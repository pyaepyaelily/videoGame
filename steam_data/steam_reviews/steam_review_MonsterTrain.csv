0,Monster Train,77179740,english,"I did it.

After 70 hours of playing, I beat Covenant 25.
It's honestly surprising, that I already spend so much time on it... It flew by like nothing.
This game is charming, polished, highly replayable, motivating and extremely addictive.

Do I want to stop playing now?
Tzk. Please.

1,Monster Train,77166369,english,"Excellent game, the best deck builder I'v played personally. Great art, fun and vibrant, with a massive amount of replay value. Totally worth it's price. However... Balance is a bit of a joke right now. Some clans are just objectively better than others. Umbra especially are kind of mediocre right now. Sometimes you'll get a boss variant that hard counters your build and all you can do is throw your hands up because your run is over before the fight even starts. The final boss in particular can just get really silly unfair variants, but a couple others have variants custom designed to ruin certain builds. So most of your runs once you get above covenant 0 will end because the starts didn't quite align for you to get a god tier build... so be prepared to restart A LOT by no fault of your own. But at the same time, lots of times you'll get a disgustingly overpowered, unstoppable set up. As I said, balance is a joke, very swingy and silly. That said, amazing game on a whole, still an absolute blast, and despite the frustrations of the balance you likely will find yourself wanting to try again and again.

6,Monster Train,77144096,english,"Monster Train is an addictive roguelite deckbuilder at it's best. It's easily my favourite in the genre.

You can chose one of five Champions. Then you get to decide a second race. Each combination plays different. In the latest update they even added variations to champions. A run can take up to an hour. 
Whats different in Monster Train compared to other games in the genre?
The battles are within a train. Each train has 4 floors whereas the fourth is your hearth. This means, if enemies reach the fourth floor they will directly attack you and you lose HP. If you reach zero, the game is over. Your hearth has an attack each turn. So there is still a chance to win, even if an enemie reaches your final floor. 
But lets start at the beginning. Each turn you can play cards. You can place monsters on each floor. Enemies start out at the first floor. If you end the turn the battle starts. If your monsters die, they are gone for that battle (but not removed from your deck). Spells and other cards are not removed from the battle (Except when the discription says so). After a turn all enemies move one floor up if they have HP left. 

That's basically the game. Each Champion has lots of different cards, artifacts and more. You can upgrade cards throughout a run and each combination of races plays differently. 

I played over 90 hours and had fun in every one of it. If you beat the game you'll unlock a higher difficulty. In total there are 25. Each difficulty adds something new (e.g. stronger monsters, different starting cards and more). 
There are daily challenges and an online mode (even through i don't really like it. It basically adds nothing new to the game IMO). 

If you liked Slay the Spire or similiar games you'll love Monster train and should immediately get it. The only thing i dislike is that there are no DLC's yet. They updated the game and added new content, but i need much more of it. It's definitely worth 20€  through.

Slay the spire will have you slowly climb 55 procedurally generated levels to destroy the big guy sitting at the top, with little back story and very little room for error, as the tiniest mistake will snowball on the many following battles and slowly but inevitably make you fail. 
With Monster train, not so much. Monster train's story grabs your attention from the get go and rushes you on a deadly descent to the heart of Hell, with one fight in each of the 8 rings against the legions of Heaven. Their armies will do everything they can to stop you from rekindling the fires of Hell, as the last burning Pyre powers your train.
(For some reason, the Angels are too stupid to just demolish the rail tracks but hey who am I to judge them :p )
Gameplay wise, Monster Train is quicker (only 8 battles!) and more forgiving than Slay the spire, since before each battle there are 2 to 3 events that will allow the player to tailor his/her deck.

73,Monster Train,76645339,english,"[h1]A better deckbuilder than Slay the Spire[/h1]

Talking about Monster Train immediately conjures the large shadow of Slay The Spire. And at first glance, it could seem like Monster Train is just riding StS's coattail. A deckbuilder game with a large variety of cards and artefacts that allow for complex interactions, that are made possible thanks to the game telling you the damage calculation ahead of time.

However, as soon as you play, you will find the feelings of both games are very different. Slay The Spire has a lot of random events, artefacts that always have a drawback, bosses that end up being exact counters to your deck, and so the overall experience is often one of misery, where you're never fully in control, and you're just trying to survive what the game throws at you. With Monster Train, this is all gone. Artefacts are all positive, bosses are announced ahead of time, and the random events are limited in scope. It's time to make the cards deck of your dream!

[h1]Enjoy building and using the deck of your dream[/h1]

Monster Train focuses on building the best deck you can. You can see the whole map from the very beginning, and you're also warned about which bosses you will have to face, so the whole game is about preparing for that final confrontation. You have all the information, success or failure isn't random, it is all dependant on how you build and use your deck.

The game offers you many ways to customize your deck as you see fits. You have various merchants allowing you to upgrades your spells and your units as you see fit, and you're also able to duplicate upgraded cards that you like so you can have even more of that goodness. In the end, you end up with the deck of your dream with often ridiculously good units and combos, which make for long combo, big damages and a very satisfying experience.

Obviously, in turn, the enemies need to be balanced to be a good challenge to your strong deck. Monster Train starts somewhat easy. It should not take you many games to get your first victory. But do not be fooled by those easy beginnings, they are mostly here to ease you into the game. After your first win, you will be able to increase the ""Covenant Ranks"", that makes the future runs harder, so you can truly test your deckbuilding skills.

[h1]Lots of content and variations[/h1]

But just having higher difficulty levels would make for a boring game, if you were constantly using the game cards. Luckily, once again, Monster Train was well designed, and offer a ton of replayability.

The game features 5 clans, and each run starts by selecting a primary and a secondary clans, which means your deck will be a mix of the cards from both clans, and you will have a special champion unit that comes from the primary clan and helps you decide on the overall direction of your deck.

Thanks to that, climbing the ranks is a really fun and diverse experience. If you like a specific combination a lot, you can just use it over and over, but if you prefer to try new things, you can constantly change your clan selections and create new decks that work completely differently.

Moreover, if you still want more things to do, the game is happy to provide, in the form of ""Hell Rush"", a multiplayer time attack mode, and the ""Daily challenge"", which feature runs with modifiers. Monster Train is therefore shock full of content, and should keep you busy for a looong time.

74,Monster Train,76638802,english,"The game is fun and I've spent a lot of hours with it. With a slight discount it's probably worth the price. But it has one glaring problem compared to slay the spire that hampers it's replayability - boss battles.

Boss battles in Monster Train are entirely passive. The idea in the game is to use the waves of non boss enemies to build an engine for the last boss battle, which in most cases is exponentially more powerful the the non-boss ones.
Once you get to the boss battle either your engine worked and you win or it didn't and you lose.
The problem is that the nature of boss battles means that you must build an engine that is passive - I.E. the engine must work without you actually playing cards. Which leaves basically only a few possible strategies to win - involving your creatures building up their power as they fight.

Besides removing tons of what might be fun strategies otherwise, having the main battle be entirely passive isn't as fun. The boss battles, rather than being what you anticipate to and have the most fun in are instead an unwanted distraction you must dredge through.",1601184797,1601184797,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,324,3,1412,0,1412,1599941724,,

You pilot a train from Hell trying to escape in a rogue-like environment, facing regular battles as well as intermittent boss battles. Deck building-vice there is more variance in that you choose between two different clans to make your starter deck. The chosen clans also determine what kind of cards you can get as drops. On your journey you can also gain artifacts that provide passive bonuses to your cards as well as remove unwanted cards from your deck to make it more focused - same feature as in the Slay the Spire.

The actual game play is focused on the attacks against your trains, which is basically a card duel, except opponent most often sends creatures on the bottom floor of your train - the train comprises of three floors and the attic where your shard (ie. life total) is). Your goal is to destroy those creatures with creatures of your own or with spells before they reach the top and damage your shard eventually destroying it. Boss battles differ from the regulars in that the bosses are relentless, unlike normal creatures they do not ascend to upper floors at the end of the round, but keep on fighting until they or all the creatures defending the current floor are destroyed.

97,Monster Train,70008683,english,"Honestly as someone who loved Slay The Spire but wanted something new, I really wanted to like this game and I did for a little while.

The problems in this game turn up as time goes on. There's nothing so massively in your face ""woah that doesn't work and is terrible"", but I found a number of disappointing/irritating things that incrementally took the fun out of Monster Train.

1. Artifact variance
2. Points of no return
3. Combat trials options
4. Certain enemy types
5. Lack of information available

The artifacts in this game are a mixed bunch. Some of them are amazing but situational (cheaper units, additional upgrades), some are weaker and consistent (your starting units are better, each unit starts with extra health/armor). Each class has some artifacts exclusive to them.

The problem is that there's way too much variance in these, up to the point where some artifacts feel like net negatives (units with the sole purpose of dying gain a ton of extra hp, at the start of each turn add a persistent spell to your deck, at the start of battle summon 4 of your units at random in a random order on the middle floor).

It's never a good feeling to make a routing decision based on gaining an artifact to be given a choice of two terrible options.

I think that these artifacts should be tagged with certain keywords (""Ember"", ""Pyre"", ""Spell"", ""On Summon"", ""On Entry"", etc) which could be shown to you when you hover over Herzal's Hoard before choosing a route, so you could see that ""Buff"" and ""Spell"" artifacts are available and work that into your choice.

Alternatively group the artefacts into ""small consistent effect"" and ""huge situational effect"" and make it so you're always given a choice from each. It's a big deal as artifacts are rare in this game (A StS run might end with 20 relics, a MT run can end with 5 if you don't route for them) and getting one that synergises with your deck can immediately drop you into ""broken deck"" territory.

Something that could be done is give each clan a ""Starter Artifact"" which can be taken or replaced at the Hoard you find before the first fight. Each clan has one or two artifacts that would be ideal for this as they don't push a particular archetype.

Annoyingly enough, we have a bit of this already. Your Champion is given a choice of 2 (out of 3 total) upgrades right at the start, which is good. More of this approach would be great.

What especially sucks is any combat trial with a ""Random Artifact"" reward. Having the option to take a harder fight in exchange for a reward is great, but committing yourself to a tougher fight (and probably losing some HP for it) is a tall ask when the reward might be something you decide to not include in your deck afterwards.

This should be reformed to ""Draft Artifact"" (maybe with the above suggestions included, ay?). Seeing Draft Unit as a reward is something you pretty much always want to go for - a shot at a useful artifact feels meh in comparison.

Some of the options for these Combat Trials definitely feel ill-thought out. 
The choices tend to ""Enemies have extra armor/damage/spikes/spell shield) and are seemingly picked at random.
Fairly quickly the first question in the early game becomes ""does the trial counter my deck entirely"" and the answer is yes surprisingly often. I feel that certain clan combinations should be exempt from certain trial types, especially early on when you haven't had chance to work around it yet (Hellhorned/Remnant vs Spikes, Stygian vs Spell Shield).

In fairness this is a theme that persists throughout the game. Each fight *seems* to be against a random selection of enemy types with a boss at the end - some of these types have certain mechanics that you just can't play around as certain clans/combinations. 

If you're Remnant/Stygian/Umbra, you're going to really struggle to defeat Conduits (enemies who sit at the back and buff their friends) because you won't have targeted spells to take them down.

If you're playing any strategy that revolves around many small units (Umbra morsels, Remnant burnout, Hellhorned imps), you're going to lose if the Warrior of Light enemy turns up (high HP, hits everyone on a floor, gains attack when he kills something).

This is compounded by the lack of information about upcoming fights. For example, the final boss has multiple forms and you're told which one you're fighting at the start of the run, explicitly to stop you from building a sick buff deck only to find the Big Bad removes your buffs - this is the only time the game will tell you what's about to happen.

It's only when you start each fight you're told what you'll be facing (this is the stage that you can opt into the combat trial). Once you're here, it's a point of no return, which means that you've just had a bunch of upgrades to pick from but with no idea what you're fighting next.

Just lost against the Warrior of Light? It'd be less frustrating if you hadn't just passed on an artefact or unit upgrade that would have saved you, but you went for something else that improves your deck against everything else.

Even the other two bosses (Daedalus on Floor 3, Fel on Floor 6) have multiple forms. You are not told which form you'll be fighting until it's too late.

In Slay the Spire, you know that Gremlin Nob exists so you know you need early damage in Act 1. 
You also know that you're fighting Slime Boss at the end of the Act, so you keep an eye out for ways to set up a powerful split or AOE to cope afterwards.

Not forgetting that if you don't find the tools to beat Gremlin Nob, you can just... not fight him and avoid elite fights (forfeiting the rewards). Hell, if you're struggling with any fight you can route for campfires, shops and events until you get back on your feet (or inevitably die against the Boss of that Act).

It actually shows there's a lot of ways Combat Trails could be further developed. Why not allow the players to pick and choose enemy types, granting extra bonuses for each one? At least that way if the game throws you a run-ending curveball, you have the option to route around it, sacrificing late-game resources to do so.

Maybe the game would benefit from a comprehensive Wiki that explains which enemies can appear on which floors, but this information just isn't available. 

Either way, the game should flat out tell you ""HEY YOU'RE FIGHTING SWEEPERS NEXT, AND YOU CAN OPT INTO GIVING THEM BONUS DAMAGE, PREPARE ACCORDINGLY"". At the moment it's ""Oh you didn't plan for this one exact enemy type? too bad, he's here, you lose"".

All of this compounds into a game with limited archetypes. Synergies within a clan's cards are fairly obvious and the game does give you an interesting number of building blocks to work with, but a lot of these combinations are either gated by gaining a certain type of artifact (Awoken Sting decks) or by certain enemy types (as above).

Exception would be Umbra - This clan has no units that don't have a Gorge mechanic or create things for you to Gorge on. It's a bit of a sad single-tracked time really.

The end result is a game where you're punished for trying to do something new. You can either play through the game doing the same proven combination over and over, but fail repeatedly as the game hard-counters an experiment without giving you a chance to prepare.

I'll probably keep an eye out for balance patches in the future and I hope this game improves. Until then though, I'll stick to Slay the Spire.

Edit - ""But andy, you have a hundred hours in this game!"" - I do, but I would recommend Slay The Spire to anyone regardless of if they had played anything similar to it before. Monster Train really makes me think about the recommendation before I give it.

18,Monster Train,76349758,english,"At first, I loved this. I'm a fan of TCG and other deck-building games, and this had almost nothing but rave reviews.

Almost. The one negative review I saw suggested that it was a pretty deceptively simple/boring luckfest, where you either became extremely overpowered or got crushed, all just based on luck. This reviewer suggested there was a lot less ingenuity involved than others seemed to think. At first, I joined the throngs of people who disagreed, and thought like many people do ""Oh, this person just doesn't know what they're talking about.""

Then, after I maxed a race out and started to get on a win streak which ended, I noticed the exact same thing. Those runs I won, 3 in a row, I got things that I was able to work into something good enough to win. Afterwards, I had far more dud runs, and I've outlined some of the issues I see below. There will always be luck involved with games like this. That's part of what makes it fun. However, the sum total of the points below makes this a game I don't see myself playing for hundreds of hours:

*Bad starting cards which gimped me the entire game
*Bad luck with units or spell draws at every point in the game -- there isn't much of a chance to win when you can only pick from units that don't work all that well together. There are not a lot of possibilities at times, and you can end up getting junk card after junk card until some minor fight overtakes you
*Bad luck with relics; some relics are game-breakingly good, and some are less than useless. *Gold awarded for skipping doesn't even come close to allowing you to gain much from relics you're not going to benefit from, whereas if something else pops up there, it practically means you win the run
*Many runs where you just don't get a workable strategy -- what do you do when getting or not getting certain cards breaks the game in a good or bad way, and there isn't much in between?

Everything is just a *bit* too random, and it ends up putting you into situations where you can't really see a way to win, over and over and over again, or on crazy win streaks that end as mysteriously as they start.
The game practically admits some of these things by allowing for easy restarts -- that is, if you're prepared to sacrifice your win streak. The problem is that the immense luck factor in this game makes win streaks themselves feel hollow, and it leaves me feeling like ""Why am I playing this again? I could just like download a slot machine simulator instead and stare at that.""

I want to be wrong about this game, and I'm going to play it more to see if I feel differently about it, but as I gained a real level of familiarity with this game, I don't think I'll be playing it for nearly as long as I thought. It needs a lot of work to make it feel more interactive and less like a slot machine where you get game-breaking combos or nothing and get crushed. If player choice and skill were tweaked in a bit more, I think I'd enjoy the game for much longer. I will update this review if my opinion changes as I play more, but since I started thinking this way *because* I played more, I kinda doubt it. I'd say if the points above don't turn you off like they turn me off, go ahead, but otherwise maybe wait and see if they balance it a bit better. This has the potential to be better than any of them, but I feel it definitely falls short in its current state.

If somebody sees this and disagrees, and has played the time/gotten things done to back it up, I'd love to hear why I'm wrong, how it can somehow be played more elegantly, but I'm just not seeing a lot of interactivity anymore. It's either get good stuff and win, or get bad stuff and lose. It feels like my only contribution is noticing combos.

34,Monster Train,76284892,english,"[h1] Summary [/h1]
[b]The game is fun and I enjoyed finishing all the classes.[/b] However, the Overwhelmingly Positive is not quite deserved, the game is overrated. At first, the game is way too easy (and that might not a bad thing for some casual players) but at the current price of 20€ I cannot recommend this game.

After finishing the game with a class, you can play on a new difficulty mode called ""Covenant Rank"" which goes from 1 to 25; so that you have an idea covenant 1 starts to be challenging (compared to the base difficulty which is non-existing) and RNG plays a big role. The more you play the more repetitive the run feels, the added difficulty is very artificial.

In short, [b]Slay the Spire is still superior in most aspects[/b].
[hr][/hr]
[h1] How this game compares to Slay the Spire [/h1]
If you don´t have Slay The Spire and you are trying to decide which one to buy: go for Sly the Spire without a doubt; If you already have it and you want a similar game it´s probably the best next alternative out there.

Monster Train is much easier than Sly The Spire generally speaking. Graphically, both have their charm. Both feel slick while playing. 

The core mechanics in both games vary just a bit and in my opinion Sly The Spire does a much better job overall, however, they share several things like the stops between fights, artifacts, etc. I would only recommend Monster Train if you own and finished Sly The Spire - at least with the basic characters - on the default difficulty.

[h1]Slay the Spire or Monster Train if I have none of them?[/h1]
Slay the Spire, without a doubt. Unless you are looking to play in ""zen"" mode, totally casual, in which case you might find Monster Train more appealing.

Ultimately, both Spire The Sly and Monster train can get a bit repetitive, is just that the mechanics of Monster Train makes it a bit more annoying.

[h1]How is the game, though?[/h1]
Graphics are good, music is decent, the game runs smooth. At first, the game is very interesting and definitively fun, but it gets repetitive very fast once you win with all the classes.

The ""covenant"" difficulty is not very well calibrated, covenant 1 is orders of magnitude more difficult than the default and you depend on the RNG a lot more.

In my case I already played Slay the Spire which I got from some bundle and I enjoyed Monster Train, which is essentially a copy of it. And so, I found Monster Train refreshing, but I cannot advise anyone to play this game first and then Slay The Spire to be honest.

You can beat the game with all classes in a few hours, your first run win can be in less than an hour, so it´s that easy. IMHO, there should be more tracks per run, at least one more should be added.

The game at the full price is arguably expensive, I got it on 20% discount which is not that much after you see its content.

[b]What about replayability?[/b]
It has pvp, daily run and challenges. Since it has many classes and combinations together with covenant modes I can say there is a ton of replayability in Monster Train. Unfortunately, it gets boring rather fast and the difficulty added by the 25 Covenant Ranks is just tedious rather than fun.

[b]Conclusion[/b]
The game is fun (even if not for too long). You should play Sly the Spire first except if you want to play on ""easy mode"" only.

You can easily get up to ~30h of gameplay having fun before you enter Covenant Ranks, then it gets a bit tedious and more repetitive but if you are looking for a challenge you should play Slay the Spire.",1600615165,1600617167,FALSE,0,0,0.454545468,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,708,19,4174,1342,2655,1601761306,,

0,Monster Train,76042638,english,"As much as I wanted to like this game, I can't properly say that I recommend it. I believe there are definitely some interesting qualities to it and it has some form of redemption hidden away somewhere inside it, but I feel like the game balance and numbers are too off. Even with the new update, almost doubling the unique content in the game wasn't what was missing or what was needed, it just needs a second look at balancing the game.

The game has some fun elements, the mixing of clans to get specific cards, the variety of builds... But unfortunately, sometimes there are certain boss modifiers that will lead to a lost run. Of course, they warn you what bosses are coming up so you can adjust your strategy to deal with them, but sometimes you get the feeling of ""this run is DOA"" because you picked Stygian v a boss that counters spells.

As for the gameplay, the runs feel a little bit too short and the numbers feel so wild and uncontrollable or unpredictable. Even after 24 hours of play, I'm still not comfortable with energy costs, since I can do 5 damage with a 3 energy cost spell and 60 damage with a three energy cost spell and even fully upgraded,  both spells can do the same amount of damage. 

I compare this game to Slay the Spire, a game whose balancing act has been so perfectly set up in a way to make a toxic grown man cry. When I look at a card in that game, I understand it and every use for it immediately, but when I look at Monster Train, every card has 6 different unique uses for every single clan depending on what deck its in and how it's upgraded, but as exciting as that might be, it's immediately overwhelming and difficult to fully grasp. I've seen a unit that I think can be potentially incredibly useful and have had great success with that someone that has more in-game time will immediately dismiss and consider garbage.

In conclusion
While I don't think this game is bad, I can't say that I recommend it. It's lack of a comparative baseline for cards and effects can be really frustrating or confusing at times, its lackluster take on balance and surprising balancing act of ""We'll create a boss to counter one specific playstyle and be a total pushover to all others"" is not the way to go about creating an enjoyable experience,",1600211496,1600211496,FALSE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,297,34,2451,578,1480,1602090244,,

It also masterfully makes for many viable play styles and approaches without restricting you to a set standard pattern and cardset in order to win.  The difficulty curve progresses at a steady rate.

I have beaten the final boss with 5 entirely different styles so far, and I find myself liking all five of the clans and all of the champions.  Each champion has three progression trees that further strengthen its style.
Each of the 5 clans is strongly themed and the synergies between the different clans plays out well in all cases - as long as you play intelligently.

There are some cards in each clan that seem to be ""junk"" - but even the junk cards in this game are useful in the right setting, or when upgraded with an appropriate rune - certain cards I felt worthless at first turn amazing with proper upgrades and use in play.  And I like this - you can find ways to make almost any card work - but you need to put some thought into how you upgrade, which new cards you pick or if you pass (and avoid deck bloat), and how you spend your coins that run.

The ability to duplicate and purge cards also helps tremendously, and is among the top choices when I pick my path through the game and build my deck.

Overall the balance, user control over their fate, and overall fun levels are great.  RNG is still there, but you can mitigate it well enough to advance - and 3/4 times when you fail it's because of choices you made and not overwhelming bad RNG.  And when you win - it's almost entirely because of choices you made and not because of good RNG.

58,Monster Train,70265636,english,"I am an avid roguelike player, having played numerous similar titles for countless hours. The UI/UX design and the amount of content are both quite impressive and overall, I am really, really impressed with the game.

With that being said, I feel like the game could benefit from more agency at times. I am sure some of those things were considered and perhaps removed after the prototyping stage but at times it can truly feel like your choices IN-GAME are limited (in comparison to something like Slay the Spire, choices made in the progression/upgrade state of the game loop are actually more substantial at times, as far as the actual gameplay is concerned though, not so much, even though the tower defense inspired systems should enforce that).

- Switching the position of friendly units: this seems like a no brainer to me, I understand that this, like most of my potential suggested mechanisms, are a double-sided coin and might strip away from the game's difficulty etc. At the very least, allow players to switch the position of ONE unit on ONE lane (not switch lane mind you), prior to the attack stage. Having such a limited choice also enforces agency and makes the decision that much more crucial.

- Add a mulligan-like mechanism to the initial cards received system: give players a choice of X set of cards (not sure about the range here, 3 feels like a good number) and allow them to choose one. Currently, you might as well restart a run if you don't like your choices, seems like a UX related issue. Just to clarify, I do not mean the actual mulligan during the combat, that would simplify the game.

- More pathing and variety in geometry: change up the order in which the bosses appear, this would also require some balancing alterations, obviously but I feel like the game could greatly benefit from it. This is more of a player perception thing since like I have already stated, I feel like the amount of agency in terms of progression is fine.

- Since the enemies are always attacking first, the game can feel very binary at times: I understand the reasoning behind this but the current combat system limits the design space significantly - rather than have one keyword I feel like this should have been tweaked more. For example. an initiative parameter could have been added to unit cards to determine the attack order of units (which would obviously also help with balancing and again, the player agency would be further enforced).

These are just some thoughts off top of my head (if they were to be considered, would obviously have to be iterated upon). Feel free to share your opinions, I would love to hear whether you agree or disagree.",1591238143,1599930709,TRUE,1,0,0.503537714,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,176,22,2144,0,2142,1600043767,,
59,Monster Train,75597766,english,"An outstandingly good and addictive Player vs Environment Card Game in the vein of Slay the Spire, Monster Train is proof that there's plenty of room at the top. Draft cards in a soft Roguelike experience where you try to put together the most pleasing wombo combos to survive your relentless enemies, cursing the runs that fall short and exalting in those that defeat the dastardly Seraph. You set up lines of units in three lanes as enemy waves try to advance to the fourth at the top. It is all easy to learn yet very compelling, a fine mix of tower defense and puzzle solving. This game is immensely satisfying for the feelings of great wit it feeds you.

Monster Train is simple to pick up and a long time to master. It is a perfect pick up and play where a full run can be executed in under an hour, yet there are so many variables and tough but fair RNG components that the ""just one more run"" is more infectious than bobbing for needles in a barrel of medical waste. There are plenty of options here for decks of many varieties, as you pick one of five clans, pick an allied clan from the other four, pick one of two champions from there, each champion has three upgrade paths and you can mix them, you get some semi-random cards available, artifact drops, card recruits, merchant luck, so on and so on. It's a great rogue-like spirit in that in most cases you are afforded a more than fair chance to clear the game, you just need to make the best use of the tools you do get and the synergies you can make. I will note as a fan of both that I found Monster Train to be more appealing than Slay the Spire just because the difficulty spikes felt more cushioned. Enemy units reaching your core aren't an instant death and unit strength recovers between every battle. Of course with the rising Covenant(New Game+/Ascensions) difficulty and so many options to experiment with as well as Daily, Crafted and suggested Achievement challenge runs there is a lot of room to make the game as hard as you'd like.

It is hard to quantify everything that makes this game so good. The highest praise I can give it is that it captures that feeling of slumming around Warcraft 3 custom games and finding a highly addictive tower defense with multiple interesting unit paths. A certain je ne sais one more round. The charming art oozing with character, the rapid loop of a campaign run that doesn't leave you sick of the task at any point and leaves you feeling at any moment that you've got a good idea for a new run, the air-tight soundtrack and the smooth 2D graphics.

[h1]The Good[/h1]

•	The significant gameplay twist that differentiates Monster Train from other deckbuilders such as Slay The Spire or Pirates Outlaws, is that some of your cards will summon minions who have their own attacks and abilities. Meanwhile your train will be invaded by waves of enemies whose goal is to destroy the pyre located at the top of the train. In a way this makes the gameplay feel a bit like a turn based tower defence game.

•	Deciding where to place minions can be very tactical. Each of the train’s three floors has a limited capacity which determines how many minions you can place there. Enemies will usually hit the front minion, so its better to put high health tanks at the front, and damage dealers at the back. Of course this is further complicated by the random draw order of your cards which means you might not always get your ideal setup.

•	Many minions have special abilities, for example, sweep is an Area of Effect attack which hits every enemy on the floor, while spikes will deal damage back to any enemy who hits that minion. Some minions will increase their health or attack every time they hit an enemy or kill an enemy. Other minions receive a buff every time you play a spell card on that floor. If you’re able to make these abilities trigger often, your minions will end up dealing staggering amounts of damage.

•	Spell cards can damage enemies, heal your minions, give them special abilities or resurrect dead minions.

•	You can see a preview of how much damage each minion and enemy will take during the combat phase, and if they’ll die, which is really useful because there’s usually a lot happening including basic attacks and special abilities of multiple units, so you don’t have to worry about doing the maths and can focus on deciding where to summon minions or target your spells.

•	You can play as five clans which have different minions and spells, resulting in significantly different tactics. At the start of each run you’ll pick a primary and secondary clan, which means there are twenty different deck combinations to choose from. My current favourites are Stygian, whose frostbite attacks can stack up like Slay The Spire’s poison for massive damage per turn, and Awoken, whose healing spells are really useful for keeping minions alive. The others are Hellbound, who focus on fire magic, Umbra, who can summon expendable morsel units which will be eaten by your main minions to increase their stats, and Melting Remnant whose minions are wax candles that will die if their burnout timer expires.

•	Between fights you can spend gold to increase minions’ health and attack, or give them special abilities such as multistrike (attacks hit multiple times) or endless, which returns their card back into your deck on death, allowing you to resurrect them. You can also buy spell improvements such as reduce mana cost, increase power, remove consume (can only play once per fight) and holdover, which places the card back on top of your draw pile after being played, effectively letting you play it every turn.

•	You can also find or buy artifacts that give you passive bonuses, encounter random events, heal pyre damage, remove minions/spells or duplicate a minion/spell.

•	Each run takes around an hour to complete, but there is replayability in trying to win with every deck combination, playing through the 25 covenant levels which add new difficulty modifiers (like Slay The Spire’s ascension mode), and daily challenges which have special rules.

[h1]The Bad[/h1]

•	The game needs more enemy variety, because you basically fight the same enemies in the same order during every run, with bosses having slightly different abilities. The developers have already started to address this, with a recent update adding two new bosses, but I think they still need to add more.

[b]This is the first game in my opinion to understand what made Slay the Spire good, without straight up copying slay the spire. [/b] 


[h1][b][u]GAMEPLAY[/u][/b][/h1]


The gameplay is familiar to STS, but unique at the same time.There are 5 clans in the game, and at the start of each run you choose one clan to be your primary, and another to be your secondary. Which one you choose for both will change how things feel a lot. On top of that, each Clan has two Champions you can choose from (basically an insanely strong unit that you upgrade throughout the run).


 In a battle you actively manage 3 floors, and have a static unmanageable fourth floor at the top which is where your health is. Somewhat like a Tower Defense game: enemy monsters will start on the bottom floor, and then whatever isn't killed at the end of the turn will move up a floor until they are killed. If a monster makes it to the top unmanageable floor where your health is (your pyre): an automated battle will occur where your pyre will get hit for X damage that the unit does, immediately followed by Y damage that your pyre does, and it will keep happening until one or the other is dead. If your pyre dies, you lose.


To kill them off before they reach your pyre, you use your own monsters/units to [i]defend [/i]floors. Your units have an amount of space they take up (capacity) to where you cant just stack them all on one floor. On top of that your units also have health to where they can die. Enemy units (outside of special modifiers) will attack whatever unit you have in front first, so it makes positioning your units on each floor important as they have different health values. 


[b]Overall I would give the gameplay a 9.5/10[/b] and would say that its originality in how it approached [i]cardbattle roguelite[/i] with the floor system as the defining reason, and the clan system being a close second.


[h1][b][u]STRATEGY[/u][/b][/h1]


You get a fair amount of say in the type of deck you're going to run, but not so much to where you can force it EVERY single run.You always need to be ready to adapt similar to how you would in any other roguelite, to what the game gives you as rewards.


Due to the floor capacity, you will usually plan out how many unit cards you're going to acquire/upgrade: as there is little use having 30 units if you can only ever place 9 of them at a time. This is one of the bigger areas where you have to adapt each run. If the game keeps giving you [b][i]incant [/i][/b]units (whenever you play a spell gain X), then chances are you should try to tailor towards that. 


You actively need to consider both offense and defense for a floor. If your frontline unit dies, your floor is now possibly in jeopardy which will then likely lead to all of your floors getting overran. Alternatively, if you only focus on defense: your pyre will likely get overran/killed since enemy monsters wont ever die before they get to it. 


I would say that the biggest con is that due to being able to sometimes force a deck: there are some cheesy/op strategies. However, even taking that into consideration you still have to know what you're doing to some degree. 


[b]Overall i would give Strategy an 8/10 as an overall game, and a 9/10 when taking into context that its a card based game.[/b] You have a lot of upfront knowledge/information displayed to you that you can use to influence your decisions, but at the end of the day you can only play the cards you're dealt.


[h1][b][u]DIFFICULTY[/u][/b][/h1]


In my opinion: this is the games best area. If you're absolutely terrible at strategy games, then maybe the difficulty will be too high.


HOWEVER, the game has an amazing difficulty progression. Your first few runs will likely fail to win. After them though you'll likely have a grasp on how the game is played and be able to claim victory! Now you can go up a difficulty level (covenant level) where an additional modifier will be applied to the run. Each time you beat a Covenant level, you will progress to the next one account wide (doesnt matter which clan you chose for the previous clear). The new modifier is now active, on top of all previous modifiers. The difficulty at Cov level 1 is a LOT different than say Cov level 10, and Cov level 25? Completely different approach required, and you better know the ins/outs of the game. If you manage to beat all 25, there are additional challenges that you can attempt. 


YOU DO NOT HAVE TO DO THE HIGHER LEVEL COV IF YOU DONT WANT TO.  If you desire to play at base difficulty 24/7: you can do so. If you want to nonstop play Cov level X nonstop: you can do so. So long as you have it unlocked, you can choose at the start of every run what level you play.


After you play X clan enough you'll likely figure out some strategies that you can attempt to force that will make things a bit easier. However, if you manage to get to Cov level 25 doing that; I challenge you to then play a different clan at level 25. You'll likely find it to be extremely difficult all over again. With 5 clans, 10 leaders, and having to select two clans each run: thats a lot of challenge so long as you're seeking it. 


[b]I can easily say that this game is a 10/10 difficulty [/b]due to the fact that the challenge is there if you want it, its not forced on you if you dont want it, and the progression of the difficulty feels smooth.

22,Monster Train,75695798,english,"In Monster Train, you’re the driver and manager of an iron horse, blazing through a literal hell in order to reclaim the underworld and banish the invaders. It’s Slay The Spire’s loud, ugly cousin. 
Loud because of the bombastic presentation. Ugly because of the array of moving bits, always surprising you with new twists and turns as you explore the randomized tracks laid out before you. 

So while Slay The Spire methodically and slowly builds up an alien mythology with a more elegant approach, Monster Train spends no time hiding behind its fire and brimstone. It wears it on its sleeve. It’s a visual spectacle, exhausting at times -- to the point that a fare almost feels like you’ve been to hell and back yourself. 

It’s messy. But boy is it a blast to play -- every single run, every single time. So much so, that it’s quickly become one of my favorite video games to date, just because of how right it nails both the deck-building aspect and the tower-defence style of gameplay.

When I say ugly I mean that in a more game-design aesthetic sense. All of Monster Train’s moving, uncoordinated parts is actually also its biggest strength, as these nuts and bolts give the gameplay a feeling of limitless variety and depth. A huge flux of available cards, sure. But also thanks to the combination of distinct races you can pick, and all the ways the game turns a strategy on its head with game breaking artifacts and modifiers that change the core rules. 

It’s an extremely rewarding trip, whether you reach the end station or not.

The gist here is that you’re building a card deck of monsters and spells to aid you as you cross the nine circles of hell into the core. 

Regardless of how far you make it, the proceedings are identical each battle: enemies spawn at the first floor of your train, and for each turn you haven’t dealt with them, they move up one level. And before you ask: yes, the invading forces get to go first every turn, making this back-and-forth a challenging balance between defence and offence.

If you play your cards right though, you stop them before they reach the heart at the top and damage it -- saving you from game over and the accompanying trip back to the first circle.

At the end of this hell-spawned-rainbow lurks a final boss, an over-powered foe that’ll prove unbeatable alongside his cohorts unless you’ve spent your travels wisely and adjusted the right variables. It’s a classic example of having to make do with the hand you’re dealt, which has always been one of my favorite design pillars in games. 

And don’t get me wrong, you really are making it up as you go here. Your starting hand may be set in stone, identical each time. But what strengths and weaknesses you gather along the way is entirely up to you and lady luck, as each circle you pass gives a couple of excruciating decisions on what part of your hand you want to adjust. 

Do I spend my hard-earned cash to modify my existing deck of cards with new powers? Do I recruit more monsters or add more spells? Do I remove cards, to avoid old ones clogging up my hand as they lose value in light of new strategies? These kinds of questions represent the meat and potatoes of Monster Train, and often where you’ll unknowingly spend a lot of your time.

If you’re a sucker for these kinds of deck-building experiences, you owe it to yourself to give Monster Train a shot. It’s a great addition to your library regardless of how overflowing it is; with enough eccentricities to make you want to come back to it. A true hall-of-famer, as far as I’m concerned.

While I could sit here and compare it to slay the spire, I think it does enough different that makes it stand out completely on its own.

At the start of each run, you choose your primary clan and a secondary clan. You will only get cards from these 2 clans. Your primary clan will give you a hero unit as well that has fantastic synergy with cards from that faction. To top it off, the most recent update adds an unlockable second hero with entirely different synergies! So there's a lot of customization and planning before the game even starts.  Each faction is completely unique as well, and offers various different ways to play.  Wanna use imps to do interesting effects then suicide them for even cooler effects? Want to create giant beefy monsters and heal them up a ton, allowing them to gain thorns and hurt units which attack them? Want to feed little units to a big unit and make him destroy everything? Wanna cast a ton of spells and in doing so buff the living hell out of all your minions? Each faction has some really fun playstyles, and the extra champion expands on this heavily. 

Your train has 3 floors for deploying units. There's a limit to each floor that can be raised, and certain units take more or less space than others. Each turn, a squad of units enters the train at the bottom. They attack your units, then your units attack.  After each turn they ascend one floor.  The fourth floor is the Pyre, which is essentially your health, and units can't be placed here. 

 You also have spells to use at your disposal.  These spells offer a large variety of options, some of which uniquely interact with this game's 'floor' mechanic.   To name a few different types:
*  giving your unit a significant buff but lowering your max mana over the next few turns. (+ damage, and a damage block) 
* entangling a unit, making it so it can't be moved up or down floors. This actually includes your own spells, allowing you to do some really cool things.
*that move a unit up a floor and heal them
*move a unit down a floor and stun them
*give you 3 random minions that are made to be fed to your other minions

Overall, the game has a lot more variety than I was expecting and it's pretty cool discovering all the different synergies.  The card text is VERY clear, and it's easy to tell what interacts with what and in which way.  

Worried about the game being too slow? The game has 4 speed options so you can play it however you want.

55,Monster Train,75635415,english,"Monster Train has the same kind of deckbuilding and progression system as Slay the Spire but with some major differences which makes playing it a fun and UNIQUE experience.

You summon monsters which allows for different types of playstyles and tons of different interactions. You got cards which buff monsters and sacrifice them. The monsters themselves also have various effects that can combo with other monsters or spells.
Speaking of different interactions, there are 5 different classes in the game, each with 2-3 distinct strategies. Not only that, but when you start a run, you pick TWO of these classes to take into the run with you. That's insane. It's like Magic: The Gathering where different classes will synergise with each other in different ways. There's SO many different decks you can build in this game.

You know how in Slay the Spire, each card can be upgraded once? Well in this game, each card can be upgraded TWICE (or three times if you get the artifact). It's not as straightforward as Slay the Spire though. The upgrade itself is much simpler. Add +10 power to a spell card. Make it cost 1 less mana.etc. Pretty simple, pretty boring right? Well, these effects can be applied to ANY card. +10 magic power on a multi-hit spell makes it pretty nice...but then I make it cost 1 less and now i'm hitting for 55 damage for 0 mana! Or how about this card which adds two dead monsters to my hand? I can make it cost 0 mana which is neat, but if I add an endless upgrade to it, now I'm adding so many monsters to my train I can barely fit them! Although these card upgrades are simple, they can interact with different cards in different ways, sometimes making cards powerful enough to change your playstyle and that means MORE deck variety!

It's fairly easy to upgrade your cards. The shops are numerous and the upgrades are relatively cheap compared to the amount of money you're getting. In Slay the Spire, the upgrades you can get are often sparse or risky to gain, but makes the game very satisfying to complete. This, combined with the shorter world map, makes each run in Monster Train feel quite short in comparison. However, the trade-off is a much more consistent and calculating experience overall. You can view the entire map from the beginning and make calculated decisions and planning to get you through.

Oh yeah, something that adds to the consistency in these runs are the champions you get. You select 1 of two powerful units to start with depending on which class you pick as your primary. These units can be upgraded during the run in a manner more similar to Slay the Spire, but with different upgrade paths. These effects are so powerful you can usually build your deck around them. Whenever you enter a battle, you START with them in your hand...and they cost NOTHING. Because of this, you can make very reliable strategies with relatively consistent first turns.

Some other things I should mention:
- The 3-floor gameplay in this game is very interesting. It plays like an auto-battler which greatly rewards careful planning.
- The music is incredible. It's probably one of the things that stood out most to me when I started. Props to the team for enlisting Jordan Chin!

60,Monster Train,75631091,english,"Alrighty, so I really wanted to experience all this game has to offer before I wrote a review on it, and at 79 hours playtime, I have hit that point. So to make things easy, I'll write some pro's/con's and then a final verdict. Skip to the bottom for the TL;DR.

Pros:
- Really interesting take on the rogue deckbuilding genre. There's a lot of new things at play here. Having to manage 3 seperate floors and battles at once can feel a bit overwhelming at first, but it's really enjoyable and easy after about 5 minutes of playing with it.
- You feel really rewarded by making a good deck and picking good synergies.
- Really great time sink for those of us that like more 'passive' gameplay (you can watch youtube and play etc).
- There is a LOT of variety here. There are 5 different clans, every run you pick a primary clan and a secondary clan and are given a deck made of both. The most recent update added some new clan 'leaders' that you can choose from and a bunch of new cards/relics, which also expands the amount of different combinations you can have of primary/secondary clan.
- There are 25 different 'modifiers' to make the run harder that you unlock as you beat each modifier (similar to ascensions in Slay the Spire). This makes for some challenging gameplay towards the later levels.

Cons:
- The runs aren't very long. On average I spend between 15-25 minutes per run (even less without higher difficulty settings). I feel like this could be doubled, or perhaps have an option to go even further once you beat the final boss? (similar to STS heart kills).
- The difficult settings is synced across all clans. For example if I beat difficulty level 25 on one clan, it is unlocked across all clans. It would have made for a LOT more gameplay if I had to go through and beat each level of difficulty on every single clan combination. 
- A lot of the clans don't work well together. Most of the time I find myself removing almost all cards from one of the clans and just using the primary clans cards, as they usually have mechanics unique to each clan, which are not assisted by other clans cards. It would be cool if they allowed you to do runs with just 1 clan, instead of having to take a secondary clan.
- It kind of feels like an early access title. I can't put my finger on it, but overall the game just doesn't feel like a finished product. They have released a bunch of new content since I purchased the game a few months ago, but it still feels incomplete. I hope they keep rolling out content, as the game is interesting, but there isn't enough for me to stick around (apart from trying to get the 50k achievment!)

Verdict: The game is a lot of fun, its a fresh new take on the rouge deckbuilder genre and it has a lot of variety in terms of gameplay. However it suffers from a lot of drawbacks that I listed above (not enough to do once you beat the highest difficulty, which is too easy). If you can get the game on sale, then I think you wont be disappointed. Personally, I'd recommend wishlisting this till either they address the above issues,  or it is on sale.",1599540404,1599540404,TRUE,1,0,0.512658238,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,215,23,5013,80,4783,1601601414,,

62,Monster Train,69607863,english,"A powerfully crafted strategic deck building experience, which unfortunately lacks the depth to make it as replayable as it boasts.


By far the most distinct aspect of the game is the lack of random chance compared to most card based games. While there is an element of randomness to the player's build each run the synergies of each deck archetype are very thoroughly present in their cards, thus requiring much less luck to establish a functioning synergy overall. Although progression is mildly gated by getting stronger unlocks over time it's completely possible to beat the first difficulty tier of the game with the default setup, unlike most roguelites. 

The main element of random chance is in getting a good draw on the first turn, as depending on the player's deck archetype they may need a second unit to defend their champion. So if they do not draw that second unit or draw a unit that isn't good at defending, the player is basically unable to protect the first floor on their beginning turn without their champion being knocked out. While this can be recovered from especially if the player just waits and puts their champion on the second floor, it severely damages the players position from the very beginning.

The game offers a refreshing amount of diversity with how players can upgrade their cards to influence their variables in completely different ways. While each individual archetype of cards doesn't have a huge amount of variety the ability to upgrade them in various ways adds a lot to the experience. Especially since players use two archetypes at once, which also adds an interesting element of synergy with pairing together the gimmicks of the different deck types.

There's a solid amount of detail to the art, animations and the music is actually somewhat noticeable. Although the fact that the game roots its world in cult mythology is bland, but at least the way the different mythological sides are portrayed is comparatively unique. It is also awkward that the game doesn't supply an explanation for how the world keeps resetting everytime the player wins or loses, and instead acts like each attempt is the last hope in this world.


Unfortunately the game really doesn't have the replayability that it boasts. While there is some variety to the cards in the deck archetypes there's not enough to stop players from generally being able to get the same deck each run nearly. The game has a lot of blatantly powerful and blatantly less powerful cards and upgrade choices, so if the player becomes aware of these it isn't long before every run essentially becomes the same meta.

The game isn't actually very interactive as all players can do is tweak the fight with abilities while all the units battle on their own. There's almost nothing players can do to change their unit standing order, the level they're on or the units they're attacking. It almost feels like a mobile clicker game in this respect due to the general lack of fundamental ways players can influence combat. 

Often the type of enemy unit the player is facing doesn't even matter; while they do have unique abilities their unique abilities usually aren't important enough for the player to change their fighting strategy. Even if it is, there's a limited amount of cards the player has which significantly affects specific enemies, so whether the player could even focus a specific enemy if they wanted to is situational. Most of those cards are just generic damage spells, there's actually very little cards in this game that inflict any form of strategic debuff or buff.

While at first the difficulty is fairly well balanced, the higher difficulties rapidly reach the point where players will basically only win if they happen to acquire the most optimal deck and upgrades. As at higher difficulties; enemies deal so much damage, have so much health and come in such large numbers that players cannot survive unless they happened to acquire a very specifically powerful deck beforehand. Even a deck that is overwhelmingly winning can easily lose the very last level because of how overbearing the so called difficulty becomes at that point. 

Between finding strong cards, finding strong upgrades, and getting good draws each turn; the entire run just comes down to random chance whether the player has gotten lucky enough to amass the super powerful deck required to out-damage race the last stage. Which unfortunately makes the later difficulties entirely dependent on luck, the result often only becoming evident in the final stage when the numbers spike; and suddenly a completely functional strategically designed deck can't function anymore.


It's still a fun game with some good mechanics to it, but the overall lack of interactivity in combat along with the lack of card variety and obvious metas makes it fail by its own claim of having infinite replayability. The lack of proper balancing in the later difficulties also causes the game to become less fair and more chance dependent the more players progress.",1590158349,1599529120,TRUE,1,0,0.521739125,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,367,277,2800,0,2199,1599892737,,

There are challenges for the highest difficulty level. 

Only at the last covenants and for some niche builds will you really NEED rng on your side.

87,Monster Train,75594372,english,"I bought the game for 20% off at £15.59 2 weeks after its release, the last day of the release sale.

The game both plays and looks very similarly to Slay the Spire. It's a deck building rougelite with ""floors"".
As for the story, hell has frozen over and you, playing as factions from hell, try to reignite the fires. Heaven has sent beings to stop you.

I ""beat"" the game 2 hours in meaning I defeated the final boss for the first time but doing so I unlocked Covenant, effectively the same as Slay the Spire's Ascension.


- (Content) Because it is so similar to Slay the Spire, it also has its pitfalls: dead runs from the start and limited variation. However, there is slightly more variation due to having 5 clans and choosing a primary and ally clan each time means there's many unique ways to theme your deck.

~ (Story) There's a small story about the wars between Heaven and Hell.
~ It is VERY similar Slay the Spire. It has copied: artefacts, upgrades, Ascension and risk vs. reward fights just to name a few. Perhaps they are a staple to this relatively new genre? There are a few unique mechanics though: the levels on the train and the 2-class system. 

+ (Audio) Music sounds like a battle between heaven and hell. Strong clangs battling heavenly strings. The sound effects are also satisfying clangs or metal or blood squelches.
+ (Content, Replayability) Covenant ranks extend the life of the game making you want to repeat it with added difficulties.
+ (Replayability) The game is quick to pick (back) up and I definitely will be coming back to it in the future to further my Covenant rank and get victories with primary/ally clan combinations that I haven't gotten.
+ Discovering new combinations of cards and then beating the game gives a good sense of accomplishment.

Best: Building up a massive multistrike backline and spikes frontline combo and destroying a boss.
Worst: It feels too much like Slay the Spire and so doesn't feel fresh. If I'd played this first, it probably would be the other way round.",1599483461,1599483461,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,355,5,2824,30,2607,1601289414,,

Monster Train is card game, a roguelite and a weird tower defense game in a single package. You travel along a the desolate wastes of Hell in your little four storied train, trying to defend the last spark of hellfire from forces of Heaven. There are eight stops along your journey where you must defend your train from the angels and their ilk. These angelic armadas assault your afformented abyssal ark from the first floor in waves, slowly progressing toward the fourth, where your spark presides. To win the game, the spark must survive through all the encounters. 

To defend the spark, you will take on the role of a strong, unique demon and marshall the forces of two daemonic clans to your cause. You have the Hellhorned who represent pure demonic strength, the Awoken who are the healers and tanks of you posse, the Stygian mages, The Umbral who constantly spawn small creatures and then procede to devour them for buffs and the weird candle-people of the Melting Remnant who possess very short and timed lives, but are enormously powerful (and have a tendency to come back from the dead). Because you are always combining two clans on every run, there is an enormous amount strategic variety in the game. And to make things better, every clan now has TWO champion demons to choose from. Oh my!

Every run you will also be able to upgrade your champion, your units and your spells not to mention all the random encounters, artifacts to gather and even adding mutators to the mix. There are currently 20 difficulty levels called covenants in the game to make it even more challenging and varied. There is A LOT to see in this package.

After each run you are presented with you stats, that you can share with the whole community, along with unlocks for the clan(s) you brought along. These unlocks include golden card backgrounds, new cards and new artifacts that fit the playstyle of the chosen clans. Grinding all the clans to max level and unlocking every golden card will take a good amount of time. After 22 hours of playing, I have all of my clans at almost the midway point, so I will have to play for at least another 20 hours to see what the max level rewards are. 

The game also boasts fun game modes and tracking. You can embark on community challenge runs and create your own, you can race you friends in a frenzied rush to the finishline, you can compete on global and friend-list based leaderboards. I've been sticking to the basic game mode, so I can't really comment on all of these, but they are there if you really need and want them.

Monster Train is a quality package that easily sits next to Slay the Spire on the pantheon of great card games. It's very robust, feels skill-based instead of driven by too much luck, is very fun to look at and has a banging soundtrack. The runs aren't too long and you can sometimes pull off very fun and degenerate combos. The clans feel varied, if not exactly even in power level (the Melting Remnant is stupid good and fun), but it doesn't really hamper the experience. The devs released a massive patch for the game that might have been paid DLC for many other games, but we got it for free - and the game isn't even that expensive to begin with.

I find almost no fault in Monster Train. Maybe some weirder strategies could be better compared to some of the more powerful ones, maybe we could have more variety in enemies and upgrades and maybe we could have a few more songs in the soundtrack. To be honest, I don't really care as the game is spectacular and probably one of the best modern pc games (for fans of card games and roguelites) that you can currently get.

This game strikes a happy medium between ""puzzle game"", ""deck building card game"" and ""rogue"". It also manages to do it all fairly well. Now you're definitely not going to find the sheer depth that is an established TCG here. There are maybe 80 unique cards per faction and 5 factions total, with a small pool of non-faction cards. (See the similarities already?). Each faction has 2 major heroes and each of those have 3 different variations that you get as you level up.

There isn't too much left to the RNG either in most of the runs I've done. Your deck being shuffled is the biggest, after that it'll usually be some trinket you've picked up that maybe procs n% of the time. All in all I've not found myself cursing it even nearly as often as I'd curse at the sky playing a TCG. 

In the end it all comes down to cleverly drafting your deck. You're going to start the run with a small card pool but you'll gain cards as rewards for events, battles and locations. It's this drafting that really becomes the meat and potatoes of the game. Learning how to manage your card pool, what to add and when to cull is the real root of all of this. If you've got experience with TCGs, this'll all be like riding a bike.

The graphics are colorful and a little cartoony; they're fun, not schlocky. Sound is adequate though for long play throughs you'll get tired of the same tracks over and over. I honestly turned the music down after the first few games and I don't miss it.

I'm going to leave my original review up unchanged below this edit, for the curious and since a lot of the issues I brought up are still problems for Monster Train.


The game's fine. The core gameplay is solid and different enough to distinguish it from other deckbuilder type games. The biggest problem is just how quickly it all becomes stale. There aren't enough events, cards, enemies, relics, et cetera. So the game ends up repeating things a lot. 
I waited a while to write this review, because I was waiting for the Wild Mutations patch to see if that would spice thing up. Sadly, no such luck. The new ""content"" adds very little to the game's overall variance and the new mutations are really just a challenge mode that you can opt into and customize, at the expense of it no longer counting for progression. 

Overall, I think this game is good fun for a 10-20 hours, though your mileage may vary. I can't bring myself to fully recommend it in it's current state though. Additionally, the most recent update leaves me feeling like they might not really have any fresh ideas left.",1594938531,1599235026,TRUE,1,0,0.523809552,1,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,422,8,1861,0,1410,1599429627,1594944352,"Appreciate the thoughts!

This game is surprisingly fun and entertaining. After 7 hours of ""I take a quick look at this game"" at 3am, I can only recommend it!


EDIT (@36 hrs in the game)
After a few more hours, digging deeper into the game I found some negatives, though.
The game suffers from 'typical trading card game issues': totally random card selection decides if one can win a run, or condemned to lose it. Some say ""it's a card game, not a puzzle"", but in fact, card games are logic games (just like puzzles...), therefore shouldn't be unwinnable scenarios - one's skills should decide. So it's frustrating a bit...
For example, I had a Hellhorned run with several ""sacrifice your imp..."" (and some other useless-for-the-initial-hand) cards offered, but zero imps...
Another time for Melting Remnant (favourite btw) I didn't get *any* ""Reforming"" cards. Zero. For the whole run, so I lost at the final boss for having a too low unit throughput (2 random per turn only -champion skill-). And I knew I'm gonna lose at the last card roll... Frustrating.

Long story short, random is far too emphasized, IMHO the game should focus more on skills / experience / strategic decisions, rather than random.
Would be great to have card selection, or at least a few tokens or something for every run, so one can reroll the offered cards to another (100% different...) set of cards to choose from, or such.

Maybe this is on me, maybe the math is there and every run is winnable - I don't know, devs didn't make a statement, but if all and every runs are winnable, would be great to save runs and being able to replay them, with making different decisions. would be happy to see someone defeating the scenario I found impossible. We live, we learn...

At first, the number of mechanics can seem a little overwhelming, but it's actually not too hard to get a grasp of them and start to really appreciate the complex interactions they create, particularly with the clear descriptions of mechanics when you hover over friendly and enemy units.
The art, effects and brief, but evocative descriptions create a vivid, absorbing setting that feels really unique. Devils riding a train powered by the last shard of the destroyed heart of hell, being assaulted by zealous, oppressive angels? That's an awesome setting.

Okay, lame intro, I know.. But this game is not lame, I promise.  So, before I oversell it because, quite frankly, I'm hooked on this game and a bit biased..  I should probably let you know that this is a very niche type of game.  The best way I could describe it is as Magic The Gathering meets Defense Grid, with a dash of Monster Mash for personality.

In this CCG-TD hybrid, you are on a quest to reach the center of Hell on a train, full of monsters..  No surprise there.  What IS surprising is just how addictive the gameplay mechanics can get.  The random elements add a new challenge each time and there's many ways to play if the standard runs don't do it for you after a while.

Without getting too deep into the mechanics, there's a lot of resource management and deck balancing involved so, if you're into card games, real-time strategy, or anything of the sort, you'll definitely find something here to scratch the itch.  You'll get the opportunity to upgrade your champion (choosing one of two paths each time) and bump up your fire (i.e. mana/land), card draw, and train car/floor capacity (+1 at a time so choose wisely).  There are different playable races and tons of unlockables.  Each race/class offers a whole new gameplay style (and ways to break things in your favor).  

For example, Umbra has a bunch of squishy monsters that, at first glance, seem rather useless.  They tend to start off weak and get really strong late in each battle and overall run.  For me, discovering how to create a 

There's a lot of built-in balancing with upgrades, too.  You have two primary types of cards, monster and spell, each with a spell cost (represented by the flames, the fire in your train's furnace, a.k.a. your output each turn).  Say, you upgrade a spell to make it three times stronger, chances are you'll increase the casting cost and/or add ""consume"" (removes the card from play rest of the battle) or ""purge"" (removes the card from play for the rest of the run) as an effect.  Monsters can get really beefy...  But, buff them up too much, and you'll find yourself having trouble fitting them on your train or having the opportunity to play them at all.

Each run has randomized elements, making every session rather unique.  At the risk of sounding cliche, one could say there is a bit of ""rogue lite"" fun to be had.  For added fun, there's a slew of mutators you could add to make things even harder (or easier, if you feel lazy or just want to feel godlike).  After you do enough runs, you'll see some similar patterns but increasing your Covenant Rank will add extra layers of challenge, plus familiar battles will bring new mods (i.e. armored enemies or heavy penalties for relying on cheese tactics).

Before I forget, let me tell you about artifacts.  Artifacts give you permanent effects and buffs that carry on for the rest of your run.  This concept isn't anything groundbreaking but, man, does it change your gameplay immensely.  Score the right artifact and a struggling run can be turned around.  One of my favorite artifacts I believe is called the Iron-Willed Horn.  That one let's you stock up your fire/mana from turn to turn, which opens up HUGE options for strategies.  Some of the other fun ones have randomly-triggered debuff and damage effects, help you change monster positioning, or do clutch things like dazing and rooting enemies.

I'm a multiplayer guy but I have to say that the singleplayer here is deeply satisfying.  There is, fortunately, a growing a community and some multiplayer goodness.  This is where the game's potential is really going to shine long-term.

First, we have daily challenges.  You get one shot to complete a challenge or score as high as you can given a set of special rules.  Some things you may see in the mix include spells hit random targets, all units are fragile (one-hit kills), you start with a mansion (more train/floor capacity), or you lose more fire/mana each turn,  Some of these challenges are brutal, and others help you discover fun new ways to play a class or combo things up.  Regardless of your game mode, you always start off with a random deck based on your class (and sometimes strictly what you have unlocked so far), so these added rules keep things even spicier.

I really dig that, even though you're not competing against other players directly, you'll see real-time updates of up to ten players who are playing the challenge at the same time as you.  You'll see ghosts/avatars of the other players as well, giving you a sense of pacing and being in a world that's alive.  Finally, at the end of your run, you get to see how your score compares to other players.  Things like reduced Pyre damage (oh, that's the thing you have to protect at the front of your train) or beating bosses in less turns will earn you big points.

The second MP mode is Hell Rush.  I love the idea here.  It's a timed rush mode against other players.  The most I have faced off against is two other players.  Usually, there's a bit of a wait.  During the day, I could get a match going in a few minutes but, during the whee hours, it's tougher.

Hell Rush is intense.  You have limited time to complete each area in your run.  This is satisfying but also very frustrating, as you have to make your upgrade purchases and other pre-battle decisions super fast.  You get around three minutes to carefully make these choices, including which, if any, cards you will remove and which units and artifacts to go with.  To me, that part is very frustrating because it automatically puts folks with faster connections and computers at an advantage.  Your load screens, animations, everything counts against the clock.

What's worse is that there is no lobby so you just wait until someone joins your session (or you get lucky and find one).  Then a short timer starts and that is the window for someone else to join..  Or not.

So, it's not a perfect game but I would still give it a 5/5 just because it's so unique, fun, and highly replayable.  Just allow me to be bitter about how unfair Hell Rush is.  I think it would be saved by having a true lobby system with session hosts.. And customizable timers.  Three minutes has you scrambling to make decisions and make your moves, and it really takes away from the fun.  I would much prefer to see a turn timer rather than an overall timer for each area.  It's just not a design decision that makes sense to me, especially when you're already hard-pressed to find a match.

Before I beat a dead horse, the worst part about the timer is that, once you run out of time, everything goes into-autobattle.  You can't play a single spell or monster...  So you lose because you aren't some cracked-out youngin' with a super-fast computer, not because you lack skills.  Feels like us old folks who like to think a little more or lack in the ""twitch"" department are SOL.  LOL

But I digress...  That's probably my one and only gripe and, fortunately, that's something future updates can fix.  I really hope that this game takes off and maybe gets the ""platform treatment"".  It is well-suited for a seasonal approach like, say, DotA Underlords (another one of my more recent faves).

Get the game, tell some friends, let's spread the word.  I'd love to see the community expand so we can see the true potential of this game unlocked.  It'd be great to see more head-to-head options to keep things fresh.  Really, in spite of my belly-aching, Hell Rush is fun..  Just make sure you play it fully-caffeinated and focused because, as it currently stands, even the slightest brain fart or distraction will cost ya!

Okay, okay..  I had to get that one last jab at Hell Rush but that's not because it sucks..  It's because it could be soooo much better and more inclusive than what it currently is.  I love a good challenge though, so I'll keep going back, even if it's kind of unfair. =oP

In short, get on the train...  THE MONSTER TRAIN, yo.

20,Monster Train,75088981,english,"This game is so close to amazing.  I enjoy every aspect of this game besides one.  For me the replay value is lacking.  I dislike that the increase in difficulty doesnt mean new enemies or additional stages. It means less resources.  This is great if you enjoy a challenge or unlocking 'achievements' but for me it doesnt motivate me to rank up.  I would love to see an increase in coins and the enemies are stronger so you have more of a challenge but at the same time you have more options and more epic battles.  Or when you rank up, there are more enemies, but shops are better.  Im a pretty casual gamer so take my review with a grain of salt.  I still highly recommend this game.  I just cant see myself playing for 100+ hours or staying up late at night to beat a hard covenant rank so I can see whats next.   I know whats next.  Everything is the same but now restock costs more. ect.

Id like to add, I know I can add mutations to get what im asking for (more intense and epic battles with increased stats on both sides) but the sense of progression still isnt there.   

I want to leave by saying I love most of this game.  The strategy required, the amazing feeling when you get the right cards and completely destroy the enemies, the art style and detailed monsters, the creative clan qualities and how each clan requires a different play style, I could go on and on.

42,Monster Train,69710211,english,"tl;dr: this is a fun deckbuilding roguelite, with lots of interesting mechanics, which will undoubtedly give fans of the genre many hours of immense satisfaction. My play time speaks for itself.

EDIT: another big plus is that the developers are very active and also listen to use feedback. There have already been 2 major updates which have added a lot of content. Some of these updates could have easily been DLC but instead they are all free. 

This is a bit of a long winded review. I'm a big fan of rogue-like / rogue-lite games. I've spent quite a bit of time on Enter the Gungeon, and a decent amount on others like FTL, Void Bastards, Into the Breach, The Binding of Isaac, Crying Suns, amongst other things. I also really enjoy the card collecting, deck building subgenre. It is quite a niche genre, but Slay the Spire was immensely fun, Cultist Simulatorand I've recently started playing East of Eden. I'm glad to see this genre becoming more popular with more unique entries for me to try out! Now let's get to the actual review!

Monster Train is a lot of fun and a bit easier than its peers I'd say. So in the world of Monster Train, Hell has frozen over, and you are a train full of demons looking to go through all 9 rings of hell, taking a piece of the Pyre to the core to reignite Hell. The unique mechanics at play here is that the battles take place on the train, which has multiple 'floors'. There are 4 floors in total, with enemies appearing on the first floor, and going up a floor every turn, slowly making their way up to the 4th floor which contains the Pyre piece. The Pyre piece is your life, pretty much. Once enemies get there, they will attack it, and you will lose health. Once Pyre health drops to 0, you lose. Pretty straightforward!

There are multiple factions/clans that you can use, each with their own champion (a hero unit) and unique decks. You also get to choose an ally faction, which means you can get cards from that deck too. So essentially you can mix and match between two clan decks, and come up with whatever weird and wacky combos/synergies you want! You start off with 2 clans, and there are 3 more you can unlock, of which I have unlocked 2. All the clans I have played so far are quite unique and interesting to play, although I think there are some balance issues here. Tanks seem to be quite overpowered (especially the Husk Hermits), at least in my experience so far. I won on my second playthrough, which was my first playthrough as the Awoken. The Awoken seem to be the easiest clan to play so far, but what can make them really overpowered are the upgrades that you can get throughout your run.

Another fun mechanic available here is that you can upgrade all your cards. Both unit and spell cards can be upgraded with a variety of buffs. For example, you can add more health to units, make them cost less, make spells do more damage, etc. These buffs can make even your weakest unit into a powerhouse, so imagine what they can do to an already high powered unit! These upgrades are super fun to play around with, and mix and match. This makes you feel very powerful, no matter which clan you choose to play. I think this may be one of my favourite aspects of the game. In other roguelite games, you can feel quite weak at the beginning, with a slow dredge to becoming powerful. However, in this game, you feel like you're getting an amazing item or buff to your cards at every turn.

I would say that the game does feel a little bit easier than, say, Slay the Spire, but there is a similar system to Ascension from Slay the Spire, so I'm looking forward to ramping the difficulty up after winning with all the clans. Overall, this is a unique and enjoyable game that will no doubt have me hooked for many more hours to come. You will probably get a good feel of whether or not you will like this game in the first run you do (which should take you less than 2 hours), so if you're interested, give it a go! If it isn't your cup of tea, you can refund it after your first run!

68,Monster Train,74843416,english,"Awesome tower defense/card/rogue-lite game. If you're into Slay the Spire, you definetely should give this one a try, because IMO it's a lot better.

There are 5 clans to choose from, each with their own strenght and weakness, each clan plays a lot different than the others and every run you mix two of them, strategy variety is the name of the game here, since you wont get the same cards to viabilize the same strategy all the time, so you build the deck on the go.

Unlike in StS, majority of cards dont lose value or become useless on harder difficulties. It doesnt mean strategies that win on easier diffs will work on higher covenant lvls.

Last but no least there's the competitive multiplayer. Hell Rush mode is simply awesome, you get pitched with multiple players in a run where you have a limited ammount of time to complete each circle, highest score or the person who makes it further wins, this mode alone should be reason enough to buy this game. But there's more, the daily challenges are fun to try aswel and community challenges you can create to compete against your friends, which I havent tried because I dont have friends playing MT.

Theres a reason the reviews on this one are Overwhelmingly Positive, this is probably the best card game out there, the possibilities are infinite and you'll beat the game with a different strategy every time, because you dont need to rely on that single card that will make your life much easier, this minimizes the RNG influence on the run outcome, because you can start with something in mind and then a couple circles later you get cards that make another strategy much more effective and go for it instead.

Monster Train is a rogue-like deck builder with a bit of a tower defence twist to it. Instead of building a deck around your attacks you collect units and spells. Units are placed in one of three lanes and attack at the end of every turn and spells are used to support them. A big part of the game revolves around finding strategies that allow you to adequately defend all three lanes until you get your wombo combo going.

With five different factions, each featuring numerous unique mechanics, and numerous game modifiers you can sink a lot of time into Monster Train. If you enjoy deck builders it is definitely worth a look.

46,Monster Train,74431402,english,"Ok, so this game is obviously most similar to Slay the Spire.  If you were on the fence on getting this and needed a better comparison between the two, let me try to explain it here.

Both games are phenomenal, which I feel should be said.  Both games are inherently difficult, with Monster Train having different Covenant levels, which if you beat the game at the highest covenant level unlocked, you unlock another one, up to level 25.  Monster Train has 5 races, each with its own flavor and uniqueness.  You pick a primary race and a secondary race. They are essentially the same thing, except your Champion card, is from the primary race.  There is only champion per race as of this review, but I believe they will be adding more.  

A large difference between the two games is the length of the game.  Monster Train is a bit shorter, as there are 9 rounds to beat, with each round having multiple enemies on each floor coming in waves of the train (Boneshaker).  Each round has a mini-boss at the end that can be pretty difficult to beat at times. Every 3rd round is a big boss that can be very difficult at times.  One cool thing I love about the game is before each round that isn't a boss round, you can choose to select to make the enemies tougher, with a greater reward at the end of the match.

Monster Train at first seems like there aren't enough cards per race, but the upgrades you can do to each card gives it a lot of variety.  Although I would love for the game to get more cards, variety, and artifacts, the amount that is in the game is plenty.

All in all, a great game, with the devs putting a lot of time in this game, moreso than Slay the Spire devs.  and this game has MULTIPLAYER (race)",1597624953,1597624953,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,81,6,3303,0,1869,1599288912,,

PROS:
+Great synergy and replayability as you mix and match your deck between two factions (Reminds me of Smash Up, which I love).
+Great production value and quality from the artwork and animations, making it feel very fluid and top notch (Reminiscence of Bayonetta as you fight the forces of Light).
+Decision making is exciting and propels you forward with choices rather than negative RNG. 
+Game is relatively clean cut and simple to understand with cleverly placed UI and icons to aid players comprehension.
+Great Soundtrack, creating a hyped up tempo.

To sum it up, this game has HEART.
<3 Ever wonder what the name of that kickass soundtrack currently playing is? The Music track pops up in this game.
<3 Do you like leaderboards when competing? You can receive live notifications on current daily runs from other players competing simultaneously so your run does not feel so barren.
<3 Small little touches like traversing the landscape from top to bottom (Very thematic as hell freezes over). 
<3 Do you like your patch notes being updated with developer commentary? Well, their YouTube page has that in spades and its obvious the developers care deeply about their game.
<3 Do you click to test every single options in the menu? Well, there is a particular Option called ""Lore Tooltips"" which i would normally click, but the game was kind enough to remind me that the Lore Tooltips is already viewable from the Logbook so I would not have to clutter my in-game with additional text, unless i desire to.

Final Thoughts: Monster Train is a very solid roguelite and deckbuilder on its own.

Slay the Spire may have better balancing and more difficult draft decisions in general.

The fact that you pick two different factions and that each possible combination end up being a totally different gameplay (some factions are around having units with high attack, another one with high HP, another one around spells and the last two more around some game mechanics) 

This makes the game a lot replayable. Finding something that you like to play and experiment since you'll gain new card and artifact each time a faction get a new level.

There is also achievement and some of them are pretty hard to get but can either be achieved using custom seed or just by playing.

With my 30H of playing i've already discovered some pretty OP builds that are able to one shot every bosses (i'll let you find these or it's pretty easy to find on google)

Daily runs are also something nice, you play with specific factions and mutations (that can either be negativ or positiv or neutral) with everybody having the same ones.

Pick your path, draft your deck, adapt to the situation, difficult but rewarding, lots of replay-ability.

Mechanically I actually prefer Monster Train to STP, it is a really fresh take on the genre that incorporates elements of tower defense as well, and the fights are a lot less of  slog. STP is often about choosing what is the least bad option, MT is more about choosing what is best, you don't get stuck with bad paths like you to often do in STP.
Although when it comes to story, immersion, and aesthetic STP still wins by a long shot for me. STP has this strange and wondrous setting that keeps you asking what is going on, it is filled with secrets and lore. MT on the other hand, you are demons on a train, fighting angels, and at least so far that seems to be about it, which don't get me wrong is a pretty fun aesthetic to, and it is also nice that it is strait forward rather than really having to hunt for the lore and secrets. 
Given this may partly be because the game is brand new, I have my fingers crossed for more content and lore in the future.

The games are quite similar, the main difference is rather than simply guarding your champions life, you are trying to keep your train from being destroyed, and rather than a single character you have your champion and some extra summons which are both disposable each fight. In combat there are four levels, enemies come in waves, start at the bottom, and work their way up, giving you several chances to defeat them before they can reach the top level where they can do damage to your actual health. 

The other smaller differences are the ability to create hybrid decks between two factions, what build you pursue will usually be a bit more front-loaded as your most important choices tend to be early on, there are a lot less fights over all and there is no avoiding them, however each fight has many rounds to it with multiple waves. This leads to an overall shorter run than STP with less choices, but the choices you do make are more impactful.",1597241945,1597267215,TRUE,4,0,0.535241365,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,39,16,12418,105,6921,1601177859,,

- The progression system seems pretty slow to unlock everything. After 9 hours still missing two out of the five playable clans.
- There is a reward for beating the game on harder difficulty making your card borders golden, I do not know if there is a way to disable using them. (I am not a fan of gold personally would be nice to toggle it off.)
- The diversity of the enemies seems small while the modifiers for what they do is large. Hopefully in future updates this will be addressed.

Other than that the game is really enjoyable. Each game feels short until you look at the time spent. You can save and quit whenever (Singleplayer.) I have yet to touch multiplayer but I am certain that will allow for much more replay value. The art is very cartoony, not my cup of tea but hey the core gameplay is what I care about. At $25 I think the price is a little steep but assuming there are future updates that grow this game I can easily see that price being worthwhile.

72,Monster Train,73858137,english,"This review will be a bit biased. This game very much reminds me of Slay the Spire, and I loved Slay the Spire! It's a very similar game, except the fact that you have a few levels here with the pyre on top, and you can go up and down based on your cards. I look forward to the challenges everyday, sometimes I wish there were more. There are player made challenges now too, which are fun to try. 

Pros:
It's a rogue-like card game with a lot of replayability
Fairly easy to get into
Easy to create builds as you go
A lot of fun, with a lot of options
Community Challenges adds more replayability

cons: 
Some of the mutations are much harder to counter than others. Some mutations don't seem to fit, for example sometimes you get hollowed as a mutation (Friendly units get Heartless which means they can't be healed) and then get very unlucky and get a bunch of healing cards. Another crazy one is Permadeath, in a game where the point is to build a deck, if your units are going to be purged completely from the deck, then the game won't last long.",1596711497,1596711497,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,129,10,34764,1835,21973,1601999575,,

The good:
+Wildly entertaining, a deckbuilder that is deep, wide, and more forgiving and transparent than predecessor Slay the Spire
+Decisions matter, but often both your options have significant upside potential, so it becomes a process of deciding what's best in short term vs. long-term for your particular run / game state
+Tons of variety - each run feels very different, despite fighting same enemies
+Progression and pacing are satisfying, take it at your own speed
+OP combos not nerfed into the ground by devs but rather encouraged / to be discovered and exploited when you can
+Opt into more risk (and more reward) when you're feeling strong on certain fights - build an unstoppable snowball of hellish destruction! 
+Music, graphics and animation are all a win for me. Some may disagree, but they're wrong. When in doubt turn on googly eyes for a good time. 

The could-be-better: 
-Eventually I'll want more variety of fights, enemies, and backgrounds
-Music is great, but if you're putting in dozens or even hundreds of hours, it will get stale

Reasons why:

[*]While it is hard to avoid RNG elements of card building, the shop system makes it possible to tweak the cards the way you see fit to make it OP. The ability to skip cards in exchange for gold, and choose between 2 different path with different shop/events/duplicate/removal options gives you so much more control. While having the consistent element which is your hero card, clan style and boss battle.
 [*]Adjust the game speed to your liking, players can almost skip all the animation and focus on the card play. The battle effects + sound hits the spot too.
 [*]Magic the gathering elements which allows you to mix and match different clans, with 25 ascension levels for high replay value.
 [*]Challenging and fun to play, isn't this the most important thing?

94,Monster Train,73777066,english,"There are some easy ways to determine if you are likely to become a devoted fiend for the phenomenal Monster Train. The easiest is to ask if you like 2018's cult classic Slay the Spire - if yes, purchase Monster Train with no reservations. If you're a fan of the indie-darling Roguelike genre and/or of staple-card game Magic the Gathering or its many derivations, you are quite likely to enjoy the unique blend of gameplay Monster Train serves up. But if none of that means anything to you, hop aboard as we attempt to ponder whether this is in fact your Train. (Summary at Bottom)

Monster Train is significant in that it's become the second tentpole entry into the fast-growing Roguelike Deck Builder genre which Slay the Spire started. A roguelike deckbuilder is a game in which a given playthrough consists of several fights of a card-game-like nature (as in your character's attacks and defences are represented as unique cards you draw, play and discard). Between fights, you're given options which add and remove cards to your deck. Every playthrough begins from scratch with a new deck and randomly determines which cards, enemies, and other rewards are available. The reward of this genre derives not just from winning a game, but from developing a deck full of cards with synergistic effects, a feeling which is satisfying creatively, strategically, and probabilistically, as you can never quite rule out the effects of lady luck's highs and lows in a given run. And all of this plays out to a rapturous soundtrack by Jordan Chin, whose music will worm its way into your list of the most hummable, energetic, iconic game soundtracks out there.

So if this is your introduction to the genre and you're reading these descriptions with excitement, or if you're a player with strategy and creation on the mind, you're likely already feeling that you're in the target audience for Monster Train. Who, then, is not?

Well the genre doesn't have the best history with polished visuals, and Monster Train continues this regrettable trend. Many have remarked that some of its monster designs, while by no means unprofessional, feel at times uninspired. Some have been put off to the point of calling it 'mobile-game-like'. As an artist myself, I find the color choices for the environment and the titular monsters very by-the-book. The most iconic object in the game, the eponymous Monster Train, looks unique, but even it isn't seen very often and some of the concept art in the game depicting it is slightly inconsistent. In short, looks were not a priority in this game's creation. 

This sadly blends into the game's story. While implied background and lore abound, quantity does not quality make, and in my opinion, the writing is serviceable at best. Even if Slay the Spire's world was occasionally rough looking around the edges, it had a unique character which Monster Train never quite attains. And this is just the aesthetic angle.

While I found the game intuitive, there are a variety of rules to learn, particularly for someone new to card games of this type. While I haven't focused on the differences between MT and Slay the Spire, they are numerous and create an experience which is arguably deeper but a little more intimidating at the outset. When you just glance at the game, and see a 3 story train, many people are literally dumbstruck and don't know what's going on. And furthermore, if you're the kind of player who favors quick reactions or execution based gameplay, you'll not find that here. 

The last reason you might consider not getting the game, and the only one which is probably not worth entertaining is that you already have Slay the Spire and enjoy it. Perhaps you wonder if Monster Train is an inferior product or is in fact too derivative. Here all the things which make it hard to recommend for the newcomer become positives; its 3 level structure introduces the idea of planning for the next turn. Its custom card upgrade system encourages you to view every card not just for what it is or is destined to become, but what you could conceivably turn it into. In an almost indescribable way, it allows for combos which seem digustingly broken to the point where you can't imagine how this can't be a bug in the game that you're taking advantage of with a huge smile. But even its difficulty curve seems better tuned than Slay the Spire, easier at first, but ramping up gradually into a true mountain of challenge to conquer. 

So while Monster Train may not be for everyone, there's a large group which will absolutely revel in its depth and its gameplay. True newcomers to the genre may wish to start with Slay the Spire first, but once you step on board that rail, you're going to arrive here eventually. And for those who are stepping on just now, you're in for a HELL of a trip.

11,Monster Train,73709197,english,"Sorry, there's gonna be a lot of StS comparisons, but it's hard to avoid it as StS pioneered the roguelike card battler genre, which this game falls into, while masterfully crossing this genre with even more unexpected genres.

If you love StS and Tower Defense, there's little reason to not instantly fall in love with this game. Only issues is that runs seem a bit short, and while there is a lot of potential variety in ""characters"", you're still only allowed to choose two small pools of cards per run amongst the many different possibilities, which results in fairly predictable and repetitive results once you've tried every ""deck"" combinations. On the flip side, it greatly reduces the potential for RNG to screw you over as you mainly get cards and items relevant to eachothers. 

Otherwise, the game is incredibly well designed up to the finest detail, adressing even issues one could have with a game like StS while providing a very unique twist. It does not just ""scratch the StS itch"", it's a great game on its own, able to differentiate itself from StS and not being a ""lesser"" version of it. It's very different despite all the very familiar mechanics and cards, and just as good. If you're still worried about the lifespan of the game, keep it mind it also has 25 difficulty modifiers, to keep things fresh and challenging, aswell as the ability to add other ""just for fun"" modifiers.

Monster Train throws in a little bit of hearthstoney flavour by using units unlike StS (you also have a ""champion"", a stronger than average, unique unit that acts as your selectable character), and while it has what would be the equivalents of skills and attacks in StS, it still spices and switches it up by using a Unit system. That being said, it doesn't lose what makes a game like StS. I don't like hearthstone. I usually don't like the unit-based card games, yet i fell in love with it. It gave me something new to master despite being able to carry over my experience from StS to this game (it took me 5 tries to win my first run, compared to StS.

The terrain, and the flow of battle is very much that of a tower defense: You have a core to protect, here called the pyre, while the game throws at you many enemies slowly, inevitably approaching toward your core each turn as you try to stop and weaken them with spells, and units that act like turrets. The bosses which have a different and interesting mechanic in how they approach your core, which further makes the game interesting. Runs are made of only a few, very long fights with many enemies, as if you played 10 tower defense levels in a row, rather than having many small battles with one or two enemies. All of this creates an immense depth to the game with many different ways to approach a battle from how you use your units, to how you build your deck. It's still so well designed that you can learn the game in about 5 minutes. Still easy to learn, and just as hard to master as other games like it. In some ways, it also reminds me of Legend of Keepers, except even more fun. Be warned the last two fights, including the final boss, are very big difficulty spikes, which can be a bit frustrating, but it'll force you to perfect the way you build your deck a bit more each time, until you win.

One of the best games to have followed in the footstep of the roguelike card game genre StS popularized, somehow adding a defense tower twist that doesn't clash with the main genre.

- Second, you can summon monsters to fight for you, this adds fun role dynamics like tanking or damage dealers. You also have a hero-like character for every race.

Increasing difficulty will add random starting cards (from both the primary and the allied clan set) which you'll have to use to mold your deck around.

The possibilities seem endless. I already have about 90 hours in and it still feels like I've just started scratching the surface.

There's a lot of mechanics to work with. Of course there's the expected card cost, damage, health, armor, mana management, healing, magic spells and so on and each clan adds other interesting mechanics. Most noticeably are the Umbra clan with their Gorge ability (eating little Morsels to increase stats) and the Melting Remnants with Burnout + Reform, having a dead timer on units and the ability to bring them back to play with enhanced stats.

Graphics are very likeable. Music tracks are amazing and so are the sound effects.

On top of all that, the UI is amazing. A logbook keeps track of almost every aspect of your game. You can create custom challenges or share your runs with friends. There a whole unlock system so you won't get overwhelmed when starting to play the game. It's just crazy.

I'm talking about games like Slay the Spire [i] (which influenced a plethora of deck building roguelike games)[/i], Deck of Ashes and Griftlands. Or even Curse of the Dead Gods which copied Slay the Spire's awesome map progression design. Monster Train did as well, which is fine. If it's not broken, don't fix it. And Slay the Spire did quite a few things worth repeating.

All that being said, Monster Train somehow manages to feel extremely unique. The art of battle in this game is just so damn addictive. I mean, I guess I could be biased. I'm a huge fan of Tower Defense games and Monster Train has that sort of feel to it with it's layered train fights. You must defend each layer as the enemy works it's way up to your Pyre. Sort of like a Tower Defense game where the enemy follows a path to it's designated finish line and you try to stop them. In Monster Train, your goal is to stop the enemy from reaching the top layer of your train. I know, I know... it's weird. 

If you're like me and passed on this game because of the name.. [b]Don't[/b]! I know it sounds petty. And, well, it is. I didn't purchase this game at first because I thought the name ""Monster Train"" was just silly and low effort. That is, until all the amazing reviews started pouring in. Coupled with the Steam Summer sale. And now here we are. The devs could have called this game Choo Choo Dukey Drop and I am convinced I would still love it. 

The cards are diverse and gorgeous. The heroes are very well crafted and each one unique. At first glance I hated the art style and animation, but the devs keep updating it and now I've really fallen in love with it all. The cards are animated and they look [b]amaaaazing[/b]. (Hello Valve/Artifact, this is what we need right here)

I don't want to give too much gameplay away. You should just dive on in and figure it out yourself. 

If you're a fan of Slay the Spire, Tower Defense games, roguelike deck builders, or if you are a fan of card games and you are looking for something that stands out from all the rest... I highly recommend Monster Train.

10-20  feel this game is way too easier compared with STS..
20-30 kind of boring.  (poor seraph..)

the good part:
a combined taste of roguelike, deck building, rpg. tower defense etc..
music is cool.


the bad part:
too easy.(relics too strong,cards over powered)
imbalance cards between their energy design, races and  upgrade overpowered.

although I only played to level 7 so far, but i won the very first round. （i have about 450hr+ sts playing though)
the game is easy because you only need to fine picking the very first 2-3 battles with good units then rest is no brainer.
if you happen to be bad luck, then it will be tough but still easy enough to win.

A pro player can potentially have a winrate higher than 90% as I estimate even with Lvl25. 
This is not a real roguelike in that sense..

anyway, I will recommend a buy because even a dozens of hours already worth the bill.

0,Monster Train,73220493,english,"Seeing all the raving reviews I decided to give this game a try.
It does a lot of things well, but in the end I didn't really enjoy my experience.
The game starts off incredibly easy, where you can defeat the final boss in your first or second try without too much effort. This means that right off the bat, you've seen almost every challenge you'll face going forward, it makes the whole game feel like a bit of a grind, where you're facing the same content over and over again with small modifications.
The faction combos are interesting, but it felt to me that most combos I tried just didn't work together all that well. The factions are highly focused on doing one or two things, so the second faction often felt like cards and units you'd skip most of the time.
The covenant system is a classic system to increase difficulty. My issue with it is that right off the bat, they increase the difficulty in very un-fun ways. Two of the first covenant effects are ""Add a Dead Weight card to your deck, and start each run with a set of random cards"". The dead weight is just an annoyance at all times, and in my opinion it does not make the game more fun. The set of random cards mostly just adds to the pile of cards that I'll need to remove before my deck starts being efficient. 
I think making the game harder by making the enemies do more interesting thing, would have been more fun than gimping my starting deck more and more. 
Overall, decent game, but it won't keep me playing like Slay the Spire did.

Trinkets/artifacts/etc are often RNG 

The FINAL BOSS is pretty meh. It just feels like another mini boss but this is on lower levels, I haven't worked my way up yet.

Chance plays a part in every run, but you still have a decent amount of agency over the outcome. When I lose, I usually can look back and see a better strategy I could have taken advantage of.

+ 5 factions that plays completely differently (select 2 for a total of 20 combinations)

+ The music! The OST, especially the credit song, are insanely good. No idea why they hide such a great song after credits.
+ Lots of multiplayer content
+ Being able to see final boss' BS skill as well as the map ahead is a huge blessing, especially for high covenant.

Some negative that come to mind:
- The graphic might be a bit to cartoony, but you will get used to it
- Need more boss variety, adding just 1 more boss type per level would be enough.

Can't stop the train, baby! Except that you very much can if you sweep and sap my ass into oblivion, 'cos I have no idea how to counter that shit consistently. Don't mind the ""picture"", I'm just being cheeky. The game is alright, but it isn't better than Slay The Spire. Does it need to be compared to it? No, but I bought Monster Train on the premise that it might be as addictive. How many hours have I got in Spire? 151! Here, I burned out in 25 hours, which is good enough for a tower defense, I suppose. I'll probably play some more, but I don't think that it could hold my interest for much longer.

Maybe I'm just spoiled or simply fed up. And I almost feel guilty for it! This is still a positive review, okay? Just not overwhelmingly positive. The game's well-made, it looks great and has some fun mechanics, seems like the best thing ever at first, but then, with time, gets fairly monotonous and predictable. I simply stopped feeling that sense of wonder when launching a new run, and it happened sooner than expected, leaving me mostly content, yet also a bit disappointed. Wait for more content updates (the devs make them for free!) and a hefty discount is what I'm saying.

I thought Slay the Spire sucked something that resembles a Metapod. All you had to do in Slay The Spire was beef your defense excessively high and apply a few kill cards. Horrible game, but only because you can exploit its flawed mechanics. 

Hell On Wheels (aka Monster Train without cowboys), is much better than Slay The Spire. I don't know why they are compared so often. There are other deck building games. The few similarities this game has with Slay the Spire are: a good UI, a deck building aspect, relics, you start with 3 actions are turn, and you know the damage output from each enemy. That's about it. After that, it's its own game.   

Do a Smash Up of 2 factions, start the game.

How do you Monster Train up in this ""B""?
Here are the phases:
-Get Cool Stuff
-Battle
-Repeat 1 and 2.

How do you battle?

Tower Defense. Deck Building. Darkest Dungeon/MTG Autobattle. Oh yes, its all those things. 

- You have a 4 story house. I call it Run's House. The attic is your HP. If the HP is 0, you dead yo.
- You summon some dudes in the first 3 stories. No one is allowed in the attic. 
- Bad Guys enter through the Basement floor. You say, get outta my house! Smack'em with a demon.
- The bad guys fight your guys in an autobattle for 1 round on a floor. Whichever bad guy lives elevates to the next floor up. Until they reach your attic.
- The game displays the outcome of each fight before it begins.

Game Length:
Once you beat the game, it gets harder. This happens 25 times. It is enough game to go around.

Summary:
I give it a 9 out of 10. There isn't really anything I think need to be added that isn't already there. 

My suggestions are have more clans, more enemy types, more variation on their starting enchantments, but they have enough.

Important note, make an option to have it so the ""enhance the enemies for an additional reward"" thing always begins ticked.

97,Monster Train,71693221,english,"Game needs to be rebuilt a bit, the balancing is far off, some clans are very strong, others are pretty weak. Some clans have good combo's with other clans, but then some clans don't. It's pretty fun,  but you'll have runs where you just have no hope of actually beating it due to rng. There are also far too many cards, that are completely useless, so you'll find yourself passing on most of them, which  makes it hard to gold border every card. I wish they  went for more of a balanced play of everything, than oh here are some overpowered combos... so don't bother getting any of these other useless cards. 

I think there was too much focus adding  as many mechanics as they could, rather than fine tuning a couple-few. Just for an example, adding spikes too  non-boss  enemies in order to get a trinket... cool! Losing much of your life because your units are still weak in the 2nd round and end up killing themselves, only to get a trinket that doesn't even work well with you clans... garbage. Just too much RNG, you should get options, like 4. Same goes for when you pick what monsters to add from landing on a spot on the map, there should be 4 monsters to pick from, not 3. This would help a bit more on the RNG factor. I hate having a good start of a run, then it being completely ruined because 1/2 through I don't get anything to actually help my build.

Anyways, 5/10 pretty average for this type of game, just with even more RNG, would have been much higher if even little changes were implemented. And because of that massive RNG, I can't really recommend it to people.

99,Monster Train,73000879,english,"If you like card games you'll probably get some fun out of this. I don't typically like card games but this still caught my eye and the way it was described to me I figured I'd give it a shot. I got roughly an hour and a half into the game when I quickly realized that this game may not be for me. So before I went over the two hour mark I decided to pass.

My main issue with the game wasn't the fact that it was a card game/tower defense mixed together. I actually liked that idea a lot. My issue was the power spikes. I played three runs. The first run I got absolutely destroyed, it lasted all of maybe ten minutes. My second run I got really far in comparison. What happened was I got a really good card, duplicated it with some good modifications, and between it and my hero card I had a single slot left per floor for a powerful imp card I found. This power spike literally carried me through the entire run. I made small modifications to a few others but they were on cleanup duty taking out whatever was left of the mangled enemy that crawled it's way up the stairs on the next turn. Point is, it wasn't even a contest. But on the third run (after you ""beat"" a run it goes into another run but NG+) the enemy got it's power spike and rendered everything moot. I didn't make it two more than two stops on my train ride. And therein lies my issue. 

This game is wildly inconsistent and all over the place. This isn't a bad thing, I can easily see people liking this. It's how rogue-like games thrive, in chaos. But it's not for me and I imagine not for others as well the lack of predictability leaves me feeling like I have no control over the outcome. You can perfectly play a level and still get roasted.

4,Monster Train,72995259,english,"In my opinion, this game is the best take on the roguelike deckbuilding genre to-date. Before the most recent Mutations update, Monster Train already presented a game with superior balancing of a wide variety of playstyles that allowed me to take on the gauntlet of enemies with any strategy and card combination that I could imagine. Now with the new update, the game has even more replayability than before.

There are five factions with twenty different faction combinations that you can play on your runs, each with a unique cardset that will never look the same run to run. Hellhorned faction features ragebuilding armored units contrasted with dimunitive imps. Awoken features healing and big-bodied tank units that don't go away easy. Stygian has an aim to freeze out the opponent or tear them apart with damage spells while triggering minion abilities. Umbra is built around morsels, tiny units born to be eaten by your own minions to reach maximum power. Melting Remnant units deal incredible damage as you attempt to play cards that prevent them from melting away... and if that fails, just bring them back to life even stronger than before.

All factions share similar winrates while being completely different in playstyles, and the escalation of difficulty as you move through each level or ""Covenant"" feels fair yet challenging.

Once you beat the game the first time, it entirely shifts it's philosophy of allowing you to pick your cards your self.

You instead get 3 random cards forced into your deck that in most cases have zero synergy, maybe one of those cards isn't awful, or doesn't cost 3.  You also need to make sure the cards and upgrades that you are offered are not hard counted by the random abilities of the boss you randomly get assigned.

So after many re-rolls you get something playable and start off and the second phase of ""starting"" begins.  In this second starting phase you need to win the first fight on the challenge difficulty to get another chance at a draft.

You can't skip this fight on the challenge difficulty and have enough resources to beat the last boss.

If you don't accept the challenge you will not beat the last boss due to not having enough use able cards.  If you get hard counted by this challenge, which happens often, you lose.  You will either take too much damage and lose due to lost resources, or you will just lose all of your non respawnable monsters and die.

So, In short in order to actually complete another run past your first all of these RNG things need to line up.

1) You got 2/3 cards that can synergize in your first assignment
2) You got a selection of initial upgrades that aren't hard countered by the random boss
3) You did not get randomly hard countered by the first challenge
4) You beat this challenge while taking no damage, typically on the first floor.

Now the actual game begins and now you have to get VERY LUCKY to get offered enough cards, in the initial synergy you selected.

If not, again you lose.

26,Monster Train,72934407,english,"This game gets compared to Slay the Spire and I'm not sure if I like that comparison, yeah they both use cards and it's a semi-roguelike where you do a lot of runs but in my opinion that's where the similarities end.

Slay the Spire is about trying to make sure you don't bleed out, it's about ""you took 5 damage in that battle, 5 damage in the next and that is how you're going to die"". Monster train is more you are barreling along on a train, you cannot avoid combat, so you have to get stronger and trample the enemy whatever way you can so they don't just trample you. I think that's a big distinction between the two, you can actually lose the first fight in the game and continue on but you're vulnerable, and you can recover from that. If you take too much damage early on in slay the spire you might as well just stop because you're never going to survive an encounter with a gremlin nob.

That's why I like this game better, on Covenant 4 I managed to pull a win out of a failing run with the melting remnant with less than one attack from the final boss left on the Pyre. Most of my Slay the Spire runs feel like I should abandon them if a battle goes badly because it's a sharp downturn in my slow death that I won't even see for another 30 minutes of play.

I really like this game and I like it even more after this last balance patch, things went from ""I don't like playing the Umbra or Melting Remnant"" to ""I've won a couple close games as the remnant, and the Umbra don't feel like they are being punished for using their mechanics anymore"" with very minor changes too. This game could have been custom made for me frankly and I love almost every aspect of it.

Now for the things you should know as a perspective buyer:

There isn't as much variation in this game as Slay the Spire, you know what you're going up against and the differences will be in how you build your deck, upgrade your deck and which factions you pick, and which relics you pick up.

It's a roguelike, you're expected to get your money's worth of playtime out of it through trying again and again to try and win, you likely will not win on your first try.

It's a roguelike, you will have runs that just end earlier than you expect because of bad luck.

It's a deck builder, because of the way it's designed you need to wrap your head around the idea that removing cards from your deck can be a good thing, and something you might even pay for.

You need to pay attention to the final boss that you get for each run, because it will show you at the very start, and if you ignore this people on the forums will never shut up about it. The game doesn't really highlight it beyond the start and the people on the forums act like you should just remember it or know to hover over an icon on the to bar to look at it rather than actually helping you out.",1595141277,1595141277,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,1246,72,3174,15,1583,1601401662,,

72,Monster Train,72854291,english,"Don't get me wrong by the thumbs down; it's a fine game.  It's just nowhere near as good as the hype and is massively overpriced, compared to others in the genre.  

The game draws HEAVILY from StS, cribbing most of the major fundamentals of the game, but doesn't improve them (and some could say, dumbs them down to make hard choices less hard).  RNG is much more important in this game than StS (final boss spawns with the ability to get rid of your spells, but your a spell-centric? tough luck; start over).  You'll see all there is to the game within the first few hours of playing.  Deckbuilding is way simpler and less interesting than StS, as unit cards don't recirculate, your deck becomes more deterministic as the battle goes on until you're left with the same few spells, with the potential to get the same hand every round.  Battles are always the same major bosses, in the same order, 9 battles to a run.  Balance is stilted with massive swings in card value, but they're at least making progress on that.  Strategy is limited: dumping major monsters on the first floor is almost always the best choice.

One thing I like about Monster Train is that it feels like the random elements inherent to the deck builder genre are slightly more controlled.  I have literally never quit a run because I felt like my deck was going to be so useless that I didn't stand a chance later on.  It's a great feeling to always believe you can strategize a suboptimal start to victory.  I'm sure this won't always be the case as the difficulty ramps up (I've only cleared 6 of 25 difficulties).  

I thought the 25 difficulty levels were excessive at first, but the smoother difficulty curve is also another nice feature of Monster Train. I've spent more time experimenting with card combos than going straight to overpowered decks in order to keep pushing forward.

7,Monster Train,72821673,english,"If you love Slay the Spire and want something more complex, Monster Train is for you. There are four floors in the titular train, the Pyre room and the three rooms below it. Your goal is to prevent the Winged enemies from climbing from the bottom all the way to the Pyre, or at least ensure minimum damage. There are five clans whose cards support a different playstyle, such as the Hellhorned with their heavy-hitting units and spells that increase attack. At the start you choose a primary clan, which also gives you a powerful Champion unit that you can place down immediately at the start of the fight, and a secondary clan for support. After each battle you can strengthen your deck by adding more cards, customizing your existing cards with unique upgrades, buying artifacts that add special effects, and more. Every time you beat Seraph and win the game, you unlock more stuff and your Covenant Rank goes up, making each run more challenging than the last. 

My only concern with the game is that the three bosses you encounter are always the same; their ability changes just enough to affect your strategy, but it feels like a regular battle with a debuff or enemy buff applied each turn. On the plus side, unlike Slay the Spire you always know what deck the final boss counters, so you won't automatically lose just because you didn't get lucky with the card rewards.

Overall, Monster Train is a well-polished card game dedicated to those who like a good challenge.

Watching a video before playing this game will confuse you, but don't get intimidated because once you get into it a lot of the mechanics will be easy to understand and the combat flows wonderfully.  

I would give it a 10/10 if you are into Rouge-like card games.  The amount of different strategies that can play out, and how different each clan feels will keep you engaged for hours.  Although there are some minor balancing issues, the developers are doing a fantastic job staying in touch with the community for upcoming patches.

My only complaint is that there is one achievement that is incredibly lazy, and poorly thought out - the ""50,000"" points in a daily challenge.  Which essentially requires you to do everything perfectly on a daily challenge that has randomized modifiers.  It just kills the enjoyment of a run being required to have a perfect run because it forsakes many of flexible options this amazing game offers that makes normal runs incredibly engaging.  Although if you are not an achievement hunter by any means then this is a completely invalid complaint regarding the game.

The only other thing that I wish I could see would be mod support.  Although this game has a lot of meat to it that even if modding never becomes an option that it would be worth the $25 price tag.

95,Monster Train,72674353,english,"I wanted to wait a while to write this review, since I really wasn't sure of my opinion of this game at the start.

Let's start with the obvious.  This is a deck-building game similar to Slay the Spire and Griftlands.  Presentation wise, it holds up very well.  The card designs and animated ""board"" you play on remind me of Hearthstone.  Visually, everything works well together, and the time and polish put into its design is very evident.  The only minor complaint I have on this front is the sound design.  Especially with the battle speed turned up, the grunts and groans of the units get a bit tedious.  The music, however, is great.  I simply reduce the sound effects in the options and problem solved.

Now the less obvious, and the reason I held off making the review.  My first game of this nature was Slay the Spire.  Needless to say, I started on quite the high note.  Having put in a fair bit of time with that game, my first few games of Monster Train felt a little slow and ""samey"".  I'm really not sure that this is the fault of the game, however.  Having played it a bit more now, I feel like my expectations were off.  I came in expecting all the options I had in Slay the Spire with everything unlocked and available.  Now that I have all the tribes, and most of the cards, unlocked, decks and strategies feel much more unique.  I do feel like the enemies and bosses could use a bit more variety.  Still, that doesn't keep this game from being enjoyable, and this will likely improve over time since the developers seem committed to the game.  There is already new free DLC for the game.  There are also a few modes that I haven't tried yet, like custom and multiplayer.

At the end of the day (or 23 hours at the time of this review), I definitely recommend the game.  Even after those first few games left me feeling a little underwhelmed, I quickly fell into the ""just one more turn"" loop and couldn't put it down.

1,Monster Train,72662245,english,"I have 200 hours on Slay the Spire (StS) and 70 hours on this game. I have a little bit of a history with card games, playing Netrunner for many years (never did get into Magic, though) and I consider board gaming to be one of my primary hobbies. Context for my review (I make quite a few comparisons to StS in here).

Monster Train is a rogue-like, creature combat, deck drafting game, essentially. ""Heroes"" are your units that battle the enemy units. You play them to occupy floors. You can think of the floors as almost a ""lane"" system, with enemies advancing from the bottom floor, to the middle, to the top floor each after a single combat round. Hopefully you kill them before they reach the top. Eventually, a boss will show up. The boss stops at each floor, from the bottom up, and rounds of combat are continuous until the floor is cleared or the boss is dead. Any units that overflow your top floor attack your ""pyre"" (like your health pool). The pyre has an attack value and will fight back a bit in continuous rounds of combat until its health runs out or the attackers die. When you run out of pyre health it's game over.

This is a great drafting game. The structure of the drafting is interesting. The majority of your drafting is for support spells and minor monsters. You are only able to draft a limited number of heroes during special draft events, and those drafts are front-loaded in your run. You fairly quickly have to figure out what your limited hero-pool will be and how to best synergize your team. From there you have to make sure that the support cards you draft match your hero makeup. This helps keep things a bit fresher, as most cards are situationally good and there aren't always the same ""best value"" cards in every run. I like this in contrast to StS, where it often feels like I'm trying for the same builds or using the same cards every time. You can further upgrade your cards to really customize how your deck is working. Many of my runs came together as I put powerful upgrades on particularly synergistic spells or heroes. And boy, when you find a power combo, it REALLY goes off in this game and that feels quite satisfying.

Card draw tends to be somewhat limited, so it's important to be choosy about what you draft-- you don't need a card from every draft pack! Thin decks are better decks, and card removal is also relatively plentiful in Monster Train. This is in contrast to StS, where sometimes it make more sense to dilute the ""bad"" cards in your deck by drafting large and playing best-value. I like that this game has you focus on making a ""tighter"" deck. The decision points at each draft opportunity feel a bit more impactful for it.

I had waned on Slay the Spire due to the same-ness that a lot of my runs felt. How similar my drafting strategy was as certain builds just seemed blatantly better than others. I came back to StS after The Watcher was released since she felt fresh and like there were more options. I continued to play her exclusively for many hours. That's the kind of feel that I get with this game. There are five factions (colors, if you will) in Monster Train and you combine any two of them for each run. The sheer number of combinations keeps the game feeling fresh. Sure, I have my ""favorite"" cards for each faction, but they are still a bit more flexible than, say, StS. Different faction combinations give different value choices for heroes and spells, and that leads to continually interesting value choices as the hours go by.

If you are a fan of deck drafting games, I cannot recommend this one enough. I'm usually not one for creature combat, but the variety of mechanics among each faction, the satisfying and powerful combos you can develop, and the progression system (much more forgiving than StS) keep me coming back time after time. 10/10 would play again.",1594714118,1594714118,TRUE,65,1,0.859474063,3,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,370,1,5422,0,4251,1599789857,,

If you have any interest in discovering ridiculously powerful combinations in card games, you will enjoy this!

Further, they are very active in continuing to expand the game, adding new modes, new free cosmetics to unlock, and balancing the cards to help encourage use of the least picked cards.

Further, if you love digging into the lore of the game, there is a lot to discover.  Every single unit, both friendly and enemy, as well as each spell card and artifact has lore text written by an in-setting character.  Lore for friendly units, spells and artifacts are currently viewable at any time through the in game logbook (which you can access midrun), while enemy lore can only be seen if you turn on lore tooltips and have one on screen.  Hopefully they will add an enemies section to the logbook so that you can review their lore at any time as well.

Next stop: Heaven.[/h1]

Nowadays, a game which releases publicly, aka hits 1.0, is an unholy trainwreck that needed more months (even years) of development.
Polish? Non-existent, expect tons of bugs.
Content? Yeah, not done yet, here is a roadmap for you to read.

Monster Train, a game made by some nobodies, somehow, hits the glory of old games. When they came in disks, because the game was **Complete**, fully done, no updates needed.
Who the fuck even buys games at launch nowadays? Just wait a year, to not only get that -50%+ discount, but also to get that ""definitive"" edition (because of course, the definitive/final experience isn't on launch)

So, you have a game, that somehow, reaches 1.0, no bugs, full of polish and [b]S O U L[/b], shit tons of content that can keep you playing for months like the games of old, and a lot of misc content no one asked for, like, full discord integration (with a button uploading your run on the official discord server for example), or mutators, or daily challenges... And they even overdid it, the madlads added even multiplayer!
Where you are literally rushing the fuck out of the game, against other players to reach the end of hell! (think of time-attack/speedrun, but actually polished so there is some kind of interaction, there are 8 players per hell rush and your goal is to simply surpass others, not win the game ;)

Most games I play, are either free (old games, emulatable or yarr), or bought at deep discount (60%+)
It has been literally [b]years[/b] since I last bought a game without any discount. And weirdly, I don't have any regret for this, since the game is well worth its price for sure.

As for the game itself, it is familiar, yet original. People saying it is a clone of Slay the Spire are doing it injustice. It is a mix of many many things, one of them being the niche Tower Defense genre. Ultimately, it fuses so much shit together, and it just works.
Soundtrack is surprisingly good, given its made for a freaking card game ngl.
Replayability is off the pyre room's roof! So much content! And that isn't enough, since the developers want to keep improving, even though the game is literally overfilled and finished wtf

This game is potentially better than slay the spire for a few reasons

- More player creativity
- Better artwork
- 5 Heroes that can be combined for many run types
- More impactful choices
- Game feels more of a 'fair' roguelite
- Push your luck with more player choice rather than slay the spires you randomly die despite perfect decisions.

Overall this game is decent in current form and you get your hours for the price, that said its lacking in a few ways that I hope they work on within the year if not I would not recommend this game without a deep sale.

- 2 of the Heroes feel too similar in their buff focus which makes them feel pointless and undistinc
- UI needs work add logbook to the main menu obviously
- Make the monster train icon customizeable because its me on it !
- Add more heroes because theres certain kinds of hero missing you would expect to be there
- Enemies need to be more intresting and have more intresting deaths
- Bosses need more personality
- Reduce the starting pack duplicates so much of this game feels like card removal

I hope for the best because this game is certainly interesting

-  Creative, engaging, much replayability the way you can mix and match your primary and secondary clan.
-  Deck building game, as you go along you choose routes that force you to pick through different upgrades/events.  Some have merchants, where you can exchange $ you earned winning fights on upgrades to your troops or your spells, or buying artifacts and other random events.

-  As you move along, you hew down and temper your deck, making it lean and mean.  You have to find a gimmick, or an engine, an exploit or hack to create a real kickass deck and get far.  

The meh: Graphics are fine.  Not the biggest fan, feels a little...mundane.  But still, super well polished game with solid gameplay loop.  

Also shoutout to the Lore guy, that's cool the way he wrote so much of the history of the clans, and their interactions with the antagonist of the game, the angels.

The content feels a bit sparse - you will see the same chain of minibosses and the same enemies with little to no variation every run, and the random events seem to repeat incredibly often, but this isn't a huge deal.

The big problem is the balance. The replayability is based on different faction combinations and deck archetypes, but the factions vary wildly in power - two of them can carry any 'minor' faction by just ignoring it altogether, and at least one of the factions is actively terrible - not just 'you wouldn't play it if it were a competitive game' terrible, but the mechanic it revolves around is so underpowered and hardcountered by so many enemy mechanics that it is actively unpleasant.

Monster Train.
Awesome game for tacticians, don't be confused by 'card builder' description, I'd say it is turn-based game, cards act more like 'RNG' than like actual cards.
First run and impression - ""hmmm.. seems very easy and stupid.."", then after you are beaten by AI angels - ""whaat? lemme try again..""
Second run: ""not that easy, just need more experience to win...""
...
After first win: ""woooaa! there are five (5!) total clans"" (clans can be combined, 'main' clan defines your 'hero'), ""and so many clans combinations""
After numerous losses and second win: ""wooooa it was the first 'easiest' difficulty? challenge accepted!""

It's like Slay the Spire had a baby with three or four slightly different versions of itself, and somehow it still works and is shockingly well balanced.

Hellhorned: Brute strength offense
Awoken: Healing, regeneration
Stygian Guard: Magic, control
Umbra: whaaaaaaaat
Melting Remnant: whoaaaaaaa

I love how the first three clans are very much like M:tG red, green, and blue, leading you to think the last two are going to be black/white analogues. But then you unlock them and they're just...something else entirely. So cool.

I can't say enough good things about this game. But I'll try to say a few.

[list][*]All the information you need is available at all times. You can see your entire deck, what's in your draw, discard, and consume piles, and even what the outcome of the turn will be if you end it now. Very well presented.
[*]You have a nice logbook that tracks all your different runs, scores, unlocks, and compares to your friends. You can check it without interrupting your current run. Neat!
[*]There are many ways to build something that seems hilariously overpowered, but most of them have some kind of achilles heel that you'll have to prepare for. 
[*]There is a perfectly medium number of special abilities that creatures can possess. Enough to create a huge variety of interactions, but not so many that it's hard to remember what they do. Same with spells. 
[*]In about 30 hours of play it hasn't crashed, glitched, or slowed down once. It's rock solid.

Highest recommendation. Don't wait for a sale. Just get it.

I would still recommend this game to those who wish to sate their thirst for a decent deck building, rogue run game, but currently this game still lacks polish, even when in comparison to Griftlands, a game still in early access.  Therefore I won't recommend it to anyone new to this sub-genre, I would rather point them to Slay the Spire instead.

For one, other games in this sub-genre like Slay the Spire and Griftlands, all recognize that it is frustrating that a half an hour to one hour run can be easily ruined by a bad draw in the first one or two turns, so they mitigate it with setting certain cards to be drawn on the first turn; this is a feature that Monster Train sorely lacks and has resulted in many of my runs ruined.

Certainly RNG is an essential element of this sub-genre, yet when other games do it better, it is hard to see Monster Train as anything but lacking.  I have some other minor gripes but they don't come as close as to the one I just mentioned.  I know it is unfair to compare this to Slay the Spire, an older game that had more time to fix itself, but when an early access game can do it better, then I see no reason why Monster Train can't improve on the same thing, especially when there are other examples to borrow from.

6,Monster Train,70963255,english,"I love Slay the Spire and other deck builders with roguelike elements and when I saw Monster Train I was initially turned off because the style looked totally different... checked out a few Steam reviews and decided to give it a go last week... already 28 hours on record & I can confidently say this game looks like it has another 50-100+ hours of replay enjoyment easily.

Overall, Monster Train is very innovative and different from any other game I've played and its differences are extremely strong and fun in their own right.

Cons:
- EDIT: after reaching higher difficulties both my initial ""cons"" were proven inappropriate. I initially thought over-powered card combinations were too easily accessible, and that final boss fights were rarely ""epic"" (either landslide victory or defeat)... won for the first time on max difficulty after 5+ losses in a row (OP cards aren't too accessible), and after the final boss killed all my floors my Pyre squeaked out a victory with 9 health remaining and some frostbite assistance from the graves of my allies (final boss fights can be extremely epic).

Pros:
- TONS of room for creativity combining the 5 different clans.  When you pick a primary clan, you also pick an allied clan and the possible synergies in combination are incredibly high and very satisfying to explore.
- What the game might lack in epic final boss fights, it more than makes up for with the satisfaction of refining your defenses like a well oiled machine.
- Most of all: Monster Train hits a grand slam with the tower defense genre:  If you're like me you've probably tried 5-10 tower defense games in the past and enjoyed them for a bit, but ended up feeling like they're mostly shallow and tedious once you learn how to exploit the game.  Monster Train is essentially a tower defense game executed near flawlessly in terms of the nuanced, challenging, & meaningful decisions you make at every step of the game (both within battles and between battles). You always need to adapt to the options available to you, and like most good rogue-lites it feels like a victory is possible (or would have been possible) if you play your cards right.

Overall, the game is way more fun than reading this review. If you made it this far, it's a 100% buy IMO.",1592451148,1593972043,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,68,4,7238,0,1692,1600129904,,

I FINALLY beat the final boss in STS and now am basically just grinding all my champs to 100%. I was beginning to get a bid bored of that and a friend had recommended me this game so I picked it up.

It is similar to STS in a LOT of ways but it is NOT the same game. With this game you have a train in which there are 3 floors and 1 room with essentially your nexus / heart. If the enemies climb from the bottom floor to the hear they will attack it and it can fight back but once it dies its game over. So you basically have to play 3 different floors of strategy at the same time and have to worry about your heart. 

It can be a little bit chaotic but once you get the hang of it, it is extremely fun!!! I have about 10 hours logged into it now and there are probably 30 something different combinations in which you can pick your ""Heros"" and each one has its own deck, similar to STS with Ironclad, Silent, Defect and Watcher. So you get to fine incredibly good combos with the deck building and sometimes it will be a good deck up till the last boss fight, sometimes you die on the second boss.

84,Monster Train,71776506,english,"I originally heard about this game from one of the people at GameInformer the day after I added it to my steam wishlist. The game plays similar to other card playing games like slay the spire for example, and it brings together a fresh take on the genre by adding three levels to an already interesting unit-summon/spellcaster style game. The game stay fresh and is easier to play for long periods because they added a two alliance system when you start your run. You can pick any combination of two factions of the five available and each has their own respective champion with 3 available specs that can be cross bred mid run to make a hybrid of your champion. The games visuals also make the game really fun to watch compared to other games with a grasp of depth to your train. The game progresses by winning your encounter and picking which path you want to follow with your monster train. whichever track you follow is lined with upgrades exclusive to that path until the next battle. With your path of travel locked in to your selection, you then get to access upgrades respectively to whats on your path. One path may allow you to remove two spells from you deck you don't want or it may contain the ability to attune your spell cards with upgrades. What keeps me coming back is the large variety of options and ways to play and the increasing difficulty with what the game calls covenant ranks. Beyond the first time you make it to hell's core to relight the fire put out by the winged, you have 25 covenant ranks to beat until you can call yourself a master. The game tracks win streaks and shows you what difficulty you've beat with all of the pairs of factions. I think I've been playing for 4 days now and I keep appreciating the small features this game has from the tracking of stats to the ability to create challenges for other players. I could not recommend this game more if you like card battlers like slay the spire. You can even have cards that make your trains pyre (your health crystal that powers you train) to obliterate enemy units.

My Overall Rating: 9 out of 10

Pros+
+Great Selection of Cards
+Artwork is on point/aesthetic
+Music is a perfect fit for this game
+Unique Plot
+Plenty of replay value
+Challenging but fair

The list could go on! This a great deck building game with an interesting take on this genre in my opinion. 

Cons-
- Artwork may seem mobile like to some people.
- RNG aspects can be frustrating at times and sometimes it seems as if you are destined to lose no matter the strategy on certain runs. (However this is in my opinion a way to make you think and strategize more)
- Sometimes the cards descriptions may not be real clear on how powerful or weak they truly are. This is part of the challenge I think but I do notice some of the information on some cards seems to be off point but this a very rare occurrence so far in my game-play. 

There are probably some other negatives somewhere that I am not noticing so far but overall this is a really solid game. If you like these style games (like Slay the Spire, deck building games, Yugioh, etc.) then you will likely enjoy this with little to no problems.

95,Monster Train,71913861,english,"Early on, as I was learning how Monster Train worked, I managed to get to the final boss. He comes in three variations and you're told which one you'll face when you begin a run, but I didn't pay too much attention because, hey, I'm learning and was prepared to lose. Upon reaching him and checking what I was up against, I learned his version of the final boss would remove the first spell you played every turn from the game (normally, spells get discarded when cast and then re-shuffled into your draw pile to potentially be used again). I looked over my artifacts I'd picked up and realized something: I had an artifact that gave me a free, 0-cost damage spell every turn (with the bonus that it would also give me +1 draw on the next turn).

I'd completely negated this boss's intended downside!

Monster Train is a single-player deckbuilding game that gives you a semi-randomized initial batch of cards, a multitude of decisions to make as you travel down the tracks to save Hell from renegade angels, and tasks you to break the game before it breaks you. 

Each run, you pick a main faction and their champion unit, and pair it with a supporting ally faction; these determine what cards you come across, and thus your potential strategies. Before each fight, you have to pick from either a left or right path of shops, healing, or other events. Every fight, you have three floors to work with before invading enemies chip at your core's health. Winning brings gold and card draft choices (and maybe more if you take on each fight's optional challenge risk). 

Between the five factions, three main floors + the core's floor, oodles of cards and upgrades and buffs for them, enemy and boss variations, Ice Cavern random events, passive artifacts that can further twist how you might play, there is so much emergent combos and pitfalls to risk that it tingles the mind.

You're presented a new problem to tackle every run and turn, and this is made all the more appetizing by great art and an infectious and epic RPG-quality soundtrack.

If you're a fan of other deckbuilder-style games, you need to give Monster Train a try. If you're a fan of video games in general, you should give it a try.

10,Monster Train,71872685,english,"This game is clearly heavily influenced by Slay The Spire as everyone else has pointed out. I'd say it doesn't quite achieve the greatness that StS has, but I'd highly recommend it.

PROS:

- The 3 floors and combat flow mechanics are what separates this game from StS primarily, and adds a nice variety to the game play that has a different feel to it than StS. It also opens up a lot of interesting strategies.
- The artwork in this game is great, especially on the cards. The card art is all animated and looks trippy / amazing
- There are something like 4-5 'races' or deck types, and you can choose a primary deck and an 'allied' deck. It makes each run seem pretty unique and adds a nice variety to things. It felt at least on par with StS in terms of the deck feeling unique each play through.
- Cards can be upgraded with various items that can do things like lower cost, make spells more powerful, buff monsters, etc. It adds to StS's basic card upgrade system and is pretty cool
- The music in this game is really really good, and I think edges out StS. Both soundtracks tend to favour classical instrumental soundtracks. StS was focused more on horns while Monster Train is more bow-instrumenty.

CONS:

- Would've liked to see more variety in the bosses, there are fewer than in StS but the bosses in Monster Train have modifiers on them. I hope they improve this and the monster variety in future updates. This game is new so it's something that's quite probable.
- The balancing in this game seems a lot more loose and less 'tight' than in StS. I'm not sure if this is such a bad thing, but StS just feels more elegantly balanced. Often the numbers just happen to work out or whatever. This game the numbers and what things do varies more wildly.
- I would've liked to choose between more than just 2 paths per encounter. I think the 'pathing' in the runs were more interesting in Slay The Spire

26,Monster Train,71833547,english,"I'm a huge fan of Monster Train. Here are my thoughts:
* The mechanics are very intuitive, especially for a game of this genre and given how many interacting mechanics there are.
* The clans are well-done: they're all different and the pairings are very interesting.
* The difficulty ramps up well.
* RNG is definitely still a factor, but there are so many things in my control that I almost always feel like I could've won a run if I'd just done something differently (and not that it was RNG's fault).

To address the inevitable comparison between MT and Slay the Spire:
* I feel like MT has less variance and I have more control over the changes to my deck/cards.
* The upgrades are more impactful;
* Therefore each fight plays out noticeably differently than the last.
* If I make some bad decisions (with upgrades or in a fight), I'm going to find out immediately. In STS you can lose a run but not find out for a while due to attrition. I prefer immediate feedback.
* Knowing which version of the final boss you're going to fight is a great change. 
* There are only about three variations for each fight. It doesn't take long to have them memorized. This can be a pro or con depending on the person. For me, it's a pro because there's so much variation with my clan pair and cards/upgrades that the fights still don't feel repetitive.

79,Monster Train,71703557,english,"73/100 - Slay the Train! A very enjoyable rogue-like deckbuilder with all of the ups and downs of the genre. Good for a few hours, but if you aren't sure you'll love it, I'd recommend waiting for a better special. Full review below.

= Intro =

Picked this up on Summer Sale. Wasn't...quite what I was imagining, but gave it a good whack today.

= Gameplay: 80/100 = 

Oh man, this game can be fun, when it wants to be. It plays similarly to Slay The Spire, expect now you are placing units, casting spells and the like to fight incoming enemies.

Unlike Slay the Spire, this throws balance out the window, into an open volcano and shoots spitballs at it on the way down. Some of the card interactions are insanely strong, while some are very, very weak. Naturally, this does exacerbate the standard issue of RNG - I found myself either sailing through runs and flipping the final boss the bird or dying before the halfway point.

Like Spire, you move through a preset number of levels, with a period of (random) vendors, upgrades and events between them. And in the theme of this game, these can be very powerful or nearly useless depending if the dice like you or not. 

But the kitten-eating frustration is very much a part of these games, and when a truly great run comes together, you'll be up past your bedtime for the next one. Although, unless you are a nut for this sort of game, you'll find fighting the same enemy sets and bosses every run a little tedious after a while. It feels like the game was meant to have a second half that never got made.

However, the big issue with the game is another issue with Spire clones in general - a lack of progression outside of runs. While you can gradually earn new cards to be thrown into the mix and unlock new races (which you choose 2 to combine at the start of a run) once you've done that the only thing at present to work on is cosmetics.

I've always thought this genre leans too far towards roguelike and needs to go more in a rogue-lite direction, with talents and the like that you can level after runs, and some permanent deckbuilding options.

= Graphics & Audio: 61/100 = 

Quite a pretty game at first glance, with bold colors, crisp looking visuals and fun creature designs. However, you quickly realize that there is essentially no variety to the backdrops or levels, which makes everything sort of turn into a firey blur after a while.

Not to mention that some spells don't even have a visual attached.

Sound effects are quite good - beefy and impactful, and the music, while somewhat generic, won't have you reaching for the mute button.

That all said, while it all looks and sounds good, some more visual variety is definitely needed.

= Style & Feel: 85/100 = 

A nice, original take that honestly feels way more fun than Spire, even when it's making you want to swing your mouse around like a morning star. 

Controls were a little odd to start, and I still occasionally drop cards on the wrong floor - but this is mostly a me issue.

= Value: 41/100 =

As cute, fun and all-round enjoyable as this game is, it does start to feel slightly hollow quite quickly. 

Either you are going to enjoy going through the same runs again and again (with the only changes being RNG or the incremental difficulty unlocked later) or not - and after a few completed runs in I really wanted something more. An endless mode? Some more variety in bosses/enemies? A more permanent deck building option? 

Remember in Spire how you'd unlock the second half of the campaign as you went? I was genuinely waiting for this in Monster Train.

I don't know. I'm sure that some people will end up playing for hundreds of hours. For me, I can't see it lasting more than another 6 or 8. And that's sort of a pity, because what is here is really great. 

I just wish there was more of it. 

= Overall = 

+ It's another rogue-like deckbuilding game!
+ Lots of fun, crazy combinations
+ Some genuinely creative cards and ideas
+ Wonderful (if slightly tedious) visuals
+ Punchy audio
+ 5 decks to mix and match with

- It's another rogue-like deckbuilding game...
- Enemies, backdrops, runs and bosses badly need variety
- Needs some progression outside of cosmetics
- RNG-tastic
- Feels like it's missing half a campaign mode and a few other modes.
- Covenant difficulties are not going to be for everyone.

At the end of the day, it's a good game. A very good game. But  I'm not sure how much replayability it's going to have for people who are burned out on the genre or never liked the repetition.

TL/DR: If Slay the Spire was your game, buy this game now!
Full explanation below:

1. The game is just as strategic, possibly even more so than StS. There are 3 vertical levels before enemies start attacking your heart. Player units and spells can be placed on each level. Enemies and bosses begin at the bottom and ascend to your heart. This makes unit choice and placement incredibly complex, especially synergize with spells. Oh, add major game changing artifact pickups to this equation as well. 

2. You use 2 decks per run. Each deck is a flavor unto it's own, and every deck synergizes differently with another. Super fun and lots of replayability

3. You have 2 paths per interlude between stages. These 2 paths greatly affect your run by your choices. Again adds tons of strategic depth.

4. Once you unlock the later decks, they are incredibly different from the beginning decks, and the new synergy possibilities turn mind-blowing.

10/10 best deck building since StS

This game is perfect for anyone looking for a “Deck Builder” game. The single player experience is all I have done so far but even though it is solo there is still a level of connectivity to it. Having your steam friends Covenant rank on the left side is a nice addition on making it so you can see where you match compared to friends. 

Things I liked this Deck Builder had:
- NewGame+ Features
- Variety of unique decks to choose from
- Having to choose 2 decks to start a mission with
- Forcing 4+ cards into your deck that’s out of your control I.E. makes you flip between more magic or DMG
- multi level combat

Pros: 

+ Combat & art style are interesting. 

Cons:

- Audio during boss battles needs to be rethought, hearing the boss scream 3 dozen times with the speed set to super ultra is very annoying. 

- Runs aren't long enough to create interesting deck/artifact builds, basically if you don't have cards that mesh well together after the first boss fight, might as well restart as there are no additional rewards at the start of a run based on the previous runs success. 

- Synergy between different clans is lacklustre.

3,Monster Train,71646510,english,"At the time of the writing, the reviews for the game are ""Overwhelmingly Positive"", so my review is here to balance this 96% positive reviews.
The game is a mix between deckbuilding and tower defence: you have spells and units in your deck that you can play to prevent the enemies to reach the top of your train. Every turn, the horde climb one story out of the three you can play on, the fourth one being where your pyre is. Spells cycle trough your discard and draw piles - what you're used to if you've played a deckbuilding game before but units can be played once per encounter. 
At the start of each run, you choose two clans, which determine your starting deck and the cards you'll be able to draft. The difference between the two clan you choose is that the main one determine you champion (a uber unit). Each clan play very differently, which is great.
So why the negative review? Well, it's too random: you can have a vision for your deck that's doom from the start if you don't get the good option for your first champion upgrade (there are 3 paths for each champion, with possible multi-classing, but you only have 2  choices per upgrade), or don't draft a good unit early on, or don't get a good selection in shops... and the randomness is made even worse with covenant (think ascension) levels: for example, the first (second?) one fills your deck with five random cards, which can really help you or make your deck completely useless.
There is also the issue that your (well, at least my) deck is based around a handful of cards: have one of your main units die early or fail to draw your main spell at the critical moment, and you can kiss your run goodbye for you'll probably have no chance to adapt.
It's a shame because there's a lot to like here, but deckbuilding has given us some great games, and this one is merely goodish, so you should probably give it a pass, at least as long as you haven't rinsed its competitors.",1593431206,1593448448,FALSE,3,0,0.488922477,2,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,347,9,1449,0,1162,1599856350,,

But I'd be wrong to say MT isn't more fun. It has way more polish visually/sound design. It has way more effective content (5 factions all with distinct card pools, every run your deck is comprised of two and the factions have all these synergies, etc). The run times are slightly SHORTER than StS so it's that little bit more ""one more run""-able. It's just so sexy and bitesized compared to it's eldest... I can't not recommend it, it's a great game.

I remember when I first saw the game I thought it looked like a mobile game ported to PC and was immediately turned off. But my attention was drawn back to it by a friend and I gotta say I'm glad I tried it. 

The multiplayer is unique and surprisingly fun. I wouldn't think a deck-building game could support a multiplayer aspect, but I would be sorely mistaken. I'm happy with the approach they took. It really puts your decision making skills to the test against others in a battle for survival. I would like to see maybe a mode in the future where you could buy things to hinder your opponents as well. 

The single-player content is still very enjoyable too. My only complaint is that the harder difficulties become a mode of ""get broken or get broke."" It's still a lot of fun to challenge myself with the insanely difficult modifiers added to the run.

    I know how tiring it is to see games compared to other games all the time. It feels a little demeaning and like you HAVE to enjoy the other game in order to enjoy this one. But in this case i feel like its warranted. If you've played Slay The Spire you'll get the just of this game. But in Monster Train everything is cranked to an 11. The amount of depth they put into the whole system when it comes to random generation (which will get my buy on most any game) is absolutely fantastic. Every run feels new and exciting. Its absolutely addicting. I just cant seem to pull myself away every single time i start a run. And all of this nerd gushing praise means so much more from a narcissist like me that only sees the worst in every game. I just love every aspect of it and i can guess right now that my hours will probably easily hit over 100 on here.

Now here's some aspects i look for in a game put in a scale out of /10

Art: 9 (Its very stylized and general reception is they weren't interested in it cause the art style but loved it in game)

Immersion: 10 (The atmosphere is easily set up and shoves you right into it from the get go.)

Story: 5 (There isn't much to go on but there is a plot driving you. What are you expecting? its a rogue-like.)

Difficulty: 6 (You probably aren't going to win on your first run and the skill ceiling feels VERY high.)

Gameplay: 11 (The one thing i NEED in game nowadays is fluidity in the controls and consistent pacing.)

Replayability: 10 (Its a well done rogue-like.)


Overall Score: 9.5/10


If you got $25 (Or less if the games on sale which it does go on) and you enjoy deck building rogues of all the games you could buy with it i would say Monster Train is the obvious choice.

72,Monster Train,71518802,english,"Monster train is a rogue-lite deckbuilder with a surprising amount of emergent depth of play. 

The good: Like other games in its class (such as Slay the spire), the focus of MT is on building and enhancing a deck that can scale to exponentially increasing levels of difficulty. This is easier said than done, as the playing field has a fairly large number of variables to consider and balance such as draw count per turn, space for units on each level of the train, ember (action points) to spend per turn, unit defensive and offensive power, etc. 

To balance this out, MT provides a generally higher degree of player agency than other games in its class. Rather than being entirely beholden to the RNG, players are subject to making impactful trade-offs at regular steps along the way. 

A winning game session requires about 1 hour and 20 minutes at a relaxed pace. A primary/secondary faction system provides ~13 deck combinations for good replayability in conjunction with a system of gradually progressing handicaps.

The bad: MT is a mixed bag in terms of permanent player progression. Wins and losses unlock more factions to play, more cards per faction, some purely aesthetice enhancements, and an increasing difficulty scale in the form of player handicaps. The card unlocks, in particular, seem a bit contrived, as though players need to ""earn"" the right to access the complete game. The faction unlocks serve as a good way to gradually introduce players to the complexity of the game, but progression is very uneven. For example, I had to play close to 10 rounds to unlock the 4th deck, but the last two decks unlocked in two rounds each.

92,Monster Train,71457200,english,"Monster Train takes the Slay the Spire formula, scales it up with playable units, and improves it in almost every way, while throwing in a dash of tower defense.  It's been the most satisfying single-player deck-builder I've played.

The two biggest issues that made my time with StS comparatively short were a repetitive early-game, a cramped pathway to deck-building, and an overall lack of variety.  MT (after the ""tutorial"" playthrough) gives you some random cards and a potentially game-altering relic from the start, choices about upgrade pathways (themselves more fun and varied), and you're always playing two of the five unlockable clans in some combination, so twenty-five possible deck compositions, themselves able to be played out in any number of ways.

Which wouldn't matter if the cards themselves weren't balanced or fun to play.  Monster Train has done an excellent job of balancing cards both with each other and with possible upgrades to make almost any card playable in the right circumstance.  Cards that I couldn't find a use for for 60 hours suddenly became a game-breaking force when it finally was in the right set-up, and there are comparatively more opportunities to trim your deck of cards that don't serve your deck's play-style (though it's still something you need to consciously prioritize), so creating fun, playable decks is a joy, and no two playthroughs have felt the same (even if you could claim the enemies can be repetitive).

You'll want to turn it up to Super speed once you learn the mechanics well enough not to need the stilted animations playing out to show you what happens each turn, and in comparison to some videos I've seen online I now realize that on my machine the game is chugging a little, and even Super speed doesn't resolve some combats as quickly as I'd like.  Not enough that I find myself being impatient, but I do realize that by the end of a playthrough it may have added another 10-15 minutes to my game time all together. Playing cards, as well, doesn't feel as snappy and responsive as StS, and while with this genre the game is certainly still playable, I felt the difference as Monster Train just controls a little clunkier (although there is more going on on screen, to be fair, and I am on a years-old general purpose laptop, not anything a gamer would consider state-of-the-art).

Art and music style are subjective (I prefer Monster Train to StS), but one thing I did appreciate is that some effort did go into world-building.  Cards have flavor text (although annoyingly only visible in the Logbook), your game has a narrative arc, and while it falls into the background of the mechanics, the different clans do have different characters, styles, and descriptions behind those mechanics.  Sure, defending a train making it's way to the center of Hell to re-light the Pyre, frozen by Heaven when they broke the Covenant, is still just a macguffin.  But it's a slightly fleshier macguffin.

If this game doesn't win some sort of award at the end of year game awards, then there is something very wrong with the industry.

For such a simple premise, I was surprised at how much scope there is to the game. You only fight one battle per round, but those battles are momentous affairs. It's a fun watch too, if a little loud. You'll turn your sound down playing this game, but that's a harsh thing to take away brownie points for.

As much as I was enjoying myself on my first run - I have only played 1.7 hours, and done one run at the time of writing this review - at first I felt the game was a bit easy. I was slaughtering bosses with surprising ease, making tons of money and boosting cards to a point at which I thought I'd be unbeatable.

Suffice it to say, I was mightily mislead, and I love that! The final boss wiped the floor with me! Truly. I'd like to say the hands I drew were terrible. That would be sort of true, but it's a weak excuse. There is so much depth to upgrading and picking cards, and it's only going to get deeper as you gain cards and boost your deck.

I've played games that are similar to Monster Train before, and I do enjoy the genre, but Monster Train had something extra. It's hard to put in to words. Part of it is that the run seemed shorter and less tiring than other games of the genre. I won't take away from the depth of planning that can go in to boosting your chances of victory with the cards you pick, improve or discard, but the fact that you fight just once per level makes things ""short but sweet"". Playing those other similar games I often could feel drained from the sheer length of a run. Monster Train had just enough in to feel full, yet not bloated. I also very much liked the fact that between each battle you could explore a level of hell to improve your deck without having to worry about what was behind you. There was a freedom to deciding which way to take your deck, but not without risks as you could only chose one path.

Not that any of the above means this game will be over all too quick either. When I finished my first run (not the way I'd have liked to) I was presented with a book of achievements and progress. I turned a page and was honestly astonished at the number of unfilled spots I saw. I look forward to exploring all that.

Now I see, whilst writing this, that the game has multiplayer. I don't always partake of multiplayer, but something tells me it could be a joy in this game.

At its basic, a rogue-like deck builder with meaningful choices and some RNG.  IMHO, the RNG is not quite as punishing as you are given a lot choices and abilities to modify cards to create strong decks.  Most of my runs end because of my bad decisions, not because of RNG, which is what I prefer.

There is also a good amount of replayability as there are 4 factions, of which you play 2 of during every run.  Meaning you have a number of combinations to work out the best synergy and card interaction.

61,Monster Train,71321527,english,"The deck building genre of rogue-lite is all about optimizing the deck and card sequence when in combat; Synergize your cards, then play them in the right order. Monster Train adds a new layer (actually 3) to this idea by having vertically stacked battle grounds, but one hand to manage them with in each encounter.

The only drawback I think think of after 75 hours of play is that for people who are focused on maxing their 'Covenant rank' (ascension for those of StS lineage) will find the grind tedious at times because the malicious added each rank can create perfect storms of failure that doom a run before you drop your first Train Steward... besides that, its all good news in every way.

This game is ""the"" next deck builder and will be remembered in the genre as ultimately what grew out of Slay the Spire.

72,Monster Train,71286637,english,"If you like Slay the Spire, you will like this too. The mechanics are similar (deck building, artifacts, path choosing etc.) but you also get monster cards as opposed only having one fighter to buff, and 3 floors of your train to manage. Additionally, you get to pick two different clans, which affect the cards available to you each round. Some have pretty good synergies that are satisfying to discover.

Overall I feel like the route choosing is fairly straightforward / doesn't require much thought when compared to STS. You get two options each level, each of which have a few bonuses (a card pick, extra gold, a shop, etc.). 

When you're building your deck you need to track how many units you have vs. how much you have space for on each train, to make sure you don't end up with units that you can't play. This adds an additional element that makes deck management much more interesting.

The only downside of the game is that the fights on each floor are pretty set in stone, with optional trials for additional rewards. If you play through a couple times, you've basically seen it all and know what to prepare for as you progress through hell. This can make the gameplay seem somewhat stale, but having 5 clans to pick from makes the way you play against those same enemies different each time.

Basically if you liked STS, you have no reason not to get this game. It's worth it, even if it is just to give you a break from STS for a day or two.",1593025396,1593025396,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,438,7,1791,0,1791,1593024840,,

Pros:
- It's good.
- It's fun.
- There is little like it. (it's not quite like Slay the Spire)

Con:
- Limited replayability.
- There is no enemy or map variations. You fight the same 9 ""rooms"" in each run, with identical waves of enemies in the same order. 
- This gets really tiresome after 10 runs. Would rather play something different.

Multiplayer is early access:
- All players are doing individual solo runs. It's not really multiplayer. The player going further with the better score ""wins"".
- You can't inspect other player decks.
- You can't spectate other players.
- There is a horrible timer forcing exactly 5 minutes per room, before proceeding to the next room. Except a room takes only 2-3 minutes to play and you're bored to death waiting another 2-3 minutes to continue playing.

The game is good but doesn't deserve more than 8/10 due to the lack of diversity and replayability.

It's so cool that they're still adding new (endgame) content.

I do still watch videos on the daily challenges because I love the crazy combos used there (costumization to more directly try some of that would be a cool addition I think - maybe like a ""training room"" where you can freely set up enemies and define your deck). Also, I will definitely come back to it once the new content is available (wouldn't even mind paying for it to support the game) and again, better add some solid endgame content later than just anything boring.

The game is more snowbally in nature, and you often end up with some broken combo by the end of the run. This is reflected in the enemies' HP which progresses much more exponentially than in Slay the Spire. This also means the balance is more sensitive and randomness can have a meaningful influence.

Pros:
- 5 very distinct clans, each with a handful of different playstyles. your deck combines 2 clans, which might uncover some really cool synergies.
- Nice art style with nice attention to detail, such as units adjusting their size based on how many slots they take up.
- You can enable combat preview, which is very handy (I'd even go as far as calling it a must-have) as it helps you track very complex interactions.
- You can pull off some insanely powerful and fun combos, and it's incredibly satisfying when you do so.
- Great replay value, as you can always go for different builds and/or increase your difficulty. 

Cons:
- This is not a train game. The train is there just to add some flavor to the game and its lore, but nothing more beyond that.

It's sufficiently challenging, but very beatable in a few tries... and then it reveals that there's a couple dozen harder difficulties. There's enough interesting mechanics to give a large number of viable build strategies, and interestingly they tend NOT to revolve around the multi-stage mechanics. This isn't a one-trick, ""Slay the Spire but 3 battlefields"" pony. The mechanics are thought through carefully. Like Slay the Spire, choosing your flavor at the start of the run influences the cards you find along the way, which means the set you're drafting from is skewed toward cards that might actually combo in your deck. But in Monster Train, you choose TWO flavors to mix together, which adds a lot to the replayability; plus, the artifacts (passive buffs) you find are also pulled from a generic set plus your deck's 2 sets.

With most games being solidly divided between ""indie"" or ""AAA"" this might seem a little pricey, but there's a lot of satisfying art and sound. I usually say that graphics don't matter; but the fact is that they do need to be good enough that you're never distracted by it, and this game delivers.

11,Monster Train,71044498,english,"Monster Train is a deckbuilding roguelike, with a fantasy theme. If you think that sounds like Slay the Spire, you're right, but it stands on its own unique merits.

The theme is fantasy but with a twist: The fires of hell have been extinguished by angels, and it's up to the player to drive a train containing the last pyre of hellfire through the nine layers of hell, defeat the angels, rekindle the flames, and make the world safe for demons again.

The big difference is the format of the combat: where Slay the Spire focuses on a single character fighting battles against very small groups of enemies, Monster Train has exactly nine battles which play out like tower defense: enemies advance up the four floors on your train while attacking, and you play creatures and spells from your deck on the first three floors to stop them . The last enemy in each battle is a boss with special abilities and many more hit points. If an enemy reaches the top of your train, it deals damage to your pyre. If your pyre runs out of health, your game is lost. If you manage to defeat the boss in battle nine, you win! A winning run typically takes about an hour: a failed run can be a much shorter experience.

Available cards are divided into five ""clans"" of demons. You begin every match by choosing a starting clan and a support clan. Your begin the game with a deck consisting of a champion from from your starting class, five basic cards from your starting clan, five basic cards from your support clan, and four clanless ""train stewards"". You begin every battle with a hand of five cards from your deck, one of which will be your champion. Just like Dominion, you draw five cards from your deck every turn. If your deck is empty, your discard pile gets shuffled back into your draw pile.

At each layer of hell, you'll be able to draft clan cards for your deck, remove cards, and upgrade cards by adding modifiers to them. Just like Slay the Spire, you'll absolutely need to optimize your deck to defeat the increasing difficulty levels of each of the nine battles. Also like Slay the Spire, beating a run unlocks a ""covenant rank"" which adds difficulty modifiers that make the game more challenging to beat. There are 25 covenant ranks in total. Monster Train also has leaderboards and daily challenge, in which everyone plays with the same random seed.

In short: Monster Train is quality. The game provides you with a series of interesting choices, and the outcomes of these choices are very meaningful, both in deckbuilding and in playing your cards in each battle. Win or lose, the game has that addictive ""gotta try one more run"" feeling. Wins are satisfying, losses can be heartbreaking, and most of the time, your choices completely determine the outcome.

TLDR; If you liked Slay the Spire, Monster Train is a very easy recommendation, especially at the $20 price.",1592599693,1592599693,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,261,2,8273,69,5221,1601672695,,

56,Monster Train,70966971,english,"This game is amazing. I couldn't put it down during the first week I bought it. My first impressions were that the 5 clans felt completely unique from each other, what with their individual champion/cards/trinkets/ and upgrade availabilities. I was originally afraid that each clan was going to play one of three ways every time, but the amount of choices and combinations are absolutely amazing. The addition of selecting one of the remain 4 clans as a sub class adds so many strategies I never could have thought of if I tried. 

The minion based combat of having to manage three different levels opens up so many paths to tread strategy wise. Example. You can put all your strength in your first level to try to kill enemies straight out the gate and have weaker minions in subsequent floors as clean up. Alternatively, you can leave the first level empty and put your team on the second or third level to buff them up in some way before the enemy reaches them. I have also had runs where I had very few minions and just beat bosses with a slew of endless spells. It's little decisions like this that keep me coming back and make the deck building and drafting that much more fun.

My only complaint so far is the boss pool. There are three main bosses you will fight every single time you play. They change slightly by each having 3 different passive and active effects, but generally the game play is usually the same against them. Other than that each of the 5 remaining minor boss areas have 2 different bosses it can randomly select from so at least in that regard the variety changes a bit. I would love to see the developers add some new boss and possibly some new cards in the future. Having read their FAQ they seem interested in supporting the game for a while, it seems like just a matter of time.

All in all, I highly recommend this game especially if you are into deck building games.",1592460344,1592460344,TRUE,1,0,0.523809552,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,237,3,3439,0,2413,1599959864,,
57,Monster Train,70966535,english,"This game feels like it could be called Slay the Spire II, in a good way.

This game perfectly captures the original vibe of STS but gives it a really fresh spin.  Instead of one hero fighting multiple monsters you're able to summon multiple creatures to fight the enemy hordes. You also control 3 different levels of your train to fight in. If the monsters survive the first floor they then move to the second floor where you, hopefully, have some creatures summoned to at least damage them. If they get past the 3rd floor they'll damage your health but also take damage from your train.  When you defeat all the enemies, you then fight the level's boss who is much more difficult than the rest of the creatures.  

Moving from area to area is very ""Spire-esque"" as well.  You start in an area with different things to visit, such as remove 2 cards, get some gold, upgrade your cards, etc.  The way cards are upgraded is very fun and different than STS.  You are able to take your cards and give them additional powers.  Spells and creatures can be upgraded in ways that almost feel like you're cheating, if the game wasn't so hard.

The idea works very well at being unique enough from STS to have the feeling of very different game. In other ways Monster Train draws heavily from the feel of STS in many of it's design elements and UI features, giving it a very comfortable and familiar feeling that makes it easy to play.

The deckbuilding, unlockable cards, random artifacts, random events, unique enemy and boss structure, insane combos, skin of your teeth wins by playing just the right combo of cards, very cool and interesting factions and combinations, all has me loving this game.

Another entry in the roguelike card game genre and what a hell of an entry it is!
With the addition of customizable card upgrades, introduction of unit summons and the ability to create sick combos, Monster Train stands proudly among other titans of the subgenre. Things really start to heat up once you unlock more clans, cards and difficulty levels. Plenty hours of fun, card diversity and fun cardplay, earns it a very warm recommendation (promise, no more puns).

[h1][b]The positive[/b] [/h1] 
+ Excellent card play. The core card mechanics and the way cards combine offer plenty of great deckbulding opportunities.
+ Card customization. The ability to upgrade both units and spells, is by far the most fun aspect of the game for me as it opens the player to experiment with pretty crazy combos.
+ Diversity. Anywhere from picking different starting champion units, over different starting clans to just picking and upgrading different cards, the game offers near endless diversity in how you make your deck work.
+ Fairly quick runs. Defeat doesn't feel as bad, as a single run can be done within an hour.
+ Aesthetics. Personally I enjoyed the art style and on top of that the cards are slightly animated which is nice touch.
* Empowering players. The players are given a ton of tools to create their own perfect deck, with plenty of options to remove cards or duplicate the strong ones. This can make runs less difficult, but most runs will not be as easy as it may sound.

[h1][b]The neutral[/b][/h1] 
* Math problems. Although the game does the hard calculations for you, sometimes it's very difficult to foresee the output until you actually play the card, especially for units. This could be resolved by showing results before you play a unit card, but the game currently does not support that.
* Slower unlock rate. The last clan together with some end cards take a bit more time to unlock than I would have liked personally. Thankfully, the game is fun enough so it doesn't feel like a chore.
* Some items seem a bit overtuned. This can make some runs a lot easier, but at the same time broken combos can be super fun to pull off. Some players may be bothered by it, but I found it more enjoyable than not.


[h1][b]The negative[/b] [/h1] 
- The single biggest downside of the game is the very notable lack of boss diversity. Each major boss has some slightly different mechanics, but ultimately you will be seeing the same faces over and over again. 


[h1][b]Gameplay[/b] [/h1] 
As typical with games in the genre, you will fight a series of fights, earning cards and items along the way, only to face the last boss. After each run you will be unlocking new cards and difficulty levels.

Aside from the tutorial, you start off by picking one main and one allied clan. The game introduces 5 clans (some locked), each with their own unique cards and mechanics. Some clans rely on summoning morsels which are eaten by your other units, other clans rely on summoning powerful minions that have a burnout mechanic,  making them expire after a few turns.

Each clan also starts with unique a champion, that can be upgraded into 3 different paths or you can even mix them up to align with your playstyle. 

Each fight you will summon units on one of three floors of your train and try to prevent waves of enemies reaching your Pyre, not unlike a tower defense game. Where and when you place your units is extremely important and positioning matters with the front units taking damage first and once they die, they can't be summoned back for that fight (with the exception of some clan spells). On each level, after the last wave the boss joins the fray, usually possessing an additional gimmick. Unlike tower defense games, the boss can't slip by, so if you have the damage/health to deal with the boss, you will. 

In between fights you can choose one of two sides of the railroad track, each giving access to different set of locations: shops where you upgrade cards or buy items, healing sites, sites to duplicate/remove cards or special events.

One thing that sets this game apart from similar games is the card upgrade system. Every card can be upgraded (spells and units) in a number of ways (e.g. stat improvements, adding special keywords etc). This small mechanic can greatly supplement your strategy. One example is adding the keyword Holdover to a card, which puts it on the top of your deck when played. If your strategy relies on playing some key cards, playing it every turn without having to clutter your deck with copies, can be immensely powerful and satisfying.

The game tries its best to give the player all the tools he/she needs to succeed with plenty of ways to remove cards from your deck, get new ones or duplicate/upgrade existing ones, all in the effort to create a super deck. 

Lots of fun, lots of diversity, excellent card play and deckbuilding.

6,Monster Train,70906413,english,"Monster Train is a rogue-lite card game in the same vein as Slay the Spire, albeit with more options.

A game generally follows as such : Choose a deck and then choose a companion deck.  This allows a player to mix and match several deck types, granting much more freedom than Slay the Spire.

Initial battles are short and a lot of the decision making is actually done between these.  Yes, that's right, there are many fun options to choose from BETWEEN battles, such as upgrading units, duplicating cards, choosing new units, taking gold, improving spells, and a multitude of random events.  Awesome.

At the start of each battle the player is given the option to accept the Trial, or run the fight as normal.  If a player accepts the trial a bonus will be awarded (the bonus is stipulated pre-battle, usually for $$ or extra units).  The bonuses can help a lot, but they can also be dangerous creating a good incentive for the player.  Winding up with an extra few damage mods on friendly units, extra artifacts, or removing cards that do not fit your current deck can do wonders for beating the last boss.

And that is what this game is all about, beating the boss.  From the very BEGINNING a player is aware of what unique situation will occur in the last boss battle.  Upon beating the boss the player raises a covenant level and the game gets ever so slightly harder.  Not harder in the annoying way that Slay the Spire ends up getting REALLY fast.  It gets hard enough to make the game more challenging and punish a player for not playing smart and thinking ahead about the fights (because it shows units pre-fight), but hard enough to make ranking up FUN.

Also, when a player beats (for example) convenant rank 5 with a certain clan, he can try for covenant rank 6 with a completely different clan.  No need to go back and start all over again.

Overall, Slay the Spire was an amazing game (but I absolutely hated the artwork).  Monster Train is not only a better game, but it also has much better artwork.  Highly recommend.

47,Monster Train,70834663,english,"Like many others have written, the best way to gauge whether you'll like this game is whether you enjoy Slay the Spire, the current king of deck builders. Compared to StS, Monster Train is a bit of a double-edged sword.

On the negative side, Monster Train has simpler builds, in terms of cards and artifacts. In StS, some artifacts or cards can change your entire play strategy, and this generates a wealth of potentially viable strategies & builds. Each of Monster Train's 5 factions have two major mechanics each (the starter Hellhorned clan has armor and rage; the Stygian have frostbite and incant). And while being able to choose a primary AND secondary clan/deck provides some nice complexity, there's still much less depth than in Slay the Spire.

On the positive side, Monster Train's simplicity makes it less random. In StS, you'll often choose a build to pursue based on the first card choices you get, but then those builds often depend on several linchpin cards or artifacts. And if you don't get them? You're done. So I put maybe 80 hours into StS before I quit for good, simply because of how often I lost through no mistakes of my own. 

By contrast, in Monster Train, I'm currently at Covenant 22 (of max 25, with each new covenant adding a difficulty twist), and I've managed some significant win streaks (7 in Cov bracket 1-10, and 5 in Cov bracket 11-20). There's definitely been some annoying RNG moments - of course there are, it's a deck builder! - but they feel rarer. That's thanks to the overall design as well as small touches like knowing which final boss you're facing from the start.

That said, the game has started to lose much of its charm in higher Covenant ranks. For me, much of the fun in deck-builders is to experiment and win with wildly different builds. But as you increase your Cov rank, that fun begins to dwindle considerably. For starters, by the time you're up to Cov rank 20+, you're STARTING with like 17-18 junk cards in your hand, so every game means half your hand is the same basic, boring crap. But what's worse is that, at these higher difficulty levels, you're also restricted down very narrow paths if you want success. Because of this starter card bloat, spell-based builds become largely non viable; instead you have to build units and within those units, what you can build is very narrow. You need a tank, you need a back-rank killer (can be the tank, if it has spikes), and you need some form of exponentially growing damage setup. 

Because of that - and because you only have a few opportunities to get units - I can often tell whether the run will be a win or loss from the very first unit/card choice I get. That loss of player agency is, to me, the epitome of bad design.

Not to end on a bad note, though: working my way up to this point has been a wild and fun ride, and I hope my review gives you some sense of whether you'll enjoy it or not.",1592239017,1592239017,TRUE,1,0,0.523809552,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,490,89,5428,0,3957,1598937763,,

51,Monster Train,70809843,english,"You might be wondering ""Does Monster Train bring any innovations to the deck-builder roguelike genre""? And the answer to that is no. Deck-building-wise, it's pretty close to how things work in Slay the Spire. However, it does bring some pretty major innovations to the [i]tower defense[/i] genre; Monster Train somehow manages to be a tactically deep and turn-based tower defense game, with the three floors each being a chance to stop enemies from reaching your Pyre (your Pyre being your ""true hp""), and the way you have to build your deck so it can manage both large enemies and numerous small enemies to prevent any of them from slipping by mirrors the similar challenges found in more conventional tower defense games. As for how it compares to the biggest title on the deck builder roguelike market right now, Slay the Spire, I would say its shorter playtime and smaller number of larger, more tactically complex battles helps make it if anything more fun. It also somehow makes it simultaneously possible to achieve absolutely ridiculous numbers and final builds while still being difficult with a risk of losing if you don't think things through, as a result of the demands on the player it inherits from the tower defense genre; going through its Covenant system (a series of special difficulty-changing modifiers) involves less of a demand for a fundamentally different playstyle and more like it requires more thought with each action compared to StS's Ascension system. Its clan system, where each run contains cards from two clans of your choice, also helps keep gameplay fresh, because, not counting the potentially major differentiating factor of the Champion (a unique unit that receives special, often transformative upgrades at regular points, including the start of the run), there are already 10 possible total card pools a run can have in the game in its current state.",1592192843,1592233172,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,69,7,11748,369,5567,1601560448,,

The tower defense / lane elements add a very nice touch and the clan system and a couple thoughtful tweaks by the developer do a lot to soften the relatively boring and repetitive early game before your deck really grows into it's character. Bottom line: If you loved Slay The Spire this game should be an insta-buy unless you're an absolute maniac when it comes to deal-hunting and sales, in which case you need to wishlist it now. If you have no idea what Slay The Spire is but the idea of a roguelike deck building tower defense game appeals to you, I can assure you that this game manages to pull all of those off in an enjoyable and very repeatable way. 

If I had to offer criticisms, I'd say that on the higher difficulties I just don't think every run with every clan combo is viable. Sometimes your starter cards/artifacts are going to have no synergy and if I ever get to the point where I'm trying to get Covenant 25 (highest difficulty) runs for every clan combo, I'm positive I'll be doing a lot of start-scumming.

Monster Train offers unique and challenging game play that utilizies technical lessons learn to create a new experience while implementing user experience of its sister and brother games to improve on the diversity of the core game play loop. This creative deck building ride (attempt at a train pun) provides players the options and flexibility to craft a distinct Monster team full of unique modifiers, abilities, stats, and clan mash-ups. 

Players familiar with deckbuilders will pick up on upgrade prioritizations, ""combos"", and effective builds relatively easily, while the increasingly difficult covenant ranks offer challenging modifiers to the game experience. The only variable that disrupts the strategic elements of deckbuilding only comes into affect at higher ranks - the random nature of the cards being added to your deck at start. Players seem to be doubly hindered with the addition of completely unsynergistic cards and blights added to the deck at the start of a run. I also fully support the alternative perspective that this is a core component of the monster train game play loop. I only question if players see this as a reason to continuously reset their higher level runs in seek of synergistic/higher performing cards (to each their own!)

15,Monster Train,70774888,english,"Good game - the game feels like a successful amalgation of hearthstone and slay the spire, both in terms of gameplay and visuals. Most runs feel quite different from one another, as do the 5 different classes, partially due to the myriad of mechanics present in the game, all of which feel quite fun, viable and have a lot of support from other cards, resulting in many satisfying card combinations.

However, one of my gripes is that, due a a number of causes, the runs themselves seem to have relatively little variation in the combat phase. You draw a hand and it almost always plays itself (unlike sts and hearthstone). That is partially caused by starting cards being complete dogshit (worse than sts....) and decks usually only having one big thing going for them. As a result, most of the actual choices in the game are made outside the combat - which would be fine if the combat wasn't by far the longer phase - the phases in betwee, during which you upgrade cards, etc are relatively short.

Another problem that is see is that there isnt as much variation in enemies as slay the spire, and enemies do not seem to test a specific area of your deck (e.g. scaling, burst, defensive options...) quite like sts, resulting in a same-y experience during most runs (sometimes you just get 100-0'd by an enemy your deck cant handle at all though...).

Losing is fine - but one of the redeeming factors of rogue-likes are that they usually terminate an unsuccessful run fast and painlessly for you before you get far. This seems to rarely be the case in monster train, which can result in one hour runs randomly losing at some point :(

Regardless, very solid game, nice visuals (after some getting used to the theme), and I'll keep coming back (though probably less than to sts). I'd give it an 8/10

Overall I love the game and the way it plays, but my one complaint is the disparity in clan difficulty. The red/purple clans are much more difficult to win with as primary than the green clan and the yellow clan (Umbra) are frustratingly difficult to make work. I kept on failing run after run until I unlocked the final clan and I'm on a 3 win streak with them as primary and I'm not even that good. I like how different each clan is to play and the emphasis on synergy between them, but some of the cards are just diametrically opposing strategies and it makes it a struggle to even get past the first fight.

A friend of mine challenged me to finish it, stating it may get more challenging if you go on. So I took my review offline and accepted the challenge to finished the game.

So after having completed lvl25 I have to stick by what I previously stated. 
In a whole it is rather unbalanced, some cards are completely useless and others are overpowered. It feels like you have options, but if you want to win, you don't have any. Some artifacts are overpowered aswell, beginning with the right one means you won before you started, later in the game at around lvl20 it meant you have a 75% chance to win. 

I finished the whole game with a very basic strategy (but then, there are only basic strategies as you have to use the ones that correspond with your clan of choice) and mostly the same cards. Some of the clans were a terrible match, I wish they had put in more synergy options. 
The further you progress the more the first two draws of monsters and upgrades count. After that, it was a sure win or a sure loss and not even worth playing in my opinion (I only did so to finish the game). There were plenty of runs I could only lose no matter what and games I didn't even have to try. So in all the game plays you instead of you playing it, making it more like a casual game in my opinion.

Is it a bad game? No it is not, it looks good and has some creative aspects with the exception of some bad steals from other games. For example: Putting extra unplayable cards in your deck to make it harder doesn't work with this game. They are not annoying at all since the monsters you place are out of your deck and card draw is easy enough to accomplish.

Replayability is high, owing to the simple trick of creating multiple sub-factions, letting you pick two to combine and then keeping track of successful runs for each combination. But this breath of options comes with a price: in contrast to StS's tight balance, in Monster Train anything goes. The degree to which the game allows you to break the mechanics is absurd, but that also means there's a number of runs that from the word go basically have no shot of making it to the end, doomed to die at the first boss. At least, that's my experience at the middling difficulty level.

Some runs are impossible to get going, some runs are impossible to lose. Most runs have you searching for the seam to exploit and crack open. If a Slay the Spire with higher highs and lower lows sounds appealing to you, it's an easy recommendation. If you're interested in trying out a rogue-like deckbuilder for the first time, it's also an attractive entry point that doesn't take itself too serious and isn't afraid to have fun.

Similar play-style to StS, but you have units and spells instead of just spells, still have the chapter bosses, choosing which path to go etc. It got time leaderboard, daily challenge run and custom run as well. A bit challenging than StS, mainly because you need to manage your units well, and also tower defence element which makes it pretty fun.

TLDR for game mechanic:
0. You pick 2 classes at start, 1 main clan for main champion and deck and secondary clan for support.
1.Each fight has 4 floors, you have a core on top, if core is down to 0 hp, you lose.
2. You have to place unit to defend the floors, each floor has a max. capacity of unit placed, enemies will move up a floor each turn, final boss can freely travel between floor.
3. You have limited mana to play cards.
4. You have spells to damage/heal enemies(you can damage your units as well), heals, draw etc. like StS
5. You cannot replace a unit until its dead.
6. Choose a path to go, either you have upgrades, remove cards or random rewards.
7. Final wave of each fight is like a deathmatch, your units and boss hit each other until one is down, so prepare well.

66,Monster Train,70709282,english,"I don't write many reviews so forgive me if I get of track a bit. Monster train feels like the strange offspring of Slay the Spire, Binding of Issac, and MTG (Magic the Gathering) after a wild night and no one really knows who's kid it is. The game revolves are using 5 base decks that all have their own specific themes as well as champions that also have different play styles to them within that base deck. You play two decks at a time between any of the 5 base decks with one being the main one that your champion is from and the other being a deck you just pull cards from.  For instance the hellhounds, one of the first decks you play is pretty similar to something of a goblin deck from MTG at times. Where the monsters synergize together to be far greater than the sum of their parts, with a heavy emphasis on aggression and relatively well stated early game monsters. And the second deck you have access to at the start  is a lot like a usual green deck from MTG with large monsters and an emphasis on large health pools and ramping damage, ect. Even though I say that, that doesn't necessarily mean that you will be locked into those kinds of play styles. How you play that deck and champion will be based on what kind of drops you get, the stats of your champion,  and what ways you can best make use of artifact synergies and events that happen in a run. Now take the MTG systems and add in vertical layers along with the usual roguelike elements, random artifacts that could drastically change any given run, random events, shops to beef up spells or monsters with different semi random effects or stats. The amount of wildly different and viable deck styles I have won with already is absurd to be frank. With me only being 13 hours in, the single player alone seems to have a couple hundred hours worth of content before you have seen all the different possible combinations. This doesn't even include the multiplayer which has weekly challenges,  mutations akin to hearthstones brawl's, as well as races with other players to see who can finish a run the fastest. With this much content at this price point if you are even remotely interested in Slay the Spire then I think you will be hard pressed to not find something to love about this game. I am very much looking forward to what comes next for this game and its developers.

Monster Train takes the solo deck-building genre and adds tower defense/lane mechanics to make a very thought invoking game. Your goal is to defend the Pyre which will help restore Hell from the frozen wastes it has become. As you continually attempt to free your kin from the forces of Heaven, you will unlock new cards and factions which allow for countless synergies. Finding these strategies and watching them unfold is a joy and losses feel like a learning experience.

For those looking for a challenge, there are covenant ranks which increase with difficulty as you beat a run, although looking through the ranks; some of them seem a little artificial. When completing runs, you even get gold versions of the cards you completed your run with!

On top of the single-player deck building experience, there is the usual daily challenge to place yourself on the ladder.  Hell Rush is a multiplayer mode where you race other players in a timed battle to see who can score the highest, something I am still a little intimidated to try; but look forward to as I continue to play.

It's Slay The Spire (which I love) but without the frustrating bits and without some of the tedium. The runs are quick and satisfying, the snowballs are fun and the decks are all pretty unique. Highly recommend!


[h1] The Good: [/h1]
The strategy is multi-dimensional due to the nature of having three floors to place units and cast spells on. This is a great dimension to the game that other similar turn-based-games miss. You will find yourself building a specific roster to achieve or abuse a certain mechanic on a per-floor basis which is extremely satisfying when it pays off. The mechanics are all balanced well enough to allow for some serious synergies without it being too easy to do (without some luck).

You unlock decks which keeps the game feeling fresh and giving you something to achieve. The last two decks you unlock I loved. So unique and well designed. The game UI and design is all very high quality. It feels like it has the same level of polish as Hearthstone. 

You unlock more cards and artifacts for your decks and runs you have through reaching new XP levels. You unlock a cosmetic reward for the cards when you achieve victory. The gameplay loop is addictive, its one of those ""oh just one more round until its 2am"" type games. Achieving victory feels satisfying but not impossible.

Art style is beautiful, love the uniqueness of the world and how you're ""defending the Pyre of Hell on a train"". It's unapologetically its own thing. Each set of enemies is varied. They have funny quips in speech bubbles. I think the ""lore"" and ""unknown events"" are better done in ""Slay the Spire"" but it's not far off - you may like it better.

The difficulty is very fair, you can choose to increase the difficulty of your run by modifying enemies abilites/stats for a bonus reward- which can make or break a run. When you rank up you unlock additional ""run modifiers"" called ""Covenants"" which is the real 'difficulty level' if you will. I am determined to finish every aspect the game has to offer.

[h1] What could be Improved/What are the cons: [/h1]
- It can be obvious early on if a run will be worth sticking around for - no reason to stick around
- Not enough ways to save a run - I almost want a mulligan/tribute/sacrifice event to help turn the tides of crummy decks
- Too much snowballing - some of my decks would become easy after duplicating OP cards - maybe duplicating cards should negatively affect its stats/buffs/runes.
- Add more variance to the ""unknown events"" and add hidden stops.
- I found the fifth deck too easy (deck balancing)
- I found the third deck the least consistent (deck balancing)
- Healing the Pyre past max health should give some bonus - Maybe healing above max health overflows into gold, pyre damage or armor
- Housemates concerned about weird noises when fighting the Fel Boss on Ultra Speed ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

Absolutely enjoyed it, it is easy to grasp and has a very nice difficulty curve. The combos and ""synergies"" feel great and I feel like my strategies pay over time.

However for nitpicking there are two issues I had with this game,
1. One of the main ways difficulty scales is increasing HP pools of enemies, while this makes sense, it makes it impossible to track how many turns to kill this enemy, and tactics depending on such peculiarities are denied from the player.

2. I said the difficulty scales well, what I meant was it actually scales ""too"" well. (Disclaimer: I am not sure about this, take with a grain of salt.) 
I would not be surprised if there was a simple algorithm which measures the performance of the player and changes tweaks the difficulty accordingly.

20,Monster Train,70658261,english,"SUMMARY: A must-buy game for fans of deckbuilders and deckbuilding Rougelikes with a twist, Monster Train combines cards, strategy, resource management, and tactical planning.  With plenty of unlockables, options, challenges, and ranzomization this is a game that will provide you plenty of entertainment while pushing you to up your game.  It also is loaded with atmosphere.

Let's get this out of the way: it's easy to compare Monster Train to Slay The Spire.  This is inappropriate because though there are similar elements and some obvious influence, the games play very different.  So just because you liked - or hated - Slay the Spire doesn't mean you'll feel the same.

So let's get to the review!

The plot of the game is interesting: Angels and Demons were once at peace due to an alliance called the Covenant, and a railway through Heaven and Hell.  Then, the Angels attacked and destroyed the heart of Hell.  Only you, with the last flames of Hell powering your train, can hope to breach the center of your homeland and rekindle it.  If you mouse over cards in your logbook or other elements of the game you can pick up more.  You don't need to follow the story, but if you do, you realize there's a RICH atmosphere here, which takes it to the next level.

At the start of the game, you'll be able to select which factions are with you, which yields you some initial spells and a champion.  More factions unlock as you play, giving you five total, which means plenty of combinations to try - and the factions are radically different.  

You start on the outskirts of hell, which gives you some options, then it's off to battle.  Each battle takes you deeper into Hell, and after each battle you get to choose two paths, which give you access to various resources such as gold, stores, recruits, random events, and more.  Some levels have common resources, but in many cases you'll have to choose.

Every level sees various enemies storm your train, sometimes assisted by a Boss, and at the end of the level the boss begins a full-on assault.  This means having to think ahead, because you know the big bad is coming.

But that's not all.  Your train has four levels - three where you can deploy troops, and the top level where the Pyre is, the last flame of hell.  If enemies reach it the'll attack it - and though it does damage to them, they may survive long enough to break it.  That means you've got to summon creatures and invoke spells from your deck - and that means thinking ahead.

Your deck contains creatures and spells, often with wildly different traits.  You draw cards and have a certain amount of power (""Ember"") to call up minions.  It sounds simple, but . . .

Some enemies go from level to level, climbing your train.  Others might be able to sneak up an extra level close to the Pyre.  Some bosses move about and assist their minions.  Some enemies grant whole groups special powers  You have to pay attention to three levels of the train each turn, figure out where to deploy troops and cast spells, and figure where the enemies may move next.    You have to think about what's in your hand, what's in your deck, what's going on, and what may happen.

This leads to a variety of interesting tactics - and ways to fail.  Do you put high-powered minions at the bottom to clear out the riffraf - or at the top to protect the Pyre? Position in the train also affects what may happen and who can attack who, further leading to important decisions, such as using knockback.  The synergy of cards and artifacts (more on that later) and your choices can create radically different results - and failures.  Plus you always know that boss is coming . . .

As you  win battles and travel you can also find cards and money, modify your champion (everyone gets one big monster to start with), and modify cards.  Cards have ""slots"" into which you can add improvements, evolving them to do more, and occasioanlly changing them.  This also requires you to ask ""do I customize monsters, spells, or both?"" depending on your troops, spells, and strategy.  Modification lets you further create your own strategies, making cards your own.

As you play you unlock new cards, and winning yields ""covenants"" to let you boost the challenge.  And if that's not enough to drive you, you can chose to up the difficulty of any level with a ""trial"" that makes it harder but gives you a reward.

The game has a lot of options, a lot of unlockables, and all of these come together with a tactical deckbuilder to make sure you'll have plenty of challenge.  Plus, you can play a full game in maybe thirty minutes.

Basically, it's a fantastic game.  I think this is one that's going to be remembered for years.

So who's this game for:
* If you like deckbuilders and want that with a twist - the tactical and positional elements - then its for you.
* If you like deckbuilders you may like it - as long as the addition of the tactical/position element is something you don't mind or are curious about.
* If you like defense-type games that involve positioning and planning, you might like it.  It depends if you like or are interested in the deckbuilding aspect.",1591933720,1591933818,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,155,97,2451,0,1379,1593744555,,

The gameplay isn't intuitive. The trick is to build small decks with cards that can fill out your train with units and then buff them. I haven't played another card game that encourages small decks and dropping cards. I only figured it out after long hours of boring grinding, not getting anywhere.

37,Monster Train,70645925,english,"So Monster Train basically a combinations of deck building and tower defense. And of course it is not Slay the Spire despite being similar genre so please don't make comparison whether which game is better, cause this game is on a different league of its own. 
A quick recap of the game's content: 5 clans (classes) so five different themed decks, and you have to allied (combined) the 5 clans with each other to build a strong deck over the course of going through hell and beating enemies coming into your train. If the enemies drained the health bar of the core (Pyre) of the train, you lose.

As much as i loved this game, the first 3 clans( Hellhorned, Awoken, Stygian) are much more well-rounded and fun to play rather than the other two (Umbras and Melting Rem) and these other twos really need some better adjustments and changes to their cards. Also it is quite frustrating to play these two clans on higher levels as they are really weak compared to other clans imo. But overall the game is really fun and though the game have value in its replayability  (because of the amount of decks' combinations you can have), but to be honest, since there are certain cards and relics that spawned way too often, the game gets extremely stale. And because of this, you don't usually have much viable options outside of the usual deck combination that already ingrained in the clans' theme, for example, Stygian being the mages so in order to win, you have to go a roundabout ways with lots of damage spells and over the course of building the deck, you would usually have to completely disregard your allied clan to win or survive. Since the game system forced u to paired up with other clans and most of the time some pairs just can't synergize at all and even hinders deck building at the start.

tl;dr: the game needs improvement on the given allies' cards at the start, and the game needs better changes to the Umbra and Melting Rem, but a fun game nonetheless, so i would recommend anyone to give this game a try.",1591908005,1591915907,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,31,5,15031,0,4272,1595793492,,

An excellent entry into a criminally under-served genre, Monster train comes with a few interesting twists and meaningful improvements to the obvious Slay the Spire comparison.

1. Interesting class dynamics with the ability to select primary and secondary clans.
2. Strategic lane-based combat, often resulting in tricky and compelling enemy lethal puzzles with depth.
3. Unprecedented control over your deck and the contained cards with modular upgrades.

Not all is perfect with the game though, in my opinion falling flat on enemy variety and often lack-luster boss fights. Although, the looming presence of major bosses off the front of the train is a nice touch to making the boss fights feel interactive beyond the final 3 turns.

Over time, you'll unlock more cards, more abilities, and more challenges. The game pitches you tougher battles, with tougher boss abilities, and give you more and more interesting, complex means of defeating those enemies. As a game should!

82,Monster Train,70601597,english,"TLDR: Buy it on sale if you're new to genre.  Buy it now if you like this genre.

I was new to the genre with Slay the Spire, barely making it to A5 after dozens of attempts.  Nothing really clicked right for me.  Highly enjoyed it though, and this game was being hyped as a good successor. (Note: I don't watch streamers or YT'ers or other crap like that; I read reviews and browse forums and go with my gut on whats shills/real)

So this game, I'd say is easier overall, much more approachable for people new to the genre, and each faction gives you a more clear direction on how to build, with more options.  Whereas in STS, you can get yourself killed in the first area pretty damn easy, this game you can make it more than half-way with a non-efficient build/deck.  And then you learn the mechanics being able to do so.  The first time you use umbra you'll probably think they're dogshit, but once you understand the playstyle they might be your fav (mine is the CandleCrew).

The game has a GREAT interface with lots of post-game summary screens, etc.  The only negative I have is that sometimes placing units can be annoying when you have many stacked.

On the subject of negatives, my biggest one is the length of a game.  Entirely too short.  Could use some filler battles or a longer campaign that goes past the current one.   I don't know if this actually happens at higher ascension levels, I didn't bother to google it.

Some hints for newbies:
HOLDOVER is OP.  The description is vague. the dum dum version is: ""If you use this spell, its in your hand the next turn"".  So you take a spell, you upgrade it with Holdover + minus cost or more power/stronger buff and all of a sudden its a passive bonus every turn, especially if you get cost to 0.
Don't start with Stygian main.  At least for me, they're the hardest to work with because your hero is a little babby with babby HP (THREE, fucking THREE HP).
Ascend/Descend sound like useless spells, but what they don't tell you is that you can ignore the space restrictions for a floor if you use these cards (All floors have a 7 unit limit though).  There are strats based around spawning on one floor then pushing them to another to stack and rape.
Hover over enemies to learn their abilities.  Stuff like ""+10 armour when a spell is cast on this floor"" can really fuck you.  If you're using a spell that spawns//draws other cards, use it on an empty floor, then use the card you've spawned on the floor with one of these enemies.  Don't use a weak spell on a guy on a floor with this ability,   Your 6 dam is negated by +10 armor unless he's under 6hp!
Spikes/Frozen can be hard to make powerful.  If you don't get the right artifacts and cards early, it ends up being a bad idea cuz the enemy will end up wailing on your torch with several turns to live before the latent damage catches up.
AFAIK you can't save scum / alt+f4 poor decisions / misclicks like in STS. This game saves your progress almost constantly.",1591824941,1591824941,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,260,11,5278,0,3192,1600020313,,

Long version:
It has 5 factions and they are all somewhat unique with their play style. A primary faction chosen from the five (Your champion with spells/units specific to that faction) and a secondary faction (one of the other five aswell). 

3 major bosses and like 4 or 5 bosses that can be another boss of that stage (like hulking bird with axe could be swapped with muscle bird with iron head). An ok amount of enemy units you will encounter.

Covenants which you unlock. These covenants make the game more and more difficult, up to 20 I think.

Like 3 or 4 different modes (normal, hell rush which is multiplayer race against others, daily challenges and custom challenges you can make).

24,Monster Train,70565360,english,"TL;DR Monster Train is like Slay the Spire, and just as good. Story is a bit overboard, but gameplay is solid and super well balanced.

Monster Train is a roguelike deck builder very similar in feel to Slay the Spire. The mechanics and strategies are very different from Slay the Spire, but I think it is pretty safe to say that if you like one you will like the other.

There are a lot of cards to unlock and strategies to choose. At the beginning of each run you pick a primary and secondary clan from the 5 available (3 are unlocked by playing), and each of those clans has about 2 or 3 archetypes you can follow. That is a lot of options and combinations. Which is why it was so surprising to me how well the game is balanced. That is seriously the most impressive feat, that you always have a shot no matter what strategy you try to go for or how the RNG plays. You can often pinpoint the failure of a run to a missed oppertunity or mistake. Also, you star off where 2 damage is a lot, and end up with dealing 100s of points of damage utilizing some of the same cards, and it just feels good to combo to a level that seemed impossible at the beginning of the run. This, along with the multitude of unlockable cards, makes playing this game enjoyable.

The story is a bit overboard though, if you ask me. You play as the last hope for Hell, trying to rekindle the Pyre to unfreeze your beloved home. There are somber interludes where you look over the carnage wrought by the invading army of Heaven, and the music swells as you fight them, struggling against these impossible odds, fighting so desperately for your right to exist! ... which is great, really tugged at my heart strings there for a moment, but it gets a bit ridiculous when you are on your 30th run. Slay the Spire did a clever thing, where it kept it mysterious and it was possible that you were making these runs over and over again as part of a larger effort against malevolent unseen forces. But in this game, each run is treated with this epicness like it is the last run ever to be made, ever, and that all hope rests with you! This is actually a pretty minor complaint, because it is fairly effective at what it does, but it gets a bit silly. It did make me not want to experiment with some suboptimal strategies because the game is making me feel like too much is at stake :/

Lastly, a complaint I have is that ultimately your ""allied"" clan, the second pick, makes very little difference because the clans do not mesh well. In general you have to focus on synergies and those just aren't present much between the clans. There are a lot of cards, but it much more feels like you pick one clan at the beginning of a run rather than picking a fusion of two.

Bottom line though, the mechanics and gameplay are great, the art and design polished, and even though the story takes itself a bit to seriously, you'll have A LOT of fun.",1591758388,1591758388,TRUE,1,0,0.516052902,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,256,78,3488,0,2730,1593610234,,

57,Monster Train,69859835,english,"I'm revising this because it doesn't seem fair to play a game so much and give it a negative review. My complaints are the same, but it's still an enjoyable experience despite the annoying parts.
This game has a ton of promise, but the amount of luck of the draw and variance in usefulness of artifacts and if you get the right cards is absurd. 
It's not difficult to play this game well. There's a lot of strategy and synergy. Instead, the problem arises from being unable to do the super cool combos you want to pull off because you just didn't get the right cards.
For example, I got an artifact that gave me plus 3 to all x cost cards. Cool. This gives me a clear strategy of pursuing and upgrading certain x cost cards. And then I didn't get offered a SINGLE + x card. 
Another issue is that artifacts are absolutely not balanced. Some are miles better than others. That's fine for a game on launch. What's worse is that some artifacts are clearly good, but offer literally no interesting decisions, like giving your pyre 40 health. These artifacts do not affect your play style literally at all. 
Also, some of the statuses are an issue. For example, thorns. It's an issue because some unit leaders only have a couple of hit points, and it's not like you can stop them from attacking. Thus, you can play your leader and hope that he just never engages an enemy with thorns, because if he does he will die and there's nothing you can do about it, or not play your leader? I guess. Stealth is equally stupid. There's genuinely nothing fun about the stealth mechanic. It's just a boss taking 8 free shots on your units so you better hope you went with a beefy boy strategy, because if you went for a glass cannon big damage strategy you're definitely going to lose.
The foundation and variability is great. This is a fully fledged and well thought through game. But it needs a lot of work to get it out of the frustrating stage of just getting totally boned by bad luck.
Even offering 3 cards instead of 2 after each fight would go a long way, or have  a card shop, or any number of other things.",1590530315,1591717867,TRUE,0,0,0.382510334,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,155,6,3237,0,1200,1599749028,,

43,Monster Train,70494885,english,"In a nutshell, this game is one of the best deckbuilding games I've ever played.

The deckbuilding genre has seen a renaissance recently because of games like Slay The Spire; where Monster Train succeeds is in the polish. One of my major gripes with Slay The Spire was that the cohesiveness of the card pool was not great, and playing more to unlock cards actually made the game harder, as it also diluted the card pool. Monster Train's card balance is such that although I've unlocked entire libraries, it never felt like I ever hit a card choice that didn't at least augment the deck I was trying to build. In those rare cases, there was always the skip button to get gold instead of a card.

The way the cards are partitioned into ""clans"" also makes it a lot easier to splash in another deck archetype to support your main deck archetype. When you start a Monster Train run, you pick a primary clan and your allied clan, which determines the pool of cards you can select from in your run. This complex interplay between your chosen clans is nothing short of magical. It allows for build variety but at the same time narrows your focus so that you have a much smaller chance of running into the diluted card pool issue.

The additional vertical element of the game also differentiates it from other deckbuilders. In Monster Train, there are three usable floors on your train. Each floor has a size limit, and enemies start on the bottom floor and work their way up. You have a choice of which floor to summon your monsters on and cast your spells on.  This adds a surprising amount of complexity to the game, but it never feels onerous. Here, I feel I have to also call out the attention to detail with the UI, as you can scroll through floors using the scroll wheel of your mouse. Such a small thing makes it a joy to play since it just feels right.

Finally, Monster Train provides information ahead of time about the enemies you are going to face during a run. This avoids the situation in which your deck works great for the majority of the game, but falls flat because of the final boss' particular gimmick. This sort of information hiding was one of my other gripes with Slay The Spire because I feel it unnaturally extends the replayability of the game at the cost of fun. There's no greater frustration than carefully building your deck, only to have the final boss be a hard counter to your deck archetype. Monster Train shines here because giving you this information up front gives you a greater sense of agency, even if there is still randomness involved.

All in all, I'm very excited to see what future updates have in store for this game. I'd heartily recommend it for fans of the deckbuilding genre.",1591631768,1591631991,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,1097,27,4149,0,818,1593864799,,

12,Monster Train,70447339,english,"I'll recommend this game, but it still feels as though it's struggling to find its way to being a great game like Slay the Spire. While StS is polished and smooth, Monster Train feels a bit bumpy. 

For example, the Relic system feels largely unbalanced - When offered a choice in game, I tend to get either 1) really great relics paired with quite poor relics, or two poor or mediocre relics. I feel like either more choices need to be offered (eg. 3 or 4 choices) or have these relics offered more frequently throughout the run. Since the game is so short as well, I sometimes only pickup 2 to 3 relics throughout the run - I feel there is room for more of an expansion here.

I also feel that some of the energy costs for cards just feels bizarre - some really great cards are 0 or 1 while some other cards cost 3. But maybe I'll figure out how good they really are later. That being said, I didn't feel this way playing Slay the Spire - the card cost was clearly associated with its power or importance.

I think the Clan dynamic is great and the mixing of these clans allows the game to be more diverse - there's lots to explore with these combinations.

Maybe a nit picking thing here, but the top HUD just seems ""mobile game"" to me - I think it could look a bit more polished.

I haven't encountered any game breaking bugs or glitches yet. Everything is smooth and looks great otherwise.

Overall, as I said, I'd recommend it. I think MT is a game that is trying hard to emulate Slay the Spire, but falls short in several ways. I can't shake the feeling that MT is, for lack of a better way of saying it, much more aggressive having the player die / lose runs. In StS, I lost because I didn't have the right cards or relics unlocked or made a bad choice - unlocking better cards and unlocking better relics made the climb not just easier, but smoother - each run felt more about skill and how to use the cards in specific situations. I don't feel that quality is present in MT - it feels more like its trying to brute force its way. That being said, I feel the potential for MT to improve is there. Judging from what I've seen from the developers, I think they can.

14,Monster Train,70249666,english,"Hodgepodge garbage. Severly unbalanced, essentially the game punishes you for trying out new clans, as you can have the best, strongest setup, just to get steamrolled by normal enemies in the next area that have dead-counter abilities to some clans, e.g. penumbra builds around smaller units getting devoured by larger ones, enemy gets +15 armour for every goddamn unit that dies, allies as well as enemies. The enemies have insane hitpoints later on and anything but clearing out a floor in one go is a death sentence in many cases, as they have much, much stronger abilities than ANY f*cking boss. You won't die to a boss as often as you will die to severly, stupidly unbalanced units that are essentially ""kek, no!"" units against pretty much entire clans (which you get your cards from). 

People say this is as good as Slay the Spyre. I say they are wrong. Severly so. Compared to this, slay the spire is thousands of times better, I wish I would have stayed under 2hrs so I could get my money back.

Tried it some more, gets even worse. Whoever designed those units should stay away from game design forever. Some enemy units are impossible to kill straight out and will bankrupt your mana entirely. Some designchoices seem like whoever was responsible just threw something together without the slightest consideration of consequences, allowing units to hit all your units and applying a horrendous debuff while doing so which will make you pay mana upkeep for the unit in question, effectively trapping you in a forever loop of ""well, looks like you can't do sh*t, given you have no mana"". You have NO say in that, e.g. you can't just not pay and sacrifice those units. You just end up with no mana. Grand game design, leading up to ""press button to lose 3 turns"". 

I am NOT saying this game isn't beatable, it's just sh*t as in it isn't fun in the slightest. Every interesting strategy can be countered by a normal monster in the next area, essentially you should be overhauling your deck all the time, and anything YOU want doesn't virtually matter.

If you want a game that plays you more than you play it, by all means, this is for you. If you want a game where your strategy choices actually matter and don't build around knowing every possible enemy unit, effectively trying to counter EVERYTHING that exists, play something else. Anything, really.

This game does everything other deckbuilding games do, except worse, with a few interesting twists, e.g. the tower defense theme, but these are so badly pulled off, it's mind boggling. The longer I played, the more I got the feeling that every mechanic I encountered I know from other games, while the way the game [i]needs[/i] to be played in a very specific way that creates a frustrating illusion of choice. Strategically it is an ocean of possibilities, with a viable handful amount of things you can actually do that could fit in a thimble.

23,Monster Train,70439910,english,"A new take on the Slay the Spire model of game and one that is fresh and unique enough to have all the fun of playing Slay the Spire for the first time again! 

Similar to Slay the Spire, you will progress along a path, though in Monster Train that path is much shorter. One could summarize Slay the Spire in the following way: You do 3x 15 levels, in which there will be 2-3 resting spot campfires and a litany of random events that you choose to encounter based on the path you travel through that level's 15. Speaking in the same way, Monster Train can be described as doing ~9 levels, where each level has 2-3 boons for your deckbuilding and ends with 1 combat, and about every 3rd level is a boss combat.

Based on this, you can imagine that Monster Train is a much shorter game than a run of Slay the Spire. That's absolutely the case, but that's also totally fine.

In Slay the Spire, you choose a class which defines the types of cards you will find, and from the RNG of what you encounter as you climb, you shape a deck. In Monster Train, you choose a primary and secondary Tribe. Your starting deck has a Champion card from your primary, as well as supporting cards from both your primary and secondary. You can mix and match tribes as you see fit to create different synergies in your deckbuilding. Your Champion card does a lot of work for you if you learn how to play it right, and you usually build your deck around the theme of that Champion card. Here's the thing though: The Champion card gets upgraded as you progress and has different trees it can go down. For example, I played one run through with the plant tribe. The three upgrades my champion got, I chose to give him ""When healed, it deals X damage to the front enemy"". By max level, it was doing 60 damage per heal... And I had built my deck with tons and tons of regeneration and cheap healing spells, so that way every turn it was 60, 60, 60, 60, 60, etc. Another build could make it so your Champion has Thorns, so when they are attacked the attacker takes damage. If I built my Champion that way, my deck would have gone a different direction.

Lastly, in Slay the Spire, outside of the challenges you present yourself when getting to The End, each level is pretty much the same as the last time you saw it. In Monster Train, you are offered the opportunity to give the enemy's buffs in exchange for a higher reward, such as hiring a new creature or getting gold. There are also global buffs to enemies if you want an even greater challenge.

It has a fascinating combat system based on floors on a train and spaces available on it. you start with 2 classes, each with a set of specific class cards, and as you play you unlock more classes, and more cards to appear when you play these classes.
Between battles you get to upgrade and alter some cards.
The only shortcoming in my opinion is that overall, it seems like the amount of cards in the game for each class are too little, and with very similar card texts. For example, One card gets spikes when you heal it, another gets damage and health, but overall they are pretty similar: you should heal this card to buff it up over the course of the battle. Same goes to hero upgrades, which you can only choose one of two, they generally fall into what feels like a more ""dps"" buff and a more ""tank"" buff.
The combination of little card text variation and few cards (there are not that many unlockable cards, either) make me worry that this game's replayability may suffer.
There's also a multiplayer battle which gives me anxiety (good thing), however doesn't seem like it affects your progress towards unlocking cards and classes.

I paid $23 CDN and I noticed that the devs jacked up the price to $29 ( I guess because of the popularity + Steam summer sale is coming up in a week ). This is a $10-$15 game at best.

There are 5 different colour decks ( most are locked ). You have to grind with a red-green deck to unlock a third colour deck ( purple). Out of those three colours, you can only effectively tank with one of them, which leaves the other two colours as support. Since the bosses have hundreds or thousands of hit points, your build is *extremely* limited.

The Roguelike aspects relate to you praying to RNGesus for a decent starting hand, overpowered trinkets or key card draws.

When I lose, I roll my eyes. When I win, it's mostly dumb luck or powerful trinkets; a lot of the time, I don't feel like I accomplished the win through my skill. Wins consist of the same rehashed strategy from the last run.

Part of the game's unbalance revolves around you grinding for hours, for card unlocks ( the other part is poor boss design and a lack of synergy between colours ). If you don't want to grind then you are SOL?

The game is just phenomenal. Many games since have tried to emulate and mimic Slay the Spire as it seemingly has set the bar to a new level within the Deck-building Rogue-Like genre that is so sensationally high that I never thought it would be possible to raise it further.

Until now.

Monster Train has many elements from Slay the Spire which is why you see so many comparisons and correlations to it. However Monster Train's unique take on the genre from its own very rich lore and incredible visuals to the cards and bosses you run into is just a blast to play. From the ""professionals"" (masochists?) that play the game on an incredibly high level at the highest difficulty to someone who has never before experienced the genre, Monster Train is truly an amazing game to play right from the beginning. The amount of possibilities that lie within its system of ""take one clan as your primary clan and another as an ally"" and all the various abilities and combinations that follow allow for a truly deep level of complexity yet introduces the player slowly and subtly enough that it never really feels overwhelming to learn.

The upgrade system seems better overall though a bit more RNG heavy than Slay the Spire. The difficulty can scale to truly masochistic levels so if you're someone who enjoys a challenge this game has that too.

Its biggest faults are that sometimes you just aren't offered what you need to win the run. And while that feels bad, it isn't so disappointing that it angers me. I usually just say something to myself along the lines of ""Guess I'll see where the next deck takes me.""

And that's the greatest thing about this game. Seeing what heights you can take your deck to soar at... or plummet below the gates of Hell itself.

Welcome to Monster Train! - the game where Hell itself has already been frozen over and your job is to reignite what's left of the Pyre at the center of the nine layers of Hell. Don't let the Angelic forces stop you though - they're here to snuff out what little hope remains. Will you succeed in reigniting the very Pyre of Hell? Or will Hell remain a frozen wasteland for all eternity? Only you can decide.

However, MT has put in a lot of effort into innovating and changing up the mechanics and various processes to make it feel solidly unique. Even a lot of the common features are tweaked in some way to present a different kind of challenge. Difficulty wise, I find it slightly easier than Slay the Spire, but that's because I think MT is balanced in such a way that you have an easier time creating a viable deck without having to rely on RNG for a certain rare card or item to define the deck like Slay the Spire. It's less about ""letting the game decide what build your going to work towards"" and more on incorporating the various choices into your run. That said, there are a couple ""build defining"" items that do end up changing things like StS.

I bought the game blind after hearing that it was pretty similar to Slay the Spire, and I feel like it was well worth the price for the amount of entertainment I've already gotten out of it.

The diversity in strategy is a lot of fun to mess around with and the unpredictability of events and loot make each run feel unique in its own way. You are often times faced with difficult and meaningful choices that can really make or break the success of your run and I really appreciate having to make those choices so often in every run I do. I hope we get to see more clans added in the future to keep the game feeling fresh and expand the roster of potential clan combinations. 

The multiplayer seems like it needs the most work. I like the idea of racing other players in a run but I also feel like putting players on a timer kind of defeats a lot of the fun and purpose, at least for me. My choices feel less meaningful when I have to race against the clock. I don't get to plan as efficiently as I normally would but I can also see how that is part of the draw to a mode like this. I'm not quite sure what my ideal multiplayer mode would be but maybe it can be some sort of co-op where you and a friend get to both participate in a run and develop a strategy together. Or maybe you use the idea of competing vs. other players like in the current multiplayer mode but instead have players battle each other rather than racing against the clock. It could be similar to something like Auto Chess where players battle each other with their current decks and then have the upgrade rounds like in a regular single player run. 

Either way, the game as a whole is great and has a lot of potential to keep on expanding and progressing with future updates. I think they can take multiplayer in so many different directions and I'll be eagerly awaiting to see what they come up with.

33,Monster Train,70368597,english,"[h1] TLDR: If you like Slay the Spire, buy Monster Train.[/h1] 

Monster Train is the best deckbuilding roguelike I've played, after Slay the Spire. The gameplay is a fusion of ""summoning followers"" style card games (MtG, Hearthstone), deckbuilding roguelikes (StS), and tower defense Games. 


[h1] PROS:[/h1] 
[*] [b]A lot of combinations.[/b] There's 5 classes, and in each run you have one as the main and one as the sub. So there's 20 different combination of ways to play with each classes' unique and interesting mechanics. After almost 10 hours, I haven't even tried the last class yet, as there is so many combinations to explore. 

[*] [b]Much less ""grindy"" combat.[/b] In StS, some of the beginning rounds can be absolutely boring to play. Monster Train solves this by having every fight have a boss at the end, and reducing the amount of fights needed to win.

[*] [b]The UI.[/b] Everything is clear, everything can be learned from the UI. You don't even need to do maths, the UI does it for you. One of the best game UIs I have ever seen.

[/list]

[h1] CONS:[/h1] 
 [*] [b]Balancing issues.[/b] Due to the insane amount of combinations, this was to be expected. The game is still new as of the time I'm writing this, so maybe the devs would work on the balancing. Holdover, Multistrike are two of the upgrades I find absolutely broken. One of the most broken card imo  is ""Unleash the Wildwood"", a 0 cost green card that heals everyone to full. At the first glance, I assumed it consumed the card. 

[*] [b]Weird Difficulty Curve.[/b] Imo, the early game is more difficult than the late game. Most of the time when you reach the Seraph (final boss), your deck is strong enough to beat him easily. However, in the earlier battles, you sometimes take so much damage in the first few battles, and it usually is completely out of one's control. Due to summoned creatures not recycled into the discard, some games, especially in the early game, can be over when your champion dies. 

[*] [b] Randomness affects runs too much.[/b] Compared to StS, there are much fewer chances to add cards into the deck, so the likelihood of the run getting ruined by bad rng is higher. Starting from Covenant 1 (this game's version of Ascension), you get random cards added to the deck at the start of runs. That can ruin the run, or make it really easy. Also some events are busted, like the make 5 duplicates of a card event. 

[*] [b]The sound[/b] It can be really annoying for the boss fights. Maybe add an instant end effect.

There's already a lot said about the positive points of this game: A lot of content, polished presentation, good music and smooth gameplay, toolbox tips are appropriate and cleverly placed, etc. etc.
But speaking about representation, what I miss is more personality. Everything looks so clean and unimaginative. Something like Slay the Spire had enemies that looked like some kid's drawing but that's what made them memorable and fun. And the tower defense nature of Monster Train doesn't help making any enemy type stand out. In fact, I can't remember how a single unit looked or sounded even after 20 hours of playing. But I will always remember SNEK from slay the spire.
The second point I didn't really like with this game is balance. In my first 5 runs or so I won 4 times with insanely imbalanced decks. Granted, because of my experience with other deck building games I was at an advantage, but it still felt way too easy. And yes, I understand that the higher covenant levels is where the game gets hard but it's still a strange concept to have you beat the game so easily and repeat the same thing making it difficult. That's also contra intuitive for the unlocking of new cards.

Getting an artist to come up with something that's unique, aesthetically pleasant and readable is difficult. I won't expect it. So could I just have all the visuals replaced with geometric shapes and text, please? That would turn this around.

Also, we're on the wrong side here! You're supposed to kill the demons, not help them!  hasn't DOOM taught you anything?

58,Monster Train,70326601,english,"The only things I could think to want from this game are: Workshop support, private multiplayer lobbies, PvP where one side has a heaven side deck, more factions/bosses/enemies to fight (more varied fights across different runs), and a longer run with more stages (either by default, or an extended mode). Workshop and longer runs are my top two right now, but I'm sure more varied runs will rise heavily the more I play.

But notice how all of these things are basically just MORE Monster Train.

I was HARDCORE HOOKED on Slay the Spire, and that's the most obvious comparison here -some godly mix of Hearthstone and Slay the Spire with a dash of Darkest Dungeon- but this game has a secret ace to play. Power levels. Like DBZ style. Let me explain.....

 Upgrades aren't small, rather they take 1 damage 1 health cards to 11 damage 11 health, or let your big damage heavy hitter get to attack a second time per turn. This means every run is more about thinking of a synergy, and what cards to make OP, and how to use the less heavy hitting ones you haven't put upgrades into. Now, I'm sure this seems like just upgrade strong cards do high damage at first blush, so let me talk about a lower damage card for a bit. (Also for scale, an example of a stronger card is a beast that can be upgraded in a way that it does 50 damage per turn and has 75 health).

Those 1 damage 1 health cards? Imps. They do almost no damage, but give buffs when you initially play their card, you can sacrifice them with some spell cards in exchange for powerful effects, and they take the minimum possible space on a lane. So do you use them to buff other creatures and sacrifice them to cast powerful spells, or do you buff them all and fill a lane with a bunch of attack instances to deal with shields? Or do you instead leave one on each lane and use spells and artifacts to reuse their summon effect? Do you use fireballs on the enemies to clear out the weaker backline enemies, or do you use them on your imps after they use their summon effect to clear the lane for more space? Do you combine upgrade imps not for more damage and health, but for zero mana cast? Do you combine that with a deck that lets you draw lots of cards every turn? Or do you focus on just imps that give you energy when they're summoned as a way to farm mana for big creatures, and then clear them out with sacrifice cards that let you draw MORE cards AND give you mana? ORRRR, do you completely ignore all of that and instead make them take up more space but do damage in the 20-30 range and instead expand your lane size to use 3 of them, so you have mid damage/health units that also have the advantage of buffs on play AND you can use occasional spell cards with them for maximum balance and maximum flexibility? And this is just all synergies with one type of card. Did I mention I only have 3 hours on this game, didn't use imps almost at all, and still could pick up on these possible ways to use them? Now that's some good game design right there.

All of those synergies have different levels of upgrade investment needed into the imp cards themselves, vs other cards you have, so some runs you might hyper focus on them, and others you might upgrade a lot of things just a little, or specialize heavily in just a few types of cards. The number of viable ways to invest in your deck is a little staggering for how intuitive it is.

This all adds up to give that power level feeling I was talking about; between every battle you will drastically increase what your units can do and how you can use them. Notice I didnt say drastically increase health or damage, because while that's pretty universally true, that's not what makes this special. What DOES make it special, is realizing that when your plant monster unit goes from 3dmg 3 times to 23 dmg 3 times, they're now useful for not only breaking shields and bleeding damage through a small enemy, they're also now good for dealing with larger health single enemies, AND dealing with long lines of small enemies above 5hp (5 is very common for small enemies). This means they not only do more damage per turn, but are far more flexible in how you can use them to deal with the unique threat posed by your current enemy's traits.

So, how do they balance against these massive increases if you're not scaling enemy health up by nearly as much? Well, they throw more things to deal with at you. It's brilliant. Seriously, like I'm a little envious of the execution and I don't even make games brilliant. You have more synergies you can make on the fly, and more raw damage to take out enemies, so they give you more enemies which poses different modifiers, and on different lanes at once, and with shields, and armor, and bombs, and debuff casters, and etc. You're constantly given these little puzzles to deal with, expanding in number and threat, but also more tools to deal with them.

So why does this feel like DBZ power levels? Because every single time you upgrade something between fights you can think of off the top of your head how many problems that unit or spell can now solve for you. You feel more capable. 1 damage to a 1 health enemy feels the same as 10 damage to a 10 health enemy after big number syndrome wears off, but being able to kill 3 enemies of a bigger weight class than before, while enemies begin giving you debuffs on death, that feels like getting stronger and taking a threat of a different scale from before.

My only real concern, is if they do end up extending runs, how they'll manage dealing with scaling considering it is designed in such a deliberate and careful way. But honestly, considering how clever this design is, and how smart all the shop upgrades are, and how clever and original a lot of the artifacts effects are, I'm nearly positive they can handle it.

TL;DR It's been a very long time since I've been so impressed by a game's design. If you like Hearthstone, Darkest Dungeon, and Slay the Spire, or even JUST Slay the Spire, I really highly recommend this game to you.

Final note, at the time of writing I only have 3 hours in the game, but I have beaten a run. So it may get too repetitive or reveal itself to be a little too easy with more time, but honestly if those do turn out to be its sins I'd still consider it worth a buy.",1591353208,1591353208,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,536,17,509,0,176,1591404213,,

Monster train combines elements of rogue-lites, deck builders and tower defence game and serves it in a intricately woven package of pure strategic fun. 

This game will pull you in and keep you engaged through its variety of class combos and enemy variations. You will have to learn to adapt to the run every time, since the bosses have unique mechanics that can counter your decks needing you to build your decks around them.

The progression in this game feels awesome, from the gold card collecting from beating the game on high difficulty levels to the subtle unlocking of powerful cards which open up whole new deck archetypes with each level up. Having played a significant amount of this game however, I have discovered all the combos it has to offer. But the journey of that discovery was well paced and enjoyable.

I was hesitant at first, because my first impression was that this game was a silly cheap spire knockoff which had that cheap mobile game vibe. But the more I played it, the more I started to realize that this game has a lot of depth to it, you can do a lot of interesting combos and synergies, and there is a real incentive to calculate lines very deep, because even a small decision can lead to a very big impact. I actually enjoy calculating lines more in this game than spire, because there are so many cool synergies and different factors to consider. Although some people might not like that you have to do a lot of arithmetic involving two-digit and three-digit numbers in this game, I would say it's easier to calculate in this game than in spire, since you don't have to worry about rounding up or down (no percentage buffs/debuffs). 

Also, the monsters are very cute! 

I'd recommend this game to pretty much anyone. I'm about 100 hours in and have cleared the highest ascension level, but it never ceases to amaze me how many different ways there are to win. In spire, there are only a few ways to win, and pretty much every game you play, you win in the same ways...get a bunch of strength, poison, frosts, whatever. In monster train there are so many different ways you can create synergies and win the game, and so many times I was surprised that I was able to pull off a victory using a weird strategy that I hadn't thought of, when my main strategy failed. It's a very cool game and you really have a lot of freedom to experiment with various cards in creative ways.

Is it totally similar in game type as Slay the Spire? Sure is!

I've just finished Covenant 25 (the highest difficulty level) for the first time and saw the credits roll - with an awesome soundtrack that made me fully watch the credits. Though I'm far from done playing it. Going by my experience with Slay the Spire, it has yet many many many more hours to offer before I grow bored of it.

If you enjoyed Slay the Spire, or if you think you'd enjoy a rogue-like deck building game - you'll quite likely be getting a lot of enjoyment out of this game.

I wholeheartedly recommend it.

(I'm not saying its perfect - there may be some balance issues, but there have already been patches and the devs keep working on it. But it sure does offer a lot of fun gameplay.)",1591228904,1591228904,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,106,5,26786,415,5715,1601996973,,

[*] The two starting decks probably won't be up to everyone's tastes. I personally quite dislike Awaken playstyle, and it takes a bit to get to Remnant [i](My favorite!)[/i] and Umbra.

You'll live longer and can rack up to 400+ DMG per hit if you stack your shit right and proper. Could probably go higher but most bosses keel over after a few hits like these.

3,Monster Train,70249182,english,"So overall I'm positive on this game - if anyone has played strategy card games (Slayer of the Spire is a popular one) then you'll probably like this game.  First, a bit of my own experience... I think I've played almost every version of strategy card game out there (a few of my favorites include StS, Meteorfall, Dream Quest, Guild of Dungeoneers).  Heck, I even used to play the grandfather of these games, ""Magic, the Gathering"".
So here goes:
Building crazy combos - that's what this game is built to do (you either build something so crazy that nothing can handle it, or you die... seems like there's not a lot of middle ground in this game because of how enemies scale)
Build variability (IE how many different combos actually work?) - I don't know yet... there's a total of 5 different factions that can technically be combined 20 ways, but in actuality it will play more like 12.5 (Example: Awoken/Hellhorn will play almost exactly like Hellhorn/Awoken, but with a different special unit).  Out of these variables I assume that each will have at least one effective combo you can build.

Play variability - right now this is the only real downside to the game.  You fight pretty much the same monsters... every run.  Do they have slightly different abilities?  Sure, but slight enough that you can virtually ignore them and they'll have very little impact.  Can you scale them harder?  Yes you can - the game scales effectively using a difficulty modifier similar to StS.  However harder monsters don't really impact the feel of the game.   All of the upgrades feel the same... they enable slightly different combos, but there really isn't THAT much variability in unit and spell upgrades.

TLDR: 
The great - Deck variability and combo generation
The good - graphics and story
The mediocre - playthrough variability w/monsters and similar rewards
If this game never adds some combination of new monsters, new upgrades, or new train routes I'll probably lose interest and move on.  It will be a game with great mechanics, but not enough fight variability to matter.  If they add a bit of playthrough variability this could beat out Slay the Spire.  Still I've played for ~10 real hours so feel like I got my money's worth either way.

6,Monster Train,70248374,english,"I don't usually write reviews but I'm only 5 hours in and feel that this game deserves all the praise it can get. To get it out of the way, Monster Train definitely took a lot of ideas from Slay the Spire. That's how all creative processes work though. That's why ""Doom-clones"" are now referred to as FPS games. 

It's impossible to not make the comparison to Slay the Spire, but that's also what I like so much about this game. While Monster Train does borrow a lot from StS, it puts a significant spin on the StS mechanics to the point where it's definitely it's own thing and I would argue that it's better than StS. Of course a lot of this is subjective, but here's are some things that I think Monster Train does better than StS:

- Presentation: The overall presentation, including the music, graphics, animation. It just feels much more lively than StS. Even things like the hit animations having the characters actually move toward each other makes each turn feel more impactful. And it ever grows old for you, there is an easy-to-access ""Speed"" button where you can fast-forward through the animations.

- Gameplay: One of the biggest differences, and probably the most subjective opinion, is that MT makes you feel more powerful than StS. By the end of StS if you get the right cards you're going to be a powerhouse, but unless you get super unlucky or play really poorly you're all but guaranteed to become a powerhouse in MT by even mid-game. When buffs are things like ""+25 damage"" and you buff a card that previously had 1 dmg, it massively shifts the importance of that card. You also realize that 25 damage isn't a ton in the later levels, but those buffs just seem super impactful.

Speaking of buffs, the system in MT is much deeper than StS. In StS while you can upgrade each card, every card has it's own upgrade and only one upgrade. In MT you can purchase various spell or unit buffs and assign two (or more with the right artifact) to each card. Many times in StS, for example, I was hoping an upgrade would decrease cast cost by 1 but instead it added 2 damage. In MT you have much more flexibility in how to buff your cards.

The ""4 floor"" setup of MT inherently adds a layer of complexity that StS is lacking. Not only is it like there are three mini-games going on at once, but you quickly learn how powerful cards can that move units to different floors. You can use this to move a powerful unit to a floor that is otherwise full, or maybe you move that unit up a floor to be behind a tankier unit so they have time to do more damage.

Just having more than one unit on your side makes things feel a lot more active than StS. There is a lot more going on at one time in MT, but the amazing thing is that this added complexity only enhances the game. Even though I have more choices to make each turn, the choices are almost always fairly clear so this hasn't added a lot of extra confusion to the game.

In conclusion, I will revist StS again I'm sure but I've been having too much fun with MT to even consider it at the moment. If you like StS, you will very likely love Monster Train.",1591205252,1591205252,TRUE,1,0,0.523809552,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,554,1,953,0,334,1591939142,,

Almost 20 hours in so far, haven't gotten bored yet.  That's much more than many single player games for me usually.

I really enjoy two of the later unlocked factions, the umbra and the remnant, I wish more games could be this creative.   I really hope they add more factions to this game.

The game is pretty varied and interesting, but I'd probably max out around 100 hours.  Nice for a single player game, but I still feel like its missing some levels of variation to make it a game you sink hundreds/thousands of hours into.

The music is good, but kinda depressing, and to hear over and over it gets kinda annoying. I get it, we're in hell, but it gets kinda old the 50th time.

I wish there were different run layouts.  You do the same boss fights every time, but the boss might have different buffs.  It would be interesting to unlock different paths with different bosses.  Maybe leading to different progression or item choices. 

The game is kinda easy for a veteran player of the genre.  Most of my runs end in success, but I'm only at rank 7 or so out of 25 so far.  This will probably balance out as I get higher in rank, but right now I think the game is slightly too easy.

I really enjoy the primary and support clan game mechanic.   You start with 2 clans and you can unlock up to 3 more.  The third gets unlocked pretty early, but is seems like the remaining clans may take some time.  Each clan has a champion that you start with and during each game you can periodically upgrade this card to add additional buffs.  After every battle, you have the choice to pick the left or right path to continue on to the next set of battles.  Each path lets you perform specific tasks like upgrading cards, restore health, etc.

Once you enter battle, you have 3 floors to defend.  Each round, heaven's ""monsters"" spawn at the bottom floor and work their way up to your pyre.  Each round, if a monster isn't killed, it moves up to the next floor (with a few exceptions).  Once the monster reaches your pyre on the fourth floor, it begins to damage the pyre.  The pyre can attack back, tho, and will make quick work of normal monsters.  Boss monsters, on the other hand, will usually wipe out the pyre.

[h1]Overview[/h1] 
A  turn-based card game, roguelike, tower defense. This game has quite a few genres crammed into it, and it only takes the best parts of each of these genres. The game is then supported by 

[h1]Game Breakdown[/h1]
[h3] Gameplay 🎮[/h3]
 
[u]Clans & Clan Heroes[/u]
The fist screen that will greet any player at the beginning of a run is the clan selection screen. There are five clans in all but only two are available at the beginning so as to not overburden the player with mechanics. The rest are easy to unlock and can be done so just by playing the game. When on the screen, the player must pick two clans. The first clan is the main clan and provides their clan hero to the player’s deck. The supporting clan only supplies their cards. 
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2117099244
Every clan combination is viable and there is an award on the stats screen every time a clan combo win is achieved. Clan heroes are strong units that can be buffed three times throughout a run at special upgrade stations, but they are still mortal and must be protected as they provide a lot of power during combat.

[u]The simple part of combat[/u]
At the beginning of each turn, the player is given a certain amount of “Ember,” which is the resource that is used to play cards. Combat is both simple and yet complex. The player summons units onto one of three floors. Each creature or hero has an attack and a defense stat. These two parties fight one another by hitting each other and then the heroes go up a floor unless they are dead or are under the rooted debuff. It is for this reason that it is so important to have all three floors defended heavily. This is the game’s simplicity at its core. 
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2117096944

[u]The complexity of combat[/u]
Where things get crazy are the various unit abilities, spells, and bosses. Unit abilities are varied and often powerful. One such example is the ability “multistrike,” which allows a creature to attack more that once. This is great when it is combined with a creature that applies a stack of a status effect or if a creature has a really high attack power in general. There are many other unit abilities, and some are hero only, but they make damage calculation difficult at times if one had to do them manually. Thankfully, the game has a great quality of life feature where it shows the damage that will be dealt to a creature or hero and if it will be enough damage to cause it to die. It makes this roguelike quite a bit more accessible as it allows for some trial and error instead of pure min/max math outside of the game. Spells are crazy cards that also mix up the gameplay in a variety of ways. Some spells are simply damage against a certain enemy or the front enemy based upon the card’s description. Other cards can buff creatures, create debuffs, and even drop enemies down entire floors. Finally, bosses appear at the end of every battle, with the final battle occurring at level 8. The three main bosses have different abilities that are randomly chosen each run. It depletes the feeling of sameness that is a pitfall that some rougelikes fall into. Other bosses, that are more like mini-bosses, instead have risk and reward powers for their hero units. One such example is that the non-boss enemies may have 10 extra damage. The reward for completing this challenge can either be gold or a random artifact. These challenges are randomized as well per run. After every battle is the time to choose which cards to gain and how to spend the player’s hard-earned gold.

[u]Shops and track choice [/u]
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2117097601
There are three shop types in this game. The first shop type is the unit buffing shop. Players are given the chance to spend gold to gain upgrade stones which can be socketed into any creature. Creatures start out with two sockets, but this can be upgraded with artifacts, and when all the sockets are used up, there isn’t any way to remove them. The same type of system occurs with spells, but they get different buffs for the most part. 

[u]Artifacts[/u]
Artifacts change up the game heavily and can change entire game mechanics. The demon horn, for example, makes it so that any Ember that isn’t used after a turn is saved for the next round. This would be perfect for a deck with mostly free cards, but also some high cost spells or creatures that will annihilate one’s enemies.

[u]Difficulty[/u]
Once all run combinations are completed, it is time to try for true mastery with the Covenant system. This allows players to fight tougher enemies, and the rewards is a nice golden border around the cards a player wins with; besides bragging rights as well.

[h3]📚 Story 📚[/h3]
The story is a bit simplistic, but still gives good context to the basis of the entire game. Hell’s fire has been extinguished and it is up to clans of Hell to form an uneasy alliance to return their homes to back to the way it used to be while simultaneously returning the balance of Heaven and Hell.

[h3]🎧 Sound 🎧[/h3]
Monster Train’s sound design is crisp and satisfying. The sound effects relay a sense of strength in each attack or spell used. The painful reactions of the player’s monsters and the enemy heroes also relay this power. The music relays the game’s theme of the bad games being good this time. The music has a choral and orchestral feeling, but in a haunting and corrupted manner. This reflects the corruption of power found in the heavenly beings.

[h3]📺 Graphics 📺 [/h3]
The graphics are two-point-five-dimensional. The creatures and heroes are two-dimensional in appearance, but they are on a three-dimensional background. The creature and card graphics use a computer-based hand-drawn graphical style that fits nicely against modeled backgrounds. Every card art is also animated with intricate detail.

[h3]⌨ Controls ⌨[/h3]
The game’s control scheme is simplistically brilliant. It is a drag and drop interface with only a few clickable buttons. This game could run perfectly with a touch screen if one has a Windows tablet.

[u]Easy to Alt-Tab[/u]: [b]Yes[/b]
This game runs so well and I never had any bugs or crashes. This game can also nearly run on a toaster due to its insanely low spec requirements.

[h3]💰 Price to Content Ratio 💰[/h3]
I have played this game for close to 18 hours now and I feel like I have barely scratched the surface. I recently unlocked the fifth clan, but I haven’t unlocked all of the cards for the first clan yet. Every unlock diversifies the game perfectly allowing for nearly limitless builds. There are also 26 difficulty levels that will keep any play busy for thousands of hours. This game is a steal for $25 dollars.

-A great card game and one I'm absolutely addicted to! I'm a huge fan of build around strategies that break the game wide open. Such as when I got a bunch of Offering cards, while also having a 0 cost ""discard your hand"" holdover card. My favorite champion probably being the Stygian.
-The Lore. Something I'd love to see more of. An interesting universe built up that we know so little of. Each unique circle of hell having its own little flavor. The world giving you just enough of an idea about how the world works without giving too much away.

The Stuff I Want but Won't Really Mind if they Aren't Added
-Branching paths and new enemies. There are branching paths, but I want these paths to have new enemies as well. I like the idea of being able to choose what enemies you'll be fighting by branching paths. Picking enemies that you will have an advantage over, at the cost of getting a different reward that you may or may not want.

36,Monster Train,70201720,english,"Monster Train is a Deck Building Rogue Lite, bearing some similarities to Slay the Spire and other Deck Builders. 

Aesthetically it is very pleasing with pretty visuals and impactful audio. The general plot is that you are a denizen of hell, taking the last remaining pyre to the frozen heart to reignite it. This pyre serves as the health points for your run (situated on the top floor of your 3 floor train), and should it be reduced to zero your run is over. Your run will last for 8 battles with overworld sequences separating these. 

You start the game by choosing a guild and a sub guild; these have their own cards and strategies which in most cases will compliment each other. To begin with you have access to two, eventually accumulating 5 with a handy option to randomise your choices for some extra challenge. Your primary guild also decides your champion, a 0 cost unit that can be upgraded to become a powerhouse. 

The game is broken into the overworld, where you choose your route between battles, and the battles themselves. The route splits offer run-duration upgrades for units and spells, regeneration for your pyre, artifacts, troop recruitment points and other more interesting points such as card duplication and removal. Some of these are immediately more useful than others, such as removing two vanilla troops or spells from your deck at a single stop. You make your initial choices of starting artifact and champion upgrade at the start of a run and then you're on to your first battle. 

You're treated to a splash screen which displays the enemies you will face, and importantly their Keywords. Keywords include such traits as incant (gains buffs when spells are cast on the same floor) and sweep (unit will apply its damage to all of your units on the floor when it attacks rather than just the frontal unit). The game will also offer you the chance to increase the challenge of the battle at this point, and offer rewards for doing so. These are on a per battle basis thankfully, as your composition may not always be suited for the challenge, for instance an attack heavy deck may not be well suited to take on an enemy force where each unit has damage reflecting thorns. 

The battles as previously mentioned take place across 3 floors, with a fourth floor being your pyre. Each room has a population capacity, with creatures having a size stat. Your job is to prevent enemies from ascending the train to the pyre by placing monsters strategically so that they combo with one another on the same floor. Typical card game mechanics apply here, such as draw amount and the energy reserves you use to cast each card, with cards having an energy cost typically ranging from 1-4 with some exceptions. 

With the knowledge that the enemy troops will generally attack yours first you must weigh up the outcome of the battle, and then intervene by dropping stronger creatures, killing enemies with harmful spells or healing and bolstering your own units' attributes. after each scuffle, surviving enemies will ascend a floor. Certain rules allow enemies to ascend faster, but if they make it to your pyre they will begin to damage it. 

Thankfully your pyre takes none of their nonsense and has a sweeping and very damaging attack it will use once they have finished their assault, but this is a last resort and to be avoided if possible. After several waves, the boss will spawn. 

Bosses will attack the same floor relentlessly rather than ascending after a single round of attack. This means that Your floors need to be strong enough to take a sustained assault while also dealing enough damage and debuffs to hinder the boss. Certain bosses will be present before they begin their climb, laying traps and augmenting their units before making their final approach which leads to some great and flavoursome battles. Should the boss kill all of your minions on a floor, they will seal the floor in ice and render it unusable for the remainder of the battle. 

Killing the boss will take you to the rewards screen, with points deducted for pyre damage taken and every floor the boss successfully ascended. You are then offered a selection of cards from each of your guilds which you can opt to take or, importantly, leave. 

The joy in the game comes from finding silly combos, finding that way to perpetually feed sacrificial creatures to your tank, increasing its power every turn or stacking hundreds of stacks of life draining frostbite onto an enemy. The guilds are varied and each is genuinely a joy to play as. Finding the synergy between each is a lot of fun, especially considering the vast amount of card and artifact unlocks that factor into this endeavour. Optional ""Covenant"" levels add self appointed penalties which make runs more challenging, ensuring a challenge no matter your level. 

I can wholeheartedly recommend this game to anyone who wants a game that is accessible but has a learning curve that is not afraid to punish poor synergistic choices. As an example, I had a unit that would bring a unit back from the dead every turn. I ended up with a perpetual cycle of him bringing a morsel, (a small sacrificial creature typically destined to be eaten at the end of the turn) back to life instead of a worthwhile creature simply by playing the cards in that order without thinking. Well worth the retail price point for the depth, and the love that has clearly gone into it.

Hell Rush, the multiplayer mode, is also very fun and a surprisingly fresh approach.  You are placed in a lobby with a handful of others and much work against strict time limits to clear each combat encounter with the same initial setup as your competitors.  If you die, you are dropped from the competition.  If you run out of time, the combat will auto-resolve from that point on, meaning you can play no more cards and must hope your units last on their own.

It doesn't have as many fights as Slay the spire, but mainly due to the fact that the battles in this game go on for much longer and have a round based system to it. There are a variety of options with different clans to mix and match each run with which is amazing, each offering their own unique buffs, pros and cons. You can see all the cards and features you have unlocked in a reward book too and gives you good incentive to keep replaying to unlock the rest. 

Multiplayer is basically: Challenge friends for high scores, a daily climb and custom challenge where you can create a template and send this to people to try and complete.

Amazing game, this might be the best Rougelite/like deckbuilder this year and since STS! 

In the future I would love to see some new clans, locations, enemy types, bosses and maybe some new game modes too!

The biggest gripe would be balance and variety. At least one of the classes feels much more limited than the others (hellbourne), and often times there seems to be fairly limited routes to true success for each class. As well, the enemies scale a bit too fast vs your monsters for my liking.

That said, there is a lot of depth here and what's already here is worth the price -- especially if there's a good sale. 

For those that like Slay the Spire, this is kind of a no brainer. Definitely a step forward for that style of game, though not quite the masterpiece that Slay the Spire is.

While the deckbuilding aspect is familiar and similar to StS, the developers have perfectly combined it with the Tower Defense genre, including Unit cards which can be placed on the board (train)

56,Monster Train,70154524,english,"As a big fan of Slay the Spire that got everything I felt I could get out of that game, Monster Train has breathed new life into the concept. By adding more variety and randomness to the start of the run, it makes the early game less tedious. The roguelike system encourages defeat, but an interesting beginning helps to offset the sting of failure. Unlike Slay the Spire, your deck consists of a combination of two colors instead of one at a time, and even when you pick the same pair, the sheer number of cards and playstyles prevents your runs from feeling samey even when you try to make it that way.

You can expect the average Monster Train run to last about as long as your average Slay the Spire run. ~1-2 hours if you win. Slay the Spire's game loop involves a large number of short battles with a few boss fights, while Monster Train has eight main battles that each have their own boss, with three of them being big bosses that act as the equivalent of Slay the Spire's bosses. The big bosses are the same every time, but they can have different abilities that change how you fight them. In terms of the other enemies, you won't know what you're dealing with until you start the battle, so you'll have to adapt with the cards and artifacts you have to avoid the tide suddenly turning. This game is very good at making you feel invincible and suddenly sweeping the rug out from under you by throwing enemies at you that counter your build. 

If you're looking for replay value and difficulty, look no further. In addition to the crazy amount of card and artifact combinations you can have in a given run, there are 26 difficulty levels that keep pushing your abilities further, the equivalent of Slay the Spire's Ascension system.  The game has no easy mode, so make sure you're prepared to fail quite a bit as you learn the game. If you've got some experience with Slay the Spire, you should find many aspects about this game very familiar, but expect a moderate learning curve nonetheless. This game adds onto Slay the Spire's mechanics just as much as it copies them.

53,Monster Train,70116399,english,"        So long and sweet of it is this is a Slay the Spire clone with much more color and multiple units to choose from. 
The game has a rather nice soundtrack which is honestly wasted here because most people I imagine just listen to their own music while playing and this OST could have been paired with a game that has an actual story. 
 
        The aspect however that isn't getting enough attention I believe is...how there really is very little challenge/variety in bosses. I personally found the boss encounters bland and repetitive. I beat my first run after about 30 minutes into the game and was disappointed there wasn't an 'end boss' grind or something to at least aspire to. Perhaps there is something I'm missing but...if I can beat the game in under 30 minutes what incentive is there to keep playing? Ideally I could unlock all the units and spells but to me, at least, the thrill would be a foe too hard to beat. 

     Naturally you can increase the difficulty higher and higher but somehow this level of challenge feels artificial. Imagine playing baseball and always beating the minor league teams and you want to one day win a championship in a large arena with a crowd cheering but instead of facing new and complicated challenges you just fight the minor leagues over and over with sandbags on your ankles. Yes it is harder but it is a difficulty that is self-inflicted and therefor robs you of some of your agency. 

       All this aside I felt the music, animation and user interface to be top notch. If you enjoyed Slay the Spire and want more of the same kind of grind then give this a try.

Favorably compared to Slay the Spire for being a similarly well-constructed deck building roguelike, but blended with a sort of Darkest Dungeon Lite flavor to the combat. Ramping difficulty is cool. Choosing a main and support race is really cool. Having a champion for each one is cool but I wish there were more than one for each race, though the choices in building them is arguably enough. Maybe one more choice of upgrade for each one? I've only seen 3 different ones at max.

Could use more enemy variety (mostly bosses, two runs and you've seen them all). Again, the variety is a little padded with modifiers, but another couple bosses would round it out nicely. Slightly longer runs would be nice too. But then, it may be that they just seem short because I'm enjoying it so much, as the runs tend to be around an hour long each. Still, it can feel like you're just getting the ball rolling on a build by the time you reach the final boss, or you may have duped 5 strong, multi-attacking, sweeping monsters with front-liners to tank for them within the first few lucky rounds. Such is the fickle will of the cards.

In any case, this is a great initial release, and scratches an itch I forgot I had.

The main premise of the game sees you riding a train which is being hunted by Angels trying to extinguish your pyre which is the last remaining piece of hellfire in existence.

Much like in slay the Spire you play a series of fights but the difference here is that as opposed to controlling a single character you control a clan of Monsters and place units on different floors of your train much like Plants vs Zombies. as well as your units you also have access to spells and artefacts much in the same way. There is a good mix of different types of classes to play These include The hell horns which are an aggressive damaged Focus class, The awoken which generally consists of large creatures and healing abilities, The Stygian Guard which has weak Monsters that creates spell weakness to allow you to use Direct damage spells, The Umbra a fun to play interesting class where you create small Monsters called morsels that get eaten by your larger Monsters to buff them and finally The melting remnant an equally innovative class that uses strong units that died after a few turns that you have to resurrect in order to get the most value. what is key, however, is that as well as choosing your main class you can also choose an allied class that you can access the main pool of cards. this gives lots of different combinations and lots of different types of strategies that can be concocted throughout the game.

As you play through the main campaign you unlock artefacts upgrade units in much the same way as you would expect but the fresh design and changes really make this stand out as the first deck building Road light worth owning since Slay the Spire.

As well as the excellent single player mode there are also a number of Multiplayer modes such as timed battles daily challenges and the ability to make custom challenges that you can share online.

Monster Train could have been an easy cash to grab but as it stands monster train is one of the best games I have played so far in 2020 and is the game that has restored my faith in the Indie scene.

You can't really just ""play"" if that makes sense so you have to learn combos and what works well together to get in the higher covenants.

[h1] Short Review [/h1]
It is very fun and explosive. The first impression is really great when you're exploring the demon factions and see the numbers go up. Monster Train doesn't concern itself with OP builds and let's you go ham.

But it is not really the thinking man's game like Slay the Spire, or Hearthstone, or, which i thought it was similar in party building sense: Darkest Dungeon. It does not have the same depth, or synergies. 
Unlike Hearthstone, you hardly have any units you can reliably make use of, as you can't really hold onto your hand. 
It is also more difficult to build a deck as reliable as Slay the Spire, due to the train overworld where you have to choose between only two different combination of rewards. and also because you have to mix two demon classes. So you really have no idea what build you're going for, and you don't get stores or events to buy yourself the cards for them.
It also doesn't make use of movement and positioning like Hearthstone or Darkest Dungeon, even though it has the mechanics for it with an extra layer on it which is ascending and descending between wagons.

So as the difficulty goes up, i feel like it will be very difficult to make reliable strategies without the RNG screwing you. But the good part is, this game is still very fun without making 300 IQ plays. Additionally, this game has great ideas and a great foundation and i really hope the devs continue working on it.",1590881199,1590887719,TRUE,1,1,0.523809552,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,490,61,2086,0,837,1599528831,,

While PvP is not necessary at all to enjoy this game, I'm a little disappointed with the Hell Rush mode. Because of the UI, I thought it would be some kind of auto-battler game mode and I was [b]down[/b] for it. It's definitely on my for having an unrealistic expectation.

My only complaint is that currently it feels like you're pushed towards very linear strategies.  Many of the mechanics feel parasitic, and it feels like you're rewarded for hyper-focusing your deck rather than taking a balanced/blended approach.  There's also a few artifacts/cards that feel overtuned (eg. the double-gorge relic) which results in some overly bland/easy runs.  So after 10 or so games (going up to covenant 3), I'm going to pause for now.

Start with Slay the Spire's approach to deckbuilding, hands of cards, and relics. Mix in Hearthstone's approach to creatures and spells. Add a dash of tower defense lanes and waves of enemies. This is a good mix, not ""toss in everything and hope it works."" It is neither trivially easy nor impossible nor all that heavily RNG-dependent.

I am a huge Slay the Spire fan. You can see my comparisons of roguelike deckbuilders at KillTenRats.com. This game does a good job of recombining successful mechanics from several games into an enjoyable whole.

97,Monster Train,70028273,english,"I've only played this game and Slay the Spire for rogue like deck building games but I've enjoyed both very much.
While Slay the Spire does a slightly better job in many aspects from my perspective, the main class + sub class system in this game makes it very fun to just play over and over again to see what kind of unique deck you can make with each combination of classes. I feel like a couple of cards are slightly overtuned and a couple are slightly weak, but maybe that's cuz I'm still on covenant 3 so I shouldn't be judging card balance quite yet.

I'd say the only change I really want in this game is for there to be more variety of the big bosses. Sure they have like 3-4 variations of what they do but it's generally the same except maybe Seraph who has a bit more of a defining difference so maybe Seraph can always be the end boss but having a bit more variety on the 2 mid bosses would be really cool for me 

overall a very good experience and I'd recommend it to anyone who likes rogue like deck builders",1590818425,1590818425,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,36,5,5059,0,1302,1599964183,,
98,Monster Train,70028172,english,"If you like slay the spire, or card games, I can't recommend this enough. The game makes you split focus on improving units, and forging spells in order to create a deck that can withstand some truly harrowing encounters. 

Creatures are played from the deck, but it seems like if they perish during combat, they stay in the ""expended"" pool until the next fight. Keep that in mind, or enhance your favorites with holdover charms to keep them coming back for more. 

You are bound to come close to success a few times, but to truly beat your final boss, you must maximize your deck synergy, and keep your card pool optimized. 

I hope there's some more boss variety upcoming, as the same bosses can feel a little stale, but there are modifiers to keep it interesting, as well as challenges in the mid-tier to tempt your greed.   

A+ would punch ticket again.

11,Monster Train,70025844,english,"A lot of people I've talked to compare this game to Slay the Spire.  I've watched rather than played that game, so my words are to be taken with a grain of salt.  However, as a general statement, I'd say that Monster Train is a more mechanically involved game.  I'd also say they are different enough that you wont feel like you're just getting more Slay the Spire when you're playing this.  The strategy is different, but it is a deck-building game, and like all of those, card advantage is often king.
I recommend this game, but I would say the price is a bit on the high end as it stands.  It might be a good idea to wait for additional content releases (hopefully free, but you never know), or for it to go on sale.
I would say that with my 28 hours of play time, I still plan to keep playing for quite a while.  I haven't quite unlocked the 5th clan yet (though am very close).  At around the 50 hour mark, I'll update my review with any additional information.

-I run on Windows 10, and it runs smooth with the occasional odd hang when loading
-The visuals are good enough, though some cards look a little too similar and you have to read descriptions/titles carefully to not make mistakes when playing sometimes.
-A game of this seems to be shorter on average than Slay the Spire, but I really don't know by how much.
-My wins have, without exception, happened as the result of maxing a specific type of card or strategy as much as possible.  So far, I haven't found any strat that seems impossible to win with, but some are MUCH more difficult and may be impossible at the higher difficulty runs.
-The music is pretty good and I find myself whistling it sometimes at work
-There is a lot going on in the UI at times and it takes getting used to.  It's similar in complexity to StS, so if you've played that you'll catch on more quickly I'd wager.
-It's not like Hearthstone other than art style and the fact that you fight with multiple creatures in your deck.  Most other aspects are dissimilar enough to really make me wonder why people keep comparing them un-ironically.

That's about it.  Watch a game or two on YouTube or catch a stream of it first before you dive in, but I think fans of StS will absolutely love this game too!",1590813617,1590813617,TRUE,0,0,0.476190478,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,197,8,2559,0,1706,1592068573,,

First off: If you like Slay the Spire you will like this game, I don't think there is anything controversial about that.

The big difference between the two games is that Monster Train rewards more micromanagement and short term decision making and Slay the Spire rewards a grander, more long-term plan.

As each fight in Monster Train resets your train cabins (the playfield and what is on them), you are fundamentally changing how each fight is approached on every encounter. Sometimes you may not even have combat between units until three turns in because you couldn't place your champion on the bottom floor, sometimes you pop off and destroy everything when they enter the train without giving them a chance to really fight back. 

In slay the spire, while it has an abundance of cards and builds, you are generally picking a build up to the first boss and then building around that for the rest of the game until you fight the final boss, where it pays off.

Both games are VERY good and we live in the golden age of these kinds of games, just don't think they are 1:1 comparisons because of all the reviews saying it!

A great game for those who love managing resources and developing decks + strategic combat. The presentation is mostly just OK, the art is decent and the music is strangely calming considering I'm the conductor of a hell train. The UI and navigation are simple and effective. 

On the other hand, I do feel the need to add that this game has taken *a lot* from Slay the Spire.  Obviously in life (and especially in gaming) a lot of people iterate on others' ideas, so I'd shy away from calling this a rip-off or a clone. After all, many beloved RPGs are little more than clones of others that came before in terms of gameplay essentials. But this game plays like a DLC of StS, and the similarities can be a bit surprising at times. 

And on that note, I kind of feel bad for the StS devs because although I really enjoyed that game, it lost me before long because it just felt like it was missing meta to expand on the basic run concept. It became repetitive and I didn't care about the end goal at all. And here comes Monster Train, providing all of that meta progression with the more interesting clan concept, and frankly I'd say even improving on the basics. So at this point I wonder... would I ever bother playing Slay the Spire again? Would I have if this game hadn't come along? The answer to both is probably no, so that's a bit unfortunate.

Anyway, this game is pretty amazeballs, despite its fairly weird train premise. Well worth a try and congrats to the devs because this will likely be as wildly popular as StS was.

63,Monster Train,69989628,english,"I write this review with a heavy heart, as I believe Monster Train could be so much more. It has its pros, which many others have noted here, but unfortunately, I cannot recommend it as it currently exists.
I should begin by explaining that I have over 300 hours in Slay the Spire and I consider that game to be close to a masterpiece, so I am, willingly or not, going to be comparing the two in places. 
As a quick aside, I want to mention a few things which drag the game down but would not stop me from recommending it altogether. 
1. The art style is ugly. It looks like a mobile game which in my opinion is unacceptable considering the wealth of great and original artists out there. Slay the Spires art, which I will admit was somewhat jarring at first, fits so well and adds to its charm.
2. The world and story is boring and surface level. Compared to Slay the Spire which is enveloped in mystery and genuine imagination.
3. The last issue which is not a deal breaker, but is worthy of note, is the map. It is a one track path (pun intended) with a few shops along the way. Very dull. No choice on where to go next. One battle after another with no variation. This would be fine, if it were not for my final point, which is the one which stops this game from being worthy of purchase. 

Main issue. The enemy mechanics. 
While there are a lot of great cards and clan diversity, which makes for some interesting play choices, it means nothing when all your enemies behave in virtually the same way. Besides occasionally changing the floor on which your unit stands, or pre-emptively destroying a bomb, there is very little variety in how one handles a battle. What makes Slay the Spire great, is how you handle each fight. Gearing your deck around the next boss or playing cards that allow you to manipulate the playing field to survive.
In Monster Train, you either have enough health and strength, so you win, or you dont and you die. Every boss just attacks over and over again until someone wins or loses. Its so dull. And whats a shame is that it feels like this could have been completely avoidable. Some extra time spent giving enemies more to do and thereby creating a more interesting and challenging battlefield would have ascended this game to something that may have even competed with Slay the Spire. As it is now, its just a game that seems to completely misunderstand what makes Slay the Spire so ingenious.
My hope is that the Developers stick with the game and realise its potential, because I think there is a truly great game in there, but as it stands now, the combat (being the core of the game), requires a complete overhaul.",1590754150,1590754150,FALSE,40,1,0.602367759,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,164,7,853,0,840,1595028756,,

68,Monster Train,69988802,english,"To me this game represents the next step in the deck-building roguelike genre. While Slay the Spire is a great game, I always thought it was lacking a little bit of structure. There was no sense of ""space"", no positioning, no movement, it was all pretty focused on optimizing your numbers (maximize damage dealt, minimize damage taken).

Monster Train adds all of that! The three lanes do a lot for the game and make combat much more complex on a beyond-math level. You'll frequently find yourself making decisions between non-comparable alternatives, during battle as well as in between battles when it comes to building your deck.

The deck-building process itself is super well-paced too. You'll make a handful of decisions between battles that will move your deck forward, trying to find a balance between getting stronger right now to survive and building towards a scalable boss-beating machine.

While there kind of are ""archetypes"" built into the game, you'll deviate from them all the time as your choices are formed by the combination of your current deck (including some random starting cards), the artifacts you received, the upcoming sets of rewards and merchants etc. In combination with ascending through the Covenant (difficulty) levels, this easily has the potential to generate interesting runs for hundreds of hours.

Not to mention, on top there are custom and daily challenges with all kinds of modifiers, and ""Hell Rush"" which is basically 8 players competing in a simultaneous ""last player standing"" match with a super timer per battle. Another innovation you probably haven't seen elsewhere in the genre.

The presentation is overall quite good.  Two nitpicks that jump out to me: I think the train on the overview map looks cheap, as does the run summary page UI.  Information is clear, which is very important since there is a lot of it. I found the UI very easy to navigate.

25,Monster Train,69972625,english,"With hundreds of new deck-builders being created in the wake of slay the spire's paramount success as an indie title, one may expect the analogous formula presented in the same way from something like this game.

However, Monster Train is a very wonderful surprise.

The core mechanics are freshened in the form of unit placement, a simplified pathing system for the map, and new synergistic intrigue types among cards and spells alike, as well as a multiplayer feature for racing. 

There are 5 currently available ""characters""/clans that can be used, each adorning their own champion card that you have the option of placing with other units on one of three floors below the pyre of your train, which is essentially the source of fuel for the train, and serves as your health. Enemies will enter the train to engage you in turn-based combat, sequentially climbing up the train's three levels in attempt to defeat your pyre, the thing you are trying to protect. 

The idea of being able to place units on different levels of the train is a very innovative way of adding layers of depth to a formula that has been almost perfected by sts, and is complimented by nice animated visuals and easy to understand systems.

the game is pretty good, it has a good baseline aswell as being unique from other cardbuilding rougelike. like being on a train to fricking hell sounds awsome and instantly got me to buy the game as i did enjoy my small amount of time i put into slay the spire.

but i got 3 problems with the game:

1. the game has barely any variety in enemies and here is why: although the game got a good amount of variety in enemies its just how the game is built to make the enemies feel less significant that makes it feel like it could be so much more. in slay the spire the bird occulists is a basic easy enemy to deal with but if you mess around it can quickly kill you, i dont feel like this about any enemy other than the last 2 big bosses in this game, the enemies are weak and easy to take down simply by you having minions and not a character making the enemies look weaker hence a need for more variety.

2. you get the silent in STS upon first beating the game, it could take 1 try or 20 tries but you got rewarded when winning with something really cool while you dont get anything from ""beating"" the game that already feels WAY to short, you get rewarded really slowly by simply playing the game. example 1, you get a different class when you have played X number of spells (this will always be the first one you unlock) and the next one feels like its an eternity away

3. build variety feels lacking in the small amount of time ive played the game. any time i swap away from red+green i get stomped simply because the other things are not strong enough. blue is cool with their status effects that stacks dmg and can reach an insane amount of tick dmg on a boss but their hero dies to everything that has sweep so not playable. having multistrike on your hero as red will never ever be better than having slay +10. having blue as a side faction as red does not work because both factions have low hp units forcing you to take the green faction. green faction hero is ass as it has 0 dmg and only there as a spike tank that other units of the same faction does 10 times better.

the game can use a good amount of more work but it looks really promising. follow this game and look out for future patches where they might expand or change things to make factions other than red green viable. also having mod support would greatly help this game in my opinion. rougelike´s always benefits from having it.

You cans see the entire path to the end before you make your first real choice each run, and because of this, if you fail, it really feels like it was your fault, and not just RNG dealing you an unwinable hand. That's important in a rogue-like; RNG adds to the fun but doesn't make or break it.

32,Monster Train,69947977,english,"If you enjoyed Slay the Spire, you will probably like this game too!

Monster train is a fun deck building game that is great for playing in bursts of 1 or more games. The duration of one game is about 45-60 minutes and it is very hard not to click the 'New run' button every  time.

At the start of a run you pick a primary and secondary clan, which limits the available cards to those two clans' card sets. This is great for replay value, because each clan has their own play style and it's up to you to choose the winning combination of spells, units, artifacts and upgrades.

There are only 8 encounters during every run, so the cards you pick and the order in which you play matter quite a bit. A misplaced unit could be the difference between victory and defeat.

The enemies you encounter feel a little same-y after a while, they only get a unique buff every time, which might influence your strategy.

I find some of the cards a little less useful, but maybe they just don't fit my play style. I don't pick upgrades that boost the Pyre (the base you need to defend), because I like to defeat enemies before they even reach it. Some other cards seem a little too situational, but that's okay.

I still need to try the more challenging modes, but I want  to unlock all available cards first, which will take me a while. The multiplayer aspect also seems interesting.

Overall, a very fun and addictive game to play with great replay value. Worth full price.

Much like Slay the Spire, you build a deck by drafting cards while navigating a map and engaging in battles, in this case, you are riding a train through the now-frozen 9 circles of Hell with the last vestige of the Pyre which can re-ignite Hell to it's former blazing glory.

What differentiates this is that you choose a combination of 2 factions, one which is your main and one your secondary.  The main faction will determine who your Champion, a special card, is while the combination of both will determine the contents of your starting deck.  The game consist of 8 multi-wave battles on your 4-level train as the forces of ""good"" try to climb its floors and extinguish your pyre which sits on the topmost floor.  You play cards either Units or Spells to defeat each wave until the boss Spawns.

Once you complete the game the first time, you unlock Covenant levels which are similar to Ascendancy levels.  Each subsequent level will give you penalties to make the run harder.

Another very nice feature is the ability to creature custom challenges that can be shared and played simultaneously among friends each challenge having their own leader boards.

The degradation in replay value of the game happens once you won 2 or more run, the builds are either overpowered or very useless in the final boss fight, not many of game winning decisions can be made without being repetitive.

That was the best and the most desperate 12 hours I have ever spent on a newly bought game.
If you love Slay the Spire, you will love this game. 

However, there's only 2 things I can nitpick from the game:
[list]
[*]The game mechanic is not really well explained in the tutorial and might give you sometime to get used to it if you have never played Slay the Spire before.
[*]Unlock progress is slow when I have only unlocked about 40% of the items 12 hours into the game.

It is fair to compare this game to Slay the Spire, and I think many fans of Slay the Spire would really enjoy this game as well.  It plays much more fast-paced.  It is a well-balanced game, but not perfectly balanced, and I think that is intentional. There are 5 different decks and there are 20 different combinations of ""classes"" that can be created by smashing two potential 'decks' together, depending on which one you choose as your 'main'.  Each combination plays very differently, and gives a great amount of replay value.

Instead of perfect balance, the game expects you to be game-breakingly strong to in order to smash the final boss, which is satisfying and makes you feel like a genius.  A single run usually lasts an hour.

At $20.00-$25.00 it is a good value, whether you play through just long enough to unlock everything or if you decide to drop countless hours reaching the highest difficulties.

Wishlist for future updates:  
1. The multiplayer 'race' mode is fun, it would be even more fun to be able to spectate or review the choices made by your competition if you don't win though.
2. A large supply of random events, maybe a third 'blind' path through each level just to spice things up.
3. The design of the bosses is fun, and the variations of each are also interesting, more bosses would of course be even more fun.
4.  I would happily pay for DLC that adds more decks to the game.

I can't remember the last time I played a game that respected the player's time as much as Monster Train does. Each run will average less than an hour and there's enough content to make them feel different and substantial.

The diversity in deck-building potential is vast with 5 playable ""clans"" all containing very different play styles. If that wasn't enough, each run requires the player to choose a primary clan (unlocks the clan champion [0-cost innate unit] to be used each fight) as well as a supportive or allied clan. This in turn allows different clan combinations to be used for further deck-building depth. 

Pros: 
+ Unique take on the deck-building genre.
+ Strong fundamental replay value. 
+ Palatable OST.
+ Respects the player's time. (By far the most important)

Cons:
- Devoid of story.
- The art style can be an acquired taste.

45,Monster Train,69895660,english,"Like many, I came from Slay The Spire, and was looking for an experience that was familiar, different, and better. 

What I found was a fantastic game that still left me slightly dissatisfied. I think the overall mechanics of the game are deep and entertaining, but I don't feel the balance is there yet. 

In StS, almost every run felt possible unless you gambled and traded your relic in for something garbage or got screwed by a bad transform/curse. RNG would emerge over the course of the run and help guide you to victory or defeat, but it always FELT possible. 

In MT, your success at higher ascension levels (I can't remember what MT calls them and I don't care) will depend on finding one or more synergies. While you can and will build synergies as you move through a game, the starting deck you're given is still crucial. A run that begins with 5 garbage cards (and yes, many cards are garbage unless tied to an extremely narrow niche deck) might as well be aborted immediately for all the odds are stacked against you. 

I don't care for that level of RNG right off the bat, and I think a better job could have been done in balancing it. My personal preference could be for the game to give you a 2x stack and 1x stack, then put one more event at the beginning stage that lets you choose a card from 3 and duplicate it, giving you your final 2x stack.",1590593686,1590593746,TRUE,11,0,0.59054327,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,685,64,3486,0,1455,1591966017,,

48,Monster Train,69894573,english,"This game isn't bad, but it is poorly balanced.  Once it gets some fine tuning, if it's acceptable, I will change my review.  As of right now, you will often run into a few very annoying issues.  Your starting deck, for nearly every clan is stuffed with too many of certain cards.  You will find that you are constantly pulling an entire hand full of nothing but Regen spells, Morsels, or other spells that don't let you develop your ""train"" to face the upcoming waves.  And there are ZERO opportunities to tweak these until you clear the first train... even then, the next tile has to have spawned a node that allows you to remove cards.

Just to clarify... there are 10 regen/spell cards in the starting deck, and only 4 monsters to place down other than your champion.  So of the 15 cards in your starting deck, 66% of them are useless for developing your train layout.  Doing the math you will see why it's so common to get screwed with a hand full of garbage, instead of monsters that you need to place in your train.  I am all for having a bit of RNG and luck involved... this is a Roguelite afterall.  But these percentages are a bit extreme if you aren't going to allow us to remove cards from our deck before clearing the first train.   My suggestion, is limit the Regens/Torches/ or other spells to 4 each in the starting deck, and give Train Stewards or weak clan monsters to 6.",1590592295,1590592793,FALSE,0,0,0.452674866,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,179,38,6349,0,548,1593310709,,

But monster train hits a lot of these points to create a truly great game which I'm afraid many will miss. So if you're finding something niche, I hope you give this game a shot.

Also, my review assumes you played slay the spire.

Monster train is what a proper spin-off, homage and spiritual successor should be.
Every aspect of Slay the Spire, MT has integrated their own spin to the formula while leaving what makes StS fun intact.

MT has a dual faction system that offers a lot more replay value and mastery with being able to mix and match regions, creating deck-building variety like in Magic: The Gathering. Each faction has cards similar to how a character in StS has cards, different archetypes and they are surprisingly synergistic across regions.

Runs are also generally shorter (personally), one run is condensed to 7-8 boss battles as opposed to dozens in StS. These fights are still fairly long so runs can still take awhile if you want to methodically think about things but there is less of the annoying health min-maxing in StS ascensions and more focus on the decision making.

There is also a real-time multiplayer gamemode, each player is still plays as if it were singleplayer but they compete with speed and efficiency to gain score to see who scores the highest in end while you are on a clock. It's very intense and a good change of pace to the singleplayer mode and I highly recommend it, it has an adrenaline rush very unlike anything out there in the multiplayer market.

My only minor gripes about this game is that some UI elements are not clear, information is crucial, same with StS. There isn't a clear breakdown of overhealing/damage, at high values you will have to resort to a lot of manual calculation. There is also no way to see what each unit is doing to who, especially important when fights span between multiple attacks amongst multiple units. Lastly, the unit's speech can block the room size which is crucial in speedrun type playstyles.

Finally, I hope you don't judge a book by its cover. The visuals are a bit ""crappy mobile game"" but there is a lot of world-building delivered similar to StS, neat character designs and that subtle mysterious lore. Also the name is very mobile gamey and I hope that doesn't detract you from buying it because I know many will.

I actually enjoy this one more than Spire due to the sheer variety of runs and card combinations that are possible, and unlike in Spire, are actually viable. You can make almost any card work, and more often than not I find myself surprised at the usefulness of a card that I initially deemed worthless on pickup.

I also enjoy how liberal the game is with cash flow, card pickup and card removal opportunities. It may seem too easy at first, but it allows for more experimentation with card and upgrade synergies, which makes the game initially more forgiving (and more enjoyable) as a result. But as you push higher difficulty levels your knowledge of these synergies will be put to the test, and some faction combinations are difficult to work with.

The logbook is a great feature as well, which keeps track of which cards and faction combinations you've used, along with the highest difficulty you've achieved with that combination.

And for the one percent or so of Steam users that play on ultrawides, this game is actually ultrawide compatible, unlike Spire.

If you're a fan of Slay the Spire you definitely need to pick this up. It clearly takes a lot from it while adding several mechanics of its own.

Edit: So after some more time I still like this game. But I will say I'm not so sure if it's.. balanced great? I'm still in low-ranked Covenant (think Ascension if you're familiar with Slay the Spire) but certain upgrades to your Champion card seem like no-brainers compared to others. A prime example is the last clan- Would you like your champion to have 50/50 attack/hp but die in three turns without a certain buff you're unlikely to have when starting the game? Or would you like him to have 15/15 and heal 5 if something dies? Considering sometimes the first fight starts out with 4 5/1 enemies (where sometimes killing them deals damage to your front unit) it seems pretty easy to decide to just wait to play your incredibly strong but short lived Champion later, when the boss shows up.

After about 7 hours of play, I am pretty obsessed with it. 

I played the first run, beat it in two tries, and was like, ""Oh, that's too bad, it's really easy."" But using covenants adds a LOT of depth and complexity to the game, which is great. You honestly aren't playing it the way it's meant to be played if you aren't using covenants. 

One of the downsides is that there isn't really a lot of variation of bosses- but I am not sure if more get unlocked later. So far, it's been a pretty samey sort of run. But with how hard it gets as you go, I think it's almost necessary to have some amount of predictability to prep for. I think the card crafting and ascension choices for champions makes up for a lack of run variation, anyway. I get to play vastly different decks with the same cards, just modded differently. I really like that. 

This game mashes a lot of genres together and is different than Slay the Spire in all the best ways. I still love Slay the Spire. They feel really different after you start playing it, though. Different enough that I honestly can play both games in the same day and still have fun with both. 

I really like this game. It is well balanced and engaging and has a ton of replayability. And honestly, I am glad it's got shorter runs than StS because those runs sometimes got too long.

Fell in love with this really good and lovely game.
Kinda like Slay the spire but with more unit and floors to manage, has really some Hearthstone PVE flavor with it's own personnality and a lot of great ideas.
The two clans system makes a lot of different combination. I also really like the log book which trace wathever card you get, mastered, and how many wins with each combination of clans in a single page. The collector heaven.

After 12 hours I'm really fond of this game, for such a low price i recommend it to everyone loving Deck building and card games with a taste of roguelike.

If you have to compare it with slay the spire I would say:
- Less frustrating, you get more chance to customise your deck and remove bad cards
- Less RNG
- More variated with 5 different clans, making 20 different combination with different play style in each

22,Monster Train,69846115,english,"Oh, yeah, baby, that's the good stuff.

Slay the Spire turned me into a roguelike deckbuilding junkie. After logging 400+ hours in it, I've been on a two-year journey through a bunch of other games in the genre. I've played a lot of good ones, but this one deserves special mention. The Slay the Spire inspiration is definitely there, but it clearly served as more of a jumping off-point into its own game, and deserves to be talked about on the strength of its fresh new ideas alone, because it has a ton, and a lot of them are just fantastic.

First, the deckbuilding itself. Monster Train very clearly understands what makes a deckbuilder fun, and is built off of the idea of finding crazy unexpected synergies between its cards, artifacts, and champions. It chooses to focus on multiplicative scaling as opposed to additive, and it gives you a lot of control over which cards and units you choose to lean into with its upgrade system. You get to make a bunch of decisions constantly, and you're challenged to find the highest-value options out of a lot of interesting ones. The game is decently challenging, and if you make good calls, you're rewarded handsomely with crazy emergent synergies that just feel really awesome to pull off. But, the encounters scale exponentially too, and if you don't keep up, the denizens of Heaven are going to overpower you and shatter the last remnants of your Pyre.

The tower defense aspect of the encounters changes the flow up quite a bit as well, asking you interesting questions about what units go in which lanes. At first, it seems like a no-brainer to just shove all your big dudes into one lane and kill things before they can even get further in, but the bosses challenge you not to do that. All it takes is one time for a wave to catch you off-guard and break through the floor where you invested all of your power to understand the tactical importance of having a plan for every lane.

The presentation is great, and each faction has a strong identity in both its visuals and mechanics. My personal favorite is the Melting Remnant, literal candle people that burn out after a while, but use graveyard recursion effects to re-form new bodies out of wax and come back stronger. The music is good too, an enjoyable soundtrack that's consistent enough to be thematic, but also just varied enough to stay interesting.

The only thing on my wishlist right now is more encounter variety. You fight the same bosses in the same order every run, but they have different crests that change the mechanics of the fights significantly. However, it still feels like the same boss, and you might have to change your tactics turn-to-turn, but you don't have to build significantly differently to handle them. But, that's probably something that's more noticeable to someone like me (who's no-lifed this game for four days straight), as opposed to someone who plays a little more casually.

I could say more, but you get the idea, I think. A lot of this should be experienced for yourself, and if you even have a passing interest in the idea of this game, you should definitely pick this up. I've played a lot of good games in this genre, but this is the first one that I've logged almost 40 hours in in four days.

If you like deckbuilding roguelites like Slay the Spire then this is an absolute must.It borrows some of it's ideas like the ascension mechanic and artifacs but also introduces new ideas like the 3 stage arena and clan combinations ( essentially allowing you to mix and match 2 deck archetypes). Speaking of Clans ,there are 5 of them (2 unlocked from the beginning ,the other 3 trough gameplay), and all have very interesting and diverse gameplay.While the Stygian Guard is all about frostbite ,sap and spells , the Umbra are about the comsume mechanic and buffing units .Seeing how you can combine any 2 clans ,you have the potential to get some pretty juicy decks that are extremely satisying to play .

Besides the wonderful single player experience where you can climb covenants ala AScension in Slay the Spire; this game also offers daily challenges ,competing in multiplayer with other players in a ""rush"" style game mode and you can even create custom Challenges that you can post online so that other players can compete in them.All of these are great activities that offer Monster Train a lot of replayability.

57,Monster Train,69831959,english,"If you like Slay the Spire and would like a new challenge, this could be it.

You manage a train in a tower defense style, single wagon with 4 floors. The objective is to beat every wave of ennemies without depleting your crystal at the top. 

Equipped with your deck of cards (monsters / spells), you have to carefully choose which units and spell to cast on each floor in order to create a perfect wall agaisnt different kinds of ennemies. 

You have to think about unit positionning, managing the space on your floors (which is limited) for said units, the mana required to cast your cards each turn, buffing or removing other cards from your deck and gathering artifacts giving you various buffs for your current run.

In the beginning, you have access to a limited amount of decks (each representing a type of monster) with a limited pool of cards. Everytime you play you unlock experience for the deck you chose which unlocks more cards.

The idea is to go as far as you can everytime, clawing a little more experience, until you can get a good idea of each deck's strengths and weaknesses. After a couple of hours, it will be easy to reach the last boss regularly. 
With a good understanding of each decks, you can start adding ""covenant"" diifficulties, which are 25 levels of harder and harder runs to challenge yourself (and golden version of your cards)


There are definitly some things to adjust, such as hero cards balance, some of those can make your run a breeze while others are just fodder in your deck while trying to find a strat.

If you are new to the game and want an easier path to victory in the beginning while figuring things out, definitly play Awoken, as the playstyle is very straightforward and the hero is very strong (compared to the Hellhorn one)

Some decks are harder to understand than others, but once you get a gist of the mechanics, you can craft winning strategies relatively fast.

Pros:
Solid deck customization
Deep mechanics
Fast gameplay
Loads of cards, upgrades, and artifacts

Cons:
Because of the emphasis on quick play, the game allows to to ramp up your power level incredibly fast. It is very easy to outpace the difficulty on lower settings. The game might reward intelligent decision making, but I can't tell as I have not even come close to losing. I will update this when I go through some of the higher difficulties.

At its essence, it is a rogue deck-building with champion-specific cards and interesting artefact permutations - again similar to StS - but the way it links to an almost RTS style of combat is extremely fun to play.

These combine to create very unique combos, most of which I have not seen obviously.

Watch Northenlion if you want to get a grasp of this game (though he may want you to pull your own hair out sometimes of how blind he is, Luckily he has no hair)",1590473604,1590473604,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,345,23,1820,0,212,1593130361,,
89,Monster Train,69810515,english,"Incredibly well polished for a game coming out of nowhere. Music is great. Gameplay is great. Synergy between factions is great. UI and multiplayer elements are great. It not only stands on the shoulders of giants of rogue-likes past (heavy emphasis on Slay the Spire), it vaults off and soars. I genuinely hope this game doesn't get ignored. 

The only weakness I can foresee would be a lack of proper scaling to keep it interesting after enough runs. I've only progressed through about 1/5 of the levels of difficulty available. I get the feeling the difficulty will ramp up at a reasonable level, and there is still tons of progression left in the way of unlocking new cards. There just needs to be a point that hits that perfect balance of ""hard"" and ""rewarding"". I have felt that the limited chances to add combat units to your deck can win or lose you a run depending on their quality. I will probably update this review if it plateaus hard, but for now I don't feel it.

Outside the above, I just hope to see more updates released for the game. New factions would be amazing, but there might not be huge amount of design space left. Re-balancing as things go, and new modes would also be great.

11,Monster Train,69816049,english,"Monster train is exactly what it looks like. It would be hard not to draw parallels with slay the spire, but the addition of a 2 dimensional play area really spices up the formula.

You are a hero of hell, on a train called the boneshaker, on a voyage to bring the last shard of Hell's pyre to unfreeze hell itself. You do this by playing units on one of three levels of your train, and playing spells to bolster your units and hurt or hinder your enemies.

Each run, you pick two factions (smash up style) to play together, and your primary faction determines your hero. Your hero is the quintessential unit of your faction, costs 0, and gets upgraded during your run. The two factions determine your starting spells, and which spells and units you'll see along the way.

The first three factions (all I've unlocked so far, though the unlock conditions are clearly presented) are essentially Magic: the Gathering's red, green, and blue colors. Red is all about units that get rage and armor, and direct damage spells. Green is all about big units and healing. Blue is all about manipulating and destroying your enemies via spells, and a stacking damage over time freeze.

I've played several runs (maybe 5-7 at this point?) and the game is super fun. When you win a run, every card in your final deck becomes gold bordered, so you can easily try new strategies on later runs.",1590462714,1590462714,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,261,2,1488,176,320,1601763847,,

A brisk and vividly imagined game where each run is concise enough to tackle in one sitting but varied enough to be engaging time after time. The factions in the game play substantially different and some cards that are typically dead weight have been made intriguing based on some incredibly creative design. In particular I thought how the Awoken faction implemented healing in a way that made simple creature heals potentially very powerful was quite interesting. While many familiar ideas are here, cards can be upgraded for example, their implementation is highly original and well crafted. On many other levels Monster Train is just a completely new take with elements of tower defense layered into a compelling strategic experience.

If you're a fan of deckbuilders at all you owe it to yourself to check this game out.

PROS:
* In depth game mechanics allow for basic and complex play as you get more comfortable with the system.
* In game card modification system adds an additional layer of strategy.
* Graphics create an atmosphere that is engaging and interesting at the same time.
* Learning curve is beautifully hidden to the point where you tend to learn as you go without knowing it.
* Scaling difficulty that you have to unlock as you progress making it feel like a reward to be challenged.
 
CONS
* Can not build decks before a run. Entire game is draft based deck building.
* Very few game modes making every run feel the same to play even though you're getting different things.
* RNG heavy while being draft based, this means an entire run can fall apart simply because the right cards never made an appearance.
* You can NOT create your deck in advance of a run.
* You can NOT influence what artifacts that your run will roll with.
* No ability to prepare before the run begins like most CCGs allow you to do.

I recommend this game in it's current state. However, if the DEVs would add a few more modes and modification options for runs, it would be much better. Such as; Arena Duels, Premade Decks, Starting artifact selection from your entire unlocked artifact collection. Just to name a few.

I've played every clan and allied clan combination, and I have to say I'm impressed by how unique each clan feels in the game - and also how many different ways it feels you can build within that clan. I think my enjoyment of the Melting Remnant's burnout+reform playstyle tops anything I experienced in Slay the Spire.

I would like more customization when upgrading units and spells. Upgrades are pretty generic for spells, though there are a few cool effects for minions like multistrike and quick.

The boss has 2000 hitpoints vs your first row spike ability + regen + freeze combo? It will take 20 turns to sort out a winner, but you know exactly right from the start who will come out on top at the end. This allows you to focus on making the important decisions (make a stand on the first floor? Build up 2nd or 3rd floor?).

Great synergies between the various cards and factions. I have only unlocked one faction and maybe 55% of the cards for the first two factions. There are already plenty of interesting combinations. I'm only five hours in, but it's enough to know that this game has plenty to offer and a low frustration factor.

Overall seems to strike an excellent balance between control and randomness. 

I was not a fan of the art style initially, but every faction and creature has personality and the art has since grown on me.

68,Monster Train,69773767,english,"This is your classic roguelike deck builder in a similar vein to Slay the Spire.  I've sunk quite a few hours in a very short time and feel it's worth the cost so far.

There is enough different in here to other similar games to make it fresh but it is quite familiar to others in the genre.  You start off with a vanilla style deck and will over the course of stages upgrade, thin out and refine your deck to a hopefully well oiled machine to tackle the end game boss.  The unique factors are the tower defense style play.  You have multi level train and enemies ascend to the top.  You choose units and utilise spells to whittle them down before they get to your pyre (hit bar) at the top.The card upgrade system is very satisfying allowing you to tailor make cards to suit their situation.  I definitely feel that early  to mid game there are interesting choices beyond thin out bad and collect good cards.

Right now there are four factions and you jam two together to define the card pool available to you. There are daily challenges and  challenge maker to keep things fresh.  I suspect in time I will find the game become repetitive ( no more so than others in the genre) but I'm not sure when that will happen.

55,Monster Train,69756527,english,"A really great game about card management and deck building, though I wish there was more layers to delve through in a run outside of the 9. I do really like the clans, but feel like some could use some work, especially with how their Clan leaders are. 

Below is my very amateur take on the clans and the mechanics they have.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hellhorned: Overall the worst Clan, victory can really only be found through having big heavy units and getting armor cards. They get Rage (Flat Armor Buff), Armor (Buffer to defense), and Imps (units that give lil effects when summoned). Their faction leader is so dang soft...it makes it hard for him to build up to get even better so those armor cards are really necessary, which is tough when there's than random factor of what you get card wise. 


Awoken: Big beefy plant folks, they get benefits when they are healed. Their faction leader is only good at being a buffer compared to their units which get massive stats when healed. They get spikes (deal damage a set amount when hit) and regenerate (heal a certain amount at the end of turn). Their Faction Leader is a wall, straight up. Gets some benefits from heal with one of her specializations, but I really think spikes are the way to go considering pretty much ALL the late bosses have multi-attack.

Stygian: Aquatic Folk with the powers of frost, discard, and spellpower! Really strong when they get spell cards. With actual spell damage. Otherwise, their discard mechanic is heavily dependent on getting discard cards to trigger them, otherwise they are too expensive. Can get really strong with their innate ""incant"" ability which gives them buffs when a spell is cast on their floor. 3rd best Clan, their leader is so so soft though...ONE FELL SWEEP and it's over. Oh and spell weakness is really strong. Honestly, the buffs they get with their faction leader and how the group synergizes with spells so well make them so good. 

Umbra: Shadowy folks with the Gorge and Morsel mechanic. You put a unit in the front and stuff morsels behind them! BOOM unit gets bigger and triggers their gorge ability at the end of the turn. Their faction leader is the strongest. 2nd best.

Waxen: The best Clan, with the mechanics of Extinguish ( which triggers an ability when a unit dies), Burnout (which causes the unit to automatically die when the counter reaches 0), and Reform(Revive a unit with a burnout counter on it). Their leader can get any of those 3 abilities and it's super easy to trigger the mechanics.

If you liked ANYTHING mentioned so far, chances are, you are going to enjoy this game. There is really no point in enumerating this game's pros, since it got A LOT of things very right. From designs, to artstyle, lore, clan combos, difficulty scales, sound design (morsels are wonderful), gameplay systems -- see what I mean? The list just keeps going.

Monster Train does not have many cons, and the ones that it has are minor at best. In fact, I have only managed to think of two so far:
- The game ramps up too fast. You can go from hitting for 2-5 damage on round 1 to a 35х2 multihits by as early as round 2. I really enjoy gradual progression in these types of games more than an abrupt leap.
- Due mostly to the first con, the runs are very short. It lacks this epic feeling of ""I've been building this deck for a long time and now I am finally ready"".

But then for boss fights, they use a completely different system.  You play your hand once, and then the combat auto battles until one side loses.  Essentially any hand-based strategy you'd want to do is pointless after about the first boss, because nothing scales as well as smearing as many buffs on your guys as possible.  To succeed you must spend every round building up one lane that can win a boss fight without your input.

Ultimately it doesn't feel like you have nearly as many options as when playing what I consider the better entries in this genre.  This game is ok, and the production quality is high, but I'm done with it after 14 hours and don't see myself playing again.

62,Monster Train,69755853,english,"Yes, this game is very much like slay the spire, but it's not a direct clone even though I will compare it to StS for this review. StS set the stage for many other games to try to copy it and i think this is one of the only 2 games out there to do it successfully. (the other is Griftlands, in my opinion) This game has an entirely different playstyle and pacing. You are not one singular character, like in StS. and the health you must manage to survive is not the health of one of the units on the battlefield, but instead it's your train's ""heart"". You essentially summon minions and cast spells to slow and kill the enemies advancing to your train's heart. 

Some of the big differences in this game is that the runs you play through are quicker and more standardized with pacing. The process of a run is 8 battles where you get a set amount of events/shops to edit your build/deck in between each battle. Unfortunately you usually won't be able to perfect a deck like you can in slay the spire due to a lot less time tweeking your deck to perfection. (I'm hoping they change this in the future) However, this game still has all the great things that make a really good deckbuilding experience like: card upgrades, artifacts/relics, permanent unlocks for future runs, ascension/covenant levels, different class options, etc.

Some really nice things this game has that many other games of this genre don't have is modular card upgrading, which allows interesting combinations,  a lot of custom game options, and the really fun one, multiplayer ""stuff"". When I say multiplayer""stuff"" I mean it has a way to do the exact same run with other people in real time, so you guys will get all the exact same options but compete to see who made the better choices, you can also do this after you had a really cool single player run, just copy and paste a url type thing to a friend and they can replay a run you did previously and try to do better than you.

Overall I think this game is REALLY good, and I highly recommend people buy it and try it if you enjoy StS or deck builders in general.

Notes to the devs if they read this: really great game I think adding more variation options to events/card upgrades could go a long way. Also, it feels too simple to upgrade cards to golden after 1 single win, maybe have multiple upgrades you unlock after a certain number of wins with the card? for instance: golden card after 1 win then new card chroma/color after 25 wins, new card art after 50 wins, etc. Also in order to upgrade starter cards you need to keep at least like 2 or 3 in the deck all the way to the end to show you actually ""mastered"" it. And of course, as with every other great game in the deckbuilding genre...... add more cards/classes..... will pay cold hard cash for more content. I really think you guys have great grounds for dlc pack of additional classes.

91,Monster Train,69752654,english,"Wow. Bought this two days ago and already 19 hours playtime clocked. It's midnight right now, but I think I need to make this review now.

This game is crazy good. It's a roguelite deckbuilder with unit placement strategy, upgrading and meta-progression elements. None of these things are things we have not seen before. Indeed, when I first loaded up Monster Train the garish, hyperactive art style reminded me of a hundred god-awful free-to-play mobile games. I went in with fairly tepid expectations.

19 hours. I've played 19 hours in two days.

I think I'll try to list the things that I love about Monster Train so far:

- YouTube's Sir Swag once said of the great mob-dunking simulator Warframe ""No one can be overpowered, if everyone is overpowered."". Monster Train allows you to obtain seemingly ludicrously overtuned units to place into battle, and then allows you to enhance those units even further until you seriously start to wonder how they could ever be killed. The game then allows you to enjoy the min-max bliss for just the right amount of time before it starts throwing its own godlike behemoths at you. Somehow this system of countering bonkers with bonkers feels challenging but not unfair, empowering but not exploitable.

- The game has a pathway system between battles, similar to Slay the Spire, but with important differences. Between each battle, you only ever have two pathways to choose from, but this is an improvement on the formula in my opinion. Each pathway has 2-3 excellent ways of buffing your team, thinning out your deck, improving your spells, obtaining powerful artifacts (Spire relics), gaining gold, you name it. Very rarely will there be an obvious choice which way to go - you will want to go BOTH directions. But you can't. Sorry. This self-contained method of progressing within a given run prevents needless ""scouting"" of your route, and keeps the game flowing.

- Meta progression in this game is off the chart. There's too much going on for me to even summarise here, but essentially when you finish a run your brain will scream ONE MORE DADDY ONE MORE and you'll say okay babe and then it'll be one in the morning and you've got work.

Okay that'll do. The only thing I dislike so far with this game is that the audio can get exhausting after a while, especially if you are playing on any speed above normal. The characters, particularly the bosses, utter the same vocal outburst every single time they get hit by an attack, and they get hit by a LOT of attacks. But whatever.

97,Monster Train,69751777,english,"My vote for the best game of it's kind!

The emergent ""Deck Crawler"" genre is most popularized by Slay the Spire, though personally I consider that sort of near the middle of the couple dozens games out right now (production values in StS are fantastic, don't get me wrong, but the card game is good rather than great, really). It's a real ""Shut up and take my money"" niche for games in my book, and there's steep competition near the top of the pile for my affections, with games like Nowhere Prophet, Chrono Ark, and Gordian Quest making competitive cases for my stop spot...

At least they did, because I feel like Monster Train just blew every other game in the genre out of the water for me.

Oh man, this game is so good, I don't even... I'm gonna have to bullet point this so I don't gush past the review character limit

- The game involves a mechanic to modify individual cards in your deck. You can really strategically run wild with novel combinations of traits in this sort of system, but to date, other games I've seen try is largely faceplanted because it was too difficult to balance these mechanics... Monster Train is the first game I've seen not only make it work, but nail it in a deeply satisfying way.

- Balance and difficulty is always an issue in these games, and Monster Train takes the approach of ""It everything is overpower, than nothing is unfair"". You can make so many busted combinations in your own deck it's headspinning, just ""it feels like I'm cheating"" with how severely you can break mechanics... thing is, you NEED to do that, because the later bosses are JUST as relentlessly unfair and over-powered... you WILL NOT beat Fel or Seraph without some form of exploit, so ""Break the game"" is built into the game due to a difficulty curve that would be unrelentingly savage if you don't... Even then, you'll be surprised how often a deck that feels unstoppable can suddenly lose due to a complex misplay... with 25 difficulty levels (apparently, I'm not very far into them), if you ever feel like things are too easy, the upscaling of challenge is quite high... it's an excellent balance of rewarding high strategy, being approachable for more casual players, but offering a huge difficulty cieling to hardcores. 

- The game involves doing runs with a modular 2-faction deck, similar to card games like Smash Up... but whereas the biggest difficulty I find with those cardgames IRL is seperating the decks after every game, it works excellent in this digital format. The faction choice influences the two halves of your starting deck, what cards will be available to gain in play, what traits will crop up to add to those cards, what passive-granting relics will crop up, and your ""main"" faction will even grant you a powerful ""Champion"" unit that costs 0 mana to play and starts in your opening hand each fight, which will eventually ""Evolve"" down a tree to 1 of 10 final forms, which will likely be utterly crucial to your strategy in most runs.

- The 5 factions all have a few themes connected to them... Umbra are ramp, sacrifice for buildup, and X-Cost; Horned Devils offer aggressive attack units, direct damage, and on-kill effects; Awakened have ample healing, defense as the best offense tactics, and units that have lot of potential for enhancement; Stygians synergize incredibly well with spellcasting and can dish out savage damage via debuffs; and the Remnants offer rapid minion spawning, deck thinning, and sacrifice effects. Any of these factions can chose to focus on just one or two of their mechanics, and of course you have two faction sets to choose from... this makes replay value almost staggering, as Remnant/Awakened, Stygian/Remnant, and Awakened/Stygian are likely to look UTTERLY different from one another in terms of strategy for a run. 

- The game prides itself on a mechanic of having multiple floors you need to defend, forcing you to make calculated decisions about where to place units so as to best use your resources and minimize weak spots in your defenses. This is probably the LEAST interesting of the innovations to me, but it is novel and works well... The implication of it I like more is that it creates a game of 9 long battles rather than dozens of short ones... which sounds unpleasant at first blush, but actually works well... rather than choose paths of ""Fight/Treasure/Camp/Shop"", every match WILL be 9 battles, and you get an ""Intermission"" of the other things in between each, making your choice ""Do I want to enchance spells, cull cards, and heal; or would a random relic, an event, and unit enhancement be better for me right now?"" and so on. It makes an interesting ""preparation phase"" between each combat... the ""One more turn"" effect is so REAL here, after every fight, you want to do the prep phase to check your spoils, after every test phase, you want to do another fight to test out your new tricks.

- Production qualities are solid... the graphics are charming, but more relevantly, the soundtrack was downright impressive... there's a lot more tracks than you tend to see in these games, and I REALLY liked the majority of them... I usually put on a podcast while doing dozens of hours in these games, I tend to just listen to the OST with this one.

On some level, it's hard for me to even know what to say reguarding why you should buy this game... it feels like a no-brainer. If you're into strategy, board/card games, roguelites, and DEFINITELY if you're into deck crawlers, you really MUST try it, it's the best game of it's kind to date.",1590361664,1590361702,TRUE,1,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,490,61,4845,1323,1347,1601344442,,

This game will get a lot of comparisons to Slay the Spire, as a video game deck builder.  I've played quite a number of them recently, and this game is by far the best spiritual successor to Slay the Spire.

This isn't a clone.  If you are coming from Slay the Spire, take note:

Choose your upgrades.  Card's don't upgrade in just one way.  You choose how to upgrade each card, when upgrading.

Your deck is a mash up of two factions, chosen at the beginning of the run.  Your deck will contain cards from each of these two factions, allowing for dynamic games.

Each run _starts_ differently.  In StS, your run starts with a minor change based on what you choose from the whale.  Here, you are given random cards to your deck which will help shape your decisions going forward.  (starting with ascension 1).

""You"" aren't the one doing the fighting.  You summon creatures to lanes, while trying to protect your health.  In this way, it's more akin to a tower defense game.  

Each room, you can chose to increase the difficulty for better rewards.

Monster Train is a deck building rogue-like. Expect to play through the game many times (this isn't a bad thing). Here's how it works: You'll choose a primary and secondary faction to join you in your quest to protect your demon train as it travels through the tracks on its way to relight the pyres of hell. At each stop you'll face a boss and its minions. You'll play cards to bring out minions of your own. The object of each level is to keep the angelic minions from reaching the top of the train and destroying the last pyre of hell.

Okay, it may sound a touch confusing, but it's super easy to learn.

If you like deck building games, as I do, you'll probably like Monster Train. Each game can take up to an HOUR to play through, so it's similar to a digital board game in many respects. Maybe you make it to the pyres and relight them, probably you'll get killed by Fel ... or that ass with the bombs. But you WILL have fun along the way.

*I have edited this review based on what people have commented. I also want to point that this is my opinion of the game. If you like, great. Keep playing. I found it a little stale. 

The game is far too easy (beat it on my 2nd try, and then again very easily on Covenant 1 and Covenant 2) and using the only viable strategy I found to win. Boss fights work by having the boss constantly attack on each level until your units or the boss dies. This means to win you need units that can take a punch with a damage unit behind it.
There is only one final boss and all the fights are always the same making this game stale very quick. I didn't bother to unlock much (unlocked other races and a few cards) as this game got boring in about 6 hours. 

The lack of variety and the game play isn't necessarily bad. Actually the game is fun but not at the current cost. This game is worth maybe $10 for the content and replay value.",1590253089,1590342374,FALSE,9,12,0.41441685,5,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,219,1,2072,114,381,1601863040,,

I do feel like Slay the Spire is the more elegant, timeless game of the two, but Monster Train has a lot going for it in terms of build diversity with the varied clans and their synergies. It takes many notes from it's predecessor, and while in some regards it does things worse, in many ways it offers some interesting new ideas, like upgrading cards and the multi-floor strategic layer. Monster Train may be a bit more cluttered in it's design, but it is definitely scratching the same itch as Slay the Spire. 

RNG is still king here, but in many ways I feel it's a bit more manageable. Runs are not super long in general, and the graphics and sound design are top notch. It warms by cynical heart that the goal of the game is to save Hell from oblivion, and that the 'Winged' (aka Angels) who have frozen Hell over are depicted in such a dark manner. The lore tidbits attached to cards make for an interesting read, something I feel StS lacks. I do hope future games in the genre take notes from some of the design choices made here.

Finally, it arrived in a Monster Train of all things. This is it, and it's great. Similar in many ways, but also definitelly different. 11 hours in I'm hooked.

While many aspects feel very familiar - like drawing cards and using energy to play those in your hand, discarding, exhausting; ways of gaining energy, healing, blocking; events with choices that are not always obvious, some risk/reward; attacking enemies, giving buffs, debuffs, status effects etc. synnergies and combinations that can sometimes get broken (as in, op)...
While all that familiarity, there is a main fresh aspect in having 3 train rooms, from bottom to top where you put your minions to protect and fight enemies (spawning on the other side), cast spells etc. and final room with pyre (your final health) to protect. A little tower defense twist that makes a big difference.
So fighting feels pretty distinct, and it works.
Also the ammount of content seems to be pretty big: after 11 hours of gameplay, I have only 3 clans unlocked out of 5, none of the clans have all the cards unlocked yet and I have seen less than half of relics (here called artefacts).

On the downside, contentwise - there appear to be less fights and bosses compared to StS, but still there are some random variants that are different from playthrough to playthrough.
Not to mention multiplayer that I have not even touched, so all in all I feel I'm getting more than mu monyes worth, as at 11 hours I am only on thebeginning of this Monster Train journey that is just very fun. There is many strategies and tactics to be discovered, cards and artefacts to unlock, covenant levels to climb (StS ascention counterpart - 25 levels here of increasing difficulty.

And did I mention that everytging looks beautiful, with good music and high degree of polish? 
At this point, I can't tell if this game is great, or only very good - I'll need to spend much longer with it to discover if it will stand the test of time, the way Slay the Spire did, being still fun and interesting after hundrets of hours.

Multiplayer worked fine from what I've played, it is a real-time time attack mode against other players.

My only complaint so far is that once you start climbing difficulty levels, there is a nonzero chance you may just have to immediately restart a game if unsynergistic cards are added into your starting deck.

Also possibly a pro or a con, getting a win usually involves some kind of absurd stat scaling.
One game I was able to stack 16 double spell damage debuffs to one shot the final boss, another time I stealthed my main team for 20 turns, so I could kill the bosses undetected.

The card upgrades become much more significant as they do not provide a linear increase in power curve (like they do in Slay the Spire), but a much more dramatic step change.    These are still necessary to move forward, which means that the power curve of the enemies is much more dramatic than it is in Slay the Spire.  This isn't necessarily a problem, but it results in progression feeling a bit odd at times.

The other issue I have is that the game simply doesn't feel that long.   A single run is only 10-15 battles I think?  That's significantly less than what you would find in Spire.   I think this may be related to the power curve, because, if they let you progress much farther there would be no chance of maintaining balance.

The developers have no qualms about the fact that this game was inspired by slay the spire (going as far as offering a 20% discount for STS owners at launch), but has a huge number of variations to make it a different game on its own. There is an extra element of strategy involved in unit placement (borrowed from tower defence games) which can make or break your run. In one of my runs, I got destroyed by a boss because I forgot that he can directly climb from floor 3 to floor 1 and floor 2 had my most powerful units. Apart from this, there are 5 clans at launch, with a number of cards to unlock and get this, you get to play not as 1, but as 2 clans at the same time, which means that there are 20 combinations possible. 
The game seems fairly balanced and you can customise cards depending on your run, during the course of the run. How many times have you thought, in STS, man do I wish this card cost 1 energy less, well, you can do that in this game. With some card combinations it's possible to breeze through the run, only to have the game kick you in your balls and tell you bitch, you ain't shit.

You are guaranteed upgrades and bonuses before each fight instead of going back to back fights with no resting period. This doesn’t make the game easier though.

The added layer of 'tower defense' strategy adds a lot to the gameplay itself.

I've never felt totally screwed when it comes to RNG, except with a specific encounter when playing Umbra late game. The clan system is genius, and I would absolutely pay for a clan dlc, since even a single one would add so much depth to the game. Though the bosses don't change, their modifiers do, so its usually important to take note before getting a deck going, so you know what you'll be up against. Some may see this as a problem, but I take no issue with the bosses, as the tactics used to approach them usually differs.

65,Monster Train,69678813,english,"This is basically Slay the Spire in another skin, and that's a good thing!
Okay, okay, to be fair, the combat in this game is a bit unique, as you have 3 layers of combat field and a heart to defend, so it's more like Slay the Spire + Artifact. Still, you build a deck, decide what goodies to pick up, you create synergies or at least you hope you do, etc. etc. - a roguelike deck builder.

There's a fair amount of replay value and I really like the combat to deck building ratio. In Slay the Spire, you often just get stuck in a string of 3-4 fights back-to-back when you just want to get to the next ? room. In Monster Train, you get to do these miscellaneous stuff after each and every fight, guaranteed and with how long the fights are, I feel like this is paced perfectly. Quantity wise, I think there's more cards to mix and experiment with than StS, but slightly less miscellaneous stuff like mystery rooms and artifacts (which are this game's equivalent of StS' relics).

The production values are particularly noteworthy, everything is crisply animated and well drawn. On the flipside, the music does not grab me whatsoever. It's a game about a fantasy Hell army riding a train through hell to fight some angel and instead of some kind of powerful metal or what-have-you, there's just a random, whimsical fairy tale soundscaping going on and it doesn't have anything memorable. The voices are kind of phoned in, too, and one particular winged angel boss will make your household think you're blasting porn on your PC with maxed volume.

14,Monster Train,69680722,english,"Monster Train is a Rogue-Like deck building with elements of a tower defense game. Hell has frozen over, can you take it back?

Monster Train utilizes RNG to distribute its many cards to the player after encounters/events. The unique take of Monster Train is that you can choose what two clans of units you can see throughout your run. This leaves up to 20 different variations of builds that can be tried out.

There are 5 types of clans, which can be described if anyone has played Magic The Gathering (MTG) as such.

The Clans Are as Such:
 1. Hellhorned 

The Hellhorned playstyle is based on aggression, cards are heavy hitters with low health. However some card effects may grant armor to combat the low health. This would be compared to playing White or Red decks in Magic.

 2. Awoken

You like to build up tank units and make the enemy kill themselves on your units? The Awoken are for you. With Awoken units you can buff yourself with healing items to buff the strength of your units, and build around multi-hitters and sweeper units to keep defense high and attacker protected. This is compared to playing Green decks in Magic, or Defense Ironclad in Slay The Spire.

[spoiler] 3. Stygian Guard

Magic and Spells are your best friends! With this clan you have units that utilize their buffs when playing spell cards. This clan can be utilized with discard synergy to help get the deck moving. Compared to playing Blue in Magic, and Silent in StS. [/spoiler]

[spoiler] 4. Umbra

C O N S U M E. You will be sacrificing units to power up units to grant special powers, by either eating said units or sacrifice larger ones to make space for the small ones. This clan is about making super powered units for fights, alongside play space and spells to get as many units consumed. This is a hard clan to compare to for a single color in magic, but would work as a Blue/Green deck, as this can also be compared to Defect with its orbs in StS. [/spoiler]

[spoiler] 5. Melting Remnant

Melting away to comeback stronger, with a heated passion for battle, these Wax fighters will burn away during the fight. The death can be delayed with other cards, or if one desires, instant death. The clan strives on death, as units power themselves up when other allies and enemies die on the floor. The twist is that you can bring back your fallen units to fight again, powered up this time. It is necromancy at its finest. It is compared to playing a Black deck in Magic. [/spoiler]

Outstanding/Not-satisfying Aspects:
1. Game Mechanic: 9/10
Though against the first expression, its game experience is not quite like Slay the Spire, but more similar to Hearthstone. It's all about choices between the health of the core and minions exchange, tricks to turn the tide, and positioning. And, thanks to that, you'll get LOTS of decisions to make in EACH battle. Lets say, that should be what we call it strategy, er?
2. UI/graphics: 5/10
I might be harsh, but I really think the UI and the graphics can use more details. assets repetition, and the UI that doesn't fit into the tone of the back ground. I admit that in the most of the time I was focused on the numbers and waiting eagerly to see the result of the combat, but that doesn't mean that the graphic is not important. With such a outstanding game mechanic, it would definitely be better with polished graphics.
3. Number balance: -
I don't want to judge the balance of a game by only two runs (and yes, I cleared the game in the second) but, given you can easily get about 5 to 10 times higher damage/ healing with a single card update, you really won't want to have ANY useless not-upgraded card in your deck, or you'll have to face minions with 5 to 10 times higher atk/hp with them. I'm not saying it's not good , but I do think there could be more love for those who want to check more cards before settling the winning strategy of their decks.

However, once I got to play the released version, it did not take me long to realise that the game is absolutely imbalanced and even outside of incredible luck with the RNG (which yes, it's a deck-builder game, it's expected to a certain degree, but in this case it's absolutely ridiculous), there are only a couple viable ""builds"" or ""strategies"" that are capable of winning a run.

Either you are able to create a beat stack in one room, which is capable of outlasting the incredibly exponentially-scaling enemies and especially bosses (while there only a couple options which ""exponentially"" increase the player's capability to keep up with the nonsense), or you manage to get a rare cheese combo of effects that allow the absolutely pathetic damage spells to nuke the boss.

Not to mention that you are forced to start with a ""dual-land"" deck, in a game, where synergies between the 5 available card factions are very lacking.

Overall I truly hope the ""balance"" gets addressed in one way or another (nerfing the enemies/bosses, buffing most of the cards and faction mechanics or slowing down the pace and adding more ""rings"" to Hell, in order to smooth out the scaling curve, etc.)

- There are five factions, but you start each run with a combination of two of them, which greatly increases the number of possible starting archetypes.  This is a big plus for players who like to switch between different styles of play frequently.

- Each turn in Monster Train has more mechanical depth than a typical StS turn.  In general, you have a greater range of choices available .  This is balanced by the fact that the total number of turns over the course of the run will be less.

- The game provides a lot more advance information to guide your strategic choices than StS.  There's still a lot of randomness in terms of what you'll have available to build your run, but you can reliably choose to prioritize different types of deck improvements.  One big thing is that it tells you what type of debuff the final boss of the run will apply, which is critical to consider in order to build a successful run.

- The different factions are thematically quite interesting, with very different mechanical gimmicks and lots of opportunities for crazy powerful synergies.

- The game is challenging and has an extensive 'ascension' equivalent mechanic to scale the difficulty as you gain experience in how to play, which I've barely scratched the surface on.

Depending on who you take as the Allied Clan, your playstyle will very much vary with each of the combinations between the 5 different clans - on top of that, your choice of starting upgrade for your Leader Monster and starting Relic will most likely create your playstyle for that specific run, simply because you want to exploit the ability of your Leader Monster and the Relic as much as possible.

This is a total 'yes, buy it' from me. It can only get better with some potential DLC or quality of life improvements like more cutscene events and what not for varied outcomes.

Small note, currently when I write this review, there's been some issues with server-contacting that caused game crashes for a lot of people - this does seem to have been fixed now because I do not have those issues anymore, however as with any newly-released game, there might be some minor bug issues or other such technical problems, although I'd call them all merely negligible issues currently and very much not something you should take too strongly to heart.",1590245203,1590245203,TRUE,1,0,0.523809552,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,376,2,2599,0,849,1600085359,,

There are 2 types of upgrades, one for minions and one for spells, and you can apply any upgrade to any cards of that type. Do you have a spell that deals damage Х times? You can upgrade it with +10 damage, and it will deal Х times 10 damage more. Do you have a unit that deals a lot of damage? Give it multistrike. Want to sacrifice you imps? Give them endless so they are returned to your deck instead of being removed until the end of the battle.

Synergies are well thought out and directly rewarding for your forethought and investment in them. Most importantly synergies no longer rely completely chance and can be planned accordingly.

It's incredibly fun to start with the champion or an item and think 'oh cool I could do this'.

Simply just play it to see the potential.
Slay the spire was good, even if honestly I was not really into this game but into other clones (especially because of the artstyle that disturb me) but not only...And yes there are lot of good clones despite what I usually see everywhere on Steam (and elsewhere) !

A short list for STS nice clones...
[list]
[*] Knock on the coffin lid
[*] Dreamgate/Fate hunters (same devs)
[*] Neoverse
[*] Deep in the forest
[*] Deck of ashes
[*] Pirates outlaws
[*] Red mist
[*] Etc etc etc...

[*] And of course...Monster Train on top of it.
[/list]

I won't go much into developping about the game (many already did it for sure).
But even playing it a little and you'll found out it is a great game (with many choices, that could change a looooot your games).
There is also a demo if you want to try it for free (and if I'm correct you could keep your save for the complete game (if you didn't fail the last one of course)).

My (early) rating -> 9/10

Unlike many of the games of this genre which I've played (mostly on ios), a run in this is a lot shorter which means over time the deck feels more and more tailored/controlled as opposed to the RNG-ness of others. I'd like to call out the length in this game specifically because it's very well paced. A lot of these type of games last too long and allow you to go overboard with the deck/items which isn't a bad thing, but in my opinion makes the genre less strategic and more random, so this is one thing this game excels at.

Aside from gameplay, the art direction and music is also very good. Overall I'd say this is a very polished game that will keep you entertained for a while especially in bite sized runs/playthroughs.

I even think that the game is a little bit more immersive than STS due to its artstyle, at least for me. For example, you battle in 3 lanes and have to act more strategically. On the other hand, it's a mix between spells and minions and one particular hero per ""class"". The class system looks promising because you can build mixed classes and play around with different combinations. Furthermore, the classes itself provide strong diversification based on how you evolve your hero.

Really digging this game right now.  Plays a lot like Slay the Spire, but slimmed down and streamlined in the rogue-like department, and with a much more robust and fleshed out battle system.  Instead of choosing your path one encounter at a time, you just select one of two tracks, each of which will offer you 2-4 beneficial encounters (shops, healing, etc.) before meeting at the middle with a battle.

57,Monster Train,69641536,english,"OK. I have perhaps 20 reviews of Steam games. More than half are good reviews, and a sprinkling of games that didn't meet up to my expectations.

I won't review a game until I have played it enough to learn it. It doesn't do YOU any good if I am making half-assed comments about the game, and I don't understand the mechanics.

OK...let's start with the graphics and polish. Similar to Hearthstone, with bright colors and sharp detail. Sounds are excellent, and the presentation is very good.

But...I don't care about graphics. I still play Master of Magic, and the original X-Com. I am all about the gameplay.

I keep discovering new things about the game. As I blasted past the two hour refund point, I never hesitated. I knew that this game had legs, and was a keeper, and will be a favorite of mine for a very long time.

I don't have anything to fault here. If you win, it is very, VERY satisfying. I have had 25 ""runs"", and have one just once. It's a roguelike, and the stars have to align for this to happen.

I think that what I enjoy most is the sense of progression. Even if you lose, you gain experience in your main army, and the secondary army you choose. Play enough games, and you unlock levels, and unlocking levels unlocks more cards, better cards, and a better chance to progress deeper in your next game.

There are five armies in the game, with two unlocked at the start. After 15 hours of gameplay, I just unlocked the fifth one..so everything is unlocked.

After my one and only victory, the challenge level increased. I didn't realize it, but I was getting smoked pretty good. In complete honesty, I am not great at strategy games....but I am doing OK here, trying to figure out the synergies and relationships between the cards.

There are MANY variables on each run through. I haven't begun to believe that I have remotely seen the content. Under 10% at this point. This game can be played for hundreds of hours, and still have unique combinations and synergies uncovered.

Each run starts with a base set of cards, and some standard, non-army specific cards using generic units. There are units and spells, and each has their own purchase price. You can increase the cost or their efficacy, or make them stronger at the risk of consuming them - one shot. If you don't use all the cards in your hand, they go into your discard pile, to be recycled. 

This really is a terrific gaming system. My grandson was looking over my shoulder as I played earlier today..he's ten, but smart, really smart, like his mom. I think the Bank of Grandpa is going to kick in here....",1590203788,1590203788,TRUE,24,2,0.62021023,1,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,327,21,4476,0,903,1591669222,,

Pesky angels and holy knights? Not on my Hell train!!!

Can't talk about deckbuilding without naming Slay the Spire. Monster train takes on the formula and brings tower-defense elements to make it all the more intense.
- Instead of a hero fighting a couple of enemies for its life, you now have waves of monsters relentlessly walking toward the end of the path to kill you.
- Balance your deck well: Summons will invoke a champion (like a tower) to guard a part of the path. Enchant to make them stronger. Use spells for instant profit. Remove or upgrade cards at the shop to improve your deck ... all the good parts of a deckbuilder are here.
- The world in-between fights has been simplified: 2 choices every time, no long term consequences. No need to plan 10 turns in advance where you want to go, you have more urgent problems to deal with.
- ""Want +400 gold? Sure, but in the next fight, the enemies will fully heal every turn."" featuring plenty of terrible choices for greedy players like you and me
- You want more pressure? There's intense minibosses battles at the end of every waves. You won't have time to rest.

28,Monster Train,69628604,english,"I've checked out the few bad reviews, and I'd like to counter some of those points since they don't allow comments. If you're on the fence this is for you. One person says the game is too hard, after spending only a couple hours trying it, well it will take you a few runs to get good, it's that simple. The game is not too hard, it's less RNG dependant than STS just from the fact that you can see the specific final boss you will need to prepare for as soon as the run begins, no more making it to act 3 with a 0-cost deck only to see Time Snail as the 3rd act boss who will 100% counter you. There are 25 levels bumping up the difficulty and you can win on lower levels even with no knowledge and bad strategies, just don't expect to win every run unless you get better. 

Someone else complains the final boss that gives your units ""Sap 3"" and that makes them unable to attack, which just isn't true. Sap lowers stats a tiny bit temporarily, and you can tell if the final boss will know Sap as soon as the run begins, so you can simply use bigger guys who can be useful despite being sapped.

Another bad review claims there's ""No strategy"", claiming enemies spawn on you with no warning what type they'll be or what they will do. Well that's wrong, before every single fight you get a screen where you can see and mouse over the enemy types that will spawn, and learn EXACTLY what stats they have and how they will behave (and learn their lore as to why they do that). It also claims RNG decides if your starting cards are useful or useless, which again is not true, as the game has a 100% guarantee your first card is your Champion (usually one of your best cards) and also a guarantee of a 2nd Unit. In fact, the game has a pool of ""worthless"" starting cards that will NEVER be in your starting hand, which completely counters the argument that RNG solely decides if your starting hand is good or bad.

This specific review also trolls by pretending there are no build strategies, in the same breath as saying they haven't unlocked most cards yet. Base STS has maybe 25 build styles total, like The Defect can win through a couple of Orb deck types, a turtle build, or Powers build, or 0-cost card build, or maybe if you're insane and lucky Claw, and then you get more build types with the other 3 characters of course. Well, I'll explain more below, but suffice to say that base Monster Train has very clear builds, supported by using cards and artifacts that lead to a strategy and build. Like, you can get 2 different artifacts for the Hellhorn clan that give armor to units, and then many units can generate their own armor, and spells grant armor, and there's the win condition spell just like Slay The Spire that converts armor directly into a huge amount of damage for you. The 2-clan system improves build variety immensely, for example Armor-build can sub-class Stygian because there are units in that clan that gain armor, even 1 that gives armor to all your units every time you cast a spell, and that class can even buff your spell's final damage output, letting you one-shot a boss with proper prep work, just like STS's armor build. It can also work well with Melting Remnant, as that clan has an Artifact that gives armor to units as well, or with Awoken, as you can protect that units gaining armor behind big bulkly tanks that can be healed cheap, or with Umbra, which lets you give units damage shields to take damage while the armor keeps building up, and offers plentiful buffs and ways to manipulate energy and how much space you can use to fill with units. Let's just say the build variety not only exists, but it also overshadows base STS by a massive degree in just how many ways you can build.

This is an amazing game, personally, it passes Slay The Spire, and that's coming from someone with over 300 hours of Slay The Spire on Steam. Deceptively simple at first, you get to mix 2 of 5 clans for your run, and the 2 unlocked at the start are very simple, which each unlocked clan being more complex than the last. After spending 20 hours in the demo I knew I needed the game, but after 18 hours in the main game I'm now sure I'll be playing this for hundreds of hours.

Not only can you curve your difficulty through 25 Covenants (think Ascensions from STS), but you can curve your complexity by picking a combo that is simpler/harder. STS lets you play as Ironclad for a straightforward game where you heal a bit after rounds so small mistakes are forgiven, and then later classes are more complex, this is true. However, in Monster Train there's 20 different starting combos with a wide variety of complexities in this game, you can go Hellhorn+Awoken for a very simple game where you probably win (if you're at the Covenant difficulty for your skill level) just by putting DPS behind tanks, and then using simple buffs and heals and damage spells to keep your guys alive and kill the other guys. You can rank the complexity up just a little, but example Hellhorn+Stygian makes magic a huge priority, in fact winning with only 2 or 3 units in the deck with the rest being spells is not unthinkable, this is a bit more complex than the last example but the simplicity of the Hellhorns make using the Stygian gimmicks easier, and the two classes share some natural synergy through shared use of the Armor mechanic and lots of damage spells synergy in Stygian supporting the Hellhorn's powerful fire spells. If you want complexity, you can jump straight to the final classes and go for something like Melting Remnants+Umbra, making a build where timing things is key, proper placement of your units is essential, using cards in the right order is relevant, and building a deck that minimizes RNG is vital. This is a perfect game for tailoring it to what you want, you can be very skilled and still have the choice between 20 very hard run combos, just with different complexity levels and combos for each one. Each of the 5 clans has at least 3 solid paths to win with, for example, Hellhorn can win by stacking armor up and using spells that damage based on armor, or they can win by using many high damage units hitting over and over in the most basic style possible, or you can build up your Champion to do insane damage while other units take the hits to protect him, and once you unlock enough of the extra cards and Artifacts for this clan, you can build an Imp deck, using token units and synergies to do hilarious strong things at a level more complex than the class allows at first. The most important thing to note, though, is that you get 2 clans, which means with the right build, each of the 20 combos can strive for an absolute minimum of 6 winning builds, given each class has at least 3. Playing Hellhorn doesn't lock you to winning only through basic strategies or imps, if you sub-class as the Stygian, you can find their cards and Artifacts, allowing you to win through strategies like extremely high damage spells, or status effect damage ticking over and over, or buffing units through abilities that trigger on spell use while your units do the killing, or discarding and drawing cards to not only get you to the cards you want that turn while in the process activate certain card's abilities through discarding them. There is a LOT of valid potential for every clan, and with 20 combos to choose from you can play for 100+ hours without running out of new win conditions to try. Especially with the scaling of Covenants, you can win with wacky strategies that are weaker simply by scaling back the difficulty in order to give you a fair chance, or you can pump the difficulty up because you want to use the OP strats that would obliterate enemies at lower difficulties while still being fun.

It's hard to put into words everything I like about this game without forming a 5-page thesis. I'll just list off my favorite things.

Game has StS-like Ascensions: 25 of them. 
I've only seen Ascension 1 thus far ""Gain 5 random cards at the start of the game"" and its already awesome. Bad on paper, but forcing you to take some of those cards, good or bad, and use them synergistically and remove the rest from your deck is such a cool idea.

5 Classes, and you can choose 1 sub-class alongside your main class so you get cards from both classes. It does take a bit too long imo to unlock all the classes, but the sub-class mechanic is awesome. 10 total unique combinations is almost as good as 10 classes.

The upgrade system is cool too, definitely dig it. You buy various upgrades from a shop and tack them onto a minion or spell, up to 2 upgrades normally.

I think the most satisfying part of the game is that things can really spiral and become very overpowered. Even when you could topple the biggest bosses, there's other enemies that have a particular gimmick that counters typical play and you have to anticipate or play around them, which is the enemy design I really enjoyed from StS.",1590181761,1590181761,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,265,50,1622,0,218,1592851125,,

The mechanics are crazy cool, the game achieves this super weird (and probably really hard to pull off) split that almost every upgrade you get seems super powerful when it's actually well balanced. Your cards get out of control at the same pace that the difficulty ramps up, super quick, and as a result the next upgrade-and-battle-phase feels like a rush. Real ""just one more turn"" vibe from this!
the great art goes hand-in-hand with the over-the-top mechanics, and details such as the train you're playing on actually being animated to move at what feels like breakneck speed add a sweet sense of urgency to the gameplay, which is then exacerbated by the very pushy, absolutely *banging* soundtrack!

61,Monster Train,69621364,english,"(This is written based mostly on having played public beta for several weeks, prior to release) 

If you played Slay the Spire, this is very familiar, only that you're the spire and are in a train, rolling your way through all the rings hell, right to where the heart of hell itself used to reside. Your mission is to bring a fragment of the heart, the ""Pyre"", to rekindle the flames of a barren and frozen hell, while the stubborn (evil?) Winged try to stop your train and constantly attack you. 
Yup, THAT's the setting. 

Mechanically the game is very similar to slay the spire as I said, but there's a big difference in the fact that you summon units that auto-battle for you, through 3 different levels stacked vertically. The Winged (enemies) troops try to ascend all the levels past your units, to get to the top where your Pyre is, then they attack it (if it's completely destroyed, GAME OVER). Inbetween battles you gather new cards, power up those already in the deck, or get artifacts (akin to relics in Slay the Spire). 
The powerups are very interesting too, btw. You have 2 slots to put improvements to cards like +attack or +HP to units, extra damage on spells, reduced ""ember"" costs (mana), etc. There are some more interesting, like being able to recast an ability each turn, and those become really fun if you learn to use them (and manage to find them, too).


The game has great attention to detail, solid mechanics inspired in Slay the Spire with very nice and fun-ctional additions that make it really unique! Also some interesting lore that has picked my interest, nice and fun interactions and combos, etc. 

Overall a very great game, with many more aspects I'd love to talk about , but I'll keep it in a short summary here
-Theres 5 factions, you play one as ""main"" and other as an ""ally"", which gives you the champion of the main faction and then you can get extra support cards from both factions. Overall 20 combinations (for any of the 5 factions, you can ally with any of the resting 4, 5x4=20 possible combinations with different synergies and strategies).
-Besides usual standard play, with an increasing difficulty with the ""covenant"" system (similar to ascension), there's daily runs with different mutators, custom runs, and even some semi-multiplayer where you are playing the same run at the same time as other players. Real time, same seeded run with the same options, competing for the biggest score. 
-There was a period of open Beta with similar content to the current demo, available for a couple months prior to release. All free, and pretty polished even then! I bet the demo is still available now, so feel free to try the game (only 2 of the 5 clans, and only 1 covenant is possible, but it's pretty fun just by itself!)
-Devs used to do a weekly stream in the ""Good Shepherd"" channels (youtube and twitch), showing new content and being in contact with the community. Also on Discord! Hopefully this tradition will continue in some form, giving us updates of the coming features post-release! They have been very active and responsive of feedback on the past, I'm sure it'll still be that way and we'll get updates :D

PS: I love the setting of playing as devils and other spawns from hell, but also being the ""good guys"" under attack instead of playing on the side of ""big evil"". Seems like a very original setting!",1590174236,1590174236,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,521,9,2715,75,1003,1600966514,,

69,Monster Train,69617553,english,"I'm a fan of tower defense games and deck builders, so this game was right up my alley. There are some interactions that the game does a poor job of telling you about, (example: spell weakness causes a unit to take the damage of a spell X more times, where X is stacks of spell weakness, but a card does 1 damage 5 times, does spell weakness proc on the first instance of damage, or the whole spell? The answer is the whole spell, but I had to just play it out and see). There are a few examples outside of card interactions that just playing is the only way to learn, like learning that you can enter a shop, leave it, then come back later as long as you haven't moved on to the next fight.

Some nitpicks I have are things like the champion not changing appearance with different upgrades, lots of units look almost entirely the same, things like that. I would have enjoyed the polish of seeing your champion evolve in its art or more diverse looking units, but these are small things.

Up to this point I have talked about things I don't like, and I hope no one reads those criticisms and sees a bad game. I love the balance of the game and the way the difficulty evolves with the covenant system! The game can be as easy as ""pay attention and you'll win"" if you want with covenant off, and when I just want a relaxing play I do covenant 1, which is another thing I love: Early access to huge variability in how you start. I find that the most fun part of the game is just starting out on a double random run, examining my deck and figuring out where I want to go with it.
The compartmentalized upgrade system with units and spells makes you feel like an absolute genius, and in a break away from other deck builder games there is no shortage of opportunities to really streamline your deck and prune it to your liking (early drop 2/dupe 1 abound), which really puts the onus on the player.

86,Monster Train,69612569,english,"TL;DR: All-in-all a decent game - certaintly not bad, but also not outstanding... (don't expect a second ""Slay the Spire"")

Monster Train iterates on the Rogue-like deckbuilding formula, and does a decent job at that. However some special ""spice"" seems to be missing to make it the smash-hit its (obvious) rolemodel ""Slay the Spire"" was: And after a few games I'm can begin to narrow it down a bit:

* The ""map"" hurts the game quite a bit - after each fight you get to choose between two goody-filled paths, followed by the next fight. Where in ""Slay the Spire"" deciding what path to go down was a game element on its own (play it safe with a campfire, gamble with ""?"",  or go high-risk to the miniboss even though you are low on HP). In Monster Train you could replace the map with a popup ""Which goodies do you want before the next fight? A or B?""

* The fights themselves are entertaining but the enemies rather lack variety. It mostly boils down to ""this one has extra armor, this one has extra health, you can't hit this one for a bit"" - there are few deep strategic elements involved.

* Balancing is rather out-of-whack. You can upgrade your spells and units (which is neat), but there the problems begin to show: one the most common upgrades for your spells simply adds 10 damage - and since your base spell does 2 damage by default this results in a 5-fold increase... which you need since enemies scale to match. After a few fights doing 2 damage is next to meaningless. On the other hand some upgrades are simply overpowered: after the 2nd fight I had a 1-cost, 3 ""size"" unit that delivered 28 damage per attack... and attack 3 times per turn. An encounter allowed to clone that card 5 times - and no enemy unit in the game posed any kind of challenge anymore.

I don't know about the longevity (at this point), but much to my surprise I'd say I like this even more than I did Slay the Spire at this point and I thought it was great.
There are different cards per class like in Slay, here though you get to cast a champion of your primary class (each is different) which along with the class cards (primary and secondary class) really mixes things up further and adds to the enjoyment.  Then before each level's boss fight you get a decent upgrade and you get a choice of which upgrade you want.  You get opportunities to upgrade cards and your hero as you go really allowing you to try different tactics.  
I've got plenty to try yet, but so far each system/approach seems to be quite viable assuming you make good decisions.  It seems far more likely of a positive outcome than bad luck that could hit you in Slay, some bosses in Slay could deal out mega damage.  In this game some bosses have mega health, but you can work towards a combination to eat into that.

39,Monster Train,69599242,english,"Slay the Spire with slightly more complex combat? Yes pls.

Oh did... did you need more than ""a good variant of Slay the Spire?""
Uh... well... alright... there are quite a few other solid strengths:

Each of the Clans feel not only unique, but actually have strengths that match along with them. I won't go into too much detail here, as I feel discovering them is part of the fun, but each covenant unlock has been a surprising new addition.

The combat is satisfying, doesn't feel painfully repetitive, and actually involves some decision making. It's important to note, this *will not be evident in your first few plays*, because...

The game gets progressively harder the more you win, rather than easier the more you lose. You are expected to complete the delivery and ""win"" the first few times. You might even, if you're an experienced card game enthusiast, find yourself winning easily your first three or four times. However, the game has a brilliant ""it gets harder"" mechanic in the form of Covenant level, which makes the game progressively more difficult each time you win. The important thing here is that each Covenant rank does not simply say ""enemies are more powerful"". They will add some new mechanics, some bits to mess up your deck design, more enemies, etc. It is not strictly ""and then +10% to all enemy stats"". The result is something surprisingly exciting to see what new roadblock will be added, and it makes winning not only possible, but good and rewarding.

Ultimately, is this game of the year? No, probably not. Will you have fun for it's reasonable price tag? If you like Slay the Spire, Roguelikes, or card games in general, then yes, most likely. Give the demo a try if you're in doubt!

Positive (+)

+ Easy to grasp the fundamental game mechanics & Smooth introduction of additional features

+ Huge complexity & depth once you unlock more cards & deck types

+ Multiplayer custom challenges, daily challenges, leaderboards

+ The amount of unlockables is really high and feels motiviating

+ Different characters & allied clans bring a lot of variety options to choose from when beginning a new run


Neutral (>) 

> The soundtrack is fitting & accompanies the different levels & bosses individually


Negative (-)

- No steam-workshop support (yet)

- An art-style which you need to get used to. I do not like it (hugely subjective though)


Overall: If you like slay the spire or card-battlers in general this game is a no brainer. HUGE replay value and a lot of fun. Even though I do not like the art style this should not stop you from buying and enjoying this game. If you are unsure, try the game. A full run takes you about ~1hours15minutes.

78,Monster Train,69587448,english,"The presentation is great, and the mechanics are a good blend of solid foundations and fresh ideas.

One thing I love is that you start each run by picking 2 of 5 factions whose cards will form your deck. This gives 20 possible combinations (the 1st faction determines which champion unit you start with, so order matters), which gives both a lot of variety, while keeping it manageable. However, this could be very difficult to balance well, unlike Slay the Spire where each faction has a very well tuned deck. Ultimately time will tell how it works as they continue to balance the game in its early stages.

If you love this genre, you'll at least find this game interesting, and if you have not given it a shot before, it is a good enough introduction.

Longer Version - It has the challenge for those looking for it, much like ascension mode from STS. The different faction combos are a lot of fun and change up the game quite a bit from run to run. You may have a spell heavy run with 1-combo, a minion heavy combo with another, or vice versa. The mechanics are familiar (besides the 'Morsel' mechanic, which is one I haven't seen before, but is a lot of fun) and the game's ability to summarize the outcome of a turn (sometimes a turn that lasts upwards of 100 attacks) at a single glance mean that all the strategy is still there, but people new to this sort of game and veterans alike will be able to determine the outcome of a played card to a much more effective degree. It's tough to explain in a Steam review, but it's honestly amazing from a design standpoint given the amount of information that is being calculated from various abilities across a ton of different units. The designers and programmers deserve a serious high five for this.

I was drawn to this by Northernlion's series on it. It's a ton of fun to watch and it's a blast to play. I'm 6 hours into it, but from my experience with it and my love of the genre, this may just be an early GOTY contender for me.

If you’re into deck-building rogue-lites, this is going to scratch all your itches. 

Monster Train, a game with a really terrible name, but some of the best gameplay mechanics in the deck-building genre. A unique gameplay loop that feels immediately like a combination of Slay the Spire and Darkest Dungeon, coupled with so much polish I can see my face in it makes for pretty good time. The most unique thing Monster Train brings to the table is certainly its floor-to-floor card synergies. Messing with the way units play together to create angle-ass-blasting combos is the most fun I’ve had with a deck-builder in a while. Unique upgrades and artifact interactions allow for a lot more varied loop than something like Slay the Spire, which can start to feel stale due to the lack of variance in effective-deck building. Monster Train seems like it has a LOT to give in the replayability department, three hours in and I have barely scratched the surface of card unlocks and have only played with 3 of the clans. 

All in all, I think Monster Train is very good and has a ton of depth and flavor to it. Heavily inspired by the genre-king Slay the Spire, but with a few key mechanics that make it addictive and unique.

The gameplay loop is fun, strategic, challenging, and there's plenty to progress through. Even though I have a list of cons, I absolutely recommend this game if you enjoyed STS.

Cons (So far):
-Art style isn't for everyone and there's no visible progression of making a card stronger
-You're on a train. Not really sure what the lore is there but not really a griping or immersive setting.
-The background is also very bland, the colors aren't the best.
-Animations also aren't very exciting, all very simple attack animations NOTHING exciting about how the characters move or attack.
-Lack of varying enemy type. The enemy's all look the same to me, I only pay attention to their stats.
-Not many bosses. I've done 4-5 completed runs and have seen every boss.

Personally, I find the idea of multiplayer intriguing and it's execution is actually really well done...

Each combination of clans (there are 5, you pick 2 to start) plays quite differently from each other, some synergize well, some don't but you can usually eke out some unusual strategy if you try hard enough.  On top of that there's a goodly collection of artifacts, clanless cards and other bits and pieces to give a massive amount of combinatorial variety.  Everything is pretty well balanced, with space to find things that seem (but aren't) completely brokenly powerful, which is always fun.

If Artifact was Slay the Spire
and if Artifact was a good game. 

You have 3 train carts stacking upwards, that you must fill with your own minions to defeat the onslaught of enemies. there are 5?(not sure if any hidden) classes, you always play as 2, one as your main which chooses your champion, and one as support which lets you get cards and power ups from that class, as well as the choice of minions from the support too. 

Initially the game feels great, but not super hard, but i feel the real normal game is the first ""ascension"" or as they call it covenant (similar to slay the spires ascension mode, but goes up to 25 instead of 20).  It makes enemies much more difficult and allows for less greedy builds at the start but still allows you to get great combos. 

Ive played 4 of the 5 classes. 3 of them seem really great, they synergize with each other. The odd one out feels pretty far out. the class im talking about is the 3rd unlock/magic water class (forgot the name). it may be similar to slay where its hard to make a good deck until you learn all the cards and what fits where but its a struggle to get through the early game with them as support or main, since they really only seem to synergize with themselves.

75,Monster Train,69571129,english,"This sure as [i]hell[/i] came out of nowhere. I learnt about this game only a week before its release, so it was all the more pleasant to discover just how outstanding it came to be. Everything about Monster Train oozes quality - the captivating music (that made me rewatch the Credits section several times just to hear the theme song again), the neat graphics (stylized and complete with tidy animations), but most of all, the content. Boy, have I not expected this unspeakably massive amount of content. For those of you who enjoy unlocking things, between the new minion clans, rare cards, artifacts, golden variants of the same, and 25 extra difficulty levels, Monster Train will keep you busy for a good while.

Now, it's impossible to talk about this game and avoid comparisons with Slay the Spire, but here, again, Monster Train holds its own splendidly. The game lets you scale and customize your deck fast - and when I say fast, I mean it. The increase in power levels comes at an uncanny pace, so that you can choose the direction of deck development and stick with it right from the get-go. The combat itself provides a commendable amount of strategic value by letting you tinker with both horizontal and vertical unit placement and choosing from a delightfully diverse pool of ingenious effects attached to all but the most basic cards.

Monster Train is a fully complete, polished, and feature-rich deckbuilder that lives up to the highest expectations.

86,Monster Train,69569364,english,"I have over 500 hours in Slay the Spire, and I was very intrigued with how this game looked, as it was reminiscent of that, but after being a Roguelike deck-builder the similarities from Slay the Spire end in a good way. Because StS is probably the most popular rogue-like deck-builder, I'll compare my experience so far with that of StS.

The multi-floor combat system and defense of the pyre gives this game another layer to the battle system that makes the combat deeper than StS and requiring more strategy and less 'broken-card combo that sweeps everything'. Being able to fight with multiple different units that can be upgraded and spells that can also be upgraded is vastly different than StS's 'each card has one singular upgrade' gameplay. 

Everything in this game revolves around combinations. From your clan, unit upgrades, spell upgrades, etc., the game lets you mix and match different upgrades or unit combinations that allow for vastly different gameplay options every playthrough. This is something missing from StS (aside from buying Prismatic Shard from the shop, but even that is ).

Overall, this game looks similar to Slay the Spire, but plays vastly different. I played for nearly 4 hours in my first sitting and beat the game with 2 different combinations of clans and I enjoyed every bit of it. You can tell this game took inspiration from it, but went a different route than StS did with the combat system and expanded on the areas that Monster Train would see to capitalize most.

87,Monster Train,69568667,english,"Simply phenomenal!

A hybrid of the gameplay you know from games like Darkest Dungeon combined with card mechanics á la Slay the Spire. 
Gameplay evolves around finding the right combos with your hero-card and 2 of 6 factions, each with a unique playstyle.
While the first trip with your train will definetly end before you reach the goal, you will get into the mechanics and find your own unique playstyle to get around bosses.

Pros:
+ Hybrid of a Trading Card Game (inspired by Slay the Spire) and Dungeon Rougelike (inspired by Darkest Dungeon)
+ Huge replayability -> a ton of new cards, artifacts and playstyles to unlock while playing 
+ Very nice Artwork
+ Seems very balanced as difficulty increases.

Neutral:
> Speed in game can be increased to skip animations if they get too much (and they definetly will :D)

Negative:
- No possibility to save while in a fight. Your game will save automatically before a fight. As fights can take up to 15 mins, it seems bad not to have a ""Quicksave"" option.


Summary:

All in all, this is a game, that feels very polished and complete. The mix of two genre types seems very smooth.

29,Monster Train,69558820,english,Deckbuilding roguelikes is a niche genre of games that I adore. When I got access to the beta I was instantly hooked I couldn't stop playing it. It is nothing like the others before it. The combat feels balanced and allows for different strategies. I am ecstatic for the full release.
