20,30876286,english,"Ark 2020:

After a while tried the game again. At first all was ok, we had a nice base at Ragnarok. Things changed a lot when more people joined. Some people took the game that serious that freedom of expression was a issue, also to who you talked and what you said. That is not the games fault. The game itself improved a lot since my last review.

For me it was mind blowing to see how serious people take this game. Some are long term unemployed, and they rolled straight from their bed behind the pc to play. That while using weed the whole day, I saw some case of a real paranoid person that used weed because he otherwise got some mental issues he told me. Ok, don't we have medical care for such cases? He was that paranoid that he first didn't trust our allies who provided us access to servers etc. Then he had another mind blow in which he thought I wanted to dominate him. I talked to a allied tribe leader because of a raid we did, and the guy was convinced I made secretly agreements or whatever. After that he started lying and threatened to show everybody a chat I had with him. Since I wasn't lying I gave the chat myself. Creepy. I think the medication weed didn't help a lot against being paranoid. Another guy was besides ark and drugs mainly under influence of his testosterone. 

No room left for family, sports, social contacts in real life, nothing. Horrible. The game seems for some people to be a way of life to escape from real life and they toke it damn serious. For some people it's a real addiction. Some have a few more, like drug usage even hard drugs. Values are not important, the game is. To such people I can only say, look where it brought you. Addicted to a game and drugs, no perspective to get out. Sitting from early morning till late night in a game with other people that can't handle real life won't improve your life.

Is it all like that in ark? No, there are also people with common sense, and they understand it's just a game. They have a real life, values and are nice to be with. The best guy I met was a Russian Tribe leader. He was very social guy, intelligent and a good leader. Also, a young guy who is in his tribe was a very pleasant person. If you play ark with this kind of people the game can be really fun. Since everything changed a lot it's much easier to achieve your goals. So the game can be great, just play it with people that meet your requirements. For me that's definitely not drug users, alcoholics and other lowlifers. 

Edit: after the rather disappointing expierence I talked to a game friend about it. About how serious it was, about not allowed to speak, about whoremongers and  drugs addicts.   We laughed so much. You really met the cream of society, she said very dry, what caused even more laughing 😂😂. 

We decided to go together to a 25x server, since we both like pvp, but dont like to wait forever before we can have some action.  Will be continued with that expierence. 





2018:

This game seemed to be good when it just started. You could build your own base tame some dinos and have fun. Although the dino taming time was way to long, it was kinda fun. I started on a pvp server and had the luck to be in good relationship with the alpha tribe. I could join their raids and was protected. Things changed over and over, first came the breeding, what is a very time consuming boring business and after that they even added imprinting from the bred dinos. That costs a lot of time also, and if you want to boost your dino babies to the max, you need to be there to imprint at certain times. Overall it looks like the developers building this game for either people without jobs, for young people who finished school and have months to go befor their next study starts or people with almost no obligations. 

The real game changer was the server travel. Huge tribes, often Chinese, are able to enter the servers and just work around the clock to wipe every structure and dino. They make life streams and people can fund them if they watch the streams. It's for people who play the game and have a job and other obligations impossible to stop them. They just wait till your offline and if you login again you are lucky if your base is still standing. 

Overall atm I can not recommend this game to anybody, at least not to play on an official server. I didn't even mention the massive amount of bugs, glitches and bad fps because the game is totally not optimized. Meanwhile, they rapidly introduce new structures, new tier, new dinos. That makes the game even more unbalanced as it was before. Small tribes can't deal with that massive time consuming game play, and always have to depend on the big tribes who are able to craft tek tier etc. 

Of cource I could go to a pve server where no pvp exists, but that's not really my thing. So I decided to stop playing this game at least at official servers and maybe completely. It's just to time consuming and if you lose al that time by getting raided by some Chinese massive tribe, which earns money to do so, it's futile.",1491052599,1601841675,False,10,1,0.60000002384185791,0,True,False,False,76561197981478701,66,2,164171,519,164171,1601808535

I bought this game some time ago with the intent of finishing the Island map. I never did end up playing it until recently. Everything was going great probably the most fun I've had playing a game, so much so that I bought a DLC pack because after the island I wanted to continue on with the game. Although once I started getting further into the game, I noticed that there are a lot of bugs, I thought nothing of it until I continued playing the game for another week or so where I encountered a bunch of issues. While doing a cave I died and my body and dino went straight under the ground, it took a long time to get my dino back by trying to whistle through the ground, and I had to install a mod to get my body back. It's wild to think that bugs like that are in the game for years with nothing being done to fix them. At this point I was having a little less fun in the game from poor optimisation getting to me, but I really wanted to finish the game, so I continued. Sudden lag spikes got me killed a few more times in the caves but I continued to play besides the fact that something happened during my time of playing and I was getting lag spikes every couple of seconds, I did not change anything to my pc or ark, this just happened one day, and it went on for days. I was ready to fight the three guardians, but at this point I was having to grind hours a day to make saddles for my dinosaurs just so I didn't have to spend hours breeding them again. It went well, and I was going to the tek cave next, but with all the time spent grinding on this game, I found myself forcing myself to play the game because I wanted to beat it, not because I was having fun, at which point, I don't think I was. I didn't care how close I was, I needed a break from the game. Once I came back months later to find the lag spikes were gone, nice. But the tek cave and overseer did take a lot of time to beat as I was unaware of certain things that caused me to restart a lot of my progress in the game. And then, it was over, I had a successful attempt at the overseer and once that was over I was ready to move on to Scorched Earth. Then on download of my character it got deleted. 280-300 hours gone. 

Note that this was my own experience playing the game and other people might not of had any of these issues or people might of had more, if you think you'll have a great time playing the game, go ahead, but there are things you got to watch out for.

[b] Pros [/b]

Really fun game if you just want to mess around with friends
Cool and interesting story

[b] Cons [/b]

Optimisation could be a lot better
Countless bugs in the game, some are game breaking, and some have been in for years
A LOT of grinding
For a new player it will take a long time just understanding what to do and where to start

[h1] TLDR [/h1]

Had fun playing the game until I got further into the game and found game a lot of bugs and other things like poor optimisation which made the game a lot less fun to try and play.

43,76715966,english,"Here's a game I thought I would never get into. I had originally purchased this game on here years ago when I had a more low-end PC and the game was still in fairly early access. It ran like crap, had no tutorial, and I was all but lost. So I had it refunded and moved on, thinking I would never return. 

Well, here I am in 2020 with 165+ hours at the time of writing this, and another 25 hours or so from the ""other"" launcher that gave away this game for free. I've had a blast with this game over the past few months of getting it again, and I'm glad I gave it another shot. It's honestly the most fun I've had in a game recently, especially with friends. There is so, so much more to do in this game than I originally thought. 

At first, it's going to be difficult. You're going to die a lot. In fact, you will probably die on your way to retrieving your stuff that you dropped when you died, and you'll never see your stuff again. But it really doesn't matter, because once you get better gear, tame some dinos, and make a bigger and better base, you'll scoff at how you ever died to a Dilophosaur or to dehydration. It's a pretty big learning process, figuring out which dinos are hostile, which ones drop certain materials, how to learn and craft new things, so on and so forth. But I feel like that's what got me hooked, because I didn't want to just give up and never see what the game really has to offer.

Once you finally get some good gear and tames, that's where the game really picks up. You have crazy caves to explore, bosses to prepare for and fight, and cool stuff to craft that makes life a lot easier. That is not to say, however, that you won't be doing some grinding. I've always played with friends where we turned up the harvest rate by a couple times, so I can't imagine the solo grind. But it's manageable, especially when you can get tames that help with gathering those materials.

Even at my hours, which is nothing compared to most, I have a LOT left to do, taking into account the free expansions. I haven't even beat every boss on the original island map yet. The only thing I can't comment on are public servers, but I have zero desire to do so. I can't imagine grinding for hours only to lose it to someone with an army of Gigas or Rexes. But when you team up with a group of friends on a private server, it makes it a lot more fun in my opinion. 

This game is not perfect, however. The main meme of this game is that the developers seem to only work on expansions instead of fixing bugs, and I would say that's more or less accurate. To be fair, it's not really the buggy mess a lot of people make it out to be. But it certainly isn't bug free, and unfortunately you'll just need to expect to run into some stupid things from time to time. You also need a fairly good PC to run this, as it's definitely not the best optimized game.

Overall though, if you have a good PC and you're willing to deal with any bugs/glitches you'll encounter, as well as working through a fair bit of grinding, I definitely recommend giving ARK a try, especially if you have friends that play as well. I'm not so sure I would recommend it if you're playing on a laptop without friends but...hopefully that doesn't apply to you.",1601306378,1601827355,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198069516944,95,16,10522,3026,9996,1601863796

Let me reiterate; if you are planning to buy this game, then be prepared to be frustrated. A very unpolished game. Expect, crashes, bugs, errors and a stupendous amount of minutes or even hours wasted. The game is held with rubber bands. Another point of contention I have, is regarding the gameplay itself. In order to enjoy this game fully, you need to put so much time in. A lot of grinding. Although this pain can be lessened by increasing tweaking the settings when making a game or you can join a more casual server.  In spite of all these issues, I found to have so much fun playing this game. I would find myself trying to go the next step by getting new dinos that can get more resources, or just planning out a new place to build my base. Those are the greatest parts of ARK. The real creativity you can have to build a giant stone base, for example. At the same time this is ruined by the amount of time you have to spend getting the stone, and the annoying bugs and lagging (sometimes crashing) you have to face while trying to do this task. Overall, this game (on paper) is an amazing game. However it is the crap coating it that ruins it. You really have to stick your hand in the crap, in order to reach the greatest parts of this game. If you buy this game, Good luck.

- some dinos like kaprosuchus or argentavis (more many others) for example are not allowed in these servers to use pick up ability that can be very handy for taming other dinos or taming in the cave (like taming megalosaurus)
- food spoils drastically fast (to avoid that craft cryos to froze your tamed dinos)
- you play by ark admins rules
- but a good place to play on
- very slow taming + slow gowing
- ultimate laggs

Online official server PVP:

- dinos that can pick up are allowed to do so
- players can kill you
- you play by ark admins rules
- very slow taming + slow gowing
- lags

Singleplayer:

- All are allowed (all pick up skills)
- you can be a admin your self to fasten something
- do not see other players (world vs you)
- carnivores aggro more after you lol
- no lags
- can use creative mode

Maps:

Island-  a good place to start (if too populated by players then there are some lags)
Ragnarok- a big world, but laggish (lags make your taming and other things a shore- even your good pet may day because of this)
Valguero- (not so laggish than Island), and is even more player-friendly beautiful map

I spent literal days gathering the necessary equipment to acquire the giga, only for it to be killed because of the game crashing.In another instance, some structures didn't load in while I was flying to my base, resulting in my flyer (flying mount) that took multiple hours to tame getting suck in the map forever. But the worst instance of the game breaking would be where the majority of my items and tames literally just decided to delete themselves out of nowhere. Making all my progress worth nothing.

Also I think basically the only way to play this game and it be worthwhile is single-player or making your own server, because I think the PVP and PVE modes are unplayable. In PvP, I spent a couple hours or so building, gathering materials and then logging off in a tiny thatch house in the middle of nowhere. No joke, I literally logged back on 5 minutes later because I forgot something and everything of mine had been raided. Naturally I tried again multiple times, but the same pattern would occur every time where I would log off and get wiped. Even when I was online, most of the resources and areas were monopolized by other tribes, making it so I could barely go anywhere or do anything. Fighting other plays is fun and all, but more often than not the players destroying your stuff just wait for you to go offline, making it unfun and impossible to progress at all. 
After not enjoying PvP, I began to play on a couple seperate PvE servers, one of which I was able to tame the Titanosaurus and hatched Ice Wyvern triplets. Only for literally every server to just eventually go offline forever without warning, deleting all progress my buds and I made. 
All this prompted my friends and I to start our own server to try and actually enjoy the game. But starting the server itself took like a week. To host your own server you have to either have another xbox with ark or another pc with ark or pay someone else to host it for you. My friend offfered to download ark on his other computer, but the download took OVER 7 HOURS. To add insult to injury the download didn't even work after the 7 hr+ wait. So then I tried to download it. It took the same amount of time and glitched at the very end AGAIN. We eventually successfully downloaded the game and started our own private server, but after a while our dinosaurs and items randomly DELETED THEMSELVES AGAIN. We tried to create a server two other times, but the same thing happened.

Also, the development behind the game is sub standard. One of the most recent events ""Summer Bash"" just added a few summer themed skins. Despite the small amount of content added, the update broke the whole game and you couldn't go five minutes without crashing. Wildcard spent multiple days trying to fix their mistake and put out multiple updates, some of which just took of space and didn't fix the problem. Also, it should be noted that this isn't just an isolated incident. This pattern of updating the game, breaking it, and having to update the game to fix it has been a staple of the past.

I appreciate whoever has read the entirety of this review. Overall, I love the concept Ark has of surviving on a giant space station with fantastical creatures, but the cons outweigh the pros. I wasted a great deal of time on this game and I suggest people considering playing Ark don't repeat the same mistake.

56,65679231,english,"It's about time I made a review for this game. Only took 2200 hours. This review is base on a mainly singleplayer experience, with some multiplayer at around 2100 hours I'd say. If you ignore the countless bugs and glitches mixed with semi-regular crashes, this game is a godsend. Probably the best survival game ever made, for me at least. The visuals are very good, the soundtrack is pretty good as well. The fact that you don't rely mainly on yourself, but on creatures is what makes this game so good. There are over 100 creatures you can discover and most of them are tamable. There are dinosaurs, mythical creatures, and other things that I don't even understand. So many of them are pretty interesting and cool. But there is one major issue, those countless bugs, glitches, and somewhat frequent crashes are there. It isn't rare for my friend to constantly fall through the floor and die. It isn't super rare that I fall through the floor either, in which I use commands to bring myself back up onto the map because that shouldn't happen. In the genesis magmasaur cave, the map would't load and so I couldn't get a basic layout of the cave because part of it won't load, making me unable to tell if something is a wall or not. I travel to different maps quite often, to get all of the cool creatures the dlcs have to offer, and in multiplayer, I get to a beacon or something that allows me to access my items that I wanted to bring over, and then the game crashes sometimes, leaving my items in a bag that disappears once you leave the game. See how this could be an issue? I can't get my items back because the bag disappears because the game crashed, making my items in that bag disappear (this could be due to a mod conflicting with the game, but I'm to lazy to check which mod it would be.). This game is chore to play without mods, because some things in the game are just totally awful or broken so you need a mod to make them balanced or viable. This game runs very poorly as well. I would say I have a pretty good computer, but this game needs a NASA computer to run without many frame drops. I get constant frame drops on this game. Sometimes something will die, leaving its body stretched  out or deformed, or even just floating in the air sometimes. These can drop your frames a ton. I had to spend over 15 minutes searching for a certain sheep body that was stretched out across out our base because it died in our ovis farm. Some ""updates"" break the game more than it fixes it. It is such a shame that a game this good has to be this broken. I wanna say that the developers did something that made the game broken, but I'm not sure. Anyway, I would not say that the game in its current state is worth the amount of money they are charging for it.",1585022245,1601698719,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,76561198799659717,28,15,132040,5360,132040,1601696598

Building can sometimes be a little touchy, leading to some wasted resources as a roof or wall builds somewhere other than desired. Taming dinos is also super time-consuming. I was never able to tame any of the really big dinos because I just didn't have time to do it in real life.

Simply put the game is as addictive as it is beautiful. Playing multiplayer PvE is a vastly enjoyable experience on a private server, but I do see lots of room for griefing on public servers. Single player, while fun and challenging, lacks the shared experience of accomplishments and wonder that multiplayer has brought. I haven’t delved into PvP but as a lot time gamer I can get a gist of exactly how exhilarating, painful, and rewarding it could be.
I could sing the game’s praises, but honestly I can sum it up with “Jurassic Park meets pokemon meets survival horror meets Avatar landscapes”. My only gripe is being so incredibly vast in scope there are indeed plenty of bugs. All in all livable for the quality of content the game brings.

me having a potato pc and running this at 1 fps is not fun too, but hey..

plz. fix. the. game. 

patch bugs, improve optimalization.

no more dlcs.

fix the existing ones.

and stop it. get some help.

300+ hours and I got NOTHING to show for it cause of a stupid ""2 week"" timer that removes EVERY. THING. YOU. EVER. GOT.

and the community is toxic. enough said.

if you have friends to play this with and dont mind gamebreaking bugs (falling through the floor), then get it!

dont. join. official. servers. unless youre me who likes to torture himself trying to find a non-pillared space.

#removepillars

#quarantine2weeks=ripstuffLOL
#coronavirus2019willtakeyourbase

anyways this is a good game. jk. jk. jk. jk.
solve the riddle. negate. improve.

Ragnarok best map. Island servers dead lol. 
Dont play on 100 people servers. Cancer.
Play on less populated servers IF you wanna really go official.
Its so much fun if youre a 1 in 10000 where the game isnt out to torture you and make you insane.

it has its fun moments... I guess...
I miss my toad.. quetz... bear.. t-rex... para :c
I made quite the progress on an official server yes.

THEN IT ERASES CAUSE 2 WEEK TIMER LOL.
AND I WENT INSANE CUZ I SUNK 300+ HOURS INTO THAT SERVER + MET SOME GREAT PEOPLE WHO QUIT.

PRO ADVICE: Be a nice person and people will be grateful their server isnt dead. They might even throw some goodies your way so you dont quit trying to tame a lvl 1 raptor. and mining with fists.

Also. PVE is boring. your only enemy are the creatures who aimlessly want to kill you or ignore you. its the same. youre just out collecting pokemon lol.

PVP is not fun on officials lol. Raidddddddds. Prepare to get rekt by a 100km/h flying vampire scorpion.

and no PVe bosses dont count lol thats just you flexing your mutated dinos and geting 1 fps while your army slaughers the boss. OR IT SLAUGHERS YOU. which makes you quit cause you brought everything to that arena. yeah if you die ur already done. ur dinos dont matter but you do.

1+ point for Ragnarok having DESERT STUFF!! I love that. Maybe the desert is a bit too big imo though.

Snowstorms are COOOOOOOL!

Unless youre on a potato pc like me and play with low graphics and still get shit fps. and lowest resolution which makes it worse than roblox.


please just think twice before you buy this. aight?
have fun on your adventure through ""Ark""!!!! Dont forget to not log off unless youre in a metal cube!

Even though you need a better computer to play, i did manage to get it running 60 fps on my crappy notebook.

Pros +
+ Good to play with friends (If you have any)

+ Build your own epic looking bases

+ Tame Dinos and Ride em!

+ Interesting background story

+ Dino Breeding

+ Challenging /// you seem to need some new resources, but its all the way on the other side of the island. That means you either fly there once in a while or you make a secondary base there.

Cons -
 
- Bad AI /// the problem with this is that the dino AI is simple. just run towards you and when there are trees or rocks high enough they´ll get stuck and then its easy for the player.

update: AI has been improved and while it does still get stuck behing natural resources and structures, it can run around hills and slopes

             /// another problem with this is that when you have a dino. Lets take for an example that you have a flyer, you need to land to replenish stamina. You get off your flyer beacuse you need water or something. Something attacks, something that you´re not able to handle. So if your flyer is on neutral, he´ll attack. Most likely result: you´re badly hurt and your flyer dead. If passive: when you come back, you can find your flyer dead.

update: AI commands has been improved a bit, there are a lot of shortcuts you can customize for quick commanding.

- Connection is managable but could be better, Official Server connection isn't great either. /// I have a good connection, its just that the servers can get very laggy.

update: Connection seems to be a more common problem, the devs aren't doing much about it either.

- When you die, you die. /// Even though this is the players problem, if you make mistakes, they can be fatal. ""maybe I could visit this cave now"" or ""Im sure I´ll outrun that"". And it's these mistakes that can cost you: all of your items, your favourite dino and sometimes even sanity.

- FOR HOW MUCH??? /// even though i bought this game for 20E, the prices now are way higher, game for 60E and the season pass for 40E. So if you want to buy this game, wait for holidays or something. wait... is it snowing? :O

update: as I'm editing this, christmas is right around the corner once again.

99,76175705,english,"BEGINNER SOLO LOCAL SERVER REVIEW:

Just starting on a local server, single player mode, but I'm enjoying this BIG FLIPPING open world survival game.  As all games, this one has good things and bad things.  I've specified a few good and bad below based on what stood out to me.  I'll update this review as i roll along through the game.

The Good:  
-LOCAL SERVER allows you to set your own parameters.  For example, when you chop down a tree, you can get 5 wood or 40 wood.  there are a LARGE range of settings to adjust.  this is EXTREMELY helpful to a new solo player. 
-Open world maps are HUGE and look good.  PVE open world play is fun and engaging. 
-Dinos are fun to tame and train.   Dinos are helpful for defense, carrying resources and attack.  Dinos also provide meaningful buffs, such as the tiny slow diono that provides XP buffs when you pet it.  The player can RIDE many dinos.  This is a strong area.
-COOL TEK DINOS to tame, ride and breed.  Cool is a factor, of course. 
-Crafting is VERY DEEP and provides meaningful tools.  BUILDING is very fun and also DEEP.  This is a VERY strong area. 
-SKILL TREES are somewhat basic but gives the player LARGE buffs in basic categories, like damage, speed, health, stamina. 
-FAST travel system between bases, although you CANNOT take any inventory or gear with you when you fast travel, which is very strange. 

The Bad:
-Save system SUCKS.  you can't manually save at all, and when you die, you loose all your gear and inventory items ( to be fair, you can go to where you died within a couple of hours and pick up your gear, but dying with no save is still annoying ).  A good manual/quick save state system that preserves your inventory and gear would VASTLY improve this game. 
-MAP is a DISASTER.  NO MINI MAP and the player map is small, awkward and hard to read. In a game based on open world play, this is very strange and a big problem. 
-DENSITY OF PREDATORS in the brush is WAY too HIGH.  If you get away from the starting areas you'll often be attacked multiple times traveling a couple hundred yards.  In 5 minutes you can have 5 different types of creatures trying to eat your face, often in packs.  This breaks any sense of realism and can be very annoying.  The brush is dangerous, but not every ten feet. 
-NO TUTORIALS.   You're dumped in the game and good luck.  Get used to hitting up google and Utube. 
-Movement skills are limited and awkward.  No climbing, mantling, grappling, let alone wall running or zip lining. vertical movement is very limited.  A good grappling system would improve this game a lot. 

The Summary: 
Despite several weak areas noted above, I'm enjoying this game and will continue playing solo/local server.  I will NOT play on any public server as many players on those servers are jerks. 

One GREAT thing about this game; you drop into this game and you play 100% of the time, unlike many modern AAA games where 1/2 of your game time is taken up by self indulgent cut scenes and NPC chitchat. No need to skip cut scenes in this game.   why? there are no cut scenes.

0,73684613,english,"You will NEVER be able to play this game without running into multiple game breaking glitches that wipe away all of your progress after hours and hours. This game is poorly developed, poorly optimized, and will leave you feeling ripped off and disappointed every time you try to play. Its been out for years yet has all he flaws and more of an early access. The developers, instead of utilizing time to sniff out the flaws, spend their time creating content to soak more money out of the fan base. Some of the issues present in September 2020 that you would never expect from a AAA title or professional game studio: The game crashes constantly (only game that does this on my over-spec PC), gamepad support is terrible and incomplete (you need to use a mouse in the inventory and you need to use a keyboard to switch your character from first person to third person), There are weird designs with character movement (One instance is when you are swimming fast in the water, your character jumps right when he gets to shore, stopping your progress and letting whatever you may have been running away from catch up to you and create damage), Some weird enviromental designs (When it rains, if you go into a structure it stops raining even outside. You can look outside and see it stops raining and if you go back and forth it will start and stop raining outside. This is by design. I would love there to be rain on the roof while you wait the storm out inside), There are weird spawning glitches (After spending hours getting set to fly into the caverns for an egg, I finally made my way into the caverns and after searching everywhere for an egg and dying one after another, I quickly realized there were NONE. I checked online to find out there was a notorious egg spawn glitch where no eggs spawn. SO I wasted all that time for absolutely nothing and lost those resources and tames. I had enough of it after that and quit playing. This was last spring. I mean come on, I spent so much time gathering those tames only to lose them and other resources including my time grinding for absolutely nothing, all due to a glitch that made it impossible to be rewarded. The servers suck. You need to stay far away from official or you have to suffer the poor balancing and the inevitble rubber banding where the dinosaurs slide away from you and back towards you and stop registering your attacks. Even in unofficial the servers go offline for maintenance multiple times per day for 20-60 minute stretches or more so you get kicked and have to play another game or do something else which is exactly what you want from a game (time restrictions). You'll run into bugs variously when you try to do things all the way down to not being able to run for some reason. Its literally one thing after the next. I got sick of googling solutions when I realized I was spending an equal time suffering from issues as I was enjoying the game. This development studio is TERRIBLE. The menus on this game are visually unappealing and confusing. Some of the sliders don't even work and you cant find explanations anywhere for instance one of the Player Stats Per Level Sllders called Temp Fortitude literally does nothing and has no explanation anywhere. But; the concept is cool and when it works it a loaddd of fun to be in an open world survival crafting game with dinosaurs. Oh and the STORY is TRASH. Its like pulling teeth to run into a moment that is scripted and when you do its low production and literally the one cutscene is if you beat the game lol all lackluster.",1596425420,1601539485,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198345226545,17,2,21990,1124,20866,1601853738

Game is great, it is a survival game where you are stranded naked on a mysterious world, having to survive on whats around you, you can tame dinosaurs and build bases, you can play with friends or whole servers, or even yourself. Game is still great and I have almost 700 hours on it.

26,28847656,english,"I write this review now, as I wait, being stuck between some rocks...  Probably about 30 minutes until I starve to death...

Ark has a wonderful concept.  Amazing graphics.  And could be an entirely immersive experience.

It is a grand concept with a failed execution.

Some will say, ""IT'S EARLY ACCESS!!"".  I do not care.  They sold DLC, they are not early access.

""BUT THEY GOT SUED!!!""

Yes.  They did.  They are not early access.

While the general gameplay could be a grand ol' time, the game is riddled with bugs that have been present for years.  Corpses diseappearing under rocks and the ground.  Engine based ((No, not lag based, actual issues with the engine processing pathing.))  rubberbanding issues.  A Laissez-faire approach to player griefing (No, not Minecraft's perversion.  The real MMO definition of ""No reason for the action but to make someone else's experience miserable"") griefing.  And just flat bugs...  Like getting stuck inside of a dino you are fighting and being unable to move...  This game is a pathetic attempt at a shell game.  They provide content, while making little effort to actually make sure the content there to begin with is worthwhile. I cannot fathom where their sense of logic comes from, and cannot assume there is, or will be one.  Do not, pay for this game.  In the end all you'll see is a perversion of what could have been a good idea....  Wasted.

**UPDATE**  Yes.  The game still sucks like a two dollar whore.  12th time I lost my belongings due to my corpse glitching.  The time consumed building resources, then having to rebuild this many times?  If our courts had any intelligence left in them they'd allow me to sue for my time they've wasted with their garbage coding.

**UPDATE**  Two hundred hours in now.  The game is even worse than it was before.  The only real points to it are trying to capture dinos (Forget keeping them alive.  Between the pathing rubberbanding, broken AI, broken bounding/hit boxes, and blizzard of other bugs, prepare to lose the dino you spent RL hours upon hours taming to be worth nothing more than a near coronary rage inducing experience.  Unless you just never use them..  What fun?), try to build (If you have the patience for the broken snap points, and having anything less than metal smashed just for someone else's giggles.), and steal other people's stuff.  Once you've explored the island, options for entertainment are limited.  Imagine HALO with a bigger map and better, but buggier landscape, where you have to spend days building up to get decent weapons and 10 hours to get a jeep.

**UPDATE**  Should have mentioned before.  If you have any history of epilepsy anywhere in your family ever, you should not ever touch this game.  The snap point system for building sucks with black hole style force.  The flinging and rapid flashing back and forth of the temporary shadows as you try to place things in futility....  Well, I'm not epileptic and it gives me a headache, so it would flat out murder you.

**UPDATE**  Still haven't fixed the timeout problem during downloading or updating mods, which shows their priotities.  They love taking content, they do not wish it easier to deliver.  Common sentiment for a company who's only out for money.

**UPDATE**  This game has been out how long, and they still can't get the building system to detect what is and isn't obstructed right?  How many years has it been?  Oh, right, they don't give a fuck.  Nevermind, continuing to view this game as a total waste of a good concept.",1483139781,1601504977,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561197976879454,112,5,45091,8220,41004,1602030925

do know that in pvp raids occur once in a while and pve is a safe as it is but less building space.

ofcourse you could always play single player straight away using admin commands to build what u want .

in short pve is full of crap
pvp is the wildwest full of death

and single player is a way to learn the game.

cons of this game are you need an SSD , SD card at least 500gb i suggest 1 tb of memory space purely for this game and it's expansions , scorched earth is like hard mode due to the enviroment that want's to kill ya same like any dino's .

Playing the game was a pain and done out of spite, to keep it short.

Price should be about $8, that should cover the overall quality of experience you may get from it. Not the ridiculous $60 price tag IN ADDITION to the DLCs for 3x shittier optimization than Ubisoft's and EA's AAA games.

Shitty optimization, shittiest UI and UX I've seen unironically, and ridiculous character designs that are completely out of place to the rest of the game, even if you try to make it non-ridiculous.

Which is cool, but that's a far shot from what the game originally was and/or seemed to have meant to be originally.  It's sad.  I'm sure some people who are into that will like it.  But even Primitive+ isn't worth playing if you want a real caveman experience because its just so obvious that the game isn't designed to be played in Primitive+ anymore.  I'm personally disappointed. 

_______________________________________________________________________


This will be my first Steam review though I have played quite a bit of games on Steam. 

ARK is an awesome game with the Devs relentlessly adding more content on almost a weekly basis. By content I really just mean adding new dino's. But that is still awesome and refreshing. These types of games are best played in a community. WIth that being said, if you do not make friends (get into a good tribe) and play on a daily basis the PVP and/or HARDCORE servers are certainly not for you. It will be nice if the Developers add a new map or at least add on to the current map. Making the current map larger would be awesome. This game requires skill, diligence, perserverance, a certainly positive attitude. 

Despite the fact that I have moved on until the full game is released I give this game a 9/10. 

I am 100% certain that the final product will be a 10/10

Fair environment of survival, hard to begin but you will get a little bored after while, especially if you play in PVE server, same reason for every open world surviving game without story quest. Community in PVE is nice, but in PVP not so friendly.

Cons: You must have plenty of time to play this game, because if you can't play for long period of time, your base and all your dino will disappear (rotting). I have a busy week, and when i have time to login again, all has gone, my hard work for 525 hour playing disappear. It just sad, but its effective way to get rid old player who decide to retire from this game, so the new one still have plenty of land to build. And don't forget about bug and lag in this game, you will get used to it. lol

4,76693817,english,"Now I'd like to preface this review with the fact that I've never played this game competitively against others, which I assume is also a major part of the game I haven't gotten into personally yet. 

Anyways, in my eyes ARK: Survival Evolved is an extremely entertaining game that you can easily find yourself sinking many hours into without realizing it. This, for me, is because of its challenge, large areas to explore, new creatures to discover and tame, landscapes to make into your home, and many other neat aspects which I find balanced fairly well in ARK. Of course there are still things which I don't like and to me are quite annoying.

My favourite among the fun side of things has to be the way that the challenges evolve throughout the game. For example in the beginning of the game, survival alone is difficult, but as you progressively build up your home, outgrow your home, and build new homes to house your new pets, you find that those early challenges disappear and are replaced with getting stronger creatures and battling the bosses of the map. Close second is adventuring through caves and the ocean, its exciting and in the case of the ocean quite spooky sometimes with gigantic overhangs and underwater cliffs, and then massive creatures lurking below and around you. Third would certainly have to be discovering creatures and their special little abilities, the variation in the creatures gives you many options for the same utility with different pros and cons 

Of course no game is without fault, and to me that comes in the way the game deals with progression of levels, alternative sources of resources, the dreaded grind, and building issues, though there are more. To start with level progression, it seems to me that in the start of the game you have resources for things at level 30 but are at level 10, and that when you are at level 80 you're starting to use stuff from level 60! I might be an odd one out in that complaint. The way the game deals with alternative sources of resources is without a doubt wrong, it gives you these many sorts of tools like fishing rods, and late game resources being substituted by drops from more common creatures (looking at you polymer and cementing paste), but most of the time one method of collecting the resources is vastly better, why use a fishing rod when you can jump in and hand stab a fish instead for example. People in the reviews constantly complain about the grinding of resources, which is true for a solo player, especially on the default settings, but I personally just think the most annoying part is having to transport all these materials too and from your main base, regardless of where you set up you have to transport lots of SOME heavy resource, traveling back and forth for hours, but I don't mind it that much in the end. My biggest gripe about the game which might seem very very trivial to those playing competitively or who simply dont mind, I absolutely despise the building mechanics, it's near impossible to build nice looking structures that are well lit enough to see everywhere and functional enough to bother with making it look nice anyways. 

One who is more observant would see that my ""cons"" paragraph is significantly larger than my ""pros"" paragraph. I think this is in part due to the nature of people being more keen of what they don't like than what they do like. I would also like to add that even the annoying parts of the game give you those ""Ah ha!"" moments when you figure out a solution to one of them. I would recommend ARK to anyone from the guy who does nothing but play videogames all day to the people who use their computer an hour a day, its easy to play for hours on end, but satisfying to have small little five minute achievements as well.",1601265435,1601265435,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198728039323,13,1,19304,3,19301,1601703964

However.

Be careful. official servers are impossible solo/duo. expect to need at least 4 players willing to commit almost full time positions to the game if you want to have a chance at surviving. Alpha tribes and Meshers(cheaters) will most likely crush you otherwise. Performance could be optimized when it comes to ultra large scale creations.

unofficial servers, speedpvp, rp, or solo if you can stomach it are all great ways to enjoy the game while trying to take down bosses and uncover the lore of ARK.

You start off naked and primitive but slowly upgrade through the ages of technology as you level all the way up to guns and radios and gpses. 

Fun by yourself but way more fun with a group of friends. 

Three things, however:

1. The griefing on public servers is way overboard. You'll join a game with nothing and have max leveled griefers with machine guns spawn killing you or locking you in a prison cell on repeat. Highly suggest making your own server to avoid this.

2. The game has an incredibly insane scaling for the taming speed of dinosaurs. No joke, some of the higher dinosaurs can take upwards of 8+ hours to tame. HIGHLY suggest turning ""taming speed"" up to 3 times the max on your server to avoid this because that's stupid 

3. The game has so many little nuances to it that it never teaches you, but really that's any sandbox game. If you REALLY want to get into this game, the wiki is your best friend.

On July 30, 2017 at 12:27 pm, I wrote in my review that I wаnt to the beam from the Island server to move to the Center server. When the server data was downloaded to the Center, an error message appeared.
After that, my level 94 character is lost.
Not good game.

But I kept on playing. Even when the safe full of gold and red staff disappeared on Ragnarok after the patch.
When the motorboat with 8 turrets on the edge of the map was wiped out after updating the game.

On September 17, 2020, when you entered the game, you were banned window appeared. I've been playing ARC for over 10,000 hours and I don't understand the reason why I was banned.
Nobody told me the reason or warned me that I was breaking something in the game.
I started to build a base on the map Island in the cave where the artifact of the heavenly lord, and my friends told me that all the tribe buildings in this cave were wiped out. Perhaps this is the reason for the ban.
But several tribes on the Island map also built their bases in the caves with artifacts.
These are Tribe Kingdom and Evombled.
I play honestly and have repeatedly asked the developers to unlock my account and give me the ability to play the game that I bought all the add-ons with my own money.
But I received no answer from them.

Research for an unofficial server host with well structured rules and active player base. Whether hardcore pvp or just taming dodos, finding a server that caters to the experience you are looking for is key in not wasting hours and hours of your time. The game is a huge installation. If you have all maps + mods installed you could be looking at close to a 200gb install. Game is poorly optimized, you need a decent rig to fully appreciate this game. Some days will be good and some bad. There is tons to do and explore even at 6k hours I still figure out new methods of farming or building techniques. You can easily play for hours and hours. Modded servers add alot to the vanilla experience. Highly recommend playing on a modded server. If you like grindy sandbox games or to build extravagant structures you'll totally be into ARK.

16,22419480,english,"TLDR - Runs like a paraplegic, glhf with your 2080ti i9 rigs. Hundreds of hours of content to enjoy with friends... Play non-dedicated, set tether distance to 100, up the tame speed and xp rate otherwise you'll literally spend 6hrs staring at your monitor watching a dino's tame bar slowly go up and be on edge trying to protect it and yourself from predators. It sucks. 

It's a fine line between pleasure and pain with this game. 950hrs in still haven't done everything there is to do. Modability is insane, played 650hrs of semi-vanilla, then discovered the Pugnacia and Primal Fear overhaul mods annnnd BAM another 200hrs of pleasure and pain. 

This game will make your 2080ti i9 rigs soil themselves, optimisation who? That's fine I didn't want more than 40fps in a game that looks worse than Halo 3 from 2007 anyway. 

Multiplayer is enjoyable BUT WHY IS TETHER DISTANCE A THING. Why am I forced to run a dedicated server of which I need to port forward and spend hours setting up with mods just so my friends can be free from virtual chains that prevent them from getting too far away from me. 

The official servers are filled with tryhards, and progress is stupidly slow... Play a non-dedicated with your friends, tweak the server settings, chuck on some convenience mods and you'll have a blast. 

Now in terms of DLC, Aberration is the ONLY one worth buying. The rest are whack and the free maps are so much funner anyway especially with a mod overhaul like Pugnacia or Primal Fear. 

10/10 Would foolishly buy all Ark's content again in hope Studio Wildcard uses their profit to idk maybe OPTIMISE THE GAME. IT'S BEEN 5 YEARS. NO ONE WANTS GENESIS PT 2.

I am going to be real for you new people who are maybe thinking about buying this game (Maybe a Steam Sale) and stumble upon my review.

When I played used to play it 12+ hours a day back in the day, it was buggy and it was just a mess overall. There was glitches, crashes and every bug you can imagine. Not as bad as Bethesda game on launch though! Yet somehow I came back to it every time cause there was something in it. If you have time look into my Profile and into my screenshots. Over hundreds of screenshots of me in-game with my homies. It was just that memorable.

The game was in Early Access then and about a year or two back it released officially. I can't comment on the state of the game as I got busy with college and life. However me and my homies from back then are officially gearing up to get back into it and I can tell you that even if all the bugs and crashes persisted, I would still play it and have just as much fun!

Gameplay: It's a really fun survival game, but OH MY GOD please don't let me change the settings so it is extremely easy before I've ever even played once! I always make game easier, and it always ruins them for me!

Bugs: THERE'S AN INFESTATION! Visual glitches that are painful to look at, game breaking glitches, and more stupid things that should be patched by now! guys, can you focus on the bugs for a few minutes???

Price: I guess the original price is fine, but I could spend 10 minutes browsing through maps and mods and find free and better gameplay than any of the dumb extra purchases. Modders make such fun ideas, and 60 of the 65 hours I've played, I was playing modded, and mostly the play as a dino mod. I WILL NEVER BUY AN ISLAND

I hold this game close to my heart, but dear god it is awful. Have plenty of money and want to ride a dinosaur? here you go, play this game. What's that? You want a reasonably priced, good looking dinosaur game? Just look at dinosaur game son steam okay? I only wanted this game in the first place because it was fun to play with my best friend. I also wanted this game before I knew what graphics were.

51,33105613,english,"Edited 09/24/2020 With 1,700 hrs in, Im still loving this game. It is not for everyone, but thought I would shed some light on the two years since my last update on this review. They have released new maps, which if great, but still horrible lag. Seriously, sometimes my character rubberbands yards from the lag. You find yourself always typing // in chat to see when lag is over and then continue what you were doing. My lag can range from 5 sec up to about 40 sec. This game is not optimized at all. I have gigabit speeds. Up and Down, I get around 950mbs. They seriously need better host. Nitrado (who is the company use) is just horrible. Once people start breeding dinos, and building their base, the lag comes. Seriously, When I log into the game, sometimes it takes about 40 sec before my base completely spawns in. My rig has a 10900k 32gb of 3200 ram, with a 2080 ti, and I still only get about 45 - 57 fps. Im only running at 1440p also. 4K drops me to about 32 fps. If you have friends to play with, i suggest creating a private server. You'll have a blast, but avoid official servers till you know what your doing. Also, still wait for sale. When you get dinos who die, or lose things because of the lag, at least you got a good deal on a sale. 


Edited 6/17/18: (WAIT AND BUY THIS DURING A SALE)
With almost 700 hrs in this version alone, and about the same amount if not more on PS4 version, this is an amazing game. Most of the bugs have been ironed out, but there is still a few issues with lag when playing on official servers, but I truely believe that those issues are from the official servers hosted by Nitrado. They are European based, and think they seriously milk and limit their bandwith. 

Some of my greatest and most memorible moments are on Ark, but if your starting off, or this is your first time playing, I would seriously suggest jumping on a unofficial server or creating your own with Ark Server Manager. It gets rid of the horrible grind in the game, and makes it fun to play and explore. They have put a bit of story into the game now, but you get it with all the notes you find in the game, and when you beat the game. Still, really no story and very hard to actually beat the game without cheating. As of today, I would reccomend this game, but seriously, wait for a sale. They happen frequently and you can get the entire game with season pass for about $20 - $25. My original review is below. It was before official release, but they were already selling dlc, so to me, that means that the game was out. 

(Original Review) Let me say that having this game on all three platforms, it is definitely not worth $60. The game is a lot of fun, but there are still way too many problems, not just that but there is no story. This is an open world survival game, and that is it. The servers still have tons of problems with rubberbanding, and disconnects. They sometimes feel like they operate on Dial Up. Recently on PC it would take about 15 minutes to finally logon because of server problems. Now when I speak about server problems it’s not that there are too many people online, on one of the servers I was playing on it said there were only 7 people out of 70, but would constantly get errors because the server itself was experiencing problems. This was going on for two weeks, and it always seems to happen during an event that gives double XP. Normally this wouldn’t be too big of a problem but with ARK, the problem is that you get disconnects. 

So let’s imagine this, you’re traveling around with your good gear on a flying mount. All of a sudden you get disconnected for no reason, now you already know that you’re most likely dead from falling from the sky because that’s what happens when flying and you get disconnected. So you go and try to login to get back to your body and retrieve your gear,  but server issues won’t allow it. Your body despawns after 15 minutes so if you cannot get back on immediately and have a second flying mount to get to where your body was, then you might as well kiss all your good items goodbye because they despawn with your body. Or lets say your taming / Breeding a Dino. Some can take 9 hours (IRL) as a baby that needs to be constanly hand fed. Which mean you need to stay online with them just running to get food and manually putting that food into the baby dino to feed them. Then you get disconnected. After 15-30 minutes of trying to log back in, and all ready spending hours raising or taming these dinos, you finally get back on only to find that your tame is no longer around or your baby has starved to death. This has been a constant problem for ARK that the developers will not seem to fix. Even now with those of us who bought early, the developers have openly said that they need to finish working on retail before fixing our problems, which in other words say “we have your money already, will get you when we can“. This might be because of the servers that Ark uses, which are Euopean based. Dont know why they would use a far away server, maybe it was just cheaper, but it is what plauges this game. Now if this game is $60 for its entire content,  then I may have a better review and say it could be worth it, but charging $60 for a game that is broken, and another $60 for the DLC is absolute GREED as other reviewer‘s have stated. If you really want this game, I would wait for another steam sale before picking this up, my friends and I were able to buy it for $15 during the Steam Summer sale so I have no complaints. This review is to warn others who are thinking about buying it.",1498950270,1601001324,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561197990793184,464,14,106212,1933,104368,1602034140

a.  If you play on official servers, the world saves every 15 minutes with at least 20-30 seconds of rollback while the world saves so every time you are doing something intensive, you have to plan around it.  (Conan Exiles does not have this issue saving)

b.  Everything in this game take an ENORMOUS time commitment anywhere from days to months which can all be lost due to a game mechanic that has a 20% chance of going wrong and you losing your character while trying to travel across servers.  Again, traveling from server to server is a built in game mechanic that have several means and items to facilitate map switching but results in more characters being lost than puppies in a dog park.

c.  When things go wrong in the game, the customer service is remedial at best.  There is no concern from the game company when it comes to losing customers.

I never supported torrents for any game, but as the developers are ignoring every player on their servers, I don't want to support developers anymore by buying their game or new DLC's they provide,",1588766126,1600980445,True,0,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,76561198420551289,12,2,74914,0,70737,1593026587

Not only could my current computer barely handle playing it on the bare bones potato graphics settings (my computer at the time was fairly nice, could play other multiplayer games just fine), but I found the crafting system clunky with way too many steps. Even if you were with a group, everyone had to unlock new recipes individually. My friends who had already played would be building stone and higher-tech things and I was stuck looking for resources to build thatch buildings because other options weren't available to me, even if I had the materials to make better stuff. I understand that scaling system for tools, like in Minecraft and Terraria - but for everything? 

Due to potato graphics, it was IMPOSSIBLE to stay alive for any length of time to make meaningful progress around my lag. I was a near-sighted caveman going 'is that a predator on the other side of the water or a harmless plant-eater?' Meanwhile my friends and brother kept insisting it was a great game. Oh what beautiful water graphics! Oh look at my tame pterodactyl! Look at my cool house! All while I'm rubbing sticks together and trying not to die and getting increasingly frustrated.

To me, accessibility is a huge issue for multiplayer. If you can't play with your friends and have a good experience, you can't have fun. The optimized game might be gorgeous and expansive and deep, but if only a percentage of people who try it can experience that level of quality, is it really a great game? 

Maybe I could try it again now that it's been out for a few years and on a better computer. Maybe the graphics would be better, I'd have less lag, and I could actually get through the 'tutorial' stages of building stuff and get to the fun part. But my computer at the time matched the recommended specs for this game, and it was zero fun to play. So getting over that initial burn in order to actually give the game another shot and a fresh start isn't going to be easy.

THIS PRETENDS TO BE AAA+ GAME WITH AAA+ PRICETAG IS NOT WORTH IT!

As of start of 2020 I tried to get back to the game. The official servers still lag like hell. I see some things have been changed, some things like kibbles and the ability to pick up structures you place are very nice, but the core game still has the same bugs it had years ago. Dino tails are the buggiest thing ever because why not have actual physics push you around. Official servers still struggle with performance even with half the maximum players, I guess cheapest bid wins. Game now costs 50+ euros, to me that would mean AAA+ title but this game is definitely not, having very very basic performance issues and bugs going unadressed for years. I would consider this game worth 30 euros and still wait for sale unless developers actually get off their asses and fix the glaring issues.

To give a little extra background on this 2020 return, I powerplayed on the Valguero map for 3 days, got some help and was doing perfectly fine. Even got wyvern egg with a nice level, but the server lag was the most annoying thing. I was still very enthusiastic and willing to overlook all the little things until I was trying to get another wyvern egg, the game got a huge lag spike and server crashed, then rolled back to where i was flying atop the canyon with wyverns.. ofc it spawned new ones next to me before i could even see anything relogging back, and the game spawns you normally even if it's a rollback from server crash and you were flying a dino. 

Sucks to be you, now you fall!

My body got slaughtered before I even hit the lava by wyverns newly spawned even when they were not there when servers crashed (mind you, this is OFFICIAL PVE SERVERS which are apparently trash). I went back but my stuff was in the lava. This is prime example of how the game will fuck you over with the bugs we reported literally years ago, and the developers just bring new candy to the game but never fix the bugs.

I want to love ARk. I really want to and I do love it when everything is working great. The game is a sandbox with interesting maps, creatures, and gameplay. It is very grindy at times but that also makes it have a great sense of achievement. ARK is also a game of 'force multipliers'. You tame certain dinos you can increase your gathering speed of certain resources by ten-fold! And who does not love dinosaurs! The challenge is greatest at the start and you can really benefit from teamplay.

Now I said it is great when it works. The important thing is that often it does not. Your dinos get stuck, collision detection is garbage and sometimes the giganotosaurus you are trying to raise just simply vanishes into thin air. These are all still manageable in an EA title (that has been for that way for a long time and released a DLC, mind you!). Why I cannot give this title a positive review is that with all the great ideas, the implementation may look nice but when you scratch the surface it breaks. The Scorched Earth DLC they released was marketed with a feature that you can transfer your character between ARKs (the maps in different servers). Now people, including myself, have lost characters to that process. Characters we have literally put hundreds of hours into leveling up, building our bases and taming and breeding  high level dinos. I hope ARK developers take a more professional approach and stop deploying faulty patches and get a grip, this can be a great game.

Ark is a great game but remember that it is in early access when getting involved.

--UPDATE--

I cannot recommend this game anymore. The developers will show you nice screenshots and make lots of updates and tell in patch notes how they fixed and added stuff. In reality, no, they may have added some visual stuff, maybe even some gameplay mechanics. But fixing things is not on their agenda. The game is basically ready as they want it, to show cool screenshots to sell more copies. By the time you realize the game's technical implementation is BAD, to put it in nice terms, they have your money and no, those issues will never be fixed. Instead they will put the money you spent into some new stuff that looks cool but is really only another money grab. The ideas and theme in this game are good, but you cannot play this without a supercomputer and you must live in south korea with a very good (wired) internet connection and must use a private server running on a supercomputer. Official servers are abysimal and the amount of jittering and  connection losses makes you pull out your teeth. This is even multiplied if you have a wireless, have fun losing the dinos you spent hours getting because of bugs with physics or because the server dropped your connection when you were fighting.

Before the performance, especially network-wise, is fixed I advice to stay away unless you have a supercomputer and a very good wired connection.",1473965589,1600955036,False,0,0,0.4977264404296875,0,True,False,False,76561197969583539,183,4,116003,45,115971,1601274100

3. AI needs work
4. PVE Public servers are abominations, PVP is a never ending crap show of changing metas as the nerfs endlessly rain down.
5. Items have different decay timers, so if you build on a public server, you have to regularly check in or your hard work goes poof.
6. Random times things go poof (characters, cryo fridge storage and tames) (see #1).
7. No timeline has EVER been kept, sometimes launches are close, sometimes they are delayed by months.

All in, for a couple of artists, they did ok.  The problem is that they keep making promises and then not keeping them so vote with your money and go to the next game.",1600910096,1600910096,False,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False,76561198875023950,10,1,137845,0,137845,1600022968

9,76404875,english,"Might be a bit surprised by the fact I'm not willing to give a positive review to this game considering the number of hours I've put into it over the last 4-5 years. Unfortunately I would not recommend this as a game for anyone to purchase beyond the base game without paid DLCs (which is almost mandatory if you want to get anywhere fast as the paid DLCs give a massive boost to resource gathering (Abberation = metal, Extinction/Genesis = element).

Without touching upon the player-base/offi server status, my reason for this is that considering just how old this game is it still rife with glitches, exploits, and what seems to be an automated anti-meshing system that will also permaban your account.

The glitches/exploits appear with each new DLC as examples: Meks in Extinction able to bombard bases to the ground from outside of turret range, also revisited with Magmasaurs in the most recent Genesis expansion (Because why not repeat mistakes of the past?). Go see the HowToArk youtube channel for far more examples of how stupidly broken this game can than I could list here. (Incidentally that channel should be sponsored by Wildcard as he does more to get bug/exploits fixed than their own dev team).

The bit regarding anti-meshing is actually what makes me really unwilling to recommend the game though. If you are not already aware meshing involves going under the mesh of the map which enables you to bypass player defenses, go to areas you are not supposed to be able to build etc. An anti-meshing system to prevent this is necessary. 

HOWEVER, Some of the maps are so unfinished they have holes in the mesh that literally allow a player to walk straight through into the mesh zone, these holes actually look like they could be small ratholes to build in legitimately except you die the moment you go into them due to anti-mesh. Well that is cool right? That is how it is supposed to work right? You'll just make sure you don't go back there again lol! Except they've managed to mess this one up also which you quickly realize when your account gets banned for...meshing. 

TL:DR - Could not recommend anyone spending the full cost for this game, or it's DLCs when you are more likely to lose everything to glitches and exploits, before the sucker punch of a permanent auto-ban rocks up because Wildcard are too lazy to finish their map. If you want to give it a try pick up the base game when it is on sale and check out the free player-designed DLCs.

10,76404106,english,"This game has a lot of good thing going for it. Unfortunately it is all overshadowed by the extremely poor developers, who release game breaking patches on the regular without testing it seems, and ""enforcement team"", which I guess is a euphemism for the mafia, who takes money irl from players to ban other players from playing the game. They won't ever admit making mistakes if you are caught in one of the game's hundreds of bugged interactions with the environment, which eventually will create false positives for their automated systems to punish or even ban you. I suppose it might be a tactic to get the people who are addicted to keep buying new copies of the game, however that is speculation. Not an unfounded one though.

As a long term member of the community, I've certainly heard dozens upon dozens, if not hundreds, of first account stories concerning these types of experiences. Their system for punishement is among the most outlandish ones I've ever heard of and it seems it is up to the individual member of the enforcement team what they wanna do, which takes away all forms of consistency. Sometimes outright cheating gets no punishment, and sometimes false positives gets unjustly banned without any warnings. And since their environment have straight up holes in it you fall through without meaning to, false positives are a common occurence.

I do not recommend buying this game, unless you plan on paying for your own server where you or a friend are in control. The official servers are a cesspool of toxicity and unpunished cheating/abusing game mechanics. I could delve deeper into the specifics, but after 10.000 hours of playing on official servers, I am convinced this is the way the developers want to keep it.

Overall i'd give this game a 7/10

Game is honestly amazing and filled with sooooo much things you can do with plenty of DLC that introduce new maps, dinos and equipment for you to use and explore 

there are soooo many creatures you can Tame and ride in ark each and every one having something special or unique about them this allows you to tame a creature that suits your needs

this game also has really good official servers that barely ever have any problems they might be a tiny bit laggy and sometimes will crash for a bit but is generally good 

Each map in this game is freaking huge and actually has a lot of cool aspects about them for example you can build on massive Mountains, Cliffsides, Caves or even eventually the Ocean or you can just build on the hills or flat land :P

graphics of this game is also really beautiful and everything in this game has a lot of detail like even the rocks on the ground has plenty of detail best part is that if your stressed out that your PC might not be able to handle the games graphic settles on epic you can just turn them to low and still play easily 

The game also has plenty of equipment from tools you need to climb and scale mountains to simple Metal axes and Picks and even extremely cool armor that can protect you against the elements or against physical attacks and sometimes both. the game also has a big variety of weapons such as crossbows, swords and spears to rifles, shotguns, pistols and even rocket launchers 

the only thing i find to be a problem in this amazing game is the community and the devs :( 
although small percentage of the community is good a majority of it is completely toxic for example if you choose to play on a pvp server you will get a player vs player experience such as being verbally attacked in text chat or even voice chat in game, the bad side of this community will completely wipe your base simply because they want to.. they also tend to abuse the game and exploit such as biting through the mesh or looking through structures / walls into your base On PVE servers its actually better but not by much sometimes in chat you will still be called out or just have some random guy attacking you but generally isn't that bad most of the people on PVE is actually quite chill but they can still be toxic and kill all your dinos and destroy your base by luring dinos to your base to destroy your buildings or use the flying dinos to pick up and drop giant snakes or bears into your base to kill all your tames 

the devs although they are extremely kind and fun to be around (when they are present on a server) and will always try their best to answer and get back to your tickets as fast as possible however they have smacked down a lot of rules on official servers such as no mesh biting (biting through the map such as the floor or cave walls) but the devs simply don't enforce their rules and although they will answer to your reports they generally wont do anything about it 

basically the game is amazing but this is pretty much how it goes

if you play on a PVP server expect to be trolled and completely wiped 

if you play on a PVE server expect to be yelled at in the text chat and have people dropping wild dinos into your base 

Dont expect any help from the devs

It's extremely easy to accidentally destroy hours worth of work because the game bugs out and places a wall in the wrong spot, automatically destroying what was already in its place.
If you get this game for free, then great. I recommend that you give it a try. I just can't recommend to anyone actually paying for this game because at the end of the day, it's just not worth it.

I now have 1300 hours in this game and I can say it's definitely worth $60. There are some frustrating moments and some bugs, but the game is super solid!

There are some balancing issues and there are still some bugs here and there, but the game has come a long way. 
I highly recommend playing with mods. The game is great by itself, but mods make it really fantastic. I almost feel bad for giving the game a negative review before. It's changed so much for the better.. it would be unfair to keep it as a negative review.

Original: (From September 2017)

After 800 hours, I'm going to review this game.

It's a ""finished"" game, for 60 dollars. (I got it for 15 dollars) The only reason it's ""Finished"" is so they can release DLC without getting backlash for doing so while it's early-access. The game is still horribly buggy, and the optimization is still trash. This is a money grab, and the DLC is going to be a ""look, more stuff, come back to our game!"" It'll work too, those players out there will buy the DLC, and then come back and play until they get bored of the bugs and optimization. It's a great experience, a great concept, but once you realise the grind and bugs to be had in this game, it'll ruin the whole game.

89,23939324,english,"Ark is, for me, almost a perfect concept. Fight and tame iconic historical and imaginary creatures and build yourself a homestead. It has a lot of deep and rewarding gameplay that can be tailored to what you enjoy. 

But there's no way I can recommend this to anyone visiting the storefront, not at full price.

Ark seemed to hit a point where it had a huge identity crisis. Things were pushed toward PvP and caused all sorts of balance issues in any public server. PAID DLC came out during the Early Access period and the game STILL is very unoptimised for many people. It's as if this game got to a point where it didn't know if it wanted to be survival, PvP or a teamwork based game and that the development suffered hugely for it. It really is a shame.

The public servers are a mess and I think it is because of this identity crisis, they never were balanced well for a PvP experience and the PvE side suffered. There's a lot of griefing and trolling, which is expected in online games but there's been very little done to counter it on official servers. 

There's also many bugs and halted development on various features, such as procedural Arks, DX12 implimentation, maps and mods that they've officially taken under their wing are not updated for recent builds and many little bugs are just left for many, many months with no communication as to if they are even on their radar for looking at. 

Paying £50 and more for the DLC isn't worth it when the devs seem to push spin offs, new content and let the foundations they were built on, stagnate.

---

HOWEVER...

I HAVE recommended this game to a few people that may play with me. ARK as a game concept is brilliant and it does have a few features that no other game provides currently. It is such a shame the dev team doesn't put more into polishing and finishing up things it takes on. 

The graphics are beautiful (if unoptimised) and the ecosystems, especially on some maps, are really well done and it does make you feel part of it, rather than player 1 tromping round destroying all. 

The settings for the game play are really customisable. If you play with a small group on a private server (I recommend that, public servers are awful) you can make things tailored around it. Playing SP? Not got a lot of time? You can change it to suit. If you prefer the hard survival game feel, you can most certainly ramp it up or if you are more interested in breeding fancy colour creatures and building you can give yourself an easier time with harvest, breeding etc multipliers.

There's a huge depth to the game and although it's really open on what you make your ARK centered around, each element of the sandbox is well done and fairly well balanced. It's worth the investment with a hefty price reduction, but not at full price.

Revision: Steam is now asking me to REVISE my review as I have played an additional 120 hours.
I stand by what I have said. I bought the game, so I may as well play it, but there is no way I will give WIldCard more of my money and no way I would recommend people to do so in the future. 

There are still elements of the game I really enjoy, as I said, it is almost a perfect concept in terms of taming, breeding, exploring and homesteading. But even five years on, there are some very old bugs that were never addressed. In fact the game is still riddled with bugs old and new and systems are still unpolished. The UI is gross and clunky and the neon text was never changed, it looks placeholder. The building is still horrible, especially when you compare it to other survival style games. The game is still badly un-optimised, its huge in size and although the graphics can be pretty, you are going to need a decent set up for them to not look like plasticine. Yet the Devs keep releasing DLCs and go on to copy paste this engine in other games with a slightly different theme. I can't recommend anyone to support this sort of practice.

Multiplayer on the other hand is not very suitable for beginners. Don't go on PvP servers unless you are willing to get slaughtered, grieved and whatnot. You will need friends in order to survive. I has none  :(

43,76239606,english,"Let me tell you something, even if you like dinosaurs, survival games and pvp raiding; this probably isnt the game for you. 

Ark isnt a game for people who like games, Ark is a ungodly creation that beyond all reason, despite it's unforgiving mechanics, disgusting imbalance, repetitive LMB-spamming non-pvp combat, janky and heavily exploitable glitches, and dear god the unoptimized mess that is its everything; still has players willing to stay online 24/7 literally taking shifts, to ensure they can have the most fun on a PvP server.   

This game in its intended form -PvP on Official settings- is enough to make you renounce even looking at a monitor ever again, I cannot believe people play and enjoy the game without playing with unofficial server rates; You could spend upwards of 2 hours taming your first low level dinosaur with the most basic method, and literally over a day getting some of the higher ranked ones, breeding has players literally taking turns to look after a virtual dinosaur for about as much time as I'd imagine it would take a real one to mature.

Good god I hate this game, but that doesn't change the fact that I have a SSD specifically set up to hold only this dog shit game because I can't stop playing it. I don't know why, I acknowledge all of its flaws and loathe it for them, the players beg for changes, map revamps, their damn dinosaurs not to fall through the world when they spend 12 hours hatching them.

I've played my share of survival games this one is my favorite by far, this game is punishing and unforgiving when you first start out but don't let this discourage you. Mastering your environment as well and the Flora and Fauna is half the fun. You start with caveman tech and move your way up to future tech and boy does that make it sound much simpler than it actually is. The best part about the game is it's social aspect, I've met and kept so many friends in this game simply because I didn't want to naked idiot on the beach punching dodos forever. Tribes you join will take on the aspects of the people in charge so choose wisely, and before you settle on a server make sure there are no tyrant Tribes that either push your shit in to make sure you never reach a point where you could challenge them or more often than not just for fun. Or you know you could join a PvE server like some kind of pussy =P

(going to be kinda long) 
it seems Ark has gotten alot of bad reviews recently, based off of the fact they released a paid dlc and fixed the character server changing that everyone has been complaining about an asking for. i see alot of reviews saying the game is buggy/glitchy/laggy what have you. i have owned this game since about the first week it has came out. i played for a few months then took a break an came back to it. The devs have done an outstanding job on this game, from bringing new dinos and engrams to fixing different bugs. to bringing out new content regularly, i to was upset about having to pay 20$ for the dlc content when i as well as many others have been apart of this games making since the beginning. But heres the thing either they bring out content to make money off of or the game will end up like so many other early access games an just get abandonded due to lack of funds.  this game does not deserve bad reviews due to the fact you have to pay for dlc or even the fact it has some minor gameplay errors (in early access) the game is Great an i do not regret buying it an i know many others who also do not regret it.

if you are interested i run my own private server, active community, non toxic

60,51426916,english,"ARK would be a great game if it wasnt for the players. The game is based around the time you are able to play. This has to be continuous time with little to no breaks in between. The worst part about this game is the way players are in PvP. Nothing matters to others more than your misery. Doesnt matter that people would get 200x more loot by leaving dinos and some resources for people to continue playing with, they wipe everything you own and laugh cause ""its PvP"". Most of the time this is done offline while you have no ability to defend your base. The turrets in game only delay them breaking into your base, they just soak up your bullets and boom take your loot and kill your shit while your asleep. This wouldnt be bad if it didnt take 2-4 days to raise a dino and multiple hours to tame a dino. In order to get anywhere on a PvP server on ark you have to have people on 24/7 and have to build up with defenses and turrets within your first day or you get to start over because people destroyed everything of yours. The dinosaur AI is broken, half the time dinosaurs (like Rexs) will just flee from the player for no reason at all. There was a boss that could be glitched and killed with ease for months on end due to a simple hitbox issue. Meshing has been a thing since the game started and its STILL not fixed apparently. ARK is broken from the ground up, fully geared to those who are able to play all day and it punishes the people who want to pvp in this style of survival game who have things to do. 100% commitment to play for 0 reward unless you like being a troll it seems. Not to mention they constantly pump out unbalanced broken content, where you get to try it out for 2 hours, (about the time it takes you to get half the bloodpacks needed for the first new tame) and then they get to keep your money. so its not like you can try out their new stuff and not worry about them keeping your money when you realize the game is actually even more broken with each new DLC.",1561395921,1600530514,False,47,16,0.633586406707763672,0,True,False,False,76561198138348874,43,2,357268,92,305820,1601987230

Buggy. Things fall through things that they shouldnt, there's plenty of clipping issues.

I won't say it's not fun. It has its moments.
I will say I took a break because of running into several bugs that I'd hoped would be adressed. I was going to return and review based off any updates that came along. Unfortunately the devs decided to divert the resources from bug squashing and optimization and work on a $15 expansion pack instead.

I played small tribes for ages, got max lvl, tek, the lot, but it just wasnt the same, it felt hollow, this wasnt the game I bought and loved all those years ago, the game was a dinosaur game, a simple, primitive, dinosaur game where the end game was electricity, it was perfect in all the wrong and right ways. Its honestly such a shame that the people new to the game, or even experienced instead of experiencing the things mentioned before, are having a 326 mana bop their head, the game was brilliant because even a guy with a crossbow and pike was a threat to you and your primitive flak armour while riding your rex or ptera, and not the lvl 300+ mana, the ""top dogs"" would always fall, and new would rise, unlike now, servers and the game were constantly evolving while remaining the same, beautiful mess of a game every player that bought the DINOSAUR game back then loved.

Decided to right this long ass review because ark holds a special sweet yet sour place in my brain, just really saddens me new people buying the game cant experience that incredible game at its peak all those years ago, where people played for fun, not to slave for pixels

My reminiscing is officially over x)

Review:

I should probably do an actual review part lol, At £45 (A big investment for most) I just cant recommend this game to anyone looking to have fun, its not a dinosaur game, its just a survival game with a few dinosaurs and crazy monsters, they're cool yes, but their not dinosaurs.. the metas boring, the player base is beyond ""sad?"" couldnt really think of a word there, the fun dinosaur loving morons living out their childhood fantasies that populated this game just arent there anymore, its just drones slaving away doing the same thing where after a point your literally wishing youd get raided just for some change, I did, until I quit and xferred ownership, the game just lost its niche as they slowly yet surely pushed random content noone asked for out, I bought a dinosaur survival game, and now its just a hollowed out carcass of what was.

62,76162689,english,"This game is quite possible the worst survival game out there.

the game conceptually is amazing but the ""Community"" And player base is beyond the most toxic I've ever seen. NOBODY lets you actually play a game, every big tribe has the monopoly on a server and they will cheat (Usually ESP) and find you and offline wipe you. There's an abundance of cheaters and the devs show only apathy with dealing with it. 

The Developers show no interest in fixing their game, the servers are terrible and unoptimised with THE biggest D-sync issues and lag I've ever seen in a game, hit-reg is almost non-existent. 

The only other way you can enjoy this game is PVE servers but you just hit a point where it becomes pointless to play, no goal to work towards and it cuts a huge amount of content from the game, on the other hand there's PvP servers; they would be so much fun if people actually let you get a chance to play but like I said, ESP and baby-dick syndrome will drive this insecure community to wipe anyone who even tries to start up.

The biggest reason for the toxic community is IRL trading, which is where the big tribes gather materials and sell them to other players for money. People don't let anyone enjoy the game because it threatens their ""Business"" 

Truly THE most pathetic gaming community out there.

76,76151638,english,"If you're playing the on the ""Island"" Map you're probably not going to enjoy yourself too much. The premise of this game has always excited me, however, when I had first started playing I was disappointed. From my perspective the map was relatively plain and seemingly relied on the concept of dinosaurs to carry it. Exploration was a moot point when everywhere I looked I said ""Oh, more island, great.""

That said, I decided to give the game another shot on a different map. I tried out ""The Center"" because it sounded the coolest to me and I admittedly had a lot of fun. I turned down the difficulty somewhat and increased expereince gain so that myself and the friend I had playing with me could get around to taming the cooler dinos and exploring the more interesting parts of the map without having to worry as much about getting eaten immediately. Without going into spoilers, 'The Center' is a great map. There's a lot to discover and it honestly renewed my perspective on the game.

With a new outlook everything else became a little more enjoyable as well. After spending a bit of time getting acclimated I can now say that I would recommend this game. But only so long as you have a considerable amount of patience and you avoid 'The Island' at all costs. AT ALL COSTS.

88,76030779,english,"I think that the majority of people who dislike this game are, in my opinion, playing it ""wrong."" I've tried official PvP servers... and God, what a mess those were. I'm a fairly busy guy, and I cannot devote my life to defending my meager base from an army of 13 year olds and others with positively no lives who can somehow dedicate every 24-hour day to ruining my experience. Granted, if you have the time to devote to that style of play, I have no doubt it would be a transcendent experience. 

When I first started playing, I think the first 20 or 30 hours I played singleplayer. I definitely should have done more reading, but I legitimately had NO idea how to tame dinosaurs. I was playing caveman survivalist. It was crazy, building spears and little thatch huts, running away for my life from raptors, building fire when the sun went down and roasting the meat I had gathered during the daytime... It was fantastic. 

After that, I unlocked Ark's true potential in, what is in my opinion, the best way to play the game. A private server with friends. Don't like the gather or tame rate? Tweak it up a bit. Not enough to ruin the immersion, but enough so that you don't have to spend an entire Saturday meticulously watching over an egg. Exploring the world, building bases, taming dinosaurs, occasionally grieving together over the regrettable loss of said dinosaurs... It's great fun. And even if you want the true PvP experience, who's to say you can't do that on a private server with friends? Even if it's just two tribes of 3 or 4 people, you can still set up organized PvP events with dedicated separate bases and dinos, and then go back to enjoying the PvE experience. 

If you aren't sucked into the environment and all of its magical possibilities the first or second time you get on, I doubt you will be able to extract any real enjoyment out of the game. But I would highly recommend giving this game a try on a private server with friends. There are easy-to-use hosting services that will get this all set up for you with easy access to configuration files for ~$10 a month.

And had all my crud stomped on cause a stray arrow hit one of those massive long neck dinos.... Even the bugs nearly got me.

After just about headbutting my keyboard in frustration. I finally got a break. Found a nice quiet spot where, not EVERYTHING wanted to kill me. I got down a solid little base. Made some tames. Started to progress. Got my first Pterra. Then was promptly reminded that i'm playing ARK... An Alpha Raptor and two of his buddies decided to tear through my camp and all I had. With me and my new Pterra barely escaping alive.

I was devastated... All that progress. Practically all my new companions... Turned into Raptor dung, in seconds. I perched my barely alive new friend on the higest thing I could see. And mulled over wwhat I could do about this dumpsterfire situation I had once again found myself in.

Well this game was great and a bit challenging to start and I greatly enjoyed it.. Up until this latest patch. The devs decided it would be a great idea to take the main aspect of this game (taming and raising dinosaurs to fight for and serve you) and nerf them into a pointless existance. Don't even bother taming a dinosaur in this game at this point unless it is for transporation or to help gather. The hours you spent doing that could be better spent on grinding materials to make firearms to kill the other dinosaurs. Nothing like seeing hours of work poured into a game to tame and raise a dinosaur, level it up to level 150 only to watch a level 50 wild dino kill it.

Thanks for ruining the game Devs. Our community had planned on a pvp day and now that's in shambles until you fix this game you have ruined and broken. If we're going to run around with guns to shoot at people I guess we might as well go play CoD or something.

*****************
UPDATE (Feb 22nd, 2018)

So I've given it over a year since my last review of this game. A couple of expansion DLC's have launched and I thought I'd give the game another shot. I had originally loved it so much before the infamous dino nerf that had the community in an uproar for making the dinos next to useless for several weeks before WildCard dialed back on the nerf bat.

I am left sitting here puzzled at the performance on this game. Just a couple weeks prior to my first review of this game I had installed a GTX 970 in my 6 and a half year old pc. The game ran great. I could put it at near maxed out settings and it was beautiful without a stutter, easily cruising along at 60+ FPS. Now I have a much more robust computer with a more powerful processor and a GTX 1070 and the game runs WORSE!?!?!  This sent me to immediately see if anyone else had been saying anything else about it. So now I have to sit here and call BS on WildCard's claims of optimization. You claim to be optimizing this game yet it runs worse than it did a year ago. I understand you have added more content, but you have released a horribly optimized game. That's if your claims to have optimized, and continuing to optimize, the game can be believed.

When you can only run medium settings on a game with a higher end graphics card something is wrong. Sorry, while I see you have fixed the problem with the once overly nerfed tamed dinos I still cannot give a thumbs up on this game.

9/14/2020 Review Update

So here I am again checking to see the current state of ARK. There have definitely been some improvements and quite a few creatures have been added to the game. There are some interesting creatures in some of the DLC's and it can be a beautiful game. However I feel that the price of a now 5 year old game going up from what it was after initial release is a bit.. foolish.  The Devs are now asking more for this game than it was at release and, yes while they have added a bit to the game, it still feels like a money grab to me. Optimization is still so so, but the 2060 Super I'm using now seems to be handling it mostly okay.  It's a good game but if I were you I'd wait for a sale.",1452079956,1600108343,False,13,0,0.483641535043716431,0,True,False,False,76561198077894505,65,5,23843,4417,13747,1601514202

Additional comments: It's mostly fun to just explore around in. If you wanna reach high tier on a server prepare to get rid of your life, but on single player you can edit the settings to lessen the grind. The developers have made some problematic choices by focusing on DLC and new games rather than polishing what they already had. Also one of the most accidentally scary games of all time.

When I play solo or a few friends, I end up something like: ???
-80% hatch time.
-80% tame time.
-60% animal durability (but add armor)
+80% animal PET durability (add armor)

It's brutal. Game continues when you log-out and you can DIE WHILE YOU'RE GONE from the game. It's a 
live world"". Hide between a random rock, lay in the brush, and logout.
Pets always die, which sucks when you spend 4 hours trying to tame/maintain them or if they've been ""your baby"" for days and you lose them.

I have built a tatch house, killed a couple birds, made a hatchet and clothes and find myself wondering wtf is the point. There is absolutely no direction, objective or overall mission to accomplish besides experiencing the world and not dying. 

single-player is meaningless as the most fun you will have in this game is interacting with tribes and other persons which requires expansions and experience. Without experience multiplayer is basically a face-palm, my first hour in multiplayer was spent trying to find a spot on the map that wasn't already claimed just so i could build a campfire. As soon as I found a spot I was immediately nuked by a flying dino bird causing me to lose my items and respawn back where i started from. 

Yes the graphics are great, but the feeling the visuals give you will only last a couple hours. I wish I had not expected much going into this, this is a game that is closer to minecraft rather than Turok or The Isle.

6/3/20:  Tried again and was getting good progress with taming, crops, harvesting but as soon as you leave your area of the island and your not aware.  You die instantly by some new monster or tiger jumps out of no where and kills you and your pet.  I played single player.  I like the game but there is no help other than what you find on youtube or the net.  I have not lost all my pets and mounts and back to square one.  This is what really pisses me off.  And you cant give your pets commands to break off attack so they can follow you and not be killed.   I hate this fucking game game with a passion so I will play less now and not expect much. 6/24/20:  Well this game is just not worth my time any more.  I go and retrieve all my lost pets and weapons, resources and on the way back to my camp.  A fuking Trex or someting kills them all.  WTF all that work for what?  No screw this game and the devs for allowing it to be released with so many bugs and glitches.  7/3/20:  Here we go again.  the game updates, I go in to tame some pets, bringing them to base camp and they all 3 of them are killed by ocean predators that I gone through many other times with tamed pets.  I'll just say F those devs and game programmers who keep f ing with the game enviroment.",1556488868,1599979525,False,1,0,0.47511756420135498,0,True,False,False,76561198028436650,53,12,22321,59,20069,1601708471

32,38290238,english,"In my honest opinion, only hardcore Ark fanboys can recommend this game.

PRO-I enjoy this game, I play single player and it's a fun little sandbox with dinosaurs.
PRO-It's a fairly engaging experience and you may have fun building up if you can ignore or get around CONs 1-3.

CON-1. Holy #$%^ this game is a huge waste of time, literally.  Takes a long time to get anywhere.  Requires hauling lots of resources back and forth to build a base.  Taming one creature and take days just for the actual process, not including gathering the resources for it.  This seems to be preferred by some people that think wasting time makes the achievement more meaningful.  Not much of a problem if you jack up rates on a private server, so not a problem for me.

CON-2. The building system is ridiciously bad.  Hard to make structures even look even and hard to make contraptions that work due to restrictions designed for pvp; but you can somewhat alleivate this by installing CON-3

CON-3.  You have to download a #$%^load of mods to improve on all the flaws in the game.  Or at least a couple if you don't want to experience extreme frustration with the building system, among other things.

CON-YOU-SHOULDN'T-GET-THIS-GAME-FOR-PC.  Really the only reason I would NOT recommend this game, and it doesn't even have anything to do with gameplay.  People that claim requirements for this game are not high are full of #$%^.  Every major update requires 100+ GB of free HD space to install.  Seriously, you're expected to keep how many movies worth of space open just to play ONE GAME?  A lot of people had to uninstall more than a couple of games to update this ONE GAME.  And of course you can't play it online of Steam unless you update it, so, there you go.

Enjoy wasting 100 GB of HD space or headaches everytime a major update comes along.  This is why I believe only major fanboys could defend this game, since they don't even consider the above a thing; and I could understand that if you only play Ark all day.  I don't have a potato PC, I have other games I want to play.

Update:  They also regularly update the game with 100 MB ~ 2GB patches; and I found out that a portion of the community endorses this, because they like their ""hotfixes"".  So, if you like regular updates vs. their biweekly 20 GB updates on console, I guess this game is for you.

CON-5 for 2020.  Should have included this from the start.  DEVS ARE DISHONEST.  They make promises and don't keep them.  On the ""first"" season pass announced, it was for all future content.  Fast forward, surprise, every new content is a new season.  On the aberration announce, they promised some amazing reaper queen ability.  On release, SURPRISE, the ability was changed.  I believe the original promise was that you'd be able to tame a queen, but I honestly can't remember anymore.  They make empty promises, then will go back on that promise, and EDIT their previous announcement to match what they actually give you.  Everyone that followed this game from the start knows this.  No one even bothers to talk about it anymore.  Every so often you will have discussions pop up when they release something that wasn't what they promised.  Apparently, those promises weren't made when you go back to check the announcement =3",1513206672,1599930514,False,2,0,0.503105580806732178,0,True,False,False,76561198001200895,134,6,9040,0,6997,1514847363

45,75776107,english,"i've played 109 hours of this game - i've never been able to get further in than the beach, because RNG makes it so i get murdered by things that shouldn't even be there. There hypothetically is a difficulty curve, but there's also random spikes in difficulty, because beasts you aren't prepared for wander into your safe zone - you can try to prepare, but you'll get screwed over by something you literally can't hope to deal with. That's just...not fun. Even darksouls doesn't have the risk of the final boss wandering into the beginning of the game

This game is incredibly tedious to play in single player, and good luck getting anyone to play with you in multiplayer, unless you already know someone who has the game.

Its also incredibly non-immersive, because the game is almost impossible to play without the wiki, and even if you did manage to play without the wiki, well, the constantly loading and unloading textures will certainly break your immersion.Also, things load and reload oddly - because apparently if you play single player for short periods of time it just....seems to delete animals. And i have a fairly beefy gaming computer, and it still does this. Not to mention, the file size. Good lord this game took up like half of my available space on my hard drive. Did i mention i had to download it twice, because the first time, the executable for the game just randomly deleted itself? all the other files were there, the executable just vanished. 

I got this game on sale for 12$, and have logged 109 hours, and i do not feel that i have gotten my money's worth in fun. The only saving grace is you can adjust the settings to make the game as easy as you want, but to me i find a weird moral dilemma between wanting to, you know, have fun playing the game i bought, and not wanting to skew the game balance terribly in my favour so as to feel cheaty. Because yeah i'm sure i could finish the game pretty quickly if i made the settings favour my character and creatures while weakening  the things trying to kill me, but if you make it that easy, what's the point? 

I suppose whether this game is fun depends on your stance on PVP, how many willing friends you have, and how daring you are. Either you'll like this game, or you won't, in my opinion.",1599791933,1599918215,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198251221096,105,15,12915,3808,7239,1601955560

94,75821512,english,"Review is of the Mac/Linux version! If you are of the PC people, this review does not apply to your version of the game.

TL;DR: If WildCard isn't going to update the Mac/Linux games alongside the PC game, stop calling it a cross-platformer or stop selling the game as multiplayer on those platforms. It's impossible to play alongside my friends, and the game sucks for solo newbies despite being a beautiful game with a lot of potential. Mac/Linus people, be aware if you buy the game you probably won't be playing it alongside your pc friends.

I bought this game because my gf has more than 5000 hours on the game, and it's been a fun part of her life. She's passionate about it; she talks about breeding dinos, meeting people in rp servers and making lifelong friends, and laying waste to her enemies in pvp.  So, of course I wanted to join her to see and experience her passion and what makes the game so great. Hey, if I can watch her be a warrior queen while I am over here stealing dodos and gathering thatch with a hatchet, it's a win-win. 

When we saw Ark available for Mac (she has pc, I have mac), we were both excited to play. She moved in with me, and we were waiting for her pc to arrive, so we couldn't play together. But I went ahead to try and figure out parts of the game so I wouldn't be a total newb (disclaimer: I am still painfully newbie and all of my ARK knowledge has come from my gf, please don't think I understand half of what happens).

For a while, I had to play singleplayer. 
 
Singleplayer is not fun. It is hard. It is punishing. It is lonely. As a new player, I have little idea on what to do or how to do things with dinos; I had to constantly ask for help in singleplayer mode,  which isn't a feasible game solution. My gf was playing her own games via phone, and I felt dumb for not knowing what to do. Most games give a tutorial. Ark... does not. I put all my skill points into oxygen until my GF saw what I was doing. Apparently hatchets work on stones for gathering items as well as pickaxes. And your character gets drunk when eating blackberries. Needless to say, despite being the dodo queen and capturing all dodos I ran across, I was not having fun. You can only hug so many dodos before you need the voice of another person to keep you sane, no matter the HD quality or map size. Art-wise, Ark is amazing- the water, the dino varieties (pls big Bront dino no step on my base), the scale of the land- the game is breathtakingly beautiful, and the art department did wonders. I just don't want to cry into my dodo flock in HD, when I could be crying with my dodo flock in HD [i] with my friends [/i].

However. Ark was meant to be a multiplayer game. This is clear from the ingrams/engrams/wristgem magic/blueprints that appear each level up, which includes cages, handcuffs, billboard signs. There's a push to talk key command. The game talks about tribes, and given that some dinos take *8 hours* to tame, a team effort seems needed. This is a cool feature; I enjoy games where the group must work together to build something greater. I was excited to be a part of that. Also, if you're in a group, you can ask questions like, ""how do I find fiber"" and ""Should I put this skill point in weight or oxygen?""  or even ""The hell are these prehistoric seagulls stealing my raw meat for?"" It's even more effective in multiplayer to ask these questions because Ark doesn't have a tutorial to help you, so when you ask, your teammates are likely to respond, rather than your questions float away on the wind.

When GF's computer arrived, GF and I bought an unofficial server to 1) try and play together and 2) invite friends to play. Well, I couldn't connect. She connected fine. Our friends connected fine. ""What patch are you?"" 

Turns out, if you have a Mac or Linux (we discovered), your patch will be arriving... whenever Wildcard feels like bestowing it unto us. Until then, if your server is updated, or your friends game is updated, you cannot play with them. For some reason, Wildcard does not release the Mac/Linux version alongside the PC version, despite the [i] hundreds of other publishers that do so. [/i]

Should then Wildcard reach down their hands to bestow their god-like bounty of patch updates to us pleebs, we can join servers with the PC master race. But as soon as the next patch comes out for the  PC/PS4/??? (I don't believe anything updates before the PC game), the Mac/Linux people will be unable to be on a server (some official, all unofficial). The patches don't talk to each other; you cannot have a user of an older patch communicate with a user of a newer patch (unlike an MMO). 

Other Mac/Linux users who have passed through the golden gate into servers before the patch can no longer get into servers after a new patch, as the servers almost all run pc versions of the game. The users report (well, their friends do, they can't access the game) their dinos dying, their structures decayed, their crops fallow. Reportedly, people spend hours/days/weeks on the game only to lose all progress because Wildcard does not release cross-platform patches together. 

Two ways to fix this. The first way to fix this is to have everyone in the server turn off their updates, but that then means no one else can play on other servers because they now have the issue you just had. You're asking your friends to come join you and share the patch sterility plague. The second way? Wildcard releases all platform patches together.

Since neither option will happen (for me, maybe you have some awesome friends, review reader), I'll find another game to play with friends. Sadly, my gf and I will not play together on something she loves. I wish there was another game like this, but at least the other games allow me to play side by side with her, rather than talking awkwardly in discord about a solo run in which my dodos crap over my unconscious, blackberry drunken body.

There are other glitches: steam overlay doesn't work, my mouse also didn't ever want to work in game (it's ok though because I never know what I should press or skills I should give myself so I just didn't). Most of this game is glitches, according to gf, so my main point a complaint that this game claims multiplayer when it should not claim such on other platforms.

I spent 49.99 for a multiplayer game that does not allow multiplayer (because of how the devs release patches). I cannot recommend the mac/linux version to anyone who wants to play multiplayer.",1599869195,1599869238,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198025163810,169,2,13412,7877,1226,1602032422

9,75814683,english,"Phenomenal despite all the bugs, of which there are many, but most have a workaround or are just funny (e.g. floating dinosaurs and eggs falling through the ceiling), so it doesn't really bother me much. My friends and I played on a private server, so we had to do everything ourselves, which was fun. The social aspects helped it be fun, but single player has some tools to help you solo things (I think like a 3x multiplier to some stats?). There are some ""survival game"" aspects I found tedious, like feeding large amounts of dinosaurs and watching babies with long maturation times, but the game provides sliders so you can trivialize those things if you want to. You can even make your tamed dinos consume no food at all. We didn't do that because my friends enjoyed those aspects of the game, and they willingly let me refrain from helping with those instead. They also find other things tedious that I enjoy, so it's kind of a neat team effort thing where we all can do what we like and others feel like you're doing them a favor lol. Each dinosaur has at least one unique ability or feature, so while some things become obsolete by mid- to late-game, most species remain useful, even if just for niche purposes. For example, there's a clearly ""best"" flying mount with all-around amazing stats compared to the others, but it still can't sprint short distances as fast as an early-game flying mount (which is also small, and thus great for just flying around your base without getting in the way of things). I think that's clever design.

One thing, though: I strongly recommend playing on a server with the mod ""Structures Plus"" (S+) enabled. It's almost mandatory. Building structures is VERY wonky without it to the point of being annoying. It's still a little wonky WITH S+, but you get used to it and learn ""tricks"" to make it do what you want, so it's not annoying 98% of the time.",1599857761,1599857976,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561197998177389,130,12,40808,2205,36807,1601964477

62,75772579,english,"I preface this review with a very high awareness of the flaws and bugs of this game.

My wife and I are always looking for new games to play and we seem to gravitate toward survival/crafting games with a sense of combat. The ""survival builder"" game genre has a lot of choices these days but none of them seem to scratch the itch quite like ARK.

I can articulate the pros and cons of the game and apply loads of logic to why it's good or bad, but the honest indicator is whether we continue to play the game despite the flaws. We do and here's why:

- The combination of combat, danger, mortality combined with resource gathering, crafting, building, and animal taming/breeding is a specific flavor and formula that I haven't been able to find anywhere else
- It provides my family and I the opportunity to work together when hunting dinosaurs or navigating through a cave but also the freedom to do your own thing when you've died for the 5th time due to miscommunication
- The ongoing progress and constant hunt for the better base location and build gives us excitement enough to talk about it randomly throughout the day
- It's a great connection with my wife that ticks a box for me that I otherwise can't get very easily

Granted, there are a truck load of issues that we complain about regularly. The long load times, the bugs, the map glitches... and of course the absolutely ridiculous inefficiency with disk storage are valid reasons to avoid the game... but I tolerate it because I genuinely enjoy the game so much when it's working properly.

We utilize the Ark Server Manager, as most do, which really makes hosting a server possible. It's the only way to fly. Unfortunately, starting the server can take up to 15 minutes in my experience. I've read stories of longer start times on some forums. This really puts a damper when we already have limited time to play evening games. With a little planning and server automation, we make it work.

All in all we really enjoy this game and would recommend it to anyone looking for that particular itch. The biggest caveat is that you have to be willing to accept the risk of some buggy behavior from time to time.",1599784789,1599784789,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198066467891,140,1,34725,395,33866,1601956210

71,75766876,english,"This is a game that has been around for a hot minute at this point in time. I have always heard a lot about it and several of my friends convinced me to finally get it. 

When you first start out, the game can be extremely overwhelming. There's not a super clear direction in what you need to be doing or anything, even though there is somewhat of a story/lore behind the game. 
How,ever after looking some stuff up online, and playing to get some things done....I quickly found that I could spend loads of time in this game!

The creatures are amazing and the world is very well lived in! Most of the animals you can tame have a good ""job"" function such as stone collecting or wood collecting or even just carrying heavy loads across long distances. 

I do have a few gripes with the game that I feel I need to address here. 

For starters multiplayer is kind of broken. Often times my friends and I are trying to connect to our host server and often get pushed back to the main menu, stuck in a loading screen, or the game straight up crashes. After several attempts we can usually get in, but again this is a problem.

Another issue I have is, the graphics of this game seem a bit dated. I mean I know it released years ago but even for its time of release games like this looked loads better. Even when you turn your graphics settings all the way up to epic...it never feels like the textures get anymore detailed. 

Overall, ARK's base game is loads of fun, especially with friends! My friends like catching creatures and I love building awesome bases so it works out great!

my experience with official servers hasnt been as amazing, most notably due to lag and quite a large power imbalance between tribes, however i've heard that a lot of other people have fun with them.

for anyone playing the game for the first time, i definitely recommend starting on singleplayer and to change a lot of the world settings (default settings are far from great) like doubling xp gain, harvest and taming speed, and changing the difficulty offset from 0.2 to 1 (will make dinos spawn with much higher levels like on official servers. it both makes dinos more challenging to fight and makes taming them more rewarding)",1475950717,1599694687,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561197964257835,73,5,37270,3064,30637,1601991377

If they make the server aspect and optimisation a little (ok, a LOT) better this could be the game of the decade 

PRO:
You can pick people up with a giant bird and drop them to their deaths. 
Pretty realistic crafting (you need 400 iron ingots for a gate)
Dinosaurs

CON: 
Players tend to be either super friendly or the online incarnation of satan and will do anything to make you suffer, prepare for that
Boring mammals, except the penguins, they are awesome 

All in all this game has sucked up a lot of time I could have spent studying, I regret nothing.

You can even make your own server and have your own community! which I did after 4000 hours, also made my own mod and created my own personal experience and it was nice.

You will have a blast building your base, taming your dinos, levelling them up, and you will swear as you watch all your hard work wrecked by the lost carnivore that you just don't have the power to stop.

PvE servers are perfect for exploring the HUGE maps and taming dinosaurs along the way. 
While the PvE servers are by no means ""safe"", PvP servers offer another exhilarating danger to the game as you never know who else you might stumble across. 
Another player, a group, their base? Maybe someone stumbles across your base while you're offline. 
Will they be friendlies? Will you? You can build up your defenses, but will they be enough? 
The answer to all of those questions is most likely NO. 
You WILL spend hours on a base just to see it destroyed. But don't let that turn you away!
Learn to move on and make the best of a bad situation and you will take away some valuable life lessons from this wonderful game.

UNTIL ALAS, I FOUND A FRIEND!  We punched trees together until we made ourselves a beautiful little house made of palm leaves.  We discovered the wildlife together and tamed a couple dodos.  After we tamed a couple dodos we decided to bring it up a notch and tame some monkeys and a compy or two.  We were really making a life for ourselves in this strange and new world that we found ourselves in.  Things were great, we had no worries in the world.  No job to go to, no nagging wife to wake up to - just two bros living in paradise... that is, until disaster struck.  On a mid summer evening while we were laying in bed philosophically talking about the island, its origin, and how we got there, we heard loud noises.  My friend peaked his head outside to see what the commotion was.  Upon seeing nothing, he stepped out of our front door just a bit to take a look around.  Within a second, I saw a giant head reach down and snatch him right up.  Just like that, my friend... gone.  Within seconds I heard a loud terrifying roar like it swallowed my friend whole.  Before I knew it, it's massive head was tearing through the roof of our home - well, I guess my home.  I had to think of an exit strategy and quick!  Quickly thinking, I through my monkey Albert at the large and vicious monster.  As the terrifying beast ripped through Albert, I was able to leave through the front door, between the beasts legs and escape.  Running as fast as I could, I never looked back.  I still to this day don't know what the beast was, but I can only assume it was the great T-Rex.  I don't ever plan on going back to find out, and I refuse to get close to anyone else I meet.

This game has one of my favourite theme's and concept's I've seen in a game
but it is absolutely FILLED with some game breaking bugs such as
zones where you can get stuck and have to starve to death, map meshes that aren't aligned with rendered terrain,
terrain that will not let you walk up it, all sorts of stuff.

Creatures can often get stuck in terrain and trees, which while broken has become somewhat of a gameplay feature. My most recent gripe with this game is the genesis expansions which force a sort of pay to win scenario where it is 1000x times easier to level up, harvest and acquire items in the genesis maps, screwing over a lot of regular players.

If you enjoy spending hours grinding while constantly looking behind your back only to lose it all while offline I would recommend

the community is good on unofficial servers.
can't say the same for territorial pve players on official. last time i tried pvp i was run off servers because i wasn't invited. but the who can blame pvp for being cautious. it is pvp after all. i could be a spy doing recon ready to raid them. funy.
if your playing for fun and not immersal escape then i recommend it. if you have a life to squander. and don't mind giving life to it. the i recommend it.
if your someone with little time or patients then this is not a game for you.

79,75553138,english,"ARK: Survival Evolved is a fantastic game under the right circumstances. I have over 600 hours on this game, so I think I can give you a general idea of whether or now you would like it.

My PC is a MSI Raider GE73, and ARK can run decently well on medium graphics. On my old Alienware, ARK constantly make the PC blue screen on medium. If you're interested in this game, make sure you have decent specs on your PC.

This game is difficult to play alone, or on official servers, due to the toxic community. That being said, if you have a server where you can play with friends, I could not recommend this game enough. Much like Minecraft, there are infinite things to do in this game. There are always structures to build, dinosaurs to breed, and challenges to overcome. I enjoy games with a steady grind to them, but if you don't, the game allows you to tweak the settings so you can avoid that aspect of it.",1599411234,1599411234,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198082045135,93,4,44260,2222,37745,1602009042

CONS

Optimization is piss poor, servers are shit, non stop lag, freezes and don't let me even start on bugs and glitches.
Game is broken, and feels like early access... More like ""early"" early access

IMPORTANT

Heard from someone that the company they rent servers from, nitrado, will stack 8 servers on a system that can have only 6, what would explain all the lag spikes we are getting.

- Below £10 on sale 

-145+GB game

-Working on paid stuff while the game isn't complete :@ (Game is now out of Beta and Is NO DIFFERENT. Cash cow by wildcard studios) 

-I have a i9 10900k, RTX 2070 Super Sli, and 32gb ram. Still after my first  review 4 years ago Runs like a toaster.  

-I bought this game for £8 in 2015, It was in early access and horrid to run then, Still horrid to run now,  little to no improvement on optimization


-Gameplay is good though, Crafting, Taming, Exploring, Playing with others are all good points
-They fixed a few problems, the developers are always releasing updates. AND PAID DLC

- AAA Costs but ZZZ Decisions. WRONG choices

-Still a buggy game, a 145GB file size ? Graphics are outdated

i dont get how a game of this file size can have such poor graphics for a game in 2020, Look at red dead, gta, breakpoint ?

Is it worth a buy? I'd rather finger my dog
Uninstalled yet again.
Steam needs to Stop developers and publishers from doing s**t like this, Polluting the game industry.

Update your game engine ffs get with the times

I like survival games and this is one of my favorites for many reasons. One of them being the fact that the maps are so huge! It would take a long time to memorize every nook and cranny of it. Another is that youre able to play with friends. I personally like to play singleplayer, but its great that I can easily host my world over their servers at no cost! There are a few settings you need to change for singleplayer to be possible to play though. This isnt the same for everybody but the initial settings are made for multiplayer where multiple people can attack a threat or mine a cluster of resources, so changing them would make it more reasonable to play. Although you may not think it at first, this game has a story you are able to put together by searching for containers of notes left behind by the previous survivors. The story is pretty interesting, but I will not go into spoilers. The bosses are HARD if youre alone. But beating them makes you feel awesome! There are downsides to ARK though.

52,75465217,english,"I've played this game for several hundred hours on Epic Games and only a little on steam and it's a nice game in some ways. Downside is that official servers have very bad lag, especially on the starting island map which is probably the most played map since it's the most newbie friendly, but there's rubber-banding every few minutes, this game has possibly the worst lag I've ever seen in a game.

It's a nice concept game, I loved the base building and taming new creatures, but terrible devs.

Devs/mods are practically non-existent and will probably take months for them to respond to any tickets that you send in. Bugs and severe lag in this game have gone on for years and wildcard just keeps creating new maps to make more money instead of fixing the major problems in the game that apparently they will NEVER fix.

Another downside is all the foreigners coming to the north american servers, such as the Chinese. The Chinese have their own servers in Asia yet they come to the NA servers anyway and it's very annoying as not only do they speak in that ""bar"" language that the game censors out, but they create even more lag for the north american players, the game really needs to be region locked as people have been saying for years but the dumb devs just won't do it. #NorthAmericanserversforNorthAmericanplayersonly!",1599281639,1599283454,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561197991777544,76,16,8031,5612,635,1602035852

- Dinosawrs (yeah)
- Some fantasy animals not even Tolkien could imagine (I am not sure if he thought the nameless should be those annoying fuc**rs as they currently are) 
- Creativity is highly encouraged
- Great friends (also in RL)



Not so good:

- The animals related grind (YOU WILL VISIT THE SWAMP WITH YOUR GIGA REGULARLY)
- The other stuff related grind (you will need a lot for everything)
- The grind for defense/wars (Same as above but in a hussle)

However, as bad as the grind is I personally belief that you will learn to be more efficient, which is a big plus in real life economy. Unfortunately, no one will hire you as you spend 16 hours a day with this game :P.

While the game has gotten more content, basically every bug that has been in the game for 5 years is still there.
-Official servers have a 15 second lag spike every 15 minutes because of save states.
-The AI is atrociously bad. If your pet is on follow and you dont have a clean line, it will get stuck.
-If you lose your pet because the AI is so bad, good luck finding them. 
-Stuck in a wall or a crevice? Have fun starving to death to get out of it. There is no unstuck or suicide button
-When building you have to press a hotkey each time you want to place something. Got 100 walls to place? You'll have to press a button for each one that you place.

As for the actual game itself, it is hands down astonishing. The graphics are very clean and crisp easy 10/10, the environment in a sense can feel alive because of so many dinosaurs and creatures about. Now the game has to offer two modes, PVE and PVP. Both modes have their perks to say the least, as for single player goes it can be a lot of fun, but as for multiplayer goes its even more fun. The bosses in this game can be very challenging and difficult, but when you get a sense of how to defeat them, they can become very easy.

56,75403140,english,"TL;DR: Not worth the time investment - you'll just leave feeling frustrated having spent tens or hundreds of hours on the game.
Game has enough dopamine inducing bits to keep you hooked, but as you level up and need to do more complex tasks you'll end up leaving feeling frustrated with the pathetic game and dinosaur logic. You spend far more than half your time trying to get back to where you were because of it. 
Things like you or your dinosaurs getting stuck walking into a tree or rock (just go around ffs), getting stuck under terrain (yup literally under the ground), or dinos fleeing as soon as you jump out of the saddle because it's still 'following' some dino back at your base. Even mods that help to restore some sort of basic functionality aren't really ideal. You can resort to using cheats to get back to where you were because of these mess ups, but it's still not the same, and you lose half the stuff that you've been collecting.
Oh, and building a base is a NIGHTMARE! Not to mention the inventory & general in-game UI.
You'll spend enough time on the game only to realise that these common problems (check the forums) give everyone gripes but have fallen on deaf ears for many years. The game costs upwards of $US50 a pop, but the developers can't be bothered to fix it. 
Looks great at first and you'll get lots of little dopamine rushes, but later on you'll just leave feeling really annoyed.",1599186250,1599186250,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561199059284131,4,1,25295,2257,13900,1601995932
57,75402796,english,"Ark is easily my favorite game I've every played. It goes so deep. The gameplay is super fun but also unfair at times. You are weak at first and dinosaurs are strong and merciless. Expect to die (you don't really lose anything when you die as long as you go and get your stuff, though your tamed dinosaurs die permanently). 

My husband and I have made so many amazing moments and memories playing this game together. He captures dinosaurs; I breed them. He hunts; I craft. And we fight all the caves and bosses together using his superior skill and my awesomely bred creatures. We've had soul-crushing upsets and exhilarating victories.

It is a punishing game and would be too difficult for someone with my (low) gameskill to play alone. If you're good at survival games or are looking for a game to play with a family member or friend, I couldn't recommend this game more!

Play style: I play PVE (players can't hurt each other) with my husband on a private server. I personally can't imagine playing on the hyper-competitive official servers. It's fun to watch Youtube videos of Ark players like Kishko but for me personally, the official servers seem depressing because you constantly get raided by other players. Our personal server is hosted on Nitrado. Nitrado's service totally stinks to set up, but works great after it's up and running. We adjusted the settings to make breeding go faster and animals eat less, but other than that we basically play vanilla Ark with the two of us in our own world.

Game Taste Background: I normally play single-player puzzle and dungeon defense games like Divide by Sheep and Dungeon Warfare. For base-building games my favorite one besides Ark has been Rimworld. For multiplayer games, I loved co-playing Minecraft and Diablo 3.

73,75395676,english,"ARK to be completely honest with you is a great promise with a lack of focus or execution. To say the game runs is a miracle in of itself. That being said for the longest time I've played ARK (Nearly 1200 hours) on steam, there's definitely something there that appeals to my brain to spend a good portion of my life on it. 
And what I will say I do love collecting creatures, you can can catch and tame creatures in different ways, some have to be snuck up on and gently offered food, others have to be knocked out with powerful tranquilizer, kept unconscious and fed in a sort of Stockholm syndrome kind of fashion till they love you. 
Which brings me to the crux of the game, ARK was designed with world scale PVP and based around community and tribal cooperation. That being said if you were to play the game on official servers, or on console, It certainly becomes a lot less dino taming; and the existential dread more so waiting for something inevitably bad to happen. Apex predators are powerful thus sometimes if your tribe actually manages to tame a Rex, it's now the 8 hour endeavor of people changing shifts, running back for more narcotics, having enough food to feed it. and the means of protecting the unconscious body as other creatures spawn around you. Not to mention if you are on a PVP server and a rival tribe rolls up and sees what you're doing. 
This doesn't have to be a problem if you play on PC, have mods or edit the multipliers, (Which you don't get to do on console) and play on an unofficial server (Also not available to console players) 
However this still stands as a glaring problem, as it is very committal and leaves no free time for other games, work, or even a shred of social life. At some point ARK will become your life or honestly you won't get anything done in it.
But oh ho! You think mods will solve everything? Another glaring complaint I have with ARK is how they even load mods at its very core. I'm not too knowledgeable on what exactly is going on, but I'll try and explain.
ARK Server has mods in a mod folder, Server starts up, server loads mods. Client-side has to have all the mods downloaded, on their download of ARK, and then to get into the server you have to load all your mods...? It makes no sense to me when if you both have the mods why does it have to load all of them again? If it's validating that everything matches up, fine. Still seems like an extremely outdated way to run things because sometimes getting into the server is literally 30-60 minuets. When I am on I do have a relatively good time, crashes are few and far between (and oh yes even vanilla with no mods you will crash.) On PC you sometimes have to re-validate your files if you're crashing a lot, that might be the one advantage of console is it is bound to be more stable; but then again maybe not. 
So why have I put nearly 1000 hours into this janky ass game? Am I insane? (More than likely) 
What you will get out of ARK in my opinion is some of the best times with friends, the endless hours looking for one rare high level dino, the prettiest one, the ugliest, or one that you have to save, the one that ate what you were taming so you tame it instead. To bond and ride these creatures in a seemingly foreign landscape of extreme biomes and creatures of a handful of wonderful maps created by the community. As you play you will find what creatures you like, don't like, to ride or use. There has been some quality of life updates (Like a rework of the kibble system) that allows you to tame what you want, rather than it being a Noah's ARK (hahahaha get it?) situation. My base will still be like that but I digress. There will be love, loss, heartbreak and occasional mourning for when you learn against a hostile world out to get you. Personally I play PVE and usually in one tribe with all my friends and occasionally randoms that join our server, my whole goal of when I play is to tame scaly nerds and breed them; but there's a whole slew of ways to play.

So would I recommend this game? Uhh, that's a really hard question to answer, to be completely honest. I would definitely look at videos, reviews, and lots of gameplay, don't buy this game blind like I did. I mean I loved it, and would have bought it anyway; but I don't have a very good conscious suggesting people to buy it. I mean I've had a lot of time with it and loved it, from my start of playing it with the lowest settings possible on my old computer, to having it on Ultra graphics on my new PC. My main concern is that someone buys it and starts searching for something they aren't going to find in ARK. It's not a shooter, (despite it being known as shootergame.exe)  it's not a monster brawler, (although it can certainly give that impression) it's a poorly optimized survival based game with tribal, sci-fi, fantasy, and gathering elements. You can Basebuild, fortify, raid, PVP, PVE, colossal fight bosses with immeasurable odds stacked against you. It does have Lore, for whatever that's worth to you. For those who don't fight end game bosses, it seems rather open-ended, needing something you must go out into the world and find, research, look up or find the right dinosaur to harvest it for you. The world can feel large at times, and incredibly small in others. Regardless it waits for you to embrace it and out in the wilds there's a new dino friend just waiting for you to find and tame...or maybe it just wants to eat you..?",1599171435,1599171435,False,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False,76561198139501587,77,2,69150,0,69150,1595504757

The idea for a game is really good, everybody likes dinos. It's a shame that it gets boring after couple of hours - actions become repetitive, building system is not advanced enough to test your creativity - all that is even worse if you played similar survival games.

Some examples of problems you can run into:
 - Dedicated server takes more than 10 minutes to start, that's more than installing and launching the whole operating system
 - Server listing when joining is broken - if you won't put any filters really fast it will load to many servers for the game to handle and crush.
 - As it is common with buggy games, no one cared about making the game run smooth and fast - no matter what hardware you have

39,75354539,english,ark is an amazing dino game for what it is. first of all it runs better than almost any dino game i have played to this day and on good graphic settings if your pc can handle it the game is truly beautiful. there is hours a upon hours of replayability with the servers being played and some being reset regularly on top of that even in solo worlds there is really just so much to do. although there is much to do in a single played world i recommend playing with a friend its more fun that way and if you dont already have people playing it getting on a server alone may be a bad time getting attacked by clans keeping all your dinos alive and saving your base is a much more difficult task alone and even in a private server having a friend to play with makes it much more fun. there are also a few free dlc that add new dinos new worlds and new items to craft and can make it a entirely new experience. i recommend this to anyone who has a friend and is a lover of dino games and even if you dont think you would play it that often i think its still worth buying on sale. and its also still worth playing if you are solo with no one else to play just be warned you may have a harder time and the game may be a bit slower paced. you can fix this however in any of the worlds you yourself create by increasing the amount of resources and exp you can receive you can also up the dino taming rate so you dont have to sit there for hours risking being attacked wile taming a dino keep in mind this is only for servers you make. same goes for spawning items you can spawn in dions and items in this game in worlds you make you just have to press tab and open the console. then use the correct gfi codes for items and the proper dion id to spawn in what creature you want. these options are good for people who dont care as much to go through the process of farming and building up what you have and just to have fun and see what all the items and dions in the game can do. i have had a lot of fun playing with my brother and i will continue to do so i hope to soon get some of the paid dlcs because the new items and dinos in them look amazing as well on top of the beautiful worlds that come with them. i over all give the game 9 out of 10 because sometimes it can be a bit buggy but its not ever anything that is game breaking or to noticeable. have fun playing the game bois,1599099129,1599099129,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198089746051,161,10,5066,0,4816,1599464458

This game is just too buggy to play fully.

Every time the server lags (every two seconds), you run the risk of losing your character, and everything you've worked for over the past days, months, or years.

Other bugs suck the joy out of the game as well, and are varied and numerous. Such as the one which currently prevents me from playing on any Official Server--regardless of what I do to fix it.

It's just too grindy to also be so fickle.

I do not recommend buying this game, unless you are just doing it for the heck of it, and want to shell out the forty bucks. However, you can often get the game for $20.00 USA, so it may be worth it just for some casual gameplay.

71,39646306,english,"I would like to start out by saying, this game is pretty amazing. It's addictive and a hell of a lot of fun for a long time. In its early access, it had a rough start but slowly got better as time went on. With as many hours that I have put into this game it was certainly worth the money. As much as I love the game and want to see it become even better I simply can't give this game a good review. 

PVP:
If you don't already know of the term ""alpha tribes"", it is a group of people that dedicate their life to this game on a daily basis to ensure that they hold the most power over every other player on the server. This can take many forms, both good and bad. Mostly I have found it to be a negative experience. At a moments notice if this faction of people stops liking you or feels they are threatened by you, or just bored, they can destroy all of your progress without lifting a finger. Every day, week, month you spent building up your base and dino collection, is all for nothing. This cycle continues to repeat itself over and over again until you have finally exhausted every last drop of your will to keep playing. 

A nice feature they added along the development journey is the ability to transfer a player character/inventory/dinos between servers. This has some convenient implementations, such as, you don't need to make a brand new character every time you switch servers. Or someone might come along and wipe out the Alpha Tribe, ushering in a new era of political reign, hooray... oh wait. To bad the new king either doesn't speak english or is more hellbent on wiping lesser tribes than the last guy. With that said, it is highly likely that at some point someone will transfer over into your server and wipe everyone out within a day. 

PVP servers boil down too, get s*** on or be the top dog. Either way you will be consuming a lot of time. 

PVE:
I finally got around to trying PVE, and thought that I have finally found a part of this game that I can play without ruining my experience. Nope... PVE servers are the equivalent of a communist utopia. Since there is no reliable way to clear our other players or dinos, servers quickly become inflated and most if not all the land in the map is claimed (at least reasonable land). To top this off, a server has a ""dino cap"". Which essentially means that the total sum of all owned dinos can only exceed a certain threshold before the server says ""no more"". New players will have no way of progressing until other players dispose of tames. All the while older players can no longer breed dinos and in short the server stagnates or dies off. Plenty of people have started forums and chats about this issue but to no relief. 

PVE in short is unplayable. 

Single Player/COOP:
Unfortunately, a lot of the charm of this game is in its community. Minus all the crap, there is fun to be had with other players whether trading, working alongside, or just general company. So playing solo or with close friends on your own server might be the way to go, but it seems more or less pointless without others IMO.


In my conclusion. Save yourself the time, money and frustration. Pick up another game instead..",1517031991,1598989004,False,2,0,0.493224918842315674,0,True,False,False,76561198121294751,151,10,45014,0,41081,1522010200

After a few minutes, it will switch the loading screen and its safe sailing from there.

All the DLC's offer brand new content that changes the way people play this game so would highly recommend investing into them.

While there are some performance issues and some bugs still in the game, the developers have been good with pushing out updates to help address these issues. In saying that, anyone with a low end computer should NOT get this game. The frustration is not worth it trust me this is coming from experience.

I think if the developers were to focus on the optimisation and bug fixes the game would be a lot more accessible to a lot of people which would increase the longevity of this game and more importantly increase the enjoyment that people would have with this game (as well as increase profits for developers of course).

83,20283024,english,"Wow. this is what? my 4th time re-writing the reveiw for this game?

I hopefully have come to a final conclusion on this game. It sucks. 

ARK: Survival Evolved is a great game, but there are certain things that I just cant look past.

Everytime I re-download ARK, it usually lasts about 60 hours before I quit and delete the game. I dont know what it is about this game but it always manages to infuriate me and any of m friends that own this game. every. single. fucking. time.

Basically what it boils down to is PVP is annoying because you reach a certain point and you get demolished by a rival tribe and all you can do is rebuild. until you get wiped again by the same tribe.

PVE is boring because once you reach a certain point, you WANT PVP. but if you had played PVP, you wouldnt reach the point where you want it.

This game is amazing depending on the server you join, but it can also be the absolute worst game you have ever bought. 

ARK was the first game I purchased on this account, I biught the game before the 60 dollar price hike, way back when the games base price was 25 dollars. I bought it during the winter sale for 15 dollars and it was a great game for that price at the time of purchase but it eventually became a toxic hellhole.

hopefully I dont re-write this again.


Edit: WOW!! I am back again with more proof that ARK: SE is utter garbage! This time I am not rewriting the whole thing for the 3rd time, Instead I am here to talk about the design falws of PVE!! Basically you think that PVE is not PVP at all, and that greifing would not be a problem? Wrong! If you have a tribe member go rogue, they can blow the whole base skyhigh. They can unclaim dinos (Depending on Tribe settings) They can destroy everything you have build over the last 50 hours of gameplay and take what is left into a new tribe, removing your access! This game is terrible, and I dont know why I keep coming back.

It is not worth anything above £20! The game has so many bugs, so many glitches, but Wildcard refuses to fix any of them. They just keep adding new maps. Regardless, the game is a lot of fun. Playing on a private server was extremely helpful to me, so i could learn everything about the game from my friends, but after a while we started playing on other public servers like MTS, to actually enjoy the game fully. 

Things to know before you get this game:
1. It is very buggy. Be prepared to log in one day and the mods have corrupted or something like that.
2. It takes quite a lot of time to actually understand the game properly. I only started to actually enjoy the game when I realised it didn't matter that my pet dodo I had for three days died to a random raptor.
3. Try to watch videos about stuff in the game, like what animals do what, what the meta is for pvp, settings etc.

That's not to say that the gameplay is not worth $50, cause it absolutely is, but considering the lack of support in certain areas I wouldn't pay that price.

Luckily it very frequently goes on sale for sub-$20, and very commonly around the $10 range. Absolute steal for that price, even with everything else considered.

Grab a couple copies, one for you and a friend or two and so long as you stay away from official PvP and default rates you will have the time of your life.

Multiplayer: Yes

ARK is a pretty decent game if you're playing with friends. It isn't the best because it has a lot of bugs, and every new update adds bugs. Also, there are pretty frequent updates that are usually around 2 GB, and the file size constantly gets bigger (the game was a little bit less than 50 GB when I first got it, but now it's 121 GB). The game requires a very good PC to run. The price was fine when it was $20, but when they took it out of beta, it went up to $60. The only reason they took it out of beta was to justify making DLC, but there are way to many bugs for this to be a full game. On top of that, the multiplayer sucks. Most public servers will have an alpha tribe, so they can do whatever they want. You're able to server transfer, which means you can take your stuff to another server, so a lot of people randomly transfer to servers and demolish people's hard work for no reason. If you stop playing for as little as ten minutes, someone can easily destroy your base. Overall, this game is not the best unless you have friends to play with, a good computer, and you get it on sale.",1518645471,1598840991,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198174700113,54,5,9026,0,9026,1598065204

every vehicle (dinosaurs) takes to many time to get to work (taming). Every server must be 5x/20x or more to overcome that poorly designed taming system. Tech tiers/and dino breed takes too many F time and there is too much power growth capacity.

pve: not recomended at all, just get some strong creature as you start the game and you can rule the island or X map
pvp: early human vs human pvp is really good, balanced and entertaining, then is just offline raiding or bully someone with -5 tiers than you

same BUGSSSS as release, they keep adding new needlessly creatures and maps, too many useless creatures, it just needs a total of 10 balanced creatures for air/earth/water for transport/attack/defense and thats all

31,75187955,english,"This is one of those games that is on my top ten list for most hours played.

Being new to the game, there is so much to explore. Different areas with different resources which allow you to build different things. Unlike other survival games, this one can be difficult to get stared and you actually feel a sense of accomplishment as you obtain different goals. Also unlike other survival games, this one is very much centered on taming and training your dinosaur army.

Dinosaurs all have different abilities and things they are good at. For instance, you train a beaver to get wood, you train an anky to get metal, you train a doedicorous to get stone, you train a rex for combat, and an arge to fly around.

You go from the stone age tech through a metal based tier, and finally to a futuristic tech teir, which requires you to kill bosses and obtain the engrams.

There are many many ways to play this game. You can play single player one map at a time, you could start your own server cluster and transfer from map to map pulling the easiest to obtain dinos and resources from each to accelerate your climb to power, you could play with a friend or two cooperativly, or you could go play PvE or PvP or both on one of the thousands of dedicated servers. 

You can customize the game to the extreme. You can crank up gathering rates, tame rates, birth rates, etc. if things are too grindy for you. Or you can flex and claim you got zero to tek on an official server with no boosted settings. You can customize your level, the dino levels, how much you eat, etc.

The game really is a unique experience and is probably responsible for many of the survival craft games that came after it.",1598821277,1598821277,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198000135239,137,36,52561,8470,31470,1602023514

4,75146236,english,"I enjoyed my time with this game, but I can't ignore all of its flaws. A lot of my fun came from joining a semi-established tribe early on and learning a lot about the game from that point on. 

The overall gameplay loop is pretty fun. Get materials. Tame creatures. Use eggs to make kibble. Train more creatures. Use those creatures to help you get more materials to both tame and upgrade your base more efficiently. It's pretty fun until the end game when all you effectively do is go on metal runs with harvester dinosaurs and min/max your tames.

This game, atleast back when I played it, is terribly optimized and full of bugs. From what I've read, this has not been fixed since the game came out of early access. You'll need a fairly beefy computer to run this game at consistent FPS on higher settings. Some of the bugs and glitches are good fun, especially when they happen in a call with friends. Others have the potential to get hours of work destroyed. 

You see the one thing this game doesn't advertise is politics. If you hope to get anywhere in this game, you gotta know how to deal with other tribes, especially the Alpha Tribe. If you do this poorly, you'll probably end up getting locked in a cage by the alpha tribe for as long as they want (essentially keeping you from playing the game). Getting everything you worked so hard on destroyed overnight by server hoppers or poor relations is also just a terrible feeling, especially when the Alpha Tribe continues to stop any effort of rebuilding forcing you to move to a different server to be able to play again.

Don't even get me started on the DLC. I mean they pushed this stuff out in early access while the main game wasn't even close to being complete. Also they introduced these super strong creatures that can be taken to different servers and used to obliterate everyone. They sort of just left a bad taste in my mouth.

I don't think I would recommend this game. If you start off with friends and just wanna have fun, it's a good time. But if you really wanna go far and tame all of those cool creatures, you have to be prepared for a long and stupid road of repetative gameplay that can easily go stale. Playing solo is almost impossible because without multiple people, there's a high chance that most of your work will be destroyed when you're offline. I wish I could give this game a neutral review, but I'm leaning more towards the negative on this one.",1598762488,1598762488,False,8,0,0.543139100074768066,0,True,False,False,76561198275710947,147,14,26477,0,26477,1505771450

For a game that's a builder it's complete sh it! If I'm forced to spend a great deal of time building structures to meet game requirements, then they had better implement excellent building tools. The building in this game is abysmal. Google the sh it. The first buildings at the beginning of the game were such a fuc king chore and never turned out properly. The stairs didn't match the building, they would fit properly and when I tried to use them I couldn't get up the stairs without crawling. The roof wouldn't go on. No, that's not entirely true; the roof was able to go on the side of the building, not the top. I thought roofs went on top of buildings. It was just one giant clusterfu ck.

40,75134967,english,"So after playing a couple dozen hours in this game I have uninstalled it.  There are serious fundamental problems with this game.  
- Balance: the imbalance issues in this game are so drastic that you need to adjust the integrated environment sliders just to be able to see serious long-term development of your character.  You can play hours harvesting resources, refining metals, leveling up to unlock new patterns, going on long expeditions to get rare materials, build yourself high-end equipment and weapons and still die in under 10 seconds because some raptor with a bug up it's ___ decides you look like a snack.  That's not fun, that's just pure and utter frustration

- Graphic/Engine: the graphics in the game, even in ultra-high settings, are pretty dated.  That in and of itself is not a significant issue, there are plenty of great games with lower end graphic detail, but what is most terrible about this game, and quite impactful to gameplay are the creature models and clipping.  Imagine a giant murder-chicken ripping you apart and you shooting for your life in the 10-20 seconds you have before you die, only to realize that the thing's hit-box doesn't render correctly and you're ""hitting"" it but not ""hitting"" it.  

- Game Progression: Quite honestly the progression system in this game is one of the worst i've seen in any type of game recently.  You level up to unlock new ""engrams"" which are basically crafting patterns. You can spend points you get each level to also increase stats such as max hp, max stamina, etc.  However most of the stats you put points into affect multiple things of which no tool-tips key you into.  I hope you like wiki-searching because without it you have no hope of advancing in this game as there's no in-game knowledge system or hints for where to find super rare resources or how to tame anything properly. 

Uniqueness: the game's theme for taming dinosaurs is great and very unique, but when it actually comes to taming them the mechanics behind them are HORRIBLE. Like...imagine creeping up on a Rex, shooting a tranq-dart and then running away until you're out of stamina.  Now imagine having to do that 50-80 times.  You're talking literally hours of solid game-play to subdue a single pet. Oh and if he catches you, you're dead, not a chance at death, you're just dead. And not just that, but now the armor/weapons/gear you made, which took DAYS of playtime to get are now sitting in his pathing area and he will keep killing you even if you manage to make it back to your body (of which there's no beacon or marker on a map where there's not even a 'you are here' symbol).  

Ultimately I gave this game a lot of slack because it fits a lot of niches that i really like.  Exploration, resource gathering, base building, hunting/survival, but in the end it is just so frustrating i can't tolerate it.  After dying about 2 dozen times trying to get the equipment I spent days acquiring, all with game settings tweaked just to make it more enjoyable and less of a grind I just had enough of it and uninstalled it. It's not fun. Fun is challenge, not being slaughtered without a chance. 

Screw this game. It has a lot of potential but only if you ""cheat"" by setting the game mode to such a level as to make it virtually impossible to lose.",1598742440,1598742440,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198047472216,100,5,4206,0,1340,1600445904

My final stopping point was the leveling system. I understand leveling up creatures to make them stronger, and leveling yourself up to get higher survivability, but why on Earth do you need to level up to craft certain things? Especially when leveling a survivor takes so long? Not to mention the most common taming method of knocking out a creature then feeding it meat for 30 minutes. Quality content! You know what I find even better though? Raising an egg in real time! The animal really matures with me. You know the saying they grow up so fast? This doesn't apply in Ark. Not to mention the constant graphical glitches, creatures getting stuck in each other, character files getting deleted, poor optimization, and just incompetent developers. Not to mention the K no collision which is just basically vanilla wallhacks. Don't even get me started with spawning right next to predators like terror birds, raptors, etc. This game has so many issues that I'm debating which ones to mention just to keep this a little bit short.

47,25650301,english,"Starting off, this is a game that has issues. No game is perfect, and I think that perfection is an unrealistic standard to hold anything to. Hit registration could use some work, many maps have spots where the visible model doesn't match up with where your character collides with the terrain, creature pathfinding is atrocious, and many glitches/exploits have existed in the game for a long time that do require addressing. But, I still enjoy the game. 

For the first 1200 hours that I logged in the game I didn't beat a single map, I didn't fight a single boss, I didn't even complete a cave. I just explored, tamed creatures, and built amazing structures. The basic mechanics of the game were enough for me to log 1200 hours and enjoy almost all of them. Over the years the addition of more official maps/creatures, as well as some amazing maps/creatures from the modding community have kept the game alive for me. even without exploring any of the endgame/story content.

After logging my 1201st hour I decided to attempt to complete the first map that was added to the game, the island. I recruited a few friends to play with and I rented a multiplayer server from a third party hosting company. Beating the island is a grueling task. 10 caves, 3 guardians, and the final ascension boss/cave combo at the top of the volcano are extremely difficult. I spent another couple months, and 500 hours completing this task. This single map that comes with the base game had enough content to keep me and a friend engaged for months. It had its ups and downs, we got bored at some stages, and sometimes you can feel like there isn't anything that you can do to progress, but if you look for it, then it is there. If you are looking for a long term, grindy, but rewarding survival experience then the base game could be for you. (Screenshots from this run are on my profile)

Moving on to the DLC's. (I have not beaten each of these completely, these are my scattered thoughts from the time that I have spent on them)

Scorched earth came out very early on in ark's development, and I think that it could use some love from the devs. It didn't receive an ascension cut scene similar to all of the other paid DLC, and it seems to lack some of the unique content that is present in them as well. Overall I enjoyed the experience still. The content that they did add is a fresh and interesting change of pace from the island, and the addition of the egg stealing mechanic can not be overlooked. The caves on this map are fantastic, I love the adventurous feel that they all have.  The new weapons and structures all look great as well. Sometimes the weather effects feel like a bit much, it would have been nice for end game engrams to be available that help you combat them, rather than them just stopping gameplay for a few mins. Overall I think that Scorched is worth it, as long as you enjoyed the base game already, though it would have been nice for an ending to have been added to the progression.

Aberration. Overall this may be my favorite DLC. The subterranean vibe is impeccable, and once again coming from the flyer heavy previous maps I think that their removal was a perfect way to distinguish gameplay on this map from others. The creatures DLC exclusive creatures on this map are so much fun. The ravager is a fantastic earlygame mount. With its ability to climb ziplines and vines it is almost essential for new players to travel the map with. The rockdrake is difficult to obtain, but completely worth it. The gliding and climbing mechanics are fairly intuitive and fun to use. The reaper has a unique ""taming"" method that separates it from all other creatures in the game. I never tamed the big crab, but it looks sick, and is a fantastic way of farming up polymer. On top of this the new items added by the DLC make map traversal easier, and more enjoyable on foot for any map. They are almost essential for anyone playing on a no tames server. This section is getting rather long, so lets just say that I recommend this DLC.

Extinction was a mixed bag for me. I like the new creatures, mechanics, map, and items, but the progression feels a bit skewed. I understand that this is intended to be the ultimate challenge for large tribes to complete. It is difficult, and the rewards for tasks are immense. But as a mostly solo player some of the tasks feel a bit too impossible. It is doable, if you put in the time. People have soloed this DLC. Maybe it just isn't for me.

As I am writing this review I haven't spent a ton of time in the Genesis Part One DLC, but what I have seen I have greatly appreciated. The addition of missions as a means of progressions breaks up some of the monotony of the core gameplay loops. As well as the taming methods for all of the new creatures. It feels like the devs really went out of their way to spice the game up, and provide the player with much more to do. The Biomes are beautiful. and the new tools, tekgrams, and structures are a ton of fun to mess around with. I am looking forward to attempting this DLC legit, and completing it as well.


Overall my advice would be don't buy the entire package right away. Start with the base game and free DLC maps. Play around with it. have fun. see what works best for you and see which aspects of the game you enjoy most. If you dont really care about the story of the game, but you enjoy exploring, taming new creatures, and building bases, then get scorched. If story, and lore, and progression are the most important aspects of the game to you then purchase the DLC's that cater to that. Aberration, Extinction, and Genesis (One at a time, don't necessarily purchase them all at once. That is a lot of content and you might burn out before then). If the core gameplay loop gets too repetitive, and you want to try playing some brand new concepts in the ARK framework then go straight for Genesis. The sheer amount of content that is available in this game is fairly staggering. There is something in there for almost every type of player.

I short, I like the game, I am happy with the money I have spent on it, and I am happy with the time that I have invested in it. Maybe I will come back with more as I continue to play through the DLC's with the goal of total completion of the game.",1474637001,1598736968,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198162477339,66,2,108299,486,105131,1601767329

This underrated game, wins the award for the best worst game ever. I personally think this game is an outrageous piece of carefully developed art. My reasons are because between all the adorable dinosaur taming and the constructing of a beautiful palace to call home, with resources you have ventured in the deep and dangerous forests for, comes the constant dying and and getting obliterated by a horde of raptors. Or when you set adventure for mountains on your amazing dinosaur,  there is a  f**king alpha raptor charging at you (which you give up on life afterwards). Other than that the graphics (although you need a powerful video card) and the overall relatively accurate physics of the game is a masterpiece. 9.9/10.

84,30030522,english,"The game can be fun when it is heavily modded, though vanilla is trash due to the utterly insane balancing and the numerous troll mechanics like stunlocks on every second creature or swarms of creature that steal your stuff and eat it. They really put in a lot of effort in these unfair mechanics.
Mods are needed to make this enjoyable or at least ini tweaks so you can remove the most infuriating creatures like Ichtyornis and Pegomastax. 

The devs are truly pure scum, not only did they screw over the former company they were working on (google lawsuit wildcard), they also do not fix years old gamebraking bugs for the singleplayer mode and this game has lots of bugs like resources not respawning, certain artefact which are needed not spawning at all or half of the explorer notes that tell the story and give an exp buff don´t work and yield nothing at all and much much more. It´s truly a bugfest.

They just completely neglect the sp mode and they also ignore the steamcommunity, bugreports, suggestions ect. 

And aside from that they also do not fix bugs like creatures noclipping in and out of solid rockwalls in caves, which is the most annoying thing ever. You enter a cavern, it looks empty and boom several sharks, electric eels, mosas, squids,shocking jellyfish and what not come right out of the wall itself! Imagine this..

I could forgive them if this were still in ea but this game is released since years now and they simply ignore this glaring issues. 

The next issue is the overall balance, it is is incredibly stupid and nonsensical. There is no logic behind it, it´s jsut supposed to be hard, which it is, but it just makes no sense at all. There too many apects of the game which are outragous due to the insane and stupid balancing to list here, so I won´t do that.

I can´t recommend this game anymore. These devs don´t deserve to be supported.

I really like this game. But people are NOT kidding about how horrible this game's state is in.

Pros:
- 3D Minecraft with dinosaurs
- Gorgeous landscapes 
- Endless discoveries to be made
- Progression is very satisfying
- Single Player is fantastic for new players

Cons: (How tempted i am to say everything else...)
- Rancid player community
- Enough bugs to make Bethesda jealous
- Really shoddy performance sometimes
- Constant and incessant updating with no real improvements

Oh and this game is what, 5 years old? It's STILL on early access and has uh...hold on. Abberation...Scorched earth...Genesis...Genesis part 2...Extinction...That's 60 USD for all three DLC...and another 70USD for Genesis DLCs?

This game was infamous for releasing an expansion before finishing the motherehffing game and now they have FIVE WHOLE DLC EXPANSIONS and this game is STILL a buggy mess. Seriously. Skyrim on crack this one is.

Like...I must have gone thru hell and back to get me a super sweet monstrous Reaper Tame...and he was so busted I could solo one of the island bosses with him when i brought him over. I was having a gay ol time. Until the game decided to thanos snap him to oblivion while i was offline. This is single player btw so it's not like anyone was pulling a fast one on me. I log on and he's simply gone. use a mod to track my dinos, everything but him is accounted for. he doesn't even exist. I've seen so many people complain about this frankly game breaking issue and people who  play on official servers are just straight up fhhucked. 
I put in all that time and effort and my reward for paying all that money and spending 300hrs on ark and it's DLC is a good ol simpsons style F-You and ""HA~HA~""?

Triggered? Yeah. I am. Are you saying you wouldn't be? Well I guess that's fair. Most ppl nowadays have been trained to have no attachment to their money or what they blow it on so they'd probably be content with buying a literal bag of burning turds if a game dev told them it was gonna get good eventually.

I have no idea what the developers were thinking, but after 5 years, this game has no bloody excuse for being in such a sloppy state.

Finish your game, get your ass outta early access, THEN shyyt out DLC like hotcakes. That's the order it should be done...and even if the developer has a skele crew...ALL THE MORE REASON TO SIDELINE THE DLC D:< 

All that aside...I played 300hrs for a reason. The game is good...when it's not busy collapsing in on itself...and I was ready to edit my review in a positive light with how much fun abberation was after recently trying it, but...no...this is the straw that broke my back.

Buy it on sale if you must...otherwise buy it ONLY if you have a friend or two who will actively play with you and you can buy a private server.

We ended up getting the complete edition this weekend due to the sale. You can do whatever you would like. Build, Farm, Explore, Fight, Breed and Tame dinos! There are so many different types of dinos across each map and we have only played the Island and Crystal Isles. Land dinos, flyers and water.  You can go exploring in caves, it has multiple biomes in each map, hands down think this game is great. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking looking for a solid survival type game.

69,29412160,english,"If you play Ark the way the developers made the vanilla experience, you will think it's one of the worst games to ever exist. And you would be right too.

The vanilla experience is beyond ""no life"", it's literally trading your real self for your Ark self. The amount of ""time based"" tasks is insane. 6 hours to tame something? Who the fuck is over the age of 25 and has 6 hours to do that on a REGULAR BASIS? If I played vanilla I would have tamed appx 2-3 big dinos PER MONTH... which is insane. You can beat The Outer Worlds in less time than it takes to tame a big dino that's max level.

Just everything about the vanilla game is blocked behind ridiculously unnecessary time blocks. It just takes so long to do absolutely anything. In order to have a functioning real life, and play this game, you need to find a dedicated server or just start your own for you to play co-op on with tame rates x10 ,harvest rates x5, and then a mod to adjust weight/stacks.

If you are planning to buy this game for PvP don't bother at all:

The audio is miserably bad, like I'm talking someone can C4 your base from 10 feet away and you wont hear a thing. Most servers have one tribe who rules the entire server and makes it impossible for anyone else to play on it. You probably think, ""oh I'll just join another server"" but yeah no they are there too, the game allows you to transfer things between servers so alpha tribes can come on to a new server, and begin steamrolling just like they would on their main server. You can have months worth of content all wiped in a few seconds by an unstoppable zerg. Think you have enough friends to fight them off? Don't bother, the servers have hard set limits to 70 players, which means some of these zergs will consume 90% of the population pool, even if you wanted your friends to come help you, they can't. It's not like Rust with 300-400 player servers. 

People say ""the community is toxic"" but they aren't. They are just playing the game the way Wildcard provided, and Wildcard provided one of the absolute worst PvP experiences to ever exist. I don't blame the large clans because Wildcard has given these large clans the tools and ability to make servers unplayable. Until this game can implement 3D audio, and a  way to have PvP without players losing months/years of work, (ORP is not the solution when alpha tribes will just build a wall around the area your ORP protects) the PvP will continue to be the worst in survival games.

""bro, ur review is positive, all you've done is talk smack""

Because regardless of Wildcard being incompetent to PvP experiences, they have built a game that is incredibly vast and can provide thousands of hours of fun in co-op. They have provided you with the ability to run your own custom game with the click of a button, with sliders that can affect every game setting down to how often you poop. You can literally build YOUR OWN PERSONAL Ark experience. And I respect the hell out of WC for implementing such a feature. I complain about vanilla but realistically I've only spent maybe ~100 hours on official servers. The rest of my time has been enjoyed either on single player or in private servers. There is so much to do in Ark and there is so much to discover. I couldn't even begin to tell the stories I've had with this game. And considering how ambitious this game is, I also give them props on it actually running..

Overall: Buy it to play with your friends, buy it to play single player. Adjust game settings so that the time walls are more reasonable, and get a stacks mod to avoid spending 12 hours farming. The competitive multiplayer is beyond bad it's a joke and isn't worth anyone's game time. Wildcard dev team has obviously never played a real PvP game in their lives.",1485051906,1598628456,True,1,0,0.525862038135528564,0,True,False,False,76561198018745755,338,50,82438,0,79362,1600136125

The breeding mechanics are also in dire need of revamping considering new players need to be given dinos by existing tribes to have a chance of competing against the ones that have been mutating their lines for years now.

18,16458932,english,"Many promises were made.  Many were never delivered yet...this has matured into the archetype of the genre. 

Personally, due to the decay system, I would not play it on anything but a private server. This became the curse of survival games and why they died a death after this. 

But on a private server, it really is a beautiful game. Ii there was one thing that could have saved it in general,  it would be a better claim and decay system.  Just like every game of this type.  

You survive, gather your food and water, build a massive variety of structures (Ark really really excels at this ( WITH MODS, IT IS HALF THE GAME ALONE), especially with mods which make the vanilla suck a lot less), create your clothes/armour, adapt and hunt in a prehistoric island type environment.  You can tame and use the local wildlife which also levels.   You can craft a wide range of objects and buildings etc from scratch.  The crafting system is very good. As is the construction though to really fly, you can mod it to avoid annoying snap to limitations and add lots of variety to an already feature rich construction environment. 

I think it would be fair to say that this game created a genre. It is up to developers where it goes from here. Conan and DnL were not a patch on it because they were part of Steam Early Access. Which is the graveyard of good ideas.

The thing which is hard to convey is the depth within this game. It has depth in all of the key areas. You feel like this is the game you wanted when you read the intro rather than you got cheated by someone marketing  features just like ticks on a list then not bothering to deliver anything meaningful.   Building alone accounts for the vast majority of my time in the game. So much variety and detail.  Particularly on a modded self run server. 

On official servers, it is nauseatingly grinding and the thing you grind so hard for (especially when it comes to taming), just isn't worth it.  There is literally no reason to buy it to play on official servers. It is terrible.

So, a classic game and an archetype of its genre. If you like building, survival and base building. It is the best in its class.  But play it on a non official server as they destroy it.

But the mods are really making this great.  The vanilla experience is dull and banal, but the moddability seems to really bring it to life.  Many great mods to liven things up and add some depth and keep you playing.  Being that the environment is very beautiful, this works very well indeed. A great pity that the moddable nature of the product did not go much further.

Having said that, a lot of people I like and I would most like to play with absolutely hate this game. The grindingly idiotic gameplay puts most people off in official mode.  You would have to be out of your mind to play on a normal server.  They basically did not help themselves when it came to making the game fun and even a little bit reasonable. 

The sheer computer power required to run it in any mode that looks nice can be a thing for some.

BUT - Make your own server and pay very very careful to your configuration and it can be both challenging and enjoyable without sucking like hell.  The addition of many many mods to add some much needed depth really can bring it to life. It can have an economy, trading system, and a much more alive eco system that the blandness of the vanilla experience.",1434501634,1598568223,True,0,0,0.507042229175567627,0,True,False,False,76561197982877381,389,129,80918,0,51127,1599938419

Basically; if you're into survival games in which you need to forcefully enslave prehistoric creatures to aid you in surviving, congrats!
Ark has: Gameplay - You play as a dropped specimen with prehistoric creatures. Build, Tame, Survive. You really only can play so much until you burn yourself out since its repetitive. HOWEVER the community's side of modding is a chefs kiss. Bringing new challenges (or changes) to vanilla ark. 
STORY - Not many players pay attention to the story behind ark and the past survivors who studied the entire life of the Island since its not shoved in your face like any other game, to find the lore and the story you must find explorer notes. They're scattered all across every single map. Goodluck. Took me till this month.
OF Servers - Both ranging PVP and PVE. 
DLC - SE to Genesis, man youre expensive. worth it.
B.U.G.S - Sometimes this game isn't bad, what makes a bad gameplay is the bugs. I cannot express myself anymore. I am sick of falling through the world because some overgrown lizard chomped my body into oblivion. 
HOWEVER, you NEED a beefy PC! For some ungodly reason ARK eats more than my ex, taking a whooping 150GBS and chomps on my RAM. save some space for the little guys :(

- tamed dinos disappear, 5 year issue still not resolved.
- abysmal building system, but they do what all devs do and wait for someone to mod it properly because they are too lazy to do it right the first time. 5 year issue.
-dinos horrible pathing.  some how an Alpha Rex can appear out of thin air but but a tamed raptor can't path around a rock on a beach.  If you have any dinos following you, you have to turn around every few seconds to make sure they are still there. 5 year issue.
- there's no way to effectively exclude dinos if that's what you want, any .ini file settings that are out there don't work.
- had to change the auto-save timer from 15 minutes to 5 minutes due to instability of tamed dinos.
- having to constantly leave the game to research things because the game does a piss poor job informing you of anything.  If you do figure something out like a recipe, you still have to pause out of the game to remember how it is done.  Once a recipe is discovered and figured out it should always be available  so I don't have to reference outside of the game.

Never have I spent more time outside of a game, researching how to do things in the game, than this. 10-20% of my playtime is spent in wikis or forums trying to understand how things work.  The devs dont fix issues but manage to keep putting out content.

97,74958483,english,"This game will sadly never be good.
It is such an amazing concept, but Wildcard's questionable decision-making has doomed this game.

The downfall of this game originally stems back to the implementation of cross-transfers between servers back in the scorched earth days, which caused an influx of alpha tribes obliterating server after server. People tried blocking the obelisks and supply drops, and eventually it calmed down slightly. 

Since then the game has never been the same, with map-exclusive dinos (particularly extinction dinos) being transferred everywhere and wiping base after base, with no way for small tribes to even exist, even on small-tribes servers.

There is simply no way to survive anymore on official, as your base will be found and destroyed before you can make any substantial progress.

Even the best defences, (heavy turrets, doubled walls, vaulted walls, etc.) won't last a minute due to massively overpowered dinos like the gasbag, MEK, managarmr etc.

Meshing is still a problem, and allying mega tribes on small tribe servers (where allying is NOT ALLOWED) still exists to this day.

The servers are a complete joke. The never-ending lag is just ridiculous, and servers will go down for hours at a time, with no explanation (or even recognition) from Wildcard, causing people to lose dinos, items, characters and hard work.

Single-player is boring as multiplayer is how this game is designed to be played, and unofficial servers run the risk of being randomly shut down if the owner decides to stop paying hosting fees. Also unofficial servers also commonly have admins that give themselves an unfair advantage over everyone else, making progress impossible once again.

The game still has bugs from when I started playing ARK on Xbox One in 2016, and due to the amount of content that has been added / changed, the game hasn't become any more bug free than what it was back then.

The performance of the game has only improved very slightly since the beginning, and it still runs awfully, even on high end GPU's and CPU's.

No matter how much content they add, and even if they remove map-exclusive dino transfers between maps, fix bugs and improve performance, I don't think this game will ever recover from WIldcard's past and present decision-making, leading this game into obscurity, where the only ones left playing are allied mega tribes with no-one left to raid.",1598471911,1598472099,False,2,0,0.524081647396087646,0,True,False,False,76561198883073139,12,1,13922,0,13922,1598377812

84,69668284,english,"I've reviewed this game before but I've played about 300 more hours since then. So, here's an honest to god review. 
1) This is, hands down, the MOST frustrating game I have EVER played. I have played a LOT of games so that says a lot. 
2) **HOWEVER** (with the right people!) hosting your own server (SUPER EASY!) for JUST your friends (SERIOUSLY, REALLY EASY) is VERY fun. 
3) Some of these maps are absolutely stunning. The next closest thing I've seen to gorgeous scenery is maybe Skyrim V. (Skyrim V tops ARK though). 
4) You have to INDIVIDUALLY buy ALL the DLCS unless you buy a SEASON PASS! This is VERY VERY annoying! I personally have not played Genesis so I can't speak to how interesting it is, but I have all the other ones which ARE fun. SEASON PASSES are also very helpful when they're on sale! 
5) Overall the game runs alright. I run ARK on a low graphic low ram $750 crapola computer and it does OK. Don't get me wrong, I'm not going to be competing in any gaming comps with it, but it does alright.
6) What other users with negative reviews have said is true - some of the bugs from eons ago have not been fixed. The tek car is kind wack... mine made it's way into the ocean. It's also virtually indestructible. They nerfed birds and mounts - but the single player game is very customizable to what you want your player experience to be like. 
7) This game updates ALL THE TIME and they take FOREVER if you have slow internet! Mine is updating as I write. Keep that in mind before you buy. 
8) Last thing - the game is very addicting. No, I'm serious. VERY. If you like dinosaurs, and I mean like even slightly, you're going to ignore the faults of the game, pay the $30 or $60 and play this stupid game and love it and its glitchy wibbly wobbly dino stuff. 

So that's my two cents. 8/10 for the game overall. 9/10 for the story line. 7/10 for the bug fixes. Good luck.",1590243806,1598391375,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198352225932,18,2,46757,2287,41002,1602015833

Would still recommend this game BUT The Tech Gear has changed alot of the game play for servers and its also lost alot for me as I liked the survival feel of being a lesser predetor of the island and working my way to a small steady base. every time i got to metal and auto guns I found the game boring . I have done the caves and such. if the Primitive plus side of game didnt take 10 odd minutes to load would maybe go at that again. but for now im done on the game .

Edit**
If you like this kind of game with OP end gear and syfy. I wanted the primititive stuff but it was not supported in the end and wrecked sadly. they are not listening to the community, also some of the dinos they have put in have made it stupid for anyone who likes either single player or solo as they knock you out and you cant catch them as they are small and annoying. this game was fun and new but now its full of crap and scifi gear.

Edit***
Would I recommend . Yes in sale you will easily get your monies worth. they still have not fixed the primitive. but have continued down the road of tek and some new maps. alot of the stuff is getting OP for users and makes a chunk of challenge go from older DLC's so to get good progression try to play in order or close too.",1441995788,1598387839,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198007228143,171,19,154203,1554,98947,1601976729

PvP is just straight garbage with the sheer number of exploits players are able to use some that have been there since the games luanch and the fact that you could have a thatch house and a member of a alpha tribe will eat it with thier giga and shoot u on sight even when ur naked and just spawned into the game. theres also the fact that the Anti Cheat is god awfull and there are several players using aim bot and wall hacks.
Also it takes several months for someone to review  a support ticket so even if some neanderthaw decides to to pillar around your house it would take for ever for someone to review the problem and even then there not giong to do anything about it.

still PvP is a heaping pile of trash when players do nothing but exploit glitches. PvE is ok on rented servers becuase most admins do what the Devs and Suppoprt wont do and limit players from bieng toxic try hards on a god damn pve server.
Single players is trash becuase your ethier playing alone or lagging with freinds and when you game crashes on single player you loose about 20m of progress not much but still annoying also the host tether that forces other players to stay close to you which they removed the ability to increase its range becuase players would max it out so everyone could do thier own thing but they removed the setting to try and force people onto servers becuase they know how trash thier servers are but thier paying for them so they want them used. im giving this game a thumbs down simply becuase this game could be so much better. i play on my private server with my freinds its much more fun and i recommend the same for you if you play",1598331032,1598331032,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198987393801,17,2,37430,0,37420,1599807975

62,49401084,english,"While the game is buggy, and will melt your computer if you don't have something extremely powerful, it is a very fun survival game, albeit very frustrating and slow sometimes. I admit, I use mods, cheats, and increased rates to make it better, default rates are painfully slow, so if you don't want to waste 2 days taming a t-rex, increase your rates. The building is also a bit wonky, you may be trying to make your roof tilt up, but instead, it'll either tilt down for no reason and blip around unless you add sloped walls to force it to point up, or you accidentally demolish a wall with the wall you were trying to place because you nudged your mouse and pointed down instead of on top. Try not to build too fast to avoid making mistakes like this, but at least there's a 30 second window to pick up misplaced structures. The game also revolves around the unique Tek tier of buildings and weapons which you earn from the 3 bosses in the late game, more DLCs add more ""Tekgrams"" later on. As for the DLCs and Maps:

The Island
The most ""polished"" map, per se, it has the largest amount of available creatures, and is the closest to a true dinosaur survival game with limited fantasy aspects. It has a variety of biomes to build in and harvest from, but as a trend for most of ARK's maps, it lacks in truly flat ground to build on, and is very hilly in some areas. Nevertheless, the variety of creatures to tame, places to build in, and the most amount of water overall than any other map makes it one of the easier ones to play in.

Scorched Earth
My favorite map and favorite mechanics, but compared to the other DLCs, it is the most simple, mostly because it's the first DLC and was released during early access, and is less ambitious than the other 3 DLCs. However, it is still one of the best. It includes a lot of unique creatures, more than quite a few other maps, and new mechanics, such as wind speed for energy generating turbines, a creature that detects the weather for you so you won't be caught in the middle of a sandstorm or heatwave, a brand new structure that can defend you against the harsh sunlight, and new weapons such as flame arrows, flamethrowers, and the boomerang. Overall, I usually play Scorched Earth the most, and will pick it over The Island any day.

Aberration
My second favorite map and second favorite mechanics, it is one of the most stark changes with other maps, compared to the ones that came before it. It includes a smaller amount of creatures, but more unique abilities for each creature as a result, it also includes more unique systems, such as sunlight damage in the fertile and ""safest"" area of the map, the Nameless that will attack you if you venture too far into the Bioluminescent and Element biomes, and the unique Surface biome that can only be explored at night. It introduces new weapons and tools such as the climbing picks, ziplines, and the new Tek Railgun, which can shoot through walls. Overall, a very decent DLC and map with very unique changes than other maps that come along in the future, and one of the more challenging experiences.

Extinction
While a lot smaller in scale than the other two, it has my favorite atmosphere, and a very beautiful map in that dystopian sort of way. It has the least amount of new creatures so far, and a smaller variety of weapons and tools, but the map itself is quite enjoyable, in my opinion. It is split into Sanctuary, the safest biome in the map, the Desert and Tundra domes, and the Sunken Forest, all 3 reflecting more typical ARK biomes, and the only places you will find non-corrupted creatures, as the Wasteland is plagued with creatures corrupted by Element. It is not recommended to build anywhere in the Wasteland, as the corrupted creatures can destroy any building, including Tek structures You can also legitimately tame the 3 bosses it offers known as Titans, a completely unique feature than any other map. Overall, it's one of the more dangerous maps, like Aberration, but is more meant to be played with a max level character you have transferred from other maps, starting a new character in Extinction is clear that it is not the intended idea.

Genesis Pt. 1
The only DLC I haven't bought, and from what I've seen, the least like a survival game. It is more akin to an MMO, per se, and has a tiny selection of new creatures, and flying or flying creatures are strictly banned from its map, which forces you to use the new Bloodstalker or Astrocetus to fly in any way shape or form, or the new Tek Hovercraft. It is also extremely buggy, having cases such as rubberbanding, jittery gameplay, and overall it isn't very polished as of yet. You also have a new system, Hexagons and the store, which lets you buy materials with Hexagons, completely disregarding the survival aspect. Since it also costs $34.99 in US dollars for a single map, it is not a very good deal. It also seems like Pt. 2 will be it's own season pass as well? Overall, it's not very worth it, unless you really adore the map and its mechanics or want to learn more about the game's lore yourself.

Free DLC maps
These are technically fan mods that have been elevated as mini DLCs due to their popularity. In my opinion, they are all great, and each has 1 unique creature, except The Center, and a lot of unique bosses.

The Center: Includes no unique creatures, but includes a boss arena with all 3 of the Island's bosses in a single arena.

Ragnarok: Includes the Griffin, Ice Wyverns, Iceworm Queen [boss], and Lava Elemental [boss]

Valguero: Includes the Deinonychus, Chalk Golem, and Ice Golem.

Crystal Isles: Includes the Crystal Wyverns [Tropical, Blood, and Ember], Tropegnathus, and the Blood Wyvern Queen [boss]

ARK: Survival Evolved is far from a polished and perfect experience, but when it gets down to it, it is one of the better survival games, and the DLCs may be expensive, but for the full package and some of the more enjoyable maps, it is worth it to an extent. I hope this helped give a brief description of all the DLCs and the main game itself, even if I left out some details.",1551903766,1598307805,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198066027350,80,4,63223,71,61609,1601593162

78,66906574,english,"I awoke to find myself being stalked by a T-Rex...  Nothing but the clothes on my back, I ran for my life.  Everywhere I turned, I found massive beasts, some just lumbering along, ignoring me, and some looking to eat me for lunch.  Two Carnotaurus' chased me, fortunately, they are not too bright, and I ran around a really big rock, and they seemed to have lost my scent.  I ran, a lot!  Stayed alive for a while.  Made a small box, put some  things I thought I'd need for later.  It got dark.  I huddled in fear.  This was my first day.  Not a great day, but I lived!!

Days later, I found a friend...of a friend.  Friends are almost a necessity, if you want to survive...  I'd like to say I didn't die much before that, but I'd be lying.  Something jumped out of the ground and ate me, before I could run away.   A Carnotaurus that was a little smarter than the others chased me down, and ate me...

My friend took me in, kept me warm, killed stuff that wanted to eat me...again!  I built my own base, tamed a few dinos, and was on my way to actually living for a few days!!

That was about 6 months ago...  I run up to Rexes now, and laughingly cut them to ribbons with an awesome sword I found in a drop pod around Christmas, while they Roar.  They usually don't get to finish!  I've built quite a nice base, leveled up beyond my wildest dreams, and the only thing I still fear is a random Giganotosaur, though the three Auto Turrets on my roof, and my 6 or 7 tamed Rexes could probably kill one...

This is my favorite game, currently!  Yes, I have to log in every few days to feed my gaggle of awesome Tamed Dinosaurs, no matter what.  Yes, it can be time consuming to do things early on, it is a tad bit grindy.  Having a Tribe with friends is VERY helpful.

I am a big fan of survival-style games, and this is superb!  I'm currently playing on the Valguero map, but I've also played a few others, and love the size, variation of terrain and dinos, and practically endless gameplay challenges.  If they have the opportunity to try it, take that opportunity!  If you like it a little, I'm rather confident you'll like it A LOT!!!  I know I sure do!  And if you see me riding Freddie around Valguero (yes, my Therizinosaur, she's my favorite dino), say hi, I'll keep you alive...unless you're being chased by a Giga, then I'm out, and you're lunch!!

Edit: After more than a year of playing on the same server, this is still an awesome game, but for one little thing...  If you have a life outside of gaming, DO NOT PLAY ON OFFICIAL SERVERS!  50+ Dinos, including my beloved Freddie, mentioned above, have been DELETED by the official server because none of my three tribe members logged in within 7 days...8 days, and you lose.  If you've ever lost a pet, imagine playing a game with about 50 of them, only to have the game developers kick you in the groin and kill all of your pets in one unnecessary swipe.  Not because they starved to death, not because they were killed by a ferocious opponent, but because your life sucked for 7 days, and you couldn't find the time to log in to their game.  More than a year of work gone.  More than 50 of my virtual friends gone, instantly, and without a hope of recovery.  If I wanted this sort of experience, I'd spend more time in life, rather than in a game that's supposed to be fun...  I'm still recommending this game, as I've loved it, and the dinos I've come to know.

99,74821929,english,"as someone that has always wanted to play this game since it's alpha, it's very disappointing to find out that this game is as bare bones as it can get, and is reminiscent of horrible and unfair minecraft mods that spam overpowered enemies everywhere that you cannot avoid. there's literally hostile dinosaurs everywhere you look in this game and it honestly looks so corny to see them as often and in the abundance that you do. i ended up just treating it as a running gag and laughing anytime i turn around and see the 50th t-rex of the day charging at me to eat me.

i can't count the number of times i've been spawnkilled by dinosaurs that i thought were going to be super rare (tyrannosaurus, spinosaurus, sarcosuchus, etc.) in the early days of the game. i've once saw 3 spinosaurus crowded around each other at the same time. you can hardly ever get to your stuff without being killed once or twice along the way. sometimes the game doesn't even give you a marker where you died and you end up wanting to pull your hair out because you need to start over what is an incredibly tedious and delicate process. even after you manage to build a small base and a campfire to cook food like i did, you'll be disappointed to find out you can't build a permanent spawn point until level 7, and even when you unlock it, it takes a ton of hide to make, meaning you need to search for the 2-3 tiny harmless animals to kill over and over that are for some reason more rare than giant hostile dinosaurs for the hide you need, not to mention the other 4 materials you need a lot of...just to make a permanent spawn point at your base that you can respawn at over and over again when you die over and over again.

it's just not worth it to me. the game lost all it's glamor for me when i realized that nothing i ever discover in this game will ever be any cool because everything spawns everywhere, and leveling up again and again just to put up a fight against the weakest of enemies, let alone the giant ones that constantly attack you, just isn't worth the time or effort when there really isn't any reason to try. the game expends all of it's content too quickly, and in a poor fashion.",1598252483,1598252743,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198056730657,415,22,1839,0,386,1598496018

23,74807966,english,"Background: I've only played Ark as a single-person PvE sandbox game.

Do I recommend it: Yes, especially if you intend to play multi-player.

The Good: Ark is a masterfully-crafted game, with simple and excellently-balanced mechanics, and a massive amount of content.  The potential play time from Ark's map dwarfs all procedurally-generated worlds I've seen.

The Warning: AFAIK, Ark does not adjust its mechanics for the number of players.  Playing alone is literally akin to trying to survive alone on a predator-infested island.  You can be eaten at almost any time, you will need to tackle an ever-increasing workload to maintain yourself and your pets, and some tasks are just flat beyond the reach of one player.

Peeves:  These are minor nits I have with the game itself, less advice on buying it.
- The abundance of maintenance tasks in Ark is a key part of game balance, but it definitely appears keyed to challenge elite multiplayer tribes.  Would be nice if it were adjustable (it may be, but I can't find the setting.)
- The game uses a fun theme of ""survivor with a journal"", but the journal only covers a few topics.  Key concepts like how to gather resources pretty much require searching the wiki.  While the wiki is excellent, I personally like it if basic data is presented in-game.
- New animals get added to the game over time.  While it sounds like a neat idea, it's gradually adding acute and chronic challenge to the game:  acute, because of waking up to find a new toothy predator standing over you after an update, and chronic, because the island is running out of ""safe"" space.

27,45662622,english,"So my previous review was false, it was indeed my issue and discovered what was causing it. So when you update ark, it makes a copy of it, which is...atrocious to say the least. The game is huge. So what'll happen is, if you don't have enough space on your SSD but have enough on an HDD it'll copy it over there. This creates a problem where it's constantly download to the HDD and then copying back over to the SSD. Even just having it downloaded on an HDD and staying there is faster. 

So, with that out of the way lets review the actual game. I will be 100% honest, I'm a PvE carebear, and mostly unofficial. That said I've played with a variety mods, no mods, rates etc. About 1500 hours is with no mods low rates (2x gathering, 5x breeding/incubation, 0.25 mating interval and 1x exp). It was a phenomenal community that is no longer existent. I've met a great friend there though, and that was almost 4 years ago and we're still friends and talk near daily to this day. We still go back to Ark and I won't tribe up with anyone else. I'd rather be solo than with anyone.

The actual game play is great. It's not perfect, it has bugs, but they aren't game breaking. The game is intensive on your system, and the story is interesting. You can make the game as fast as you want or slow, you can play PvP or PvE, total conversion mods or no mods. You make the game how you want. The maps are huge and anyone who says otherwise is playing on a flyer, and possibly with higher speed (mods). Ragnarok, Crystal Isles and Valguero especially are huge. They're all free maps too. I prefer the Island, it's very full, and every environment feels unique. While not the biggest, it doesn't feel as empty as Ragnarok or Crystal Isles does. 

I would go into this game with a mindset that it's not going to be flawless, but you can lose hours and days here. Maybe even weeks. If you're looking for something to do for days on end, this game is a great way to spend it. It's hard for me to get back into it, but I do play it every now and then and love it all the same. I know so much that I can accelerate my play speed ten fold than what I did when I was new. The learning curve is large, but I always followed a philosophy. Don't take what you can't afford to lose out of your base. Items, Dinos, etc.

Enjoy, this game is a great one. Not a master piece, but there are far worse survival games.",1541543895,1598223171,True,0,0,0.497925341129302979,0,True,False,False,76561198054809710,604,10,192753,0,152398,1600505409

If you try to play ark on an official server, you might as well not bother. 
If you're playing single player or on a non-dedicated server, it's fantastic. (Although it's WAY better with friends!)

I set up a non-dedicated server (2, actually, one each for the Island and the Center, and I'm going to add Ragnarok and Scorched Earth shortly) and played with a some buddies, and it was fantastic. It's still challenging to deal with the random dinos that rip you to pieces but you don't have to deal with the jerks that play on official servers and wreck anyone who tries to do anything. There's the satisfaction of building a base and leveling up and getting stuff done and TAMING DINOS, for heaven's sake. How much better could it get?! It's not even that hard to set up a non-dedicated server. If you want help doing it, let me know and I'll walk you through it.

If you don't like to grind every now and then and just want to PvP, either stick to the official servers (good luck) or play Survivial of the Fittest instead.

The expansion packs are really cool, but way overpriced. like the Extinction expansion pack, its super cool with a lot more stuff to do, but you sometimes have to pay the price of the full game again just to get it. Also, on certain ARK maps, there are lags and glitches that havn't been fully developed yet. I think before they continue making more maps and expansions, they should finish the ones they already started. 3. collecting resources takes WAY to long. like, i don't want to spend half the time i play chopping down trees, collect berries etc. the default harvest rate should go up a lot. the good thing is you can personally customize that stuff in the game settings. despite the downsides I named, its a pretty good and really fast moving game fun game. would definetly recomend.",1598194327,1598194327,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561199043874527,2,1,1793,0,870,1600716419

77,74772898,english,"While I do recommend giving this game a try if you are a masochist I will say that I really wish the devs game the combat an overhaul.

Currently the game revolves around taking 10 guys to a dino, trapping it in a man made cage/wall/fence and then shooting it with tranq arrows/darts until after 100's of shots it finally falls asleep, then it takes hours to feed it and wake it up tamed in your tribes name.

I don't like that.

Two solutions, the first would not require many changes, they would just have to make the game more balanced around solo/duo torpor/damage/resistances and attack/movement speeds. I would recommend they look at some videos of Darkfall / Darkfall Unholy Wars for Inspirations on proper PVE and PVP Gameplay.

Route 2 would be an overhaul of the combat system to work more like Darksouls so that each monster has a move set so you can dodge/block/parry/do some move to counter the moves of the dinos, they can add some randomness to it when it comes to the choice of move the dino does but since there are hundreds of dinos remembering which moveset to dodge each dino will bring a level of mastery to the game easy to learn difficult to master, instead  of its current meta of difficult to learn, very difficult to master.

51,67411347,english,"Take this review with a grain of salt since I've only been able to play for nearly 20 hours.  Before I even get into the gameplay, I'll talk about the straw that broke the camel's back - the sheer amount of storage space that this game consumes.  Don't let the download screen fool you - this game is well over 100GB in size when extracted.  Even worse, each new update adds 10+GBs of content.  With the way the game looks, it's actually insane that it consumes this much space.  The textures do not look all that great and I'm speaking lightly.  Either way, I had attempted to play this game after some time away, when an update completely filled my download cache and destination drive.  Even after clearing out unplayed games, it was still too big to fit in either drive.  It was this point, after the latest update pushed my drive to its limit, that I uninstalled.

Secondly, the game is optimized so poorly that my 1080TI was struggling to run it on High settings.  The game does NOT look good enough to warrant my PC heating up my apartment by another 10 degrees.  It is actually ridiculous how much of a lack of concern the devs have with your ability to run this game.  Once they sell it to you with the shiny wrapper and promise of having the dino army of your dreams, you're practically dead to them.  Mission accomplished.
  
But none of that is really my main gripe.  You could get past these issues for sure.  But no, my real issue is the gameplay, which to me is most important.  First of all, I'm not sure how this game gets away with forcing the player to spend so much time performing mundane tasks that get subsequently punished by the plethora of bugs and RNG litterred throughout the game.  Did you just spend several hours obtaining the dino you wanted?  Have a small army of dinos at your disposal?  Trained your dinos to be stronger and faster than your average dino?  Great!  Watch as a few unlucky spawns result in an aerial raid that swoops in and leaves your army and co-op partners in ruins!

To put it in perspective, after playing this once with some friends the very first time, we managed to do the following:

* Crafted some decent weapons and a nice cache of supplies
* Tamed some low level dinos
* Tamed a few tankier mid level dinos
* Built a 2 story base of operations
* Built a wall around our base (it was in progress at the time of the attack below)
* Assembled armor of decent quality and mid tier ranged weaponry

This equated to about... 10+ hours of work for me alone.  And most of it was coordinated by my tribe mates while I had already logged off for the night.  Note that I use the word ""work"" with FULL intention here - all of these tasks were a slog and did not hold any innate entertainment value.  One of my least favorite chores was dino taming, which required that we babysit the dinos we wanted to tame while we periodically force fed them berrires/meats.  

Anywho, once all the work was done, we could finally start getting into the groove and have a little fun exploring.  We had dinos to ride and fly around on.  Our base was on the peak of a hill overlooking the landscape.  It was reasonably well fortified.  We had a pretty darn good foundation and were ready to set out... until a TRex-lookin' dino that spawned meters away from our camp, decided it hated our tribe and everything we stood for.  A few grueling minutes and several futile deaths later, the damage was done.  Might as well have slapped a game over sign on the screen right then and there. 

So what was the damage exactly?  Most of us permanently lost our gear because we couldn't find it amidst the slaughter.  One person's gear clipped through the terrain.  All of our dinos, sans one tiny little guy who actually listened to our orders to stay in the base, were slaughtered mercilessly.  The TRex had left its mark all over the battlefield in the form of feces carrying the DNA of our lost reptilian brethren.  Needless to say, that was a hard stop to the barely existent enjoyment elicited by this game.

I've tried to get started in this game twice since then, and have had similar experiences both times, though not nearly at the same scale.  I think I can safely say that if you are the sort of person who appreciates saving your money for years only to have some lowlife dip steal your identity and make off with it all, you would absolutely love this game!  I for one, in my barely sane mind, do not.  

To be fair, perhaps the hardcore survival game enthusiast would appreciate how rough this game is.  Though the lack of polish and care would grate on even the most avid of survival fans.  I thought I was included in their ranks, but clearly, after playing Ark, I discovered the limits of what I could survive.  Godspeed to all those who long for Ark's unique brand of suffering.  

P.S. In the spirit of fairness, yes, you can turn down the more grindy elements in the game if you start your own server.  Did it matter that much when we tried it?  Not really.  Just meant that our inevitable loss hurt that much less when it happened.  But it was still time wasted, no matter how you slice it.  With that said, cheers to you, Ark - a complete waste of 20 hours of my life.",1587014133,1598085962,False,3,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False,76561198015425085,431,1,983,0,983,1586836434

It certainly has its problems, and it will make you rage at times because despite the fact that it's sometimes broken, it delivers an amazingly rewarding gameplay loop and hooks you quickly. It has a steep learning curve for higher level play, so definitely don't try to take on an official server alpha tribe as a new player or anything. Steam's version is the best way to play, with mods giving the game SO much more quality of life. Vanilla Ark, especially on Official, can get REALLY grindy, with a lot of ""chores"" to do. Finding a server with the right rates for you is the hardest part, IMO. But once you find the sweet spot, you'll be immensely addicted. Don't play if you can't devote reasonable time to it because when you log out, your character stays where it's at (and your stuff does, too). If you're not in a safe area, you're in danger when you're logged out. Group play with reasonable time dedication is the most rewarding experience. If you get paranoid easily, Ark PvP may not be for you. On PvP servers, you have to automate base defenses or hide, because when you log off, other players may try to destroy your base and take your stuff. Paranoia can run rampant at higher level play. But if you're not deterred by this, Ark will definitely be worth it.

Edit (16.08.2015) : 

The current state of perfomance is still awful, gross & disgusting, even tho there has been released an Nvidia driver which should optimize the Game + some additional perf patches, but i still can't get stable Fps above 30, sometimes 50 - barely 60 when i look onto the floor or the sky. The average fps are around 15-35 (not even everything on epic, ground clutter & sky detail on low) on a GTX 980 | i7 4790k | 16gb 2133 mhz. And that's, kinda sad compared to Witcher 3  & gta v which came alot earlier then this game but are stable at a 70+ fps (maxed out settings). It doesn't look that the Game dev's are paying attention to the performance anymore since there's no word in the upcoming/further out notes what indicates on adding some patches related to the performance.


Edit : 01.09.2017) Game is fully released now and the performance is still ass. Great job.

Edit: 2020: Well nothing much to say, playing on your own server (bought or dedicated) is the only way in my opinion to achieve fun.

TLDR - I would recommend this game and the DLC content.  Fun, challenging with a high replayability. 

Lots of game settings to adjust difficulty and grinding (level, stat gain, harvest, dino stats, breeding, etc).  Some of these are simple and intuitive and others need to be researched.  Between the wiki, youtube content creators, and some trial and error I was able to come up with settings that worked for me.

The one issue I have with the game is the building.  It is frustrating with placement limitations and the limited time (30 sec) to pick up placed items. I solved most of these issues with S+ Mod. 

One feature I would like to see is a way to adjust spawn types, rates, max levels, and level weight (IE higher level spawns more common).  I know some of this can be accomplished by modifying the ini files but it is difficult for non tech people to do.

5+ years of development and it's still a joke to play because of this, yet the devs add new bugs and DLC and totally overlook these issues.

This should have never left the Alpha status until it was smooth to play. It looks and runs well enough, but that alone does cut it and justify the cost.

And why does this game at this point in development take so much space and forever to load on a SSD.

Addictive and fun on unofficial servers.  From what i hear official is no good tho, no way i would want to spend a week or two to raise a bred dino. The server i play on is a lot of fun and the people are nice.

Cross-play with the Epic version requires the server to run NO MODS (as of 8-20-20), so if you're having issues finding the server in Epic, that could be why. There are other possible connection issues, but they have workarounds.

Taming enormous creatures is a nice payoff for the amount of work you put into the process and some can be extremely valuable in base-building since they can harvest resources for you. (Gigantopithecus gathers more fiber than you'll ever use. Doedicurus gathers a lot of stone.)

56,74580943,english,"So I have almost 900 hrs played...

Why do I have given it a negative review? 

Because a lot of those 900hrs were doing things to try to play the game.

From the start... it took possibly 10-20 hrs just to find the right blend of settings between graphics/performance.

Possibly another 50 hrs is just waiting for the game to load, crash, try to reload again, crash... or getting kicked out for an update no one cares about, 5 mins again waiting to log back in... u go to a part of the map ur PC doesnt like? crash! 5 more mins trying to get back in. 

Now a lot of those crashes mean ur body died somewhere.... so u gotta spend more time looking for ur body... u might lose a mount that took u hrs to tame...

So when u put it all together I wouldnt be surprised if around 20-30% of my 900 hrs is just me TRYING to play the game, server t ime outs, servers not having updated, etc... 


Does this game have a good concept? yes thats why I almost spent 1000 hrs on it... (30% dealing w issues) 

But during most of that time I was thinking: ""WHAT AN AWESOME GAME! I am sure the devs will fix this, or that soon"".... years later is now clear that will probably never happen.

If the Devs showed the intent to fix these things then I would be playing and giving it a positive review... but as that doesnt seem to be part of their schedule then its a no from me...

I will gladly change it to a Positive if things get better... but why do that when you can just make another DLC, right??

I was wrong, multiplayer is far more annoying due to poor server stability and server-side lag. It can still be fun if you have a lot of patience. 

As time passes I am going to have to recommend against this game. The developer clearly doesn't test its patches and often breaks more than they resolve. Additionally, the official servers are so incredibly laggy as to be unplayable. This company has produced an incredibly amateur product that keeps deteriorating with each patch.

After my character was deleted twice and all my progress in the multiplayer game lost twice, wildcard refuses to restore the engrams lost on my character. Literally half a year's progress lost. Now data integrity is a basic function of a multiplayer game, and wildcard fails totally in this regard.

ARK, with friends, is fun. LOTS of fun. Running around a beach, naked, beating animals with rocks whilst making stupid jokes with your friends, what more can ya want? 
There's a lot of satisfaction going from essentially a cave-man to being a high-tech super warrior riding a robot T-Rex. 

But playing the game solo? The silence is DEAFENING. Any sounds, be it from friend or foe, are a startling welcome as you struggle to get out of the mud of poverty stricken neanderthal era technology.

On top of this, you have the obvious problems under the hood. This game EATS your computer. I run a fairly decent specs computer that I maintain on a regular basis and this game just looks at it like an Asian kid's father whom just saw his son bring home a B in Science.

Do I like ARK? Yes. Would I recommend it to friends? Absolutely. But for selfish purposes. I need them if I'm to ever return to this game.

The game is decent. It is horribly optimized and there is almost no way for low end pc's to run this game, but if your specs can run it, then have all the fun you can. I recommend playing on modded servers, because I've tried playing on official servers and it's honestly way too time consuming. It takes a week to tame a Giga and then when you tame one, its stats get cut right in two, whereas on a modded server, it may take you up to 30 minutes, an hour if you're unlucky. Flyers are also really bad on official. They had nerfed them at some point to where you cant up their speed, so you may as well ride a turtle on land instead of riding a pterra. Also make sure you have friends to play with. Bases are hard to manage on solo and mats are much easier to grab with people. Also, watch out for compies (I think that's how you spell their name) and sharks. They can come out of nowhere and can shred your gear and dinos in seconds, weather it be on modded or official.",1485914756,1597846689,True,0,0,0.508055627346038818,0,True,False,False,76561198260328389,60,10,51329,0,24995,1598011075

It looks amazing and has so many awesome mechanics that have never been included in any other game I’ve played. Normally, I would strongly recommend everyone to give it a go. The key word there being normally.

However, I’ve also never encountered a game that throws as many tantrums as this one does. I’ve gotten through two laptops and a desktop trying to play, both laptops were killed off by overheating, the second laptop was gone before it’s one year warranty was done. The desktop lost the functioning of it’s NVIDIA graphics card to this titan and I had to do a system reset to before I’d even installed the game. Speaking of installing, you’d better have ~150gb spare on an SSD drive (HDD starts lagging uncontrollably the more you play) and each map will add on about 50gb. Some people occasionally get lucky and are able to play ARK on the equivalent of a potato, but once you start playing this game you won’t want to stop and I’m begging you to not sacrifice your life and your technology to Wildcards monstrosity. They seem to have decided that rather than fixing and utilizing their spaghetti-fied mess of code, they instead want to release DLC after DLC and bring you reskinned versions of old dinos with a few new gimmicks (I’m looking at you Tropeognathus). The point of games should be that they are able to be enjoyed by everyone without having to dedicate mass amounts of time troubleshooting why the game keeps crashing or why it runs at 10fps. There are more threads of people complaining about how bad the game runs than there are official servers in the game.

All in all I’ll give ARK credit for being so good that despite all of its many, many flaws people still want to play it, me included. But again- please do not sell your soul to a game that’s going to give you hell for your entire relationship with it. No amount of new dinos will make it worth the drain on your wallet, your time and your patience.

Russian/Chinese zergs are still a thing on public servers, the latest FreeLC map is a buggy pile of garbage, and via dark wizardry or some shit; the AI has gotten worse, not better.

For those coming back: Just imagine your original experience, but your tames are even more likely to fuck about than they used to, ESPECIALLY flyers.  I died, respawned, and watched my argentavis struggle to kill a microraptor for 10~ minutes before I got bored(read: finished my cig).  I'm not even going to touch on the shitty hitboxes, either, because they've gone into the dumpster fire, too.

For those new to the game: Ark is an early-access 20$~ game, trying to sell itself as a 50$ full release(145$ if you buy the season pass+DLC, which is a fuckin' joke, btw).

Seriously, just stay away, that's my best advice.  Everything Ark does well gets mired by buggy crap that'll either A). Kill you,  B). Kill your Dinos, or C). Both.",1597817147,1597817147,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561197976974693,90,7,52867,132,50777,1601951836

What so proudly we hailed at the twilight’s last gleaming?
Whose broad stripes and bright stars thru the perilous fight,
O’er the ramparts we watched were so gallantly streaming?
And the rocket’s red glare, the bombs bursting in air,
Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there.
Oh, say does that star-spangled banner yet wave
O’er the land of the free and the home of the brave?

On the shore, dimly seen through the mists of the deep,
Where the foe’s haughty host in dread silence reposes,
What is that which the breeze, o’er the towering steep,
As it fitfully blows, half conceals, half discloses?
Now it catches the gleam of the morning’s first beam,
In full glory reflected now shines in the stream:
‘Tis the star-spangled banner! Oh long may it wave
O’er the land of the free and the home of the brave!

And where is that band who so vauntingly swore
That the havoc of war and the battle’s confusion,
A home and a country should leave us no more!
Their blood has washed out their foul footsteps’ pollution.
No refuge could save the hireling and slave
From the terror of flight, or the gloom of the grave:
And the star-spangled banner in triumph doth wave
O’er the land of the free and the home of the brave!

Oh! thus be it ever, when freemen shall stand
Between their loved home and the war’s desolation!
Blest with victory and peace, may the heav’n rescued land
Praise the Power that hath made and preserved us a nation.
Then conquer we must, when our cause it is just,
And this be our motto: “In God is our trust.”

These are the words I would use to describe this game.

This game offers a pletora of flora and fauna species to be explored, tamed, bred and expanded in several biomes, maps, DLCs and events. This game feels like an MMO at times due to the amount of time you have to invest (and trust me, you will want to invest more time in it) Each animal has its utility, and each portion of the map opens to new posibilities of adventure, and a new thread on your tapestry of experiences you will enjoy in this game.

I was rather upset that at the time I didn't know that steam did a big sales event during the summer so the week later, it was on sale for 20. besides that, the game has an amazing theme and great aspirations and meets them to certain extents... however I would be remiss if I didn't mention the downfalls of the game. I first tried to play it on my mac book pro 2012, and I know it was my fault for trying to play it on a computer that couldn't handle it but a few years later I got a much much nicer PC that could play much more complex games and yet it would still crash. I had to play with the settings a bit and lower the quality of the graphics to be able to run it at a smooth 60 fps. For a game that promises so much, I'm rather disappointed to find that it didn't have to power to show me its true extent. The game is still fun to play but needs fixing. 7.2/10

4,74442776,english,"I Enjoy this game when its functioning and it has a really solid concept, great art, and it can be a lot of fun. The problem the whole game and company sits on an attitude of absolute disregard for the player. Their game is designed to force you to perform massive grinds to build up your base and get your dinosaurs only to flippantly destroy what you built when one of the endless number of bugs pops up. The servers often go down for hours or days and a lot of the time the game is running on that server with no players. This means that the large quantities of dinosaurs you've spent hours taming or raising from babies will die of starvation while you stare helplessly at a login screen. These babies take 9-18 hours of hand feeding with constant attention to raise followed by days of having to login every 8 hours to make sure they have the best stats only to have their terrible servers take it all away. In addition it seems no one at the company is actually paying attention to whats happening in their game or servers and bug reports are completely ignored. A recent patch note claimed they changed a timer on a boss fight from 20 minutes to 30 minutes... no they didn't, and whats more even after i reported it the false patch notes remain live and have been for three weeks. They fundamentally don't care about your experience or time.

Another great example, on extinction they decided it would be a great idea to have a map border which when you crossed it you would die and lose everything including your steed. In addition that server often has massive minute long spikes in lag where you can accidentally fly off the map. Finally, one of the banner creatures for that map is one that ""shoots"" through the air and is the most prone to flying off the map. Putting it all together you have an absolute deathtrap that has existed for over a year and nobody thinks hey maybe we could be a little nicer to our players and not kill them when our server freaks out.

Examples of blatant disregard for player experience:
Valguero Manticure Bosses Glitch out and never land for you to fight, after 20 minutes game kills you and all your dinosaurs
Extinction Orbital Drops come down and murder you (no issue) and your dinosaurs you bred from babies with little to no warning.
Extinction edge kills you and your mount in a manner of seconds, even if server lag is what placed you outside the boundary
You have to login to ""imprint"" your dinos every 8 hours of you don't get full stats, try having a job or sleeping at night with this requirement
Raising babies takes 2-14 days and requires constant care every single day or they die and waste all that progress

Clearly I've invested in this game but i wouldn't recommend others do it.

I believe it is riddled with too many bugs or glitches as well as poor game mechanics, creature and structure designs. 

Despite having great internet and computer specs far past the ideal requirements to play the game, it still regularly lags or hiccups, even when simply walking around. 

I have gotten stuck on rocks/boulders, jumped into a lake and fell halfway through the ground so I could still move and see under water but ended up drowning cause I couldn't escape the lake floor. 

Taming is a joke. it is almost as if the game actively tries to fuck over any attempts at taming. I have been in an area that had no predators, the entire time i played, and the moment I start taming something multiple appear? and that happens a lot it wasn't a one time occurrence; or i walk away from the tame and the unconsciousness level rapidly disappears at a rate faster than when I was standing by it. 

When building, it often doesn't place a mat or structure where I intended it to be, or even where it was highlighted as being. Also, when placing items close together, such as storage cabinets, one minute you can put them nearly inside each other while other times you have to have a decent gap between them. They have horrible consistency with the collision or physical boundaries of various structure. 

There is a similar issue with domesticated dinos and their movement or attack patterns. One minute it is smooth sailing, you can walk through trees that clearly are too close to fit a dino through, but then a small rock or boulder will stop a freaking rex in its tracks. As far as attacking with dinos, while mounted it is a joke, you are better off letting them attack without you, because when you are riding them, they seem to have the turning radius of a tractor and trailer, while unmounted they have the flexibility of a gymnast and can bite an opponent when not even facing them somehow. lol However, a minute later, while you are being molested by a wild dino, your dino, especially flying ones, will take forever attacking them, often needing to fly far away to come back for an attack, when seconds ago they were doing donuts around another dino, biting it contantly. 

To be honest, this game, which they are asking way to much for, IMHO, feels like it would be a game that was barely in alpha, if that makes any sense. They have WAY too many problems to be selling this as an essentially completed game, especially for their price.  I will not recommend this to anyone and believe the devs should be ashamed of their work, as it stands.

For what reason... I have no idea. It isnt just how the game runs it's also some of the game mechanics. dying on the other side of the map for some stupid reason, then having to tame a new pteranodon and fly there just for my loot to have despawned is not how I want to spend 3 hours of my day. Another thing that is entirely broken and needs to be fixed is the no-clip. It is so bullshit that someone can just sit outside my metal base and chomp me through the wall with their t-rex.

62,74407993,english,"Ark is a fantastic game that has had plenty of content added to it. I'm not a fan of the company or the way they do busness. I picked up the game and the first 3 DLC for £20 after admiring it for ages. I've played it for an obscene amount in the relatively short time I've owned it. To me this game comes closer than many games to having it all. Its done more aspects of its gameplay well than many games I love. Sure its got flaws, Dino clipping is probably my most irritating flaw, but I feel like theres no easy option on how this should have been done given the staggering variety of creatures you can tame and their differing relative sizes. Im not a PVPer but it appeals to me that any/all Ark gameplay ive enjoyed could in theory have been done under a PVP framework. People moan about the PVP, sayings its not fit for purpose. Id just like to know what other games thas has even a vaguely similar gameplay/content loadout has  PVP baked in. Lets say Arks hit registering in PVP is bad. (I've never experienced this). What is better ? Also I imagine its pretty equal for all players.  Maybe the complaints stem from how good of  game ark is, its so game that people wish it was perfect. Well practically perfect will do for me. FInlly the building, I've probably spent more time in ark building than anything else. The building system is fantastic. It can be frustrating s hell for various reasons, but those reasons have a cause in my opinion (like dino clipping issues). The structures plus mod fixes many issues and takes arks excellent building system and improves it.

If theres one thing id like more of in ark, its item variety. Id like to see more loot in ark, more armour weapons and outfits, more structures to build. But even this, I suspect has been fairly heavily balanced and presents enough options to be interesting.

I forgive you ark all your minor faults while celebrating what I consider to be one of the finest gaming experiences ever created. Its peers as I know them do not come close.

97,74371296,english,"Mostly played on a private / friend server. And we modified the rules and settings to be more friendly to a small group for taming. Did not play public servers or PVP.

Premise: 9/10 - The idea super fun and rewarding. Its not the same old MMO or shooting game copying something else. Survival, crafting, while taming dinosaurs to ride with crazy tech ranging from bows to guns. Crazy entertaining.

Survival: 8/10 - Pretty damn hard/frustrating at times. Can die alot in the beginning while learning how to manage food/water and avoiding predators near your spawn. Can be frustrating and/or annoying dealing with some of the aspects like night time can fuck you when it sneaks up on you in a forest. Food/water can be annoying when you are trying to do something else. But its meant to have that and its not overly annoying, having a tame/dino mitigates that after a certain point. Fine and can be adjusted if needed (not public though).

Crafting: 7/10 - Not alot of thought process in the crafting tree. Pure level based crafting tree. But lots of crafting and things that are useful for various situations. You got all kinds of saddles to make, guns and weapons, crafting stations, quality of life stuff. Tooltips and information are decent enough to figure out. Could be better or more intuitive and the tree has room for improvement. Relocating resources can be a paing without mods. There are mods for many of those things though. Plenty to do crafting wise to have a nice big base for your needs. Mods to make them crazy castles and tree forts. 

Building: 6/10 - Yes you can build bases and what not, mostly everything is good. Some things are just frustrating lik enot being able to pick something up or having something snap on top of something else or being blocked or seeping through a wall. You can build, but nothing allows for true planning or expansion well, without mods.

Breeding/Taming: 9/10 - Come on you get to tame and ride T-Rexs. Taming in a real public server is probably a friggin nightmare. But basically you can tranq a dino, feed it, wait, repeat (depending on settings is time/effort) to ultimately tame/claim a dino to your army. Craft and throw a saddle on it and you can ride it. So much fun and very rewarding just murdering shit with some super predator. Then if you want you can mate/breed them to get better stats. Some of the default settings are kinda harsh and grindy, but meant for big server clan type stuff. There is alot going on here that can keep you busy for along while, even with super taming/breeding speeds. Have had farms of T-Rexs, Argies, Kangaroos, etc just to try and get better ones.

Content/Maps: 7/10 - Content is very basic and not much to do other than some boss fights which are limited in arenas. Personally feel like its a weak attempt at progression. The maps are huge and generally fun to explore, few of them have seen almost every inch of them and are fun to build in on and explore. They also have ""crystal beams"" which are bascially random loot crates to help with gearing up. Not a fun or rewarding experience, just disappointing most of the time. Loot can be annoying to progress through. You will spend most of your time getting your tames/bases built up. Again, on a real server the experience is PVP and staying alive.

PVP: N/A

Overall: 8/10 - Liked this game. Play with friends. Pay for a server. Tame some dinos. Build a base. Get murdered alot at night. Fun times.

Note: Developers/publishers are kinda trash. They could make this game SO MUCH BETTER. They have had legal problems. They haven't fixed some very basic bugs that cause alot of frustration. They haven't really made any key changes to take any step further. Instead they money grab.

Big mistake. Not only is it a buggy mess,  beginning is a nightmare. Spawn system seems to teleport you further and further away from where you die each time, and has no regard for if there's a building or /aggressive creatures/ right on top of you. Most of my deaths were followed by second and third deaths because of unlucky spawns next to direwolves and raptors.

Not only that, but for some reason temperatures will screw you over. Too hot? Shade won't help, unless it's a structure you've built. That includes four walls and a roof. Too cold? Torches and campfires are your friend, but /only if you're inside a building/. That's right, holding an actual flaming log two inches from your face doesn't count as ""heat"" unless you've got a bit of thatch over your head.

And the combat! Good god at the camera shake when firing a spear or slingshot. It's like a constant earthquake. And if anything's above level 5? Good luck. Troodons will take one bite out of you and knock you out within seconds. And they're /tiny/. Hell, three Compy'sll screw your day over. Y'know, those tiny, smaller than chickens dinos from jurrassic park? Three. Not the pack of ten or so taking on a little 9 year old girl. Three teeny tiny two-legged rats with a temper problem, vs an extreme bodybuilding, possibly genetically engineered human. Oh and punching anything barefisted kills you. Because reasons.

Edit: 8/9/2020
ALL OF THAT BEING SAID! I have put 233 hours into this game. It's still a buggy mess. It's still brutally difficult. Torpidity sucks. Multiplayer is ABSOLUTE trash. So why, after all this complaining, am I recommending this game? 
I learned the mechanics. The game absolutely lets you customize every setting to suit your playstyle. Missing features? There's probably a mod for that. And the actual diversity of creatures rivals any other dino game to my knowledge. This is one of those games you fully lose yourself in for days on days on days. Players beware, the cost of going back in time is losing most of your future to ARK.

Edit: 8/14/20
I remember why I stopped playing. The reason people have such high playtimes, and then not recommend it is because it's a poorly designed game which takes LITERAL IN REAL LIFE DAYS to accomplish basically anything. To even make it playable in singleplayer, you have to max out the options, and then download mods.

However ARK in its entirety is a massive investment, having payed nearly $300 AUD on ARK so far for often mediocre advancement for the player just looking for a base purchase the modded community (although it requires large amounts of storage) provides advancement and additions the Devs haven't provided realistically unless you are an extremely dedicated player looking for story, environment and small additions as I am myself there is no need to actually purchase season passes or additional payed DLCs.

77,17422958,english,"Ok it is years later and the game is FUN and well done I still am not a big fan of early access but this one worked out

You would think in 2015 programmers would have some resources they can all just use to start making a game. But NOOOOO! This game is so un polished they have no mute feature on the chat. They simply keep releasing ""new dinos"" and many many of the GLARING issues go unaddressed. ARK has PVP and PVE both of them are an exploiters wet dream! On the ""official"" servers I have played on about 20 of them either a group of chinese run it or a group of rude players gains an advantage that newer players have no hope of overcoming and they are constantly tormented at level 1-30 to the point most of them quit. So then you seek out a moderated game environment. Great the game is still broken and they seem to release the WORST patches on fridays just in time to completely foul up your week end game play. 

Over the past month 3 out of 4 weekends have been spoiled by a lame patch rushed out the door and BAM you can't log in. All the hype from the youtubers is from lame non experienced gamers trying to boost their earning on youtube. If they were honest this alpha is NOT worth paying for. The Game runs on the Unreal Engine and they Devs seem to have problems adjusting the most basic of map settings so be prepared to spend 1/2 of your game time in an extremely bright glare filled environment being blinded by the sun, and the other 1/2 of your game time is spent in complete darkness where you are forced to carry a large bright come kill me beacon called a torch. You are promptly killed by someone that has figured out to alt-tab out of the game and max out their gamma so they can somewhat see in the EPIC darkness.

So for the positives if your are lucky enough to not rage quit and you gather up some resources you can tame and house a pet dino. Riding around killing dinos is great fun at each stage of leveling. 
So if you are into self abuse get this title because some day it might be more fun to play for now the game play mostly consist of people waiting until no one in your tribe is online and they come up and glitch your pets through the wall kill them and blow up your door and take all your stuff then they brag about how leet they are and how much raiding they can do. 
All of the “official” servers are set up the same with default vanilla settings which in my opinion leave the game play very lacking. On the other hand many of the other un official servers are so heavily modded and adjusted I once logged into a server where I cut down one single tree and went up 16 levels, at that point you are not even playing the same game every one else is.

So  your only hope might be to pay to play this one on a group server that has some moderation and Guarantees they will not be adding any of the childish mods messing up your game time but that is hit or miss.

now i think i have some ideas that could be cool to put in the game like
1. you can find better versions of saddles or weapons in drop like ramshacle or acendant but why can they not get better models like the lowest better version [at least i think] ramshacle guns  can get a built in red dot sight that is remove able or colour the ones above that get newer models and attachments
2. this could be optional but you dont level up stats they level themselves and the same goes for your tames [DINOS]
3. each time your tame gets to level 50 it EVOLVES into a better newer model 
4. when youre low on health dinos can glory kill you for example a t rex can eat you whole with you inventory but in a cinematic way but only dinos can do this
5. smaller herbivore dinos now run away when a bigger predator is near and combat between wild animals isnt just bite and die they can sort of combo attack each other and when one is near death the winner glory kills the loser 
6. this is also optional and might be alot of work but when you knock out a dino you bring them to a cage where you feed them but larger dinos cant be dragged around so cages must be around them cages can be made from wood to iron or tek
7. dinos dont just walk around, some can go to groups or the groups would  go near water to drink or they would go to eat plants or hunt other dinos 
8. as for flying dinos if they are predators would pick up smaller prey and drop them or take them to nests
9. dinos sleep at night except for the dinos that are suppose to be awake and roaming at night 
10. npcs that are friendly , are bandits and raid friendly npcs or you [i know there was a mod but yea could still be cool if they hired that person and put it in the game ]

14,73849225,english,"This game had a lengthy early access period on steam, well prior to its official release in Aug 2017.  It's gone through a lot of evolution over the years, and what was once a buggy mess is now... a slightly less buggy mess.  Players and NPCs alike will still fall through the mesh and get stuck in terrain, the pathfinding is still broken, and the AI is still brain dead.  The grind is still real, so real in fact that many players won't be able to vest the time necessary to experience all the content in this game.  And that's a shame.

Because that's about where the negatives end.  These issues, while serious and occasionally frustrating, are not game-breaking.  And they are overshadowed by the plethora of design areas in which this game knocks it out of the park.  

While Ark doesn't feature the tightest gunplay or the most hair-raising combat, it is deep and nuanced in a way that a simple FPS could never be.  The PvE in this game is no slouch, with a handful of 'raid bosses', dungeons to explore, and hundreds of different creature types which have fairly unique combat mechanics.  Meanwhile, the larger scale PvP in this game involves a good amount of strategy, planning, and preparation, and is an absolute spectacle to behold.  

Much of this owes to Ark's graphical fidelity, which remains near best-in-class years after its official release.  The weather effects are superb, with streaks of lightning that crackle across the sky, to sandstorms so thick you can almost taste the sand.  The sound design is incredible as well, leading to a real feeling of immersion that few games can match.  

In Ark, you will level up, allocate stat points, learn better recipes, and make your dps numbers go up just like an MMO.  You'll eventually become powerful enough to go up against enemies that used to one-shot you and come out on top.  But let's be clear - this is not a theme park MMO.  You'll get overconfident.  And then you'll die.  Let's be real, you're going to die a LOT.   And each time it happens, you'll learn what not to do.  You'll learn where you shouldn't go alone.  You'll learn what works, and what doesn't. And you'll get a little better.

The player is always learning because there's always some degree of risk, even on PvE servers.  Feeling safe flying through the trees atop your wyvern?  You just got pounced by a prehistoric rat clinging to that tree, and knocked 50 feet to fall to your death.  Think it's safe because that T-Rex is dead?  Well, those 3 tiny high level troodons in the bush are waiting to knock you out too and make splatter art with your body.  

The sheer quantity of biomes, creatures, craftables, building tools, cosmetics, and activities make this a decidedly non-linear experience.  The dangers of the world aren't hidden behind a level gate, either - they're readily apparent from day one.  You'll either learn to avoid them, or die hideously.  Until one day, tired of getting chased around your spawn by a stubborn carnivore, you'll strap together all your supplies, lay the perfect trap, lay the perfect bait, and land the final hit.  And when it happens, you'll scream into your mic like your team just won the super bowl.  You'll name it after your first dog.  And then, probably a few hours later, it'll wander off and die bc you forgot to put it on neutral or you'll forget to put meat in your feeding trough and it'll starve to death.  Such is Ark.

Each player will make their own adventures, and each player's experience in the Ark will be unique to them.  Oh, did I say Ark?  I meant Arks.  Big, varied maps with multiple biomes, regions, and cave systems.  And you can travel between them fairly easily, especially if you play on a cluster server (which I strongly recommend).

This is among the best survival crafting games on the market, and a big thumbs up *if* you have the time and machine to support it.  If you can commit to the weeks and months long journey through Ark, you'll likely find that the journey itself is an engaging, gorgeous, sometimes terrifying, and supremely worthwhile reward.",1596693592,1597381485,True,0,0,0,1,True,False,False,76561197997329368,347,17,36640,119,29703,1601878530

First, be prepared for a lot of bugs. You're sometimes going to loose dinos because of it, and it's going to be REALLY frustrating.
Second, this game is a massive time consumer. Don't play on official servers unless you have the time to. If not, you might want to consider joining a private server. There is a lot of them and the community is often really helpfull.
Third, this is only my opinion, so don't make this a rule. I find PvP hella hardcore. If you're not prepared for it, you might wanna consider doing PvE.

When you start out the game is terrifying - one raptor can easily chew you up and the first spawn point is dangerously close to a Spinosaurus hunting ground. But if you can get to the point where you get a boat then you are a bit safer... then later on you get very good flyers like the Argentavis and the game changes once again into a soaring, exploratory dinosaur-hunt. It is amazing. The only downside is some clipping bugs (dinosaurs falling off ships or getting stuck in buildings) but the game itself and network code is very stable. Oh, and when you get really attached to a favourite dinosaur and it ends up getting eaten by some wandering carnivore. That hurts, but it always feels realistic.

80,26449850,english,"******UPDATED*****

Excellent game overall. I have played hundreds of hours and this is the prettiest, most open world, most involving game I have ever played. 

Basically, the game is Minecraft, with DINOSAURS... and obviously amazingly better visuals.

Originally it was glitchy and buggy, but it has come a LONG WAY since early access. They've released this game now for almost every platform, and even have a crappy mobile version. I haven't had any crashes in a LONG time, but there are still ""bugs"", like for example, you have to restart your dedicated server because your game setting file isn't properly applying, or you can't drink water, etc....

I play on a custom dedicated server with my wife - and recently my 9 and 11 year old kids - and  we just try to survive against the environment. We have about 3 fairly large bases and some good raft bases for getting all the resources we need, and my young kids LOVE taming dinos and hatching babies, which is good because I HATE that part of the game (LOL). The challenge with just a few of us is still more than sufficient. In fact, this game really needs more people in many ways because boss battles and Alpha Dinos are extremely difficult with just a few people. More people also helps speed up resource gathering and base building, and just generally reduces the overall feeling of 'grind' to gather and build.

Getting resources on the game's default settings is very labor and time intensive, and losing even a set of Flak armor can feel a bit frustrating. What is great is that this game allows you to find your own preferences, and really play the way you want.

Turning up the games default resource gathering to insane levels like 200% turns this into a nearly pointless sandbox without challenge, which at that point you may as well use console commands to spawn stuff and just full-on CHEAT... but the default settings on the other hand suck... They are a tedious, GRINDING SLOG. You have to find the middle ground that stays true to all the intended challenges, accomplishments, and elements of the game, while also reducing that grinding tedium.

I recommend  taming set for 3x taming, and resource respawn, gathering, and leveling boosted by 25%. I dialed these perfect settings in right after early access, and now these settings are really close to the official dedicated server settings. In other words even the Ark people figured out that these settings are the way to go, but they don't keep them at the perfect settings, oddly. A few times a year, they do ""special events"" where they do 3x taming and resource boosts. They are trying to lure players to the servers this way, and they know that this is just BETTER. So they leave the settings at ""OK - but not great"" most of the year, and make Alpha Tribes grind away, and then fix the settings once in awhile. This is why I recommend SKIP the official servers, and just make your own server where you can fix your own settings. 

I also made night 75% shorter because night sucks and leaves you cursing for daylight.

I made my own server for this game. It runs at least 3.2 Gbs of RAM and will spike and increase until the server will run 10-12 Gbs of RAM!!! I installed the server on an intel NUC that I bought a few years back. It has a Core-i3 (6th gen) with 16Gb of RAM (a $400 machine built mostly just for an Ark Server)  

There are lots of guides online on how to make an ark server. If you follow the guides, you can easily create a server that your friends can connect to, but there is a trick to getting friends from outside your home to see your server. For some reason even after doing everything right, setting windows firewall to allow the server traffic, and properly doing the port-forwarding on your home router... almost 100% guaranteed your server will NOT show up  -ever - in the unofficial server lists in ARK. The secret is going to a 3rd party website to find your ARK server over the WAN.   

https://www.battlemetrics.com/servers/ark

just search for the name of your server and you will find it if you did everything correctly, and then your friends can join you on your very own server, and you don't have to pay for anything extra! 

Having a static IP would be helpful so your buddies don't get booted when your ISP renews your IP and it changes, but I find it is not 100% necessary as they can always reconnect. If you want to call your ISP and see if they can give you a static IP for like an extra $10.00/ month, hopefully... that is a good thing if you actually have friends elsewhere who would play. Still much cheaper than paying for a hosted server.

That's pretty much it. Have fun. It's a solid way to waste time.

15,74204654,english,"Pros:
-Taming Dinosaurs
-Can be fun to play with friends

Cons:
-Almost constant rubber-banding
-Huge Server lag almost every minute
-Bad environment interactions
-Dinosaurs immediately losing the ability to path correctly after being tamed
-Cave Mechanics (Mainly grappling hooks not enabled on all servers)
-Everything takes FOREVER to do (Breeding intervals, Egg hatching, raising baby dinos...)

So let me start by saying this game has the potential to be a lot of fun, but due to the constant rubber-banding on servers and constant lag spikes it becomes extremely frustrating. One of the worst mechanics in the game is trying to do caving if your server does not allow grappling hooks, not being able to use flying dinosaurs in caves in understandable, but the grappling hook being up to the individual servers. How am I supposed to jump around on tiny ledges above lava with a dinosaur when I am almost constantly being moved back several feet anytime I jump?? It adds so much unnecessary difficulty/game mechanics that really add nothing to the game. Every dinosaur seems to collide with any bit of environment that is even remotely in its path.

Overall I would say get it if you want to goof around with friends while riding and fighting dinosaurs, don't get it if you are looking for a game to actually try and progress in without a bunch of unnecessary content between you and the endgame.",1597262530,1597262530,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,76561198219722468,21,1,19418,0,15130,1600720794

[h1]I have never seen so many amazing ideas mixed in with so many bad ones.   [/h1]
This is the most difficult, non-beginner friendly game I have ever played.   I LOVE hard games.    This one might be overdoing it on the difficulty.    I felt dirty making my own map and change the difficulty to my preferred settings.   (Sorry, but I don't feel like grinding for 100 hours just to get an ""ok"" item.)   I even had people helping me out on multiplayer, but I was still getting my butt wooped.    

[h1]Permadeath + hundreds of bugs don't go well together[/h1]
I took a screen shot of every bug I ran into while playing this game and I have a lot of screenshots....

You lose all your items and gear when your die.   You can collect your gear off your body, but the problem is that you and your dinosaurs will get stuck.... a lot.    I fell into a hole and couldn't get out.   Sometimes it will be impossible to retrive your items.   I built a ladder right in front of my face, but I couldn't climb it.  You have to wait and starve to death so you can respawn.   Their maps are full of these holes too.   This reason alone is enough to not recommend the game.   

[h1]Positive points of ARK[/h1]
It is hard to find positive things to say.....   The game looks great.   The dinosaurs look awesome, especially on the Aberation map.  You can change the settings on your own private games/servers.  This helps you avoid waiting insainly long wait times and avoids the need to grind for hundreds of hours.   There are so many things to create, that you will not want to craft everything.  

[h1]Not new player friendly[/h1]
The real issue behind this game, is that new players get thrown into the fire and will often fight high level enemies in the ""easy"" zone.    It will get easier when you get better gear, but It is painful for new players to grind through the beginning.  You run extremely slow when starting a new character and you cannot outrun raptors that are trying to eat you.   The real name should be Ark - Prepare To Die.

[H1] You can die within 5 seconds of spawning.  [/h1]
This game has so many good ideas, but it also has so many things wrong with it.    Like the 2nd map for example.   Did the developers even play the map ""scorched earth"" as a new rookie?!?!    I can die of heat stroke within 110 seconds of spawning.    Once again, I love hard games, but their default difficulty might be a little overkill.    They need to make starting zones more beginner friendly.

[h1]Complicated pet commands[/h1]
It is extremely painful for new players to figure out how to control their pets.   I wasted a lot of time, effort and pets as I was trying to master the pet whistles.

[h1]Lots of things in this game do not make sense[/h1]
Google will be your best friend while trying to figure out this game.  Air conditioners do not function like you would expect.  (You can die of heat stroke right next to a bunch of working air conditioners?!?)   Alpha dinosaurs and wild drakes cannot be knocked out or tamed.   Grindstones will continue to craft items for you, even if you walk away from it.   It just doesn't make sense and you might have to figure out things the hard way.

[h1]Terrible map tools[/h1]
The worst, most awful part about this game is the map tool.   It sucks to retrieve your items off your dead body.  Combine this with bugs and your body can be impossible to find, let alone retrieve.    I like the idea of keeping it simulated like it is a real hand drawn map, but it isn't worth the pain of having such a terrible, TERRIBLE tool. 

[h1]Horrific status icons[/h1]
While playing the game, you will get status symbols that show if you are hot or cold.   The problem is that half of them don't make sense.   ""This status symbol looks like a wolf howling at the moon.   What is that supposed to mean!?!?""   (search on google)   ""Oh, that is actually a man, wiping his forehead because it is hot....""   Be prepared to google these effect a lot.  

[h1]Review verdict[/h1]
[h1]4.5/10 - Bad, but still somewhat playable.[/h1]
Insanely difficult survival games are my favorite type of video games to play, yet I still struggle to recommend ARK.   I could recommend it, but you must be ok with permadeath and getting stuck in holes all the time.  You must be ok with running into bugs, like getting your dinosaurs trapped in someone else's base.  You will not be able to get your dinosaur out without the help of the base owner (if they are even online).   You must like crazy hard survival games.   Most people are not ok with these things, so I do NOT recommend this game.  This game obviously has so much potential, but it is PLAGUED with so many awful problems.",1529130141,1597248610,False,5,0,0.506982505321502686,0,True,False,False,76561198045136606,149,78,11224,0,11224,1540693129

At the same time I bought this game for something like 12-15 bucks on a sale and if it were still priced like that I'd leave a good review but considering they've raised the price to 60. Kind of absurd. Granted if the bugs and other issues had been fixed then ok maybe. But the bugs were never really addressed while I played. Talking to friends that still play say they still experience the same stupid stuff I did as before. Falling through certain areas, clipping into terrain. Just all around wonky physics I suppose. Given the experiences I've had I would say yes to a 20-30 dollar game. Buy it, you wouldn't regret it but 60 dollars? Better off finding something else sadly. 

If you do not heed the many users that feel the same way I do then bite the bullet and get a private server for you and some mates.

33,49895266,english,"ARK: Survival Evolved was one of the most entertaining games for a long time in my case as lack of content was never an issue. Comparing the current price with late 2015 I'd say it is more so on the expensive side. The learning curve is very high similar to other survival games and playing can feel fairly unrewarding especially for newer players.


As for gameplay ARK: Survival Evolved is mainly focused on the player versus environment scenario with the player versus player mode as an added bonus. If competing against others in a highly unbalanced game is just not your thing, there's plenty more stuff to sink thousands of hours into. Mastering the taming system with over 190 unique creatures available can be quite enjoyable for some people and exploring & experiencing each map provided by the DLCs can be quite fun for others.


If you're someone like me and decide to spend thousands of hours in-game replayability can play a big role in your experience too. I can almost guarantee every time you start over there's something new to accomplish be it building a larger base or finding that one tribe you've fought against last wipe. 


All in all the ARK: Survival Evolved is a great game and I'd suggest getting it if it does look appealing to you, and if you're wondering what's my overall opinion on it, after more than a few years of playing I'd rate it a 8.5 out of 10.",1554132779,1597106491,True,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,76561198319296460,18,5,145684,0,137819,1599158676

Pros:
Game has fun mechanics to it. Always keeping you busy. Plenty of dinos to choose from. Level up system is enjoyable. Huge selection of mods to use.  Lots of things to craft. Graphics are alright. Huge and interesting maps. Taming dinos is fun..As long as you don't get them killed. Many ways to play like, base building, pvp, hunter, fishing, breeding and, exploring.

Cons:
You might as well buy a private server otherwise, you will spent 12 real hours taming a level 80 bronto. You need friends for this game or you will not have as much fun. It is a chore to have to keep feeding dinos and replenish your spoiling food/resources. You have to play every day in order to keep these things going.

49,74105195,english,"I have played quite alot of hours on this game, and honestly, I can't recommend it, I really want to, but I just can't, it is such a good game but is let down by alot of basic quality of life features that force me to not recommend this.

The main example is stuff falling through the map, including your characters dead bodies, this mainly happens in caves, and happens alot in caves.  This is a glitch that should not have made it out of early release but not only was in the full release but still exists.  People have been even known to lose dinosaurs because they fall through the map. Luckily this is solved by downloading a gravestone mod so all your items is stored in a nice neat gravestone that just so happens as not to fall through the floor.

Another issue is the building, due to the way foundations work in this game, it constricts building alot unless you have perfectly flat land, this is because the foundations cannot be stacked.  The building is constricting in other ways too, but that is just the most restricting.

There is also a problem with non-dedicated sessions, which is incredibly annoying when playing with friends.  There is a limited range in which the non-host players can travel away from the host.  Now, whilst this can be changed in the setting before you start the game, it is still incredibly limited.  When in a non-dedicated session you always have to keep an eye eachother so as to not wander too far off.  This is easy for the non-host to do as you can see the hosts player tag for miles, but for the host, the other players name when you look in the specific direction and even then it's difficult to see.

There were a few other issues that I cannot name off the top of my head right now, but it's basic stuff that holds the game back and has caused me alot of stress and anger, which therefore stops me from recommending it.",1597099062,1597099062,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198065026804,108,1,4771,0,2317,1597889468

They are on expansion 8 or something, and still have bugs that are from the release. Today was a bit of a breaking point. I have been mudding around in the toxic PVP and decide that its time to down a boss, and work on PVE.  My partner and I breed all the dinos we need and head to the ob. Attempt one, only 9 of our 20 dinos get in. All 20 were in range before hand. NBD it was a glitch, that kinda stuff happens. Attempt two, all dinos are in, and the boss despawns 5 minutes into the fight. We are kicked out and lose our reagents to summon the boss. After this we speak with other who say this is common. How can you have  bug this large and just not fix it. It takes days of time to get a survivor leveled up and supplied enough to attempt a boss, and then it just despawns and takes your stuff. Waste of money, and I got it on sale. This game is the biggest tease and disappointment. Don't pour hours of your life into a game that will just bug out and throw it away. Stay clear of this unfinished product.

This game is a major time sync and the dev's have had over 5 years to solve the absolute worst issues with this game. Meshing and Aimbotting. 

Everytime you go on a raid as a mid-high level tribe, you have to 100% account for the fact that some brand new character level 73, will show up with a fab rifle and continue to kill everyone in your tribe. Larger tribes have programs that they pay around $500/month just so they can aimbot and avoid detection from ARK's anti cheat. Your only hope is that you put in a ticket and a GM shows up before you've had to pack up and leave. 

And what's worse, the person aimbotting generally finds out what server you are from and tells you he's going to mesh your base (blow it up from inside the map textures) There are new methods to do this found almost weekly and while yes they eventually get patched, Wildcard cannot keep up with the new methods that are being found. So no matter what you do you have to assume there are cheaters in every tribe.

Months of grinding every day and raising dinos just to be shot by some kid paying a monthly subscription to cheat and losing your entire base to some guy under the map. Even though Wildcard tries to ban the accounts that are cheating, the problem is people have ways to buy new accounts for pennies on the dollar and to them it's worth a few bucks to destroy everything you have.

The game is grindy and you won’t experience its full potential without a team. This is the only game I’ve played that appeals to everyone. On offical you can have pve stay at home moms that play and only raise cute dinos and you can also have the hard-core csgo guys that are insane at pvp. It's also the only game with basically infinite replay value. I see people complain about the game with 1k+ hours and i always think at least you got your moneys worth from the game. After i quit i have never been able to get even 200+ hours on a game since no game really has the strong social aspect ark does (evee online maybe).

69,73882479,english,"After now about 13.000 hours of total playtime, over all of my accounts. I can safely give a honest review of Ark Survival Evolved. I`ve started playing this game almost right after launch and I was quickly immersed in the amazing Idea of surviving on an Island filled with prehistoric creautures and the amazing scenarios it was giving me. With every update it became better in graphics, gameplay mechanics and accossiatelly some  new creatures that made the game more broad. Until Scorched Earth arrived and everyone was quick to jump on the ""Why does this game have a paid Dlc if it´s still in early access"" train. But I must say that I loved Scorched, regardless of the need for a dlc at that point. It improved everything I liked about the Base Game. The new Creatures were amazing and the map was honestly beautiful. Aswell as that it brought a lot of new gameplay mechanics and opportunitys. When Aberration hit us, it was in my oppinion the best state Ark has  ever been. Almost everybody loved it.  It was filled with great ideas that were well executed. Aswell as that it was full of great story elements that were leaving us all excited for Extinction. Extinction is where it kinda fell a bit apart for me. Wildcard had amazing ideas for Extinction, that they teased to us in charity streams before it launched and it sounded really interesting. I for one couldn´t wait for the new Titans that rommed the biomes and the mutated corrupted creatures that we would need to protect orbital supply drops from. But when it launched it wasn`t at all what we expected. Some great ideas where scrapped and replaced by mechanics that already existed, like titans needing to be spawned in terminal, when they were suppossed to be in the biomes all the time. Don´t get me wrong I still enjoyed Extinction, interms of story and gameplay, but it didnt live up to the potential that it had as the apparent ""Last Dlc"". In my opinion though wildcard should have left the story after Extinction. It had a great epic finale. That left me, who is very deeply invested and interested in the story, satisfied and didn´t have the need to be continued or expanded. And then we got Genesis Part 1. Genesis had kind of the same problems like Extinction for me, but much much worse. They kept telling us that it would be a ""whole new experience"" and that its gonna be ""nothing like we have seen before"". But when it finally launched all the new mechanics that were supposed to be interesting new gameplay assets, like Biome teleportation and the new mission system, aswell as the Hexagon Exchange were all to unbalanced or straight up broken like the new taming methods. The new creatures we got were great, but the Ferox or Bloodstalker for example were way to op for how easy you could get them. Another Problem was that we had 12 new creatures in both Scorched and Aberration, 11 in Extincion, but on Genesis we only got 5 new tameable creatures and less items than usual. I find that kind of lack luster for a Dlc you can only buy in a Season Pass. At the core I know what route they were wanting to go with the Genesis Simulation story wise and the new gameplay aspects, but they didn`t think some things through to the end. In my opinion. Overall I think Ark is a pretty good game at the moment, of course its flowed, but you can still have lots of fun with it and get easily immersed in the gigantic variation of creatures, environment and the overarching story. But with Genesis as the newest example it kinda showes that Wildcard isnt really putting in as much love and effort into their Dlcs as they used to do. It kinda comes foreward as if they only make new dlcs to squeeze as much money as possible out of the rapidly decreasing Fanbase, before the game finally dies because of countlles bugs ,that get fixed way to late  , lack of Tlc and lack of interest in new Dlc. They really should focus more on improving the  base game  before they make more dlcs or add new free maps. Island for example hadn´t gotten any improvement since the launch of the game. Some new Biomes were added,but about 50% the map is still the same and Island is still the map most new players start playing on. With Genesis Part 2 on the horizon I really hope wildcard give themselves the needed amount of time to do better and improve. They can realease it in 2022 for all that i care, but they need to make something great for their ""Last Dlc"" or Arks Fanbase will most probably slowly die out and Ark Survival Evolved will forever be remembered as a bad game with great potential.",1596748799,1596837145,True,1,0,0.480158746242523193,0,True,False,False,76561198240091884,15,1,635758,9376,600012,1602035552

- server is often down for about an hour or more (days)
- server ID changed - try to find it!
- even diconnected inside your base you can and will be killed (Raptor, drown??)  (PvE Server!!!)
- storage boxes are emptied after you reconnect (despite being inside your base) (PvE Server!!!)
- you got time to play: sorry, must wait for update (1/2 hour is no exception, maybe better with SSD)
- oher player's dinos somehow end up stuck inside your base, even if closed
- first connection attempt most often ends with Connection timeout after 3-5 Minutes
- once connected, if you are lucky, you get a message that the server will shutdown in 5 minutes, or, more it just crahes (and stays offline for another 1/2 hour or longer)
- server back online, great, but all the bad guys you have killed will respawn and probably eat you
- walking/jumping over rocks, you or your dinos risk being stuck - and you must wait until you starve since somehow the client thinks you are falling, so you can't  do anything to die faster  (eating or punching, ...)

The game hasn't improved in any of the attempts to play it all those years ago.   Outside of the die-hard fans that somehow find enjoyment is the horrible PvP design, the core game is just bad.

as of right now i do not recommend this game until they fix the player De-Sync issue god awful framerate on amd gpu's and the ungodly huge installation with 0 compression or optimization this game has come a long way down the pit of developers adding everything and fixing nothing they break on the way.

years later and many hours of playing still feels like early access crap with almost 0 effort into fixing issues or actually giving anyone a game worth more than $15 and some lols 

(final opinion if you are thinking of buying DONT if you enjoy this game then Dont defend piss poor lazy development and hocking hacked togther $3 content and using other peoples work in an attempt to goat people into buying it this game is good if you played it for a while but will just be an irritation so sane people)

The bugs make me want to rip out my own eyes because even on pve its really player vs enviroment, lag, and bugs. Lets not even mention the server resets/slash saves they may or may not teleport you, your dinos, or wild dinos to undesirable locations.

And the Best(Biggest). The time sink. Even with the upped rates, it still take 3 days to raise a decent dinosaur, and i'm talking cool shit, not raptors and dilphs, I'm talking ice breathing lizard cats and spiderman symbiote spiders.
and three days might not be so bad, if it wasn't for the fact that you gottta sit there for five hours and watch it or it will starve to death. Don't even get me started on otters.

This game is a time sink, that will keep you in it because you've spent so much time there. I guess you could play it single player and up rates to ungodly levels to maker game bearable, or shell out a about twenty bucks a month for a private server for your friends. 

Look at you library. Do you have unplayed games? Cause this game will try to never let you play them again, that is unless you wanna be shitting yourself on a beach forever in Ark.

19,48949720,english,"This game is terrible in every aspect, it's grindy, not rewarding, glitchy almost to unplayable state, very annoying, and very unfair.

I originally wrote this review in language i use back in 2018/2019, so the review is accurate to that date

Back then i used to play non-dedicated with some fella of mine, we both experienced how terrible this game is, i have no idea if they patched some or even any of the glitches, but the most memorable one for me was the character getting stuck in literally every piece of enviorment, the reason the character was getting stuck is unknown, but it happened when you go over a sharp edge/corner of the object

The unfairness of the game was on every step, the game gave you ABSOLUTELY no clues about where you have to progress, and tought ""hey you are new here right? let's spawn some alpha raptors in your area"", in the region which was noted as ""easy""

Entire map is one large maze, if you are playing this game blindly, then you should know what i mean, the only way to complete the game before you die from boredom is to look up wiki cave locations, better yet the caves were so broken in previous versions the game would render the cave for even 10 minutes, sometimes the game even crashed for me

The ""dragging to the host"" system in non-dedicated server makes absolutely no sense and is just pure frustration factory, if you will tell me the reason is to prevent host from crashing/overloading pc due to massive area loading due to players spreading across the map, let me remind you this game weights F***ING 120 GIGABYTES, anyways what it does is basically it drags any player which is not host to the host with unknown force if they get ""too far"" away from the host, this can even kill you if you get pulled against the wall. You can change that in game settings but i noticed it after long time, the effect still works if you load a new area like cave or even volcano peak and there's no proper way to remove it

The way how the game requires you to grind is awful, let's say you wanna craft a pistol, guess what, you need (around) 65 IRON BARS FOR A F***ING PISTOL, but you can't yet, why? you need to level up to level 30-40 (not sure on which you unlock the pistol), you get averagely 5 iron from one vein, the problem is the veins are EXTREMLY rare compared to normal rocks (you can get iron from normal rocks/boulders but it's super rare), you finally achieve the iron bars and level/blueprint for the pistol, you craft it, then you wanna test it out - craft bullets, 5 hours of mining or rather searching for iron veins, you get to craft your first bullet, you go test it out, it broke after 20 shots, guess what, you need more metal to repair it! to make you even more angry, you can mine metal ""FOR SOME REASON"" from rocks that are on beaches, game gives you no hints for that, no clue, yet they are common and very easy to find

So how is the game frustrating? well thirdly tame a dinosaur for 5 hours, secondly put it to sleep with 100 tranqualizer arrows/darts, and firstly grind for god knows how long for the materials, go into combat, get SOMEHOW killed from it's back, and praise that it doesn't die and you arrive there on time because you forgot to disable ""passive mode"", you arrive there, your dinosaur is barely alive, you want to get to it, but you get deathcammed by a raptor which is COMPLETLY unavoidable, you die, your dino aswell, you quit, move the game onto a movable drive SOMEHOW WITH 120 GIGABYTES, you cut the drive into pieces, burn it, store in potato sack, drown it in the deepest part of the ocean, but you realise you need 500 iron ingots for a boat, also don't do the same for me if you find yourself disagreeing with this review, it's mainly my personal opinion

TL;DR don't buy it, it's a waste of money, sanity, family, neighbours, friends and life

I've been with this game for quite some time, checking in on the progress every once in a while, and I have to say I'm disappointed in where this game has ended up. The UI has always been horrible, to the point where trying to find anything at all is a pain. Interacting with dinosaurs shouldn't be so time consuming if all it involves is menus. The number of dinosaurs is impressive and the amount of locations and the size of the worlds is incredible. I just can't seem to stick around for longer than thirty levels, and I'm not sure what it is that prevents me from doing so. It is probably a culmination of the glitches, the weird mix of high level dinosaurs in low level areas, the player base not in check. I love playing with friends in private servers, but it is such a pain to set up that it's almost not even worth it. I dislike that they have focused on additions and dlc rather than repairing and streamlining gameplay. I just think the developers could have done more with the base game before going out of their way to add so much content that doesn't even make the game better.

82,73804466,english,"I personally found this game very realistic or to say ""living the life"" like. Please take a seat and let me explain my findings and remarks from my humble experience... At the beginning you are thrown naked, afraid and beefed up like Belgian blue bull to this seemly beautiful world with stunning scenery, nice peaceful dinos and other beefed up fellow studs which whom you just cant wait to knock a few beers up, watch sunset and touch yourself at night with each other. However reality is often disappointing as in real life...  When I spawned, I started to walk down the beach while carefully examining my perfectly trimmed nails and muscular forearms. Sun was brightly shinning on my exquisite figure, I felt like on a verge of best day of my life. Then it all changes... Suddenly I felt a very dull and strong force upon the back of my head, right after that a very putrid and foul stench reached my nostrils. I turned my head to see what monstrosity produced this unworldly substance. Oh... the scenery I will never forget... A group of overgrown monkeys were stampeding in my direction and throwing their shit on me. Immediately after I turned, I received a huge load of warm shit in my eyes and on my nose. I started to run towards the sea to clean my face and neck, at this time monkeys were already near me. When I reached the nearest body of water I profoundly started to wash my eyes while monkeys proceeded to pummel my body.. then I realised the shit is not going away... Instead of washing, I was drinking the water with E keyboard key while shit was still obstructing my vision and the pummeling monkeys kept renewing the shit on my face with fresh layer of their waste. Not more than a few second later I died in vain while monkeys were presenting their alpha posture over my mangled entrails full of water and shit. Anyhow... such scenarios are inevitable at the beginning but you will experience them less and less often when progressing through the game progress and levels, eventually you will become the one who penetrates their ovaries and spill all kinds of your and theirs bodily fluids. Unlike in the real world, after some time and work you will become what you want, build your self a house, tame some posh dinos, be self reliable, have fun.

Totally recommend this game, its like irl but you can actually become something.",1596618781,1596618781,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198034998961,88,3,46053,0,43086,1598857693

It offers intense challenges and worthy rewards, allows you to explore how a survival game that does not hold your hand feels like, and if you were to get into the dlc maps, my god, it is incredible. Very few games can do what ARK does and not require mods. ARK requires a very specific set of interests to draw people in, but it does its job well.

17,62554588,english,"I’ve put off writing a proper review for ARK for a long time because I knew I wouldn’t be able to do it justice and I’ll probably edit this multiple times but anyways, here it goes.

First off, ARK is hands down my favorite game ever and no other game has even come close. It is just such a unique game that is brimming with content. I mean what other game can you ride a T-rex or build a house on a giant flying pterosaur or use a giant crab to hop around an extensive cave system or use  a moth to steal eggs from dragons or go wyvern surfing or fight King-Kong with an army of dinosaurs or zip through space with a blood sucking spider or get abducted by a freaky little crocodile or support a gremlin’s drug addiction or decimate a bug infested cave with a sloth or fight Kaiju with giant robots, the list goes on. There are so many combinations and ways to play this game that it effectively lasts forever. Sure some methods are more effective and practical than others but for instance you could use what’s essentially a turkey to complete one of the hardest achievements in the game. And as the game continues to progress, more items and creatures are added that multiply out the possibilities for goals old and new. ARK does an amazing job at rewarding player’s achievements because nothing can compare to the moment you tame and ride your first dinosaur. At the beginning of the game you are just a weak human getting killed over and over by things as simple as ants but by the end you are the strongest force on the map with a super suit and an army of creatures capable of taking down even the strongest foes.But, there is a lot of value to being a noob in ARK because one day you’ll cherish the memories of when you didn’t know that eating those black berries put you to sleep or scrounging for those same berries to keep that pesky spino’s torpor up. That’s another thing, you’ll make lots of memories in ARK as you try to figure out how to survive. There are very few games that I remember like ARK because most others just blend together into the same with each match turning out just like the last, whilst every playthrough of ARK is unique and captivating. The only downside of ARK is that the other games you play will pale in comparison. I haven’t found another game that gets the recipe quite right and I doubt I ever will. I wish the future survivors of ARK good luck as they embark on a journey like no other.

^Dec 31, 2018

Alright, so now for the review. ARK is a game that I love and hate. First of all, it is buggy, sometimes unplayable (although that is rare) and all we need are quality-of-life bugfixes. I play on a private RP-ish server, which is quite fun. Currently, however, the most fun part of ARK:Survival Evolved, is the people you meet and play along with. Your fellow ""Survivors"". In my 1000 hours I have played only with one group of people, and all of us know eachother quite well. We accept new players as well ()!

First of all, you'll probably be better off waiting until the game goes on sale and picking it up then. The game is quite buggy as the Devs seem to favor adding new content over making the game actually work. I will also note that not messing with the game settings and playing the game single player is just asking to have an awful time. If you mess with the game settings though, and have a friend or two to play with, it is a mostly enjoyable experience.

Don't get me wrong, the game will absolutely spit in your face and stomp on your long dead corpse like the bastard that it is. I've recently been playing a game with friends and we had to move out of the area that we had lived in because the game just kept spawning packs of Alpha T-Rexes everywhere which were just absolutely demolishing everything and everyone.

If you are looking for a fun, casual, balanced, and fair survival game experience, then skip this game and play some Minecraft. This game is clusterfuck of broken shit and almost malicious game design. But once again, if you play the game with friends and with settings like XP and Taming Speed turned up a bit you'll still probably get some meaningful fun out of it.

Part of the experience is realizing that this game has no bugs or errors of ant kind because the whole damned game is one giant fucking error.",1596523361,1596523361,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198090603251,163,3,16624,0,14032,1600753668

A few weeks later: Avoid. Object containers (or ""hitboxes"") are unfinished and massive, while pathing is questionable at best. This results in objects getting stuck on all kinds of things, resulting in bugs and glitches like crazy. For example, try running through the forest with a pack of dinos following you. You'll lose most of them to simple rocks and trees. Hatch too many babies at once to close to each other? Say hello to your useless, bugged, 3-headed carno. Give up on traveling by land and go all argentavis in the skies? Guess what, they get stuck on trees too.

Beautiful game, but it feels like it was made with minecraft level object containers. What a travesty. It feels closer to an alpha state game with the current frequency of bugs.

I'll admit to having quite a bit of fun too. But I'm not sure if it was outweighed by the time spent dealing with bugs and grinding. So close to being a great game.

But since we have only two, I'll lean more into Do Not Purchase ARK For Fifty Dollars.

The fact the developers think this is a fair price for the game in its current state is beyond maddening, it shouldn't have even left Early Access yet with the amount of issues it has still going. As much as I love this game and  would love to tell you to play it, I just can't for its price. 

Bugs are a constant issue you will run into, where AI fails to do as its supposed to, or strange random deaths just dive bomb you and your dinosaurs because..I don't know, you stepped wrong? The fact that the only times it was actually fully playable was with the use of several mods tells a story in-of-itself of the mechanics and balancing issues this game has had since the day I bought it.

Is it fun? At times.
Is it pretty? Oh definitely.
Is it optimized? 25-30 minute load times and random lag even with the best of computers? No. Go back and try again.

It's a sham that they decided to sell an unbalanced product for the price of a full game, while demanding $20 for DLCs as well without even bothering to comb over the most basic of optimization issues. The game is HUGE due to a lack of paying attention to how to deal with its struggles.

Every Dinosaur generated (This can be...hundreds depending on the map) spawns in at once, and moves around despite not being close to the player character. On a server, that can handle that, fine. But in Single player, not having things pause or despawn when not in use is foolish beyond belief. There is a rampant issue with Caves in particular that I'm not sure ever got fixed.

So a cave can be accessed, and then the floor becomes walkable for players and dinosaurs, and the cave derenders when not in use. That's good. However. Dinosaurs have still spawned because every.single.dinosaur on the map spawns in at once. What does this mean when you enter a cave? There's no creatures. Because they fell through the floor that wasn't there. This is a single player issue due to servers always having everything loaded.

Do I love  breeding and catching dinosaurs and creatures? Definitely!
Is building fun? ...Sometimes.
Is it gorgeous and fun to explore the maps? Yeah!
Is there a lot of content? Tons.
Is it worth $60 + DLC costs? No.
Is it worth picking up with the apparent flaws? Maybe for $15 like when I first bought it.

Improvements to mechanics, balancing, and optimization are slow, and often ""improvements"" break core mechanics that weren't even the real issue.

I love you ARK, but...Get it together.",1596442906,1596442906,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198041991868,245,12,37878,10,37867,1601847626

PROs:
+ Level design is very good, Aberration, Extinction, Genesis especially.
+ Graphics and textures for *most* stuff are very well done
+ Concept and lore is interesting
+ Group play is a lot of fun
+ Good PVE content.
+ Variety of items which have lots of cool features (greenhouse, grapling hooks, etc)
+ Hunting down animals to tame makes for a fun gameplay loop
+ Recent updates and features have alleviated a few of my main complaints about the game and made it more approachable.

CONs:
- Avoid PVP servers at all costs. This game is a major time investment and PVP servers will continually wipe you. Offline base raiding with easily obtained materials, cheaters, gankers, etc. It's simply not worth spending hundreds of hours building anything of value on a PVP server unless maybe you're in a megatribe or something. 

- Character Models and player-structures still look like garbage. They have time to make a bunch of new expansions with pretty maps and cool animals- but then they leave the most visually-frequent assets looking like trash.

- Building is overall *really* bad compared to any other game in the genre, even much older ones. It's very frustrating to create an aesthetically-pleasing base without mods. The building mods which have been out for several years now are substantially better than the base game and continue to make the official team look like idiots.

- Weird idiot design decisions- like caves, which require a high level animal to clear, are too small for those animals to fit into, except with a cryopod and a lot of patience.

- It's been out for several years and they still haven't fixed their horrible-ass hitboxes. half or more of my pve-related wipes are solely due to their shit hitboxes sticking together; making it impossible to disengage from an unwinnable fight. enemies pretty much stick to you like they're coated in superglue and make it impossible to move until you die. (Animal's tails, wings, etc all clip you and get you stuck everywhere. They basically just said visual mesh = collision mesh like lazy amateurs.)

The vanilla game itself for newbies isn't extremely welcoming. People who are not into dinosaurs or survival will have a very difficult time becoming invested in this game. Vanilla rates are slow and grindy, so I recommend for newer players to play on a 5x rates (or higher) server or solo server w/ custom rates. This will get rid of the grind time and reward you sooner, but effort is still required to progress in the game. 

Ragnarok is a great starter map in my opinion but so are the rest of the vanilla maps (center, isle). Scorched Earth, Abberation, Extinction, and Genesis are all extremely fun maps with their own niches and metas. I highly do not suggest starting out on any DLC map as a newbie, as these maps are much less forgiving and more complex.

I suggest to play with friends, since its way more fun. And, don't eat narcoberries.",1596318497,1596318497,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561199011103527,8,3,20,0,20,1587497119

Bought this game a long while ago actually, and after about 300-400hrs I left it alone for a long time for them to optimize and add more early-mid game content, (of cource end game stuff too), and I come back to see a paid DLC. Sigh, I belive they put finacnces over the player base's well being and requests. Recently I came back to the game, like I said and there is a notable preformance difference since last I played, but not enough focus has been put into optimization. I hope ARK follows in another steam game's footsteps, Rust. Why do I say this? Well Rust is similar minus dinos, therefore comparable, and what the dev team has been doing is amazing, they are always listening to community ideas, even have a community blog alongside their own dev blog, and when the players wanted optimization they worked and are working on it right now, I can run the gamewith around 60fps at medium graphic settings, (before most recent update, haveen't seen graphics overhaul yet). So basically just try to listen to the player base, people can wait for features to have a much better optimized game.

Positives:
+ Great to progress.
+ Excellent graphics.
+ Great for 4K.
+ Great for playing with friends.
+ Has an online mode with a lot of offical servers.
+ Has decent amount of maps.
+ Has lots of things to do.
+ Has so many dinosaurs.
+ Has its' mobile game too.
+ Game is realistic except the last parts of the game.
Negatives: 
- Very bad optimization.
- Takes so much space on drive.
- You need to wait hours and hours for hatching eggs and growing the dinos.

Really fun game, but this is no where near able to be considered out of early access. Constantly getting stuck in spots, and dinos alike along with having trouble moving around at times due to the really wonky fighting and building mechanics. The game feels so weightless, and you feel so disconnected from it, the fighting sucks dick, and all you do is just get pushed around or slammed off a cliff. 

Often feel like im not hitting things when I am, and it feels off at times to move, especially on dinos the movement feels clunky as all hell. And dont even get me started on how much power a high end clan can have. I may not have alot of hours, but I dont see the point of people able to move entire herds of dinos server to server, I can understand people moving, which is nice. But entire herds of base desroying dinos to just wipe a server? Come on, not to mention you can build to block off caves, and obelisks, and there are no restriction whatsoever on where you can build which feels very wrong to me which in all means that a big tribe can bully and take over the entire server. Thank god for the ability to transfter through loot crates otherwise hours of leveling would be gone. 

The AI as well? Oh my god the fucking AI, whoever did the AI for this game needs to be shot in the foot, or at the very least replaced. Its so dreadful, and agonizing to deal with trying to organize and call over your dinos or a pack just glitches into you and your stuck.

TL;DR - Really fun game, has so much potential, and so much to do. But it feels unfinished and very clunky. Along with the ability of server - to - server raid and blocking off resources makes it very irritating to play. They have not, and most likely will not optimize this game, fix the AI, and make all around QOL improvements.",1514652462,1596216737,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198055078437,229,54,7101,0,5831,1596228114

WIldcard constantly pumps out random unlabeled updates with no reason or info, just wait a day while this unknown source material is dumped in to your rig. They offer, and fail to deliver, random hype and then tone it down to ""what we meant to say is..."". I honestly can't recommend it. I have tons of hours due to commitment to my tribe/team etc and to the AGB servers I like so much. Every time they do a non scripted DL that just eats away at gaming time I repost a neg review until they get their $hit together and start to talk to the community like SUCCESSFUL game creators do.

WARNING: if you play this game you will have technical issues on your rig due to stress from improper, or missing, balancing of game optimization and operation protocols.
