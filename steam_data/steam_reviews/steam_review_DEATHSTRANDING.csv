0,DEATH STRANDING,75875591,english,"Death Stranding is quite literally a one of a kind game and is one of the best games I have played in recent memory.If you told me I would have a lot of fun delivering cargo to random strangers, I would tell you to pi55 off.

To give background on what this game is about,you play as Sam ""porter"" Bridges.He is a delivery porter that works for a reestablished government known as Bridges in a broken america,set years after an apocalyptic event took place which almost killed off all of humanity and now deadly entities roam the earth.These entities are called BTs.The whole objective of the game is to reconnect the last remnants of humanity and get it back on its feet while travelling all over the country and completing orders.That's all I can say for the story without spoiling it.

The game play is excellent and it didn't take long for me to get the hang of.At the beginning of the game,you will be doing a lot of walking and running to your destinations while having to figure out ways to cross difficult terrain and avoid or fight enemies.As you progress through the game,you will unlock blueprints and equipment that will allow you to travel around the world better compared to when you start the game.Equipment like ladders will allow you to cross rivers, scale cliffs and climbing anchors can be used to descend from high places.You get to use vehicles like the reverse trike and trucks that can get you to your destination quicker.You can also build structures like bridges,zip lines,roads and much more in the world that can be shared with other players which is where you and other porters will be helping each other out through out the game.You can like all these structures and equipment which gives likes to other players and they in turn can do the same for you as well which is there so you can show your appreciation for how helpful players have been in helping other players.I think this works very well and makes sense with what the game is about.Connecting with people!The game play doesn't focus too much on the fighting side of things so don't go in expecting the game to be a full on shooter because you will be left disappointed.You will get a handful of shooting sections but primarily,the core game play is travelling from A to B.

The visual representation of the game is absolutely stunning.The details on the characters,facial capture,weather effects and the landscapes really blew my mind..Every time I make a delivery,I always stop at some point and look at gorgeous vistas.It's just really peaceful and relaxing walking across scenery that looks close to real life.

The main characters and their stories are highly interesting and engaging where you are always learning something new about those characters as you are progressing the story.Heartman is definitely one of my favourites.Some of them ended up growing on me(Deadman).The actors did a fantastic job in playing their roles especially seeing the facial and motion capture in action making it feel very real and almost like watching a movie which is what Hideo Kojima was aiming for and he succeeded in doing so.

The musical score is excellent.The tracks that would play while travelling across the world added to the atmosphere and really fits the whole theme of the game especially when you're on your own doing your jobs as it felt very relaxing to listen to.As a whole, the music felt very soft and sad which captured the isolation of the player really well while there is no one around but you.I like the music player function while in the private room but I felt it was a huge oversight not to include it while you're out in the world.

As for bugs and crashes,I didn't have many problems on that side of things.I did get a crash from time to time but a recent nvidia driver update seemed to stop that from happening.Only glitches I can recall was being stuck on a climbing anchor on multiple occasions which prevented me from descending down and a BT boss got stuck on a wall while spazzing out which gave me a bit of a chuckle.All in all, glitches were minor.

Even though I've beaten the game,I'll probably still carry on playing it by finishing off standard orders and maxing connections on settlements.The game is so damn addictive that I can't stop and the reason it took me 140 hours to beat the story lol.Anyway,despite the game being a bit of a high price tag,I definitely got my moneys worth and think it's well worth playing.If you're like me and not too interested in combat gameplay,like travelling around the world,delivering cargo,soaking up mouth watering scenery and enjoy a great complicated story full of mind bending plot twists then buy it!I look forward to what Kojima Productions will have in store for the future.

2,DEATH STRANDING,76994188,english,"If there is a word that can sum up this game, it would be ""Inconsistent"". I honestly believe this is a game that you really have to try for once because there would be no other game that is this weird with a high budget behind it. I would also mention that I'm familiar with Kojima works, I've played MGS1, 2 ,3, Peace Walker, and V. With that said...

Death Stranding (DS) is a walking simulator. Not as a meme, but technically the best walking simulator. Most walking in video games have you walk straight to the point, but in DS, you have to avoid cliffs, pebbles, mud, etc. The nature is your enemy and you have to avoid and overcome it. Those little annoyances become trivial as you put effort and invest into the game. This result is a very rewarding end game that satisfies the whole gameplay loop and turns into efficiency runs. That sounds very boring, but sadly this is the game where you have to try it first and see if it clicks with you. It isn't a generic TPS, the movement is its own and people have to know that. It is very delicate, some say clunky but it would be because of the momentum behind YOUR movement. I can vouch that the ""on-foot"" control is really good, but the ""vehicle"" control is another whole beast that is just serviceable. Surprisingly the shooting mechanic is really solid, which rarely happens in the game.

DS ""story"" is very inconsistent. It has good meaningful quotes but also really stupid lines of dialogue. It has the best acting performance but also the most horrifyingly bad acting I have ever come across from ANY story telling medium. With that said however, I ended up loving the story. It is very unique and the fact that they actually mocaped the real actor is even better. I just wish the characters would shut up and talk less. Kujombo writing is like that, I'm not surprised. DS isn't the worst of Kojima, that would be MGS4. However, even with that background, I still think it is too much because of the sudden discrepancy of the quality.

However, the ""narrative"" of DS is supreme. Game narrative is the story of the gameplay and Kojima is always very good at this. Episode 1 to 3 are filled with excellent narrative that is akin to PT. It is filled with such expertly handled narrative that it peaks at the end. If you know about MGS3 ladder scene, this game has a similar one that is even miles better. So many gameplay elements are used to make the narrative works. It just shows how the game knows what you are feeling. It is just sad that the third quarter of this game was really lacking and felt like ignored. 

If there are things that DS excelled at, is the art department; Graphics, Ideas, Music, and Cinematography. They all are really damn good. Graphics is surprisingly really good and well optimized, it runs pretty well. The ideas like BT, BB, PCC (Online infrastructure), etc are all very unique, The music made the whole cutscenes hundred times better, they are so damn good at emphasizing what is going on. And the Cinematography is so miraculously detailed that you might miss some body language/details in your first playthrough. You can see the enormous effort they put into the game. With these points, I can totally say that it is really worth getting into the game. 

This review ends with ""DS is the most Kojima game"". I think he went out to be too arrogant with this game. I still screamed out internally what ever the f*ck he meant ""Strand-type"" of game. If he meant by the walking gameplay, that would be ""Simulator-type"". But if he meant the Social Aspect of it, yes that is really unique, but also have been done in ""Dark Souls-type"". However, there is one thing I know.

4,DEATH STRANDING,77053567,english,"Disclaimer: I am a Kojima fan and the Metal Gear Solid (MGS) games are some of my favorite, so I might be a bit biased.

With that said, I absolutely loved Death Stranding. I played the main story on PS4 at launch, and now I have 100%ed it on PC. It has in many ways nothing to do with MGS, while still at the same time having a lot in common. 

Death Stranding shines to players who are not looking for a traditional ""mainstream"" action/adventure/shooter game. There are boss battles, and third person shooting, even melee combat, but they are secondary to the main game flow which is much slower. It's a game that rewards patience, planning and teamwork - even though you are playing alone, you can interact with other players' structures and other things they leave behind, and vice-versa.

Getting through the harsh introductory sequence and starting to see and use other players structures, slowly improving your character to be more agile and strong, acquiring blueprints to a pretty big assortment of items, vehicles and structures, building a network of roads and other structures. It all leads to improving your ability to transverse the world, and it can be incredibly satisfying to the right audience.

WIth that said, the game is not without its faults. While for the most part it's quite pleasant to play, and the controls usually are pretty good, there can be some frustrating situations with the movement system, and particularly with vehicles, that result in damage to your cargo or even your character's death, especially when you try to rush things. Although you can and will learn to work with it, it can be twitchy and unresponsive at times.

Normally this wouldn't be a huge deal to me, but in a game that (imo successfully) explores the concept of making character movement a core of its gameplay, it can be quite frustrating when it does happen. The second major flaw is the action/shooter parts. If you care at all about this type of gameplay, I strongly suggest you try playing at the hardest difficulty, as only then it becomes at least a bit interesting. But for the most part the combat is fairly ""meh"", and the majority of boss fights are very straightforward and mostly behave in a very similar fashion - although there are some good ones by the end of the game!

The setting, characters and story are all very interesting, keeping you motivated and engaged with the game and its world. The pacing can be a bit off (I felt that the story was very back loaded, like most of it happened near the end), but ultimately it is worth it as it is quite interesting to slowly peel away the ""weirdness"" of it and unveil more about it, including some pretty interesting twists!

TL;DR: A true flawed gem that is not for everyone. It does so much so well, but falls short in some places that stop it from fully fullfiling its potential. Gameplay falls short of the brilliancy of MGS V, but on the other hand story and characters are a notch above it, providing an actually pretty solid and cohesive story with little to no loose ends by the end of it. This and the fact that it does an incredibly solid attempt of being unique and original, I believe, more than make up for its flaws and make it at least a ""must try"" for anyone that's willing to approach it with an open mind.",1601858143,1601858405,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,786,24,4429,1987,4429,1601856228,,

Over all an excellent game. You can tell that the developer put a lot of time into the game. The graphics are phenomenal, as are the sound, voice acting, and motion capture. Controls are a little sloppy, at least on mouse and keyboard. They feel...twitchy. Taking your time and putting in the effort to build up the Chiril Network will top you out at around 80-90 hours of game play, which for a game of this type is pretty good. My only real complaint about the game is that the end story, the last few chapters, just seem to drag on and on. You beat this boss and think ""Awesome boss fight complete, show me the final cut scene baby!"" and you're treated to another round of go here, kill this, rinse, repeat.

Wow! What an awesome game. It has some darker elements (like carrying a baby in a glass jar), so I can see this game being, not for everybody

Graphics are awesome in this game! If you have the hardware to run it. Wow! The game looks amazing and super realistic! It very enjoyable just be around and about

Now, the like and cooperation system is new generation! Super cool! You share map with other players and help each other win the game without ever meeting one. You can give likes and your stuff can be liked. This what made me come back to the game time and again, getting likes every time. Even the most mundane tasks are cool! Another thing is, this is a single player game, and I never felt that I was alone. I always felt like I am sharing this world with others, this is what Fallout 76 could look like if they done things right

Building system is novel! You can build and help other on the map, and other help you it too! You can ask for help and resources and share. Building degrade overtime, so if you are not taking care of them, more space is created for the new once, there is a upgrade in the game to slow degradation down to almost a halt, so you don't need to constantly rebuild things. Likes system goes really well with this, and again this is a single player game, and I never felt that I was alone! Just amazing!

Music is amazing! I normally don't care about music this much, but this game has some of the best music I ever heard. I would love to see them play live 

Finally, the story is not everybody's cup of tea, it's bold, it tackles understanding of the death itself! It's one of a kind full of mystery and make you think different. If you can't play the game, I recommend watching all the cutscenes. This story is deep

P.S. as for 100% achievements, this game is not bad.

23,DEATH STRANDING,76266437,english,"[b]TL;DR:[/b] Not for everyone, more slow-paced than many other AAA games, but if you enjoy a mellow game with a mystery story and a relatively low difficulty, this game might be deeply satisfying for you.

[h1]Spoiler warning[/h1]
I mention things that one gets / can do later in the game. While it is great to discover these things on your own, knowing about them can help quite a bit to enjoy the first few hours more, because you know it does get better and they serve more as a ""demo of hardships"" than fun gameplay.

[h1]Long version:[/h1]
(Note: This is 22 hours in, which according to things like HLTB is about [spoiler]halfway[/spoiler].)

I get that this is a polarizing game, and a lot of the criticisms are legitimate. At least for me personally, things were annoying at the beginning, but get thoroughly enjoyable later.

Let's start with the criciticms: The game starts quite slowly. You deliver things, and in the first area, it takes quite a while to go to places because you have to walk, you can't carry much weight, and you fall over almost hilariously fast. You have trouble getting around BTs. There is lots of backtracking, which is made more annoying because of the before-mentioned points. People talk about things without explaining what they are, and it is annoying because at a certain point things turn from mysterious to confusing (this is really bad in the prologue and continues for a fair amount of time later).

When I started out, about 5 hours in I thought ""what is the point of this game, it's just... tedious, and I'm not sure I'll keep playing this if it goes on like that"". Things get better one step at a time - you get [spoiler]a bike that can drive significantly faster than you can walk[/spoiler], you get more things to do [spoiler](build structures, hunt BTs, hunt MULEs)[/spoiler] and the ""moving from A to B"" part turns from tedium to fun because you're faster, get more possibilities and with [spoiler]vehicles[/spoiler], it turns into an actually fun gameplay mechanic: [spoiler]cross-terrain driving with vehicles - I make a game out of getting cargo trucks across terrain that they are definitely not meant to cross, and it's SO much fun[/spoiler].

At this point I'm having a blast with the many different things to do, exploring new terrain and unraveling the story. Difficulty-wise, the game is more of a walking simulator though - you can save anywhere as long as you're not in a fight, which means if you screw up you just reload. Time challenges are hilariously easy (you for example get 45 minutes, the delivery takes 5) but it still felt like ""oh I should hurry"" and the game holds your hand in terms of what you are supposed to do to the point of it being funny as well (whenever _anything_ new gets introduced, you get one of the characters explaining it to you). This is of course a weird contrast with the ""talking about story things without explaining them"" part, but it didn't bother me that much so far.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
While the game is a slow burn, I myself find it deeply rewarding and it slowly turned from tedium to fun between about 5 hours in and 8 hours in, and I've been glued to it ever since. For me personally, the hardships I had to go through in the first few hours make the customizable possibilities you later get to remove them just so much more rewarding. In a way, it's similar to the reward you get in souls-like games for practicing a boss or an area for a long time until you finally beat it, at which point it becomes effortless.

One thing that really annoys me though: The game is very progressive in terms of being able to pause and skip all cutscenes, but then in the end just goes out of its way to force you to watch the credits _twice_. First you get the ending interleaved and interrupted with unskippable credits - this would be bad enough on its own, but then the the same credits roll _again_ after the ending, for 15 minutes, unskippable, and in the end there is a short video that is important but plays automatically after the credits - if you walk away to let the credits roll (understandably), you just miss it completely. They really go out of their way to force you to watch credits and punish you if you don't. I paid for this game, stop forcing things on me this way.

It's basically a glorified walking simulator that tries REALLY hard to impress a melancholy atmosphere of loneliness and isolation upon the player but ends up being a kitschy, nonsensical mess. 

Let me explain: This is a Japanese game full of characters called Deadman or Die Hard Man screaming at you to restore America to its greatness again - quite earnestly too, as irony is not part of this game's narrative at all. And if that wasn't puzzling enough, the story is drip-fed to you through ham-fisted exposition-heavy monologues of said characters or emails drowning in Emoji: The apocalypse seems to have turned 50-something Americans into 13-year-olds. As for the garbled mess that tries to be a story: There are people calling it ""moving"" or ""meaningful"" in reviews. Well, you guys should really check out these things they call movies or books. You won't look back, trust me.

32,DEATH STRANDING,76943764,english,"First off, this game is a masterpiece. Maybe it's not for everyone, so here's a few thoughts:
 - The game is really about 50% movie, 40% package delivery, and 10% fighting monsters. I was fine with that mix, others may get bored if they're looking for more action.
 - The story overall is deep, mind-bending, and heart-wrenching. It starts dramatically, the middle has some lulls where it loses focus, but the last third starts to really pick up steam again and keep getting better until the very end. Throughout, it comes together from disjointed, out-of-sequence snippets, but in the end they're (almost) all brought together.
 - Visually, an amazing experience. Vivid green landscapes, barren wastelands, supernatural vortices, where it's easy to get lost in the experience of Kojima's world. And great performances from the cast all around.
 - The main storyline has some variety, but the side quests are just of a handful of basic deliver/fetch/recover types. I was enjoying just going around and delivering packages, just relaxing, and there's an abundance of side quests to go on. 
 - The social aspect is quite unique, and fit well into the setting. I'm not a social gamer, but you can interact with that portion of the game as little or as much as you'd like.
 - I played with an xbox controller, controls were flaky sometimes, sometimes pushing a button again to enter/exit a menu or vehicle. But only slightly annoying.",1601691964,1601692166,TRUE,0,0,0.497737527,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,196,3,5341,1075,5341,1601679603,,

Now onto the story... It's super cheesy and has a lot of cringe worthy moments, also there's one japanese voice actor (and also photos scanned) choice that it's just plain awful, she's terrible and the acting is super cringe worthy, the character also is awful, but what do you expect, it's Kojima, so expect dumb cringy names for the characters and areas as well. The story, although bad, it's pretty solid, by this I mean it's dumb but at least it has enough story and background on itself, same with characters and every detail in the game. You may like it, I didn't care much since it's dumb, but I appreciate it been solid.
Gameplaywise it's solid too, it's very niche so you may like it or hate it (reviews may show that already), but I liked it enough that kept me going. 
Kojima should hire good directors and people that can help him instead of doing everything himself, he's not a bad game designer, but it's definitely not a great one either, specially when catering to a western audience, he's too ""japanese"" lol.

43,DEATH STRANDING,76919591,english,"I've now finished the game and literally spent half a day simply sitting through the seemingly never-ending ending. This game is weird on so many levels. 

It's basically a hiking simulator on steroids. At so many points in the middle of ""the next important delivery"" I was wondering why I am even playing this game. The very core gameplay (walk from point A to B - and have a delivery on your back that makes the way as unenjoyable as possible, tumbling, losing packages, climbing objects, no stamina, having to rest every 20sec if you climb a hill etc.) is annoying by itself. The fighting isn't fun (because you always have something heavy on your back) and the BT encounters aren't either (they would be cool - if you didn't have something heavy on your back). Basically you'll hate this game for quite a lot of the experience. But then Kojima happens.

It's either the next tiny bit of story gets unveiled, or it's wandering across the most beautiful landscapes that you've ever seen in a videogame, or it's simply the visualization of every little detail in the game (the BT's, the cutscenes, exploring a new piece of the world..) that makes you continue playing. 

If you've played the MGS games, you'll immediately see and feel that this is a Kojima game. In all it's seriousness and dark story line, you'll still find Kojimas charme, humor and love to detail in every single second of the game. For example: I've basically only played the story to find out how the game ends and I have almost 45hrs playing. So this wont be over soon. 

It's a game that you really have to accept for what it is and if you manage to dive in - it becomes a unique experience. I can't compare it to anything else.

Make sure to be annoyed by the weird mechanics and simple gameplay. A lot.

But also - if you let it - this game introduces you to a whole new experience. A new world if you will.

At this point I am finished with the game. Now I am just killing time and seeing what else I can do. There may be spoilers in this review but I highly doubt it.

Normally I would do like a PROS / CONS but meh... I'm just going to point out things I find interesting, odd, or messed up.

- It is a VERY Japanese game. For anime and Japanese video game otakus you'll totally see what i'm talking about.
- You will shower a lot. Like ALOT. Well, unless you don't mind looking grimy.
- There's a lot of tar. Seriously. It's like the La Brea tar pits had a baby with the peat fields of Scotland...
- America after the voidouts* looks surprisingly like Iceland, is only a few hundred KMs from coast to coast (if that) and has something like less than 200K people in it.
* (Voidout - when a person is killed by a BT an explosion occurs.. something, something, antimatter, something)
- Eventually you can wear so much gold colored items that even ""Goldmember"" would be jealous.
- Sam REALLY dislikes physical contact and intimacy, he literally has aphenphosmphobia. Say that 5 times fast...
- You will see a lot of crying. Not that you'll cry, but that EVERY character with a cut scene WILL eventually cry.
- There are a LOT of cut scenes. If you skip them you will miss the story Hideo Kojima wove together and the story IS the game. Walking around and delivering cargo is just what Sam does. The story explains why he does it, it explains the world and why it is in this current state. There's a lot of dry theoretical suppositions posed by characters in the cut scenes. YAWN!
- The story told by the cut scenes are really long and painful in some instances! Everyone should just be given a digital novel when they purchase the game so that they can make the cut scenes like 85% shorter. Seriously.
- Single player game but you can interact with other players structures, signs and vehicles. Kojima calls it ""strands"" I believe.
- I don't really understand the ""likes"" system. Likes are a kind of social media currency that allows you to get better gear with the NPCs and allow you to level up in general. You can give other players likes. For example I can spam maybe 600 likes for another player's structure at a time if I button mash the 5 key well. I totally do not understand how the automatic likes are awarded though.
- Player built structures can be placed well or they can make you scratch your head. When combined with the likes they receive I am then left baffled. I OFTEN see ""land"" bridges that serve literally no purpose have 300K likes while a well placed zipline can have 0 likes.
- Every player built structure chews up ""chiral bandwidth"". This limits the amount of structures that can be placed on a map. If dimwits build a crap structure then too bad. You can delete the eyesore for your instance, but only yours and it has no positive impact on chiral bandwidth. It exists until it doesn't (deleted by the builder or decays).
- Fortunately and unfortunately structures eventually decay. Fortunate because the dimwits who placed a bazillion postboxes everywhere that usually serve no purpose will eventually disappear. Unfortunate because you may be the only one repairing the structures you built. I have repaired the structures of other players that serve me well.
- You can prolong the life of your structures by upgrading them with materials.
- You can get materials by raiding mule (NPC thieves basically) and terrorist camps. Each camp has a specific type of material they hoard. Each area of the map also randomly spawns containers of material. You can cash out materials at each settlement. Recycling found gear also helps.
- Decaying is caused by ""timefall"" rains. Wildly enough timefall ages everything it touches. The heavier the rain the faster stuff ages. Everything decays and becomes decrepit. Vehicles, containers, and gear just rust.
- Even though a container can rust away the contents will still be good. So don't fret if you look like you are carrying a junkyard on your back...
- Beached Things (BTs) - basically the souls of people trapped between the world of the living and the dead help spawn these timefall rains. The timefall is heaviest around BTs.
- In a BT area if you get detected and you don't ""kill"" a BT in time you'll see splashes of tar come after you. Best bet is to go back the way you came otherwise you will get caught by a tarry modern art sculpture and have to spam the ""V"" key while you slowly walk out of their radius... if not you get dragged a hundred meters away or so and have to fight something big or again, try to run away from it. BTs cannot completely kill you (neither can humans), you just go to a kind of purgatory, swim to your body and respawn covered in tar, blood and your gear scattered to the four winds.
- You detect BTs using your BB or ""Bridge Baby"". Basically an infant that is strapped to your abdomen. A BB is a baby who exists in the physical realm but whose spirit is on the other side (IIRC). They basically stay a baby forever and are treated like a tool vice a baby. Without a BB you cannot see BTs until they you are upon them and you have to do a quick fight or flight scenario. You can hear BTs somewhat, so that helps. BB's get worn out from detecting BTs so they need rest from time to time.
- You cannot truly be killed because you are a ""repatriate"", someone who has been to the other side and was brought back. Death at the hands of others basically has no meaning. Sam is just a bit different than others though as you'll find out.
- There are a few boss BT fights. They are not too bad once you get the hang of it. Other players who you've made connections with will appear as white figures in the tar, they'll call out to you and throw you gear that you can fight/heal with. It always helps to carry plenty of hematic grenades and blood bags.
- You want likes and help yourself/others? Build roads. They only exist in the central map but are REALLY helpful in spots. I have either solo built or heavily contributed to 31 road sections. I have gotten thousands of solid automatic likes from players and NPCs (I surmise) for the roads. If you want to move around fast but never get kudos for your efforts? Build a zipline network. I built 2 networks totaling 59 zipline stations with a total of 144 likes. Meh... at least I can cruise around the map crazy fast. Sometimes I wonder if people even know how to properly use the ziplines...
- Neat thing about the roads. They float with rubbery tar-like stalactites on the bottom - amazing.

57,DEATH STRANDING,76888442,english,"Death Stranding is... well... an incredible masterpiece. I went into it completely blind, knowing NOTHING about the story, setting or even gameplay. If you as well want to be surprised by gameplay elements, skip this review. I of course will not spoil the story. 

Anyway, at first the game starts off pretty slow and with some intriguing cutscenes. Honestly it does take a while to get into it and you need to persevere through the first few hours of the game because nothing will make sense. Even though you have no idea what's going on, the cinematography, graphics, and design are spot on. 

I was expecting a ""walking simulator"" with some topography challenges and 100% stealth. I was not prepared to start acquiring lots of cool gear that let me do crazy things like skate down a mountain on a hoverboard, ride a zip line, or make grenades from my own excrement. Vehicles are a thing (I had no idea) and after all the hours of walking it was a welcome change to plow through snow in a truck or fly over meadows on a bike. 

Things really started getting intense a few chapters in when suddenly I found myself experiencing COMBAT IN DEATH STRANDING! I was definitely thrown for a loop, especially because there are quite a few guns as well as non-lethal options, frag grenades, even armor. 

So, consider that you have long expeditions with hugely varied landscape to overcome, enemy humans, monsters, tons of varying gear you have to plan with, and many weapons as well, suddenly the game becomes huge and full of possibilities. Granted, the combat isn't always perfect and can sometimes be oddly unresponsive or janky. I got frustrated in some battles because Sam would grasp his backpack straps instead of ready his gun, for instance. But these are small annoyances. The game is oddly social as well with buildings you can like and interact with from other players, as well as signs or mushrooms sprouted from peeing. Yes, lol. 

All I can say is give this game a chance. Yes, it is weird. Yes, it is genre bending. Yes it can be tedious sometimes from a gameplay perspective. But it has all the quality of a movie combined with a very solid foundation of a game. It is extremely intense at times and may challenge the way you think about things (I know it did for me). It has many subtle and deep concepts that really make your brain think. As well as some just balls to the walls crazy action moments. The story is captivating and emotional. Towards the last few hours of the game I just didn't want it to end but couldn't stop playing/watching. 

Overall, I would 100% recommend this game. It is not perfect but even the greatest masterpieces have flaws, and in this case it's well worth the experience. I finished Death Stranding yesterday and can't stop thinking about it.

CONS :-(   Cannot actually see other players.

Unless you just get super lucky and start a new game with someone at the same time)   Also,  After a certain amount of gameplay the character enters a very snowy and mountainous area for a time before progressing,  and i myself got real tired of falling and damaging cargo, and moving slowly just to find out its too steep and have to hobble slowly around the mountain the other way.

65,DEATH STRANDING,76867715,english,"So after finally having an opportunity after almost a year after PS4 release date, I finally got my hands on the game.

First i will say that this game won´t be for everyone. I personally love this game, because i like slow and enjoyable games with breath taking environments. Tho if you buy the game you probably will kinda be bored in the first part of the game in the first location, but when you overcome it, it´ll be worth it ( that´s where the game really opens and starts being really great )

The story is amazing to the point i cried at the end ( please don´t watch any gameplay or trailers before you play the game, i watched the trailers again and it kinda ruined some parts for me because i kinda knew what will happen in the cutscenes )

I recommend you read some of the interviews in the game to get the full picture of things to fully understand the story.

This game entertained me with it´s gameplay from start to end beacuse it´s not just holding forward and walking, i was always thinking what path to take, where i won´t fall and so on. So the thinking about how to walk is entertaining for me.


Performance:
- i have a:
 - i5 - 4460 3.2 Ghz 
- GTX 960 4GB
 - 16 GB RAM

And this game is so well optimised that i was able to play at base PS4 settings and i was at 40 - 50 fps, sometimes 60 fps too. Tho in the first hours of the game when i entered the BT area i had huge fps drops which disappeared after a few second. Later in the game this didn´t happen at all.

Problems: 
- I encountered problems in cutscenes, when ever any cutscene would start that wasn´t pre rendered, the cutscene would 
  run under 30 fps, but when i pressed escape and resumed the cutscene the low fps was gone and it was 40 fps again, 
  which is kinda weird

but that´s about all the problems i encountered with performance. So if you´re scared you won´t run the game and you have similiar or higher specs then you´re in the golden.

So, if you like playing games that can be slow at times, sometimes dynamic with action and breath taking with its environment and you like interesting story, then this is a game for you. If you Don´t have patience and don´t enjoy at least slow gameplay, then i guess it won´t be for you.

Pluses:
+ incredible story ( from my point of view )
+ songs that play while you play make the mood incedible and all worth it
+ Incredible performance and optimization
+ Awesome and breath taking environment
+ fun gameplay (not for everyone tho)
- / + Better played with a controller but that is my opinion

Minuses:
- the UI for sorting cargo can be messy but after some time you get the hang of it
- Graphics settings aren´t really that much editable
- First location can be kinda boring / uninteresting

78,DEATH STRANDING,76824058,english,"Death Stranding. Which feels like Breath of fresh air, the mechanics of game already makes it a genre defining game. Obviously as a game with totally new Gameplay experience and story makes it unique, and its uniqueness comes with a fact that it may not be suited by everyone. Because of that there remain divisive of opinion about this game, some gamer found it to be one of the greatest game and enjoyed while others did not felt it to be that good.
Game is set in post-apocalyptic America where you are Sam porter who is delivery man, so basically our job is to make delivery from one location to other location and to do so by traversing harsh terrains and enemies. The world is visually appealing, the terrain is diversified and sci-fi setting of game made it very explorable and challenging.
As a Porter your job is to transport cargo and it raises many challenges to do that like Weather condition, Terrain it can be mountainous, snowy, river area and many more, other challenges are to manage cargo, tools we carry for our journey, cargo condition, its position, its impact and many other small details needs to keep track in order to make successful delivery. In short every delivery will come with its own set of challenges and to be successful deliverer proper planning and tools will require.Even with all the tools and techniques traversing with the help of no one game will feels tedious and may become unenjoyble.
But as you traverse this world you will realize that there is more to it than that, where comes the support of other players, when you find sometimes that items you needed in certain area like stairs to cross a river , climbing anchors, are left by other players in the worlds and it is being shared by other players. That’s where we realize that games challenges can be overcome with the help of other players and we can also help other players by doing so. for example major buildings like highway require so much materials to build that it will become very tedious task, but since the structure is being shared by other players so with the contribution of materials by other players, highway can be constructed easily. Also with the construction of such structure, the harshness terrain of game become easily traversable.
And that’s the main vision of that game where there is cooperation among players in order to make such a difficult journey easier. At the end you realises that you are not alone in this post-apocalyptic harsh world.
Visually the game environments feels very amazing, also environment transition from place to place and as we encounter BTs feels very natural and good, also as we travel across game many soundtracks are played which suits the ambience of environment perfectly.
Story is so satisfying and mind blowing that after the ending you will keep wonder about it for few days. All the questions that we will have during game is perfectly revealed throughout game. All the Sci-fi concepts implemented in this game are very interesting and logically satisfying. Characters that we encounter in game are also unique and their own personalities.
Enemies that we encounter may feel repetitive and easy after some time, since hideo kojima wanted to make a game that will not have any violence, so enemies encounter may not be the main focus of this game. Also killing is as much as possible not allowed in game ,we can knock out enemies with non-lethal weapons and if we kill enemies there are more chances of BTs appearing in game.BT encounter also feel satisfying at first but they will become repetitive because of lack of varieties.
Death Stranding is a game that if you like it then most probably you will love it.

1,DEATH STRANDING,72718641,english,"Dislaimer: I've finished this game on PS4 Pro when it came out. Currently I'm happily replaying it on a superior platform.

This game is a breath of fresh air among many 3rd person shooter type of AAA games. It brings in new gameplay mechanics which aren't useless and actually fun to play with. The main difference from other mainstream games here is controlling you character's center of balance. When you're on foot and have lots of stuff on you you have to control the balance constantly because you don't want to fall and damage the goods or loose them. Whether you like it or not it's a unique gameplay mechanic, it works and it wasn't annoying for me.

In this game you have a lot of tools to choose from and what to use. You can't bring everything with you so you have to manage your equipment accordingly to the path you chose. Sometimes it's better to be on foot with exoskeleton equipped, sometimes it makes sense to drive a truck which can hold lots of cargo in it etc. Gathered (or bought) resources can be spent on building different things anywhere you want, from recharge stations or a cargo storages to roads and private bunkers.

If you reach a place on a map where people live and do couple of quests for them the region around that place will become connected to other player's games. This mechanic allows and encourages sharing whatever you build with other players. The sharing mechanic is made in such a way that it won't spam shared things around you, it does it in a very decent way so the world you're playing in is still playable. So in this game you kind of have to go everywhere first by yourself and then you'll get the other player's stuff.

Also this game has some episodes with just generic shooting arenas in it. They aren't bad but they are nothing special gameplay wise. You can shoot not only lethal weapons but also non-lethal, in fact the game encourages you to be non-lethal. I believe I finished my playthrough without killing anybody and it was fun. You can try stealth and it works but it's nothing special.

The story is surprisingly interesting and makes sense so I was captivated by it until the end. 

TLDR: Unique gameplay mechanics mixed with generic mechanics. Story is interesting until the end.",1594798432,1601369193,TRUE,1,0,0.520958066,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,2468,9,2086,160,2086,1601123124,,

3,DEATH STRANDING,76747018,english,"Liked: Very immersive, peaceful, relaxing. Almost meditative. Well it IS meditative, but then there are action elements, and the story.
Started to remember every rock and pathway. Started remembeing where to cross the streams and how to climb, run, and just stand properly. It's called learning. Learning the game. The world. The environment.
Leave your home now and go for a walk. Notice who put that tree, rock, path there? That's outside your home. Now go into Death Stranding. Feel it.
Sure you can speed-run, and min-max everything. And then how would you be enjoying it?
No - just walk/climb to the top of a mountain and just stand there and breath it in.
Good voice acting AND character representations of real actors. the character CGI is amazing. They have mannerisms and real-world physics on bodies and faces.
Disliked: hard to describe to other people - what sort of game is it? Hard to say. Very expensive for a walking sim, or a photo taking sim, or a courier A to B sim. But then the game is MORE than the sum of its parts.
Long load times. Look, I get it. The game is massive and there is a lot to pack in on disk that has to load. But once the game is going then the other loads are bearable.
Some video sequences are repetitive, and you can skip them, but then skipping them becomes repetitive. I suggest to appreciate the work that has gone into it.
See that rock. Someone put that there. It wasn't procedural or random. No. I real person looked at it and thought about that rock. and a bajillion other rocks. And put them all there.
How about that river? Yeah. Same.
And why can't I get up that cliff? Think about it. Take your time. Maybe you weren't meant to, but then maybe you can. Find a way. Enjoy FINDING the way.
I recommend it for anyone with a deep pocket and plenty of time to enjoy it. Don't rush this game. Experience it. Relax with it. Feel the angst and plight of the characters.

The game gets into your head and under your skin and you just want to keep playing.

The idea of being a glorified post-apocalyptic postman seems like it would be boring but it's not. Getting your rating up with each of the preppers to get better gear and even just stars is a ton of fun. Chipping in with other players, who you never see in-game other than the structures they build, builds a weird sense of community within isolation. At times, for example, when your motorcycle is about to run out of power and you see someone has built a charging station there's a feeling of calm and happiness.

The graphics are gorgeous. The keyboard controls are a bit wonky. Hint: you can save the game just by sitting down rather than going through all of the convoluted menus to find ""Save.""

1.) Don't worry about grinding deliveries for reputation until you get access to a truck.

2.) Don't bother building a road in a region that's off the chiral network. You'll need a lot more resources without other players chipping in.

3.) If a delivery doesn't go well, don't sweat it. Ranks don't really matter all that much and almost every delivery can be repeated. Cargo condition doesn't affect rank as much as you might think unless the order states otherwise. You can always save scum, but losing rank is such a small setback that it's often times not worth the headache unless you're going for Legend of Legends of Legends on every standard order and won't lose much time.

Gameplay overall I also enjoyed 

The thing about this game is mostly cutscenes, you get from point A to point B and there's a cutscene , there are times where the hologram talks to you instead of just giving you a cutscene and that's good. 

Also this isn't a game where you can watch and find interesting, you need to play it for yourself and experience it because watching it on YouTube or any other platform will be boring. And from a personal experience with the game , I enjoyed playing it.

31,DEATH STRANDING,76678856,english,"Great game that is really driven by the story and the incredibly rich character development. Game play is hit and miss, and can range from quite a bit of fun to genuinely bland and irritating from time to time. In general though the real draw to this game is the story, which is genuinely unique and deep enough to leave plenty of room for your own interpretations by the final acts. Kojima's oddness is everywhere, but I didn't find it nearly as distracting or convoluted as the Metal Gear series. 

There were a few times where I felt myself losing interest in the game, as the game play does tend to get a little repetitive and stale at times. The key to enjoying the game (for me at least) was to limit the use of vehicles which are not only horribly clunky and very difficult to navigate with, but also tend to really smooth over the subtle moments that really make the game unique. Using all of the tools available to Sam and sometimes choosing to avoid the paths of least resistance really make for a better experience. At least that was my experience.

Overall a really great game, and one I will probably remember for a very long time.

The game is about marking a destination, planning a route and surveying the challenges ahead - then setting off on a journey, prepared but alert to the fact that you can't prepare for everything. This is life itself - it's school, it's work, it's getting into shape, it's learning to write a symphony - it's anything worth doing.

Thematically the story beautifully builds on these ideas - Why must Sam push himself to exhaustion? Sam learns that he must do his job, because tiresome and hopeless as it may seem, it brings people together - linking people creates hopes, new life - it is divinity. As someone facing challenges of my own, preparing, setting off, stumbling, getting up again, all of this shook me to my core.

I feel that Sam is represents Kojima-san. A man with a legendary reputation - a reputation that comes with the burden of huge expectations from society.

The first 10 hours or so, prior to Episode 3, is really slow.  I was having fun but couldn't shed the feeling whether there's more.  I'm glad I listened to what everyone said, ""Rush to chapter 3 and the game's world will open up"".  Oh my, the game really transformed to another level for me after Episode 3.  It was at this point that the game got to the Skyrim-level of epicness for me, and the sense of exploration and loneliness is unmatched.  The story, including both the main and side missions, also started to shine at this point.  So if you bought the game but found it slow/boring, try to stick with it till Episode 3.

The point of the game is indeed exploration, delivery of cargo and also building. Major part of the later game is the deliveries that will allow you to build structures that will make traveling within the world easier than before. 

If you can find satisfaction in that only then is this game a good choice for you. For me this loop of  exploring/delivering, finding safe paths to take, conquering tough new terrain and then taming it with structures and technology was amazingly enjoyable. You are feeling like a pioneer at first and a builder secondly when you can traverse safely and quickly places that the first time were incredibly difficult and dangerous.  It definitely gives a feeling of accomplishment. And the are some actiony 3rd person shooter parts as well to break the monotony, although depending on how you play they are not very common. 

On the other parts the game visually and technically is stellar. And the Story is typical Kojima. Have to admit kinda more structured and easier to follow than his MGS stories. Great voice acting and very very imaginative lore concepts. Confusing at first but as more information is given everything at least feels consistent and make sense (have not finished the story yet though but until now this is how it seems to me).

If you want to be completely immersed into another world of beauty and enjoyment; if you want to escape, then give this game a try. I played the game halfway through on the PS4, then started from the beginning on a high-end gaming PC once Death Stranding was released on PC. The first few times I played Death Stranding on a high-end gaming PC following my PS4 Death Stranding experience, I was at awe at the beauty. The detail is amazing. The lessons learned during my time investment on the PS4, made game play even better the second go on the PC.

The game part of the game is basically warlking around with a bunch of boxes. While this sound pretty boring at first, the game does an amazing job at this. The world is very beautiful and well done. It is also pretty darn scary place (don't mistake this for a horror game though - ""jump scares"" are kept to an minimum - you generally have some idea what you're about to walk into once you get a feel for the world). And the pretty good balance mechanics in the game actually make it so walking isn't as straight forward as it sounds.

        [th]What I have reviewed[/th]
        [th]What conclusion I reached[/th]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td][b]Immersion/Game World/Story[/b][/td]
        [td]Death Stranding is about the daily life after a psychic, destructive event that has completely turned our world upside down in the near future. The circumstances of this catastrophe remain barely comprehensible until the very end, but the consequences are clearly felt everywhere: the world order is gone, almost the entire human race fell victim to the event and the survivors withdrew to self-sufficient cities.

This retreat is necessary, because the outside world is harsh and every infrastructure is gone. Ghostly beings, the so-called BTs, which can only be made visible with the help of babies in portable tanks, attack anyone who makes too much noise. Falling time rain makes wet people age in seconds and postmen addicted to deliveries attack anyone carrying packages.

As Sam Porter Bridges, played by Norman Reedus, we are a legendary messenger and deliver our freight. In the end it is the messengers of services like Bridges, Fragile and Co. who keep the last remnants of civilization alive by bringing things like food or medicine to those who need it. But the Bridges Group, under President Bridget, is planning the reunification of the former USA. Under the banner of the UCA (United Cities of America), we are being asked to connect the last cities with each other through a new network technology.

This initial situation ultimately forms the basis for the previously mysterious gameplay of Death Stranding: the game is a single, giant fetch quest.
[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td][b]Gameplay[/b][/td]
        [td]So we deliver packages and it's quite possible that the gameplay aspects of Death Stranding remained a mystery for so long back then because the gameplay - admittedly - sounds rather boring at first. But it's not, because Kojima is doing everything he can to make these packaged deliveries as complex, challenging and varied as possible. With success.

Because although we always have to walk, climb and stumble from A to B, it is not just a simple delivery order. There are countless things that we have to consider and prepare so that the arduous journey to our destination is made easier or even possible in the first place. This already starts with the cargo itself.

Sam has no conventional inventory system in which our equipment simply disappears invisibly. Every single item is worn visibly: on the back, attached to the suit or even in the hand - and that becomes a lot very quickly. Usually the packages pile up on our backs and we drag ourselves through the inhospitable, impassable terrain. With every step the delivery swings back and forth and we have to keep our balance at the push of a button or we fall painfully to the ground.

The latter not only damages the cargo, but also makes our Bridge Baby cry, which we have to keep happy, however, to be able to detect lurking danger from GDs.

On the way to the delivery destination, new parcels that have been lost on other deliveries can always be found. So if there is still space, we can take extra freight with us if we are on the way. But it can be worthwhile picking up the parcels, because on the way there are smaller mailboxes where we can unload lost freight - albeit with a reduction in the reward.

Once we arrive at our destination, our delivery is then evaluated according to various criteria. Did we take the direct route or did we dawdle? Is the freight damaged or even broken? And then the reward follows through ""Likes"" - the experience points of Death Stranding. The better the customers like our work, the more Likes we get and the better we get at our job. This way we can gradually carry more weight and keep our endurance longer.

Afterwards we can take a little breather in private rooms, which can be found in every bigger city. These rooms are always located in delivery centres that all look the same; unfortunately we are not allowed to enter the cities themselves. The fact that we are locked out of such important places seems a bit disappointing and makes the beautiful world of Death Stranding more monotonous than it should be.

If you fear that there is no action in Death Stranding, you can rest assured. It's not only nature that stands in our way, there are also enemies to fight. The creepy BTs and the aggressive MULEs each have their own designated areas and sometimes we just have to go through them. However, we are almost always in a defensive position here, because our goal is not to challenge a fight, but to protect ourselves and our cargo.

There are also weapons in Death Stranding, but they are only added after about 15 to 20 hours of play - so for now we are dependent on stealth and our fists. Especially when it comes to the MULEs. This loose band of mad messengers is only interested in stealing our cargo, so they patrol certain areas and alert each other when they discover loot. In the high grass we can escape the glances, a regularly used scanner finds us at the beginning of the game almost every time. Then it's either flee or fight.

        [td][b]Tech[/b][/td]
        [td]First of all: Death Stranding already runs with a GTX 1050 in Full HD with absolutely fluid 60 frames per second, which is probably due to the relatively modest engine. In addition, the game uses DLSS 2.0 technology, which takes anti-aliasing to a new level and provides much more sharpness, especially in the small details. (My GPUs: 2 x RTX 2080Ti)

But for this you need a graphics card of the RTX series from NVIDIA. Despite the graphics, strange animation glitches still occur in some places. For example, if we climb up a steep rock, Sam likes to get stuck in the landscape or jerks around on the edges.
[/td]
    [/tr]
 [tr]
        [td][b]Conclusion[/b][/td]
        [td]I wasn't sure what to think about the game, until I played it. The story is pretty weird, the gameplay beyond the brute action I usually appreciate and guess what happens most of the time during your delivery? Nothing. 
		
		However, the strong focus on inventory management, the many ways to get around and the complex effects of indirect multiplayer have completely taken me away from my personal life for hours now. Every delivery was its own little adventure and every time there was this deep satisfaction as I made my way through the world.

This also requires a little patience, because the ways can be long and getting lost is not unlikely - if then unexpectedly BTs appear or suddenly MULEs give me a good beating ... it can sometimes be quite frustrating. The will and the staying power to accept the new situation are then particularly important.

These are the core competencies of Sam Porter, who is actually more of a boyscout and mountaineer than a normal postman. The more parcels you deliver, the bigger, the more fantastic, the weirder Death Stranding becomes. Don't be intimidated by the strange concept of the game at the start, the story behind Hideo Kojima's latest project holds many moments for which it is more than worthwhile to mobilize the last reserves and continue. Step by step.

And hey: Norman Reedus

89,DEATH STRANDING,73020689,english,"Fantastic game, loved the whole thing. People that have dismissed this game as a ""walking simulator"" are missing out on one of the best game of the last decade. It does simulate walking with more game mechanics than likely any game before, but this is not a bad thing. It makes travelling and traversal a core element of gameplay. This allows for a much more engaging open world in much the same way being able to climb anything did for Zelda BotW. Of course you will not spend the whole game on foot either, far from it. You get access to vehicles and can build roads and other mid game structures to aid you in traversing and surviving your journey. There is also combat with multiple weapon types and other assorted gadgets. If you have played Metal Gear you should get an idea what to expect, but also know that while there is combat and it is really cool and interesting to learn how to fight the non human enemies, combat is not a main focus of the gameplay. The shared world aspect is also a standout adding a lot of encouragement and seemed to often provide a structure in the right place to help you out, all provided by other players. Structures you build may also show up in other players games to help them and the game lets you know who has used your stuff and vice versa through a social point system. I really enjoyed the story, it is plainly just great science fiction through and through. It's creative, It has a lot of mystery, some suspense, it's engaging. It take's it's time getting to the meat and bones of what is going on but I also spent a good chunk of time in the mid game building, delivering and not progressing the story. Had I not done that I'm sure the pacing would have been great. That said, they really bring it all together in the end. The conclusion felt satisfying and I never felt the big questions I had the whole game were unanswered. A true masterclass in storytelling from Kojima. I highly recommend this game to anyone that loves good sci-fi and can enjoy a game that isn't always about killing everything that's in front of you. The challenge of a difficult journey and helping others along the way does actually make for a damn fine video game and one that deserves more acknowledgement than what it got.",1595281166,1600999370,TRUE,0,0,0.504010677,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,159,1,5559,69,5544,1601398343,,
90,DEATH STRANDING,76511558,english,"I truly loved this game. It's an experience that sticks with you. It's a bizarre narrative on inevitability that doesn't come off as preachy or obnoxious. But, the spreading of hope and a possible future to a collapsed society feels rewarding in both gameplay and narrative. This game is not a game to just pick up and play in a casual sense. The gameplay itself could be a deterrent for a lot of people. The game gets arduous and very frustrating at times. Some occasions feel unfair but they also tend to be short lived. I love hiking and this gameplay actually appeals to me for multiple reasons but it still definitely gets tedious at times. I am a big fan of Kojima games so I may be bias (Ignore the multiple collectors items on my desk from years of collecting.) 

As for my conclusion, This game is best viewed as an experience than as a game. Sure it has scoring, progression, combat, upgrades, and customization, but that isn't what you will be thinking about after finishing the game. Beautiful visuals, killer soundtrack, and compelling story telling that makes the absolutely bizarre seem commonplace makes for something that is truly unique.

93,DEATH STRANDING,76507105,english,"This game does its themes better through gameplay than Kojima's typically weird writing style. The feeling of comradery you have with other players was more compelling than any of the characters in this game. I think Kojima's a better idea guy than a writer, and you can see that in the themes and gameplay. If you want a deep and engrossing story, you should probably look elsewhere. Most cutscenes either had me laughing my ass off or cringing from how strange it felt. I think Norman Reedo does a pretty good job, and I think Mads Mikkelsen did a FANTASTIC job, but there wasn't enough of the two here to justify a glowing review.  

People HATE the gameplay of this game but I went into it knowing i'd like it, and I did. You pick gear, walk to a place, rinse and repeat. Sometimes your enemy is the environment, sometimes it's dudes with pointy sticks or guns, and sometimes it's spooky flying ghosts. The enemies get stale by the end of the game, but they serve their purpose well. I think the game shines more when you're hiking alone in your thoughts, but that's what a lot of people disliked so maybe I'm crazy. More games should require preparation as part of their gameplay loop, and I felt this game really did a good job of making you stop and think about your next move. Sure- you CAN just pack everything under the sun and trek off to your next destination, but don't be surprised when you get really frustrated from tipping over for the fourth time. My only complaint gameplay wise is that it could've pushed this idea further. 

TL;DR: Story sucks, but the themes of connection shine through in the multiplayer feature. Gameplay is mostly you walking and planning your route, so don't expect the combat to be fleshed out like MGS games. If this sounds awesome to you, you'll probably like it. if not, I'd suggest doing more research or staying away.",1600990931,1600990931,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,438,23,2986,0,2986,1596493094,,

16,DEATH STRANDING,76214789,english,"[i](The review is completely spoiler-free.)[/i]

[h3]I appreciate it, but wouldn't actively recommend. 👍🤔[/h3]

It’s a kind of experience that you just don’t go around encouraging people to play, because it’s not [i]pleasant[/i] in the way games usually are, and will not appeal to majority. I think [b]you need to know you want it[/b] before you go in. I know what [i]I[/i] wanted - a Hideo Kojima Game about death. 🐋 Worked out just partially… But I don’t regret it. ❤

In order to appreciate it you need to pay attention and be willing to seek the satisfaction from playing in areas [b]other than instant dopamine spikes[/b] that recent games (especially mobile) conditioned us to. It’s rather difficult to digest. That’s why you might not be willing to invest money and time into it. It is however a fantastic treat for those who analyse game design, art, symbolism and are generally more appreciative than judging.

[i]Death Stranding[/i] is a very convoluted sci-fi thriller story wrapped in mechanics of terrain traversal, pathfinding, sightseeing, a bit of stealth, some shooting, and last but not least - appreciation. 🙏 But let’s ask the right question:

[b]Is this something that I should buy and play?[/b] 💦

The game has a AAA price tag. It is fairly long, especially if you're taking your time - I've heard people finish it in 30 hours, but I personally took like 110 hours to finish it to the credits - that’s cause I enjoyed my stay. 😄

[b]Is it well-spent time?[/b]

If you're in for the story... I'm afraid you'd be disappointed. 💀 In my opinion, this aspect could have been so much better. I think it's Kojima's unedited writing who's to blame. The pacing, dialogues, digestibility, conclusion - all are crippled in some way. And I say it with pity, because I’d love this game to be a masterpiece, because it has all the potential, but unfortunately just doesn’t deliver (hehe). 😢 So if you’re interested in the story - you could watch a “film” version of gameplay on YouTube; be advised however that quite a lot of lore is exposed via completely optional text “interviews” and emails, so you might be even more confused by the mechanics of the world. But then again, these could also probably be found on the net. [b]But but but! But there’s a reason this game is not a film[/b]. 🤔 Because it would suck as one. 😄 Honestly if this was a film or a series, it would be a 5/10 mess for me by cinematography standards. This is a [b][i]game[/i][/b] experience, there’s so much more to it than the story and storytelling, that I’d argue that the story isn’t even the biggest or most important aspect.

If you’re in for the gameplay… It’s been said a thousand times and the game is even marketed as [i]genre-defying[/i]. The majority of it is preparation for a trip, planning your route, checking out with cargo to be delivered and departure. Your enemies are slippery and rough terrain, the caustic rain that puts time pressure on you, the very few people that are still present on the surface and would very much like to come into possession of your belongings, and the ghosts of the dead who want to take you to the other side. So at least it’s a nice mix.

You probably have heard the “walking simulator” critique. It’s ironic how valid it is, and how it’s mostly meant to be [b]negative[/b], whereas I think it’s absolutely great. ❤ I’m not sure if people who found that as a downside have ever been on a mountain hike. For the first time in a video game I’ve experienced the lifelike difficulty of going down a hill with tens of kilograms of weight on my back. 💦 [b]It really does simulate walking[/b]. You can trip over inconspicuous rocks. You will regret not controlling your momentum. 🐋 And it’s not meant to be [i]pleasant[/i] if you think effortlessly traversing from point A to B is what’s [i]pleasant[/i]. That’s what I was writing about earlier - [b]if you value the [i]process[/i] over the [i]result[/i][/b] (which, by the way, I think is the healthy thing to do in life), if you find reward in the challenge - then this game might be for you.

The game tries to stay fresh for the tens of hours by gradually introducing new means of transportation, survival tools, weapons of defense and offense. There are a few biomes of environment, so it also freshens things up as you arrive in a new one.

I think many things that people find offensively “bad” have been intentional decisions in design. The game wants you to feel accomplished by first dragging you through hell and later putting it in contrast to how easy things are after you put the pioneer’s effort in building the infrastructure.

If you’re in for the experience… [b]It’s absolutely unique.[/b] You hike mountains, you ride motorcycles. There’s this ethereal feeling of isolation in freedom, as you’re on your solitary journey through the world so empty and rather unwelcoming, but one that can take you by surprise with its beautiful vistas. And yet at the same time you also feel connected to the other human players by the unprecedented [b]strands system[/b]. The footsteps you leave can be seen by other players. The paths you tread will be shared with others - hell you even contribute to treading out the grass that grows along them. Together with other players you will collaborate in creating the useful infrastructure of roads and other facilities that help you (and them!) on your way. And many, many more aspects that are state-of-the-art game design. ❤

It’s a story about connections. What is it trying to tell? To compliment people for their effort? To treat children with dignity? To find beauty in small things around you? That touch is necessary for you to be a healthy human? To be considerate and caring? That there’s salvation in mundane repetitive tasks of everyday and nihilism is not the way? With a bit of imagination and determination, you will find a lot of beautiful symbolic meaning in the story, about the connections you make with others throughout your life.

The one thing that’s [b]absolutely masterful[/b] and [b]couldn’t have been better[/b] in my opinion - is music. Kojima is known for having a taste in music and apart from the flawless score by Ludvig Forssell that perfectly emphasises on the dreamlike, mysterious atmosphere of electronic future that clashes with scientifically-tangible afterlife, the game is filled with commercial music that [b]was not[/b] specifically created for the game (apart from several pieces that [i]actually were[/i]), but effectively not only fits, contributes to and enriches, but even expands the experience. [b]Low Roar[/b], who’s the artist most exposed in the soundtrack, was such a discovery for me that I almost immediately went and bought the “Songs from Death Stranding” CD album (along with the actual OST) which features their best pieces. 👍👍👍👍👍 The songs reflect the game so perfectly - in lyrics, in timbre - it’s hard to believe they weren’t written specifically for it. (Actually I think they might have contributed heavily as inspiration.) The music, which I can listen to while driving or working, has effectively expanded my game experience onto the real world.

Is it worth it?

I have to admire and appreciate how Kojima approached the design of this one. He spoke in interviews that he wanted people to take something from this game that they could apply in their lives. And it’s absolutely great. Actually, I think it’s what art is for, and games can be art (apart from entertainment, which serves a different purpose). What I’m trying to say is that you might not need this game - you might already know what it tries to teach. 😄💦 But then again, even if you already know these principles it's good to refresh them from time to time. Especially in times of enforced isolation it's nice to play a game about being connected.

It is definitely a game you will either love or hate, and I think that's largely due to how unusual it's gameplay/story is. But I don't think that the term ""walking simulator"" is entirely accurate for describing this game, as it may give the idea that it is like other games which are often described as that. 

DayZ always comes to mind when I think of the majority of gameplay largely being a ""walking simulator"", but that feeling of being bored or the discomfort that brings was something I never experienced in Death Stranding. I think this largely comes from the fact that travel in a game like DayZ is consistently a perceived hinderance in the players mind, or an obstacle in the way of the true gameplay that your're just enduring to try to reach. Even though Death Stranding can invoke similar frustrations at times, the game shines in its ability to actually make it fun and satisfying to travel the world. The exploration/""walking"" isn't a separate entity from the gameplay, but rather a well thought out, ingrained part of it that keeps you immersed - rather than another means to an end.

The beauty of the world and the graphics that back it up make it invoke feelings similar to hiking at times, and the gratification/rewards from accomplishing deliveries is executed extremely well. The story has great moments but also noticeably bad ones, but is gripping enough to keep me interested and striving to understand more on the more outlandish aspects of it. I would say that getting my first vehicle was the point that cemented my liking of the game, as it washed away many worries or uncertainties I had about how long my appeal for the gameplay would last in the long run, and I feel that is a good point for players to push to before giving up on the game. (Also, if you're a completionist type of player like me, this game is amazing in making that feel extremely satisfying)

Once again, this game is definitely not for everyone. I was extremely hesitant myself on buying it, since most games others say are relaxing but fun rarely have done the same for me. Luckily It turned out to be a game I love, but that uncertainty of what side of the coin you'll be on for loving or hating it (combined with the actual meat of its gameplay experience coming in after the max amount of time allowed to be played to refund) makes it somewhat risky to buy at it's price tag. I think it is an outstanding and amazing game, and if you share in the worries I had about the gameplay before playing, as well as know going in this isn't a typical action packed AAA game, then I think you might be on the side of loving it like I do and thoroughly enjoy your experience.

I have never played a Kojima game before, I had never understood the hype around the designer. I was originally skeptical of this game, often labelled a walking SIM. However after playing death stranding I reject this idea. Playing Death Stranding has been one of the best experiences I've had in gaming period. Kojima's creativity and imagination is what fuels this amazing game, the design and details across the whole game from the basic 3D printed models found in your private room to the complexity of DOOMS and BBs. It all works, and to put it in plain English, is cool as f**k.

I must admit the gameplay is not for everyone and perhaps the weakest point of the game. The combat is somewhat lack-luster and the balance physics system can often be frustrating. However, there is still an action packed experience and a lot of fun and enjoyment in slugging deliveries across an apocalyptic America.

The narrative is deeply intriguing, interacting with a wide variety of core characters all who are dynamic and profoundly interesting in their own right. Who themselves are woven into the beautiful cinematics and experiences across America's various landscapes and settings. This is complemented further by the various dimensions or beaches which create a rich, surreal, dystopian atmosphere like no other.

Death Stranding also presents a reflection of modern society's fragmentation and political climate. Kojima contrasts these ideas present in the narrative further through the core gameplay with likes and shared structures amongst fellow porters.

The soundtrack of Death Stranding is stellar. Expertly curated and composed sparking various emotions and thoughts. With well placed triggers throughout the game as well as the ability to relax in your own private room to said soundtrack. This is how music in gaming should be done.

1. Expectations. This is not a 3rd person shooter. Do not expect constant action. While it is true, a lot of time is spent walking/traveling, there are compelling systems in place to make it interesting. There is shooting and stealth as well, but it is not the main attraction (despite being quite good).

2. It is a Hideo Kojima game. There is story. Lots of story. [i] Story. [/i] There are tons of cutscenes, and everything about the story is original. Its weird, its easy to get lost in, but ultimately very good. If you are a fan of Kojima's stories, you probably have already played this, but if not, you definitely should.

3. Its long. There is a lot of game, and it takes a while just to get through the story. There is also quite a bit of end game content if you really enjoy the gameplay. However, I don't think you are missing anything important by skipping side missions and end game content.

4. It is unique and original. I love when AAA titles try new things. Everything about this game is trying something new.

I decided to give Death Stranding a try and play it all the way through to see what the hype was about. Mainly due to the fact that, like the memes would suggest, it looks and feels like FedEx package Delivery simulator. 

Sadly that isnt true at all. At least FedEx Delivery people get to see some landscape variety, and see a bit of color during their day. 

Death Stranding is a game about moving random nonsense from Point A to Point B. And somewhere in between Edgy Character Number 6 spoon feeds you some reason why it matters. Really its like a lot of Kojima titles. It feels like it was written and designed by that Edge Lord kid you used to make fun of back in highschool, and most of the characters personalities read about the same. Really flowery lengthy philosophical nothing burgers abound in every single dialogue. 

You play as Norman Reedus. Literally just the same version of himself from the Walking Dead nearly. Who is about as warm and personable as a bag of rocks you dont want to hug because their pointy. For some reason you have a relationship with the president. Who dies in your arms during the first hour long cutscene that is the start of the game. and now you have to walk across the country alone.... for ""Reasons"". 

Gameplay is as follows. 

Boring Terrain -> Cross with your Package -> Deliver it really fast. Oh and dont take too long. Because the rain is time travel rain and makes it degrade really fast. Cus ""Dead Things or Something""

Rinse. Repeat. BUT WAIT! You can now build an object you can deliver things too. In order to build a bridge. To cross a stream. So you can then deliver another package with ""Story"" written across it with bold letters a little bit faster. 

Once in a blue moon you have to fight something. Even on harder difficulty this is just designed to waste your time and Ruin your packages. These last a minute tops. 

The Fights are centered around forced Stealth components. Because it wouldnt be a Kojima game if the ""Stealth Optional"" didnt feel like it was shoved down your throat like a sponge covered in week old crusty chocolate. Where you have to avoid ""Watcher"" dead things. Which will drag you to the big Dead things that want to eat you and explode. So you throw your blood at them. and this kills them for some reason. 

Its often way faster to just kill the big dead thing than screw around ""Stealthing"". Which honestly makes the use of the Baby from the trailer 99% a waste of time that just screams at you anytime you stub your toe (You can blessedly mute it, thank god)

Everything is just a nothing burger of nonsense about ""Being the Bridge to unite america"" and ""Human Connection"" and ""Look we have another sponsor. Drink 15 of these to get a buff from Monster Energy Drink""

69,DEATH STRANDING,76324456,english,"A little background to the game, an explosion happened, fourth or fifth, I forget, but more importantly, the USA was changed for good. What was America turned into Norway, both in looks and size.  All people socially distanced, hiding themselves in bunkers. For a long time they kept the required 2m separation apart from one another. 

Although cut off from the outside world, people managed to retain their different regional accents, including well spoken English (BBC accent) and Spanish. Surprisingly, playing through this post-apocalyptic game so far, I haven’t encountered any  Irish. Because of this, I say it has broken the mold somewhat to other games of this ilk , thank god Colin Moriarty from Fall Out 3 isn’t here. 

As for the visuals, well its basically photo realistic, it looks amazing on a good rig. Dare I say it, it probably holds up to next generation consoles. 

The game is unique, and I had some amazing experiences travelling the world.  Walking through the waste land you really have a feeling of isolation. The only games I can compare it to where I had similar experiences are  Another World or ICO, that weird alone creepy feeling. 

The BT’s are genuinely scary, don’t ask me to describe them just play, it’s a Hideo Game. I have no idea what will happen next, but the story and the game play are so unique and bizarre (I did say this is a Hideo Game).

Gameplay includes allot of walking and managing your packages, not the one in the nether regions, but actual packages. It sounds boring but it’s a pretty cool concept and its actually fun. The combat I have experienced is a little clunky, reminiscent of the first Dead Space. It feels part of the character though, you not supposed to be a ninja or Daryl Dixon for that matter (crossbows are not available in the game).

One downside, there are major exposition dumps, but luckily not to a Mass Effect level, but close.  

Games should be rewarded by their originality and this is highly original. Beware though, it’s a game I class as Marmite, you either love it or hate it. As much as I hate Marmite, I love this game.  I am compelled to carry on. Unless there are some shite sandwiches  later on, I will go and say now, for me personally, this is one of the best games I have played  this year.

70,DEATH STRANDING,76323693,english,"Owned since its release on PC but only just got around to playing and completing it over the past week, I absolutely no-lifed the shit out of this game and enjoyed every second of it. My initial worry was ""okay so, how do you make a game about been a postman engaging"" and of course, in good old fashioned Hideo Kojima style, even though I didn't understand a lot of what was actually going on, I still loved it because it was so different and weird, the story kept driving me forward and I WANTED to understand as much as possible.

there were always several ways you could deliver orders and they had several parameters that were required for a successful delivery which had me thinking ""hmm okay so how can i get THESE packages from A to B, I could walk, take a vehicle, use ziplines. How heavy is the package? What gear should I use to facilitate its safe arrival, what supplies should I take? Will I run into enemies on the way?"". Along with thinking about whether or not you had to keep the specified package upright, if you could only carry it by hand, maybe you weren't allowed to submerge said package in water so taking that route through the water maybe isn't the best idea. The game actively challenged you to think about each and every delivery and actually gave me a sense of accomplishment when I got it there in good time and in top nick, even after battling through the harsh post apocalyptic world that tries everything to stop you and ruin those packages, especially the timefall, that rapidly ""ages"" everything it touches.

What I loved the most was the online interactivity with other players, you could see certain people structures and use them, upgrade them, give them a like to show your appreciation to those players for using there resources to not only help themselves but to help others...there was a strong sense of camaraderie with your fellow porters, even though you could never actually see or speak to them directly...it strangely brought the world to life even more.

Of course it wasn't all about just running around delivering packages, there is combat and boss fights through the course of the game and you can very quickly find your demise or completely lose items or orders if you're careless.

Norman and Mads did a fantastic job and I don't think the game would have been as good or the same without them. I didn't realise until recently that Death Stranding didn't actually do as well as expected, that it generally got a bad rap for been ""boring"" which I personally couldn't agree less with but to each their own.

If you have a gripe about all the famous people, I get that and I had the same complaint before I played it. I feel like Kojima did that because they're simply his favorite actors and wanted to include them in something he did. It constantly feels like he threw in all of his favorite things into this game which is something I'd want to do in a similar situation. 

The beauty of the game comes from the subtlety that hides behind the plot devices that are repeatedly slammed into your head which might steer some people away or be glossed over for that reason. It deals with social isolation, death, dopamine feedback loops, life-altering trauma and the collapse of nations while masquerading as a game about a biker babysitter who gets a job with Amazon and chugs Monster.

As far as good things: It looks great, graphics are amazing. Voice acting, while everybody sounds super subdued they feel real and it makes sense for the setting. The music they included is great, I liked both the original soundtrack as well as the licenced songs. And as previously stated, I enjoyed the story.

The core gameplay is essentially just a walking simulator but with extra mechanics, you need to balance your weight, be careful of your momentum, make sure your cargo is set optimally etc. It comes down to basically just pressing 3 different keys over and over at all times so you won't fall over. After a few hours you won't need one of them because you realize it's just telling you where rocks are that you can already see, but then they introduce the BT enemies and while they are around I felt the need to continually press the button again. The weight mechanics felt odd as well, it has the mechanics for you to organize your gear the way you want to, the better optimized, the easier to move around, but the problem is there is a button that auto organizes your stuff so it's the best it can be each time, you can also do this in the field, so there is no reason to do it yourself. 

It just felt, so monotonous, with no real reason to do anything other than the main story. You get paid in ""Likes"" for completing NPC's deliveries or other players dropped packages. There doesn't some to be any thing I can do with these likes, it feels like it's supposed to be a currency, but there is nothing I can buy with them, or if I can, not in the first four hours.

Then there is the combat, you need to fight these slime monster things occasionally and it feels so, so bad. Not enjoyable at all, it feels slower than the main game, which is saying something. I don't understand how the action moments of an already slow game drag the pacing down even further.

Overall:
Death Stranding is a cool concept with some jaw-dropping scenes full of weird, unique surprises.  However, the grinding gets tedious fairly early on in the game, there are some longer cut scenes that drag the narrative down, and there is WAAAY too much data to read and understand in emails, interviews, tips, etc.   If you are looking for an action game, this may disappoint you.  I would classify this as an atmospheric adventure sci-fi questing game.  The price was worth it for me just for the outstanding graphics and soundtrack, its probably the coolest looking game ever made (IMO).  Unfortunately, the gameplay is only mediocre.

Came down to it not being any fun. Controls were really frustrating. For example, I would try to hold down both the left and right mouse buttons to stabilize Sam while, and if too close to the bike and he would start to pick more stuff up. What!? I found a lot of scenarios where I needed to tweak the default controls to compensate for stupid crap like that.

The final nail in the coffin was auto-save. I really hate auto-save in just about any game. This game is the worst. It is nearly impossible to tell when a save has been done, so when you're done playing and you want to go to bed, or do something else, well, you might lose a ton of progress. IT. IS. A. GAME.

23,DEATH STRANDING,73418020,english,"[h1]Overview[/h1]
[b]Death Stranding[/b] (DST) is a post-apocalyptic open world title not belonging to any genre, as it builds a unique gameplay from scratch. Players impersonate Sam, one of the few Porters that dare to brave the desolation left by the Stranding, a mysterious event that broke the barrier between the world of the dead and that of the living. After rejoining the UCA, Sam is tasked with traveling to the other side of the continent, uniting all the survivors in the process to restore America to its former glory. His journey through the wastelands will go beyond any expectation, and become a legendary tale.

🟩 [b]The Good Side[/b]
[list]
[*][b]Unique, satisfying gameplay formula[/b]
DST has a unique take on the open-world gameplay style, as it has players traversing incredibly vast stretches of land where the main obstacle are not enemies or dungeons, but the landscape itself. Most gameplay consists in fulfilling delivery contracts - which may sound boring. Instead this title manages to make an astoundingly creative experience out of it. With a vast array of tools ranging from simple ladders to advanced vehicles, each player will forge their own path to destination, with a reward system that keeps interest up till the very end.

[*][b]Incredible visuals & art direction[/b]
From mountain, river to the desolation of urban remains, this game is nothing short of majestic at every turn. Amazing landscapes only seldom found in your average open world, here instead become commonplace, with maniacal attention to the smallest detail. Models, animations and effects are of masterpiece-quality without any flaw or inconsistency.

[*][b]Revolutionary multiplayer[/b]
DST uses a unique asynchronous multiplayer, where structures built by others may appear in your world, and vice-versa. Not only that, but players will also be able to upgrade each others' structures, contribute to larger projects such as highways, and leave signs around in a fashion similar to Dark Souls - other than ""like"" each others' structures, exchanging XP in the process.

[*][b]Overall great story[/b]
Hideo Kojima did it again, as expected he managed to cook up an extremely convoluted story that branches into philosophy, human existentialism, history and a dozen other subjects with equal complexity, while also narrating the adventures, betrayals and losses of Sam and his companions. Too bad it loses a lot later on, but it's overall memorable.

[*][b]Amazing soundtrack[/b]
The music accompanying the most iconic moments and boss fights is nothing short of perfect, amplifying the magnitude of those moments tenfold. The selection of tracks employed here suits masterfully each situation, contributing to the narrative pathos.
[/list]

🟥 [b]The Bad Side[/b]
[list]
[*][b]Mediocre boss fights[/b]
The bosses of DST are mostly disappointing, either having simplistic patterns with zero evolution in the course of battle, recycled designs, and/or being hulking bullet sponges without any unique mechanic to them. Combat might not be the main focus of the game, but in contrast with the overall quality, these fights do not live up to par.

[*][b]Control problems[/b]
Many players (including myself) have experienced a repetition / delay in game inputs, both on KBM or Gamepad. This bug can lead to weapon misfires, unwanted actions, and very well your death in the most serious combat situations. A nasty bug that definitely makes the experience more annoying.

[*][b]Story pacing becomes a drag later on[/b]
As you approach the late/end story phases, an excessive repetition of already seen scenes, along with some good old complete nonsense that contradicts things stated earlier on, ruins the narrative pacing quite a lot. It becomes a mess for the sake of BEING a mess - in the later stages.

[h1]In-Depth Breakdown[/h1]
🎮 [b]Gameplay Analysis[/b]
Gameplay is divided into Exploration, Character Management, Deliveries and Combat.

[b]Exploration[/b]
Initially plays out on foot, though soon enough will be supported by vehicles and more advanced means later on. Traversing the landscape has a variety of mechanics to it including fatigue, stamina to resist effort, balancing your character to prevent falling down, and various environment phenomena such as storms. There is not much to explore as the world turned into a wasteland, the few and far between points of interest are almost all mission-related, though some collectibles and secondary NPCs can be found by the attentive explorer. 

A handy map will enable planning your paths, your scanner will reveal hazards and items around you, while the structures of other players may help you in your journey if they spawn in the right place. The land is vast, varied and full of unexpected dangers.

[b]Character Management[/b]
Is done on the fly while exploring or in a more complete way at one of the many outposts available. You will be able to use 3D printing to craft weapons, equipment, utility via terminals, with the resources found while exploring or gained by leveling up the trust with each outpost with successful deliveries. Making sure you have all the necessary equip and managing your weight is fundamental, depending on what type of mission will be your next. Being overburdened with cargo will lead to massive maluses, and quick stamina loss. Your character can level up passive stats as he makes more and more successful deliveries, each will benefit him differently such as more cargo capacity, or better balance.

[b]Deliveries[/b]
Are the main activity and are divided into several categories, from standard ones to time-sensitive or with other special conditions. Making sure the cargo arrives in good state is the primary concern, as too much damage to it will void the contract and in some cases trigger a game over. Depending on time, cargo status, weight and other factors you will receive a rating, equivalent to a certain amount of reputation with a particular client. Leveling up reputation unlocks weapon blueprints, gadgets and many useful tools. 

[b]Combat[/b]
Plays out in third-person and can be either melee or with guns, grenades and devices. Killing people is possible but strongly discouraged as it has terrible consequences - a vast array of non-lethal weapons is available and effective. Not only humans but also monsters from the ""other side"" will be your enemies, either being stealth or fighting them openly are viable strategies. Combat may not be the main focus but holds up quite well and has mechanics like dodging, parrying, headshots and status effects to build a serviceable system. Enemy AI is not too brilliant however, rather predictable.

Graphics:
Great graphics, nice details. I like landscapes which are fairly amazing although a bit plain, mostly stones while vegetation is rare (I guess due to the story, but still would be nice to have a bit more variety)

Music:
Nice and calming, it is set to play in the specific moments of the game, if you want to hear it more often you need to set it up (although it seems to stop every now and again)
Tracks unlock as you progress through the game, not for streaming due to licencing.

Mechanics:
Prepare for grind.
If you just follow the story, it will be a rough ride through the tough terrain but a nice experience nonetheless. However if you try to complete most additional orders, build and upgrade infrastructure, get best standing with all the locations, etc - then it’s going to be a long grind. 
For story-only, I would advise to play “offline”, with the world not polluted with other players' structures, it will make it a bit more difficult but will add to the experience.
If you plan to do more, then you should use “online” mode to have structures from other players appear in your game, even though sometimes it feels like too much “noise” (the game itself decides when and how much to show from other players).
The boss fights are not so good either.

Story:
That’s a tough one.
The story is so twisted and abstract that it's hard to understand it for a while (if at all).
Main theme is recreating [strike]USA[/strike] UCA from the perspective of [strike]Amazon[/strike] delivery guy, and it feels rather cringeworthy.
While the story is interesting, too many times I had moments of “wtf head scratch”.
I think the story would fare much better if the game theme was “joining colonies on planet Mars” (wouldn’t be much of a difference)

Sam controls like crap.  The vehicles control like crap.  You get stuck on the smallest rocks and due to the mostly terrible controls you will miss ladders, tumble down cliffs and things like that.  I also had a weird issue using a bluetooth xbox one s controller, that it would do multiple inputs to a single button press sometimes (like hitting start to open the menu and it would open/close rapidly a few times for some reason). This is the only game I have this issue in.

- great music score

- Severe resource scarceness for single-player compared to multi-player!
(I miss a choice at game start - pure single-player -> more resources or less pricy costs - multi-player -> as-is resources and cost)
- combat is underwhelming, esp. against human enemies

On single-player, one can get through the main story no problem - but side-activities like trying to complete roads (even without upgrading them to level 2 or 3) is close to impossible without extremely boring resource farming. Travelling without roads becomes boring and annoying quickly.

57,DEATH STRANDING,76186230,english,"This game is fantastic. I almost never finish games these days, but this one had no problem keeping my attention throughout. It's something different.

I've seen it get a fair amount of hate as a ""walking simulator."" There's a lot more to it than that. It's true you spend large chunks of time trekking across the map, but you're not just walking, you're *traversing,* making decisions about your route, taking advantage of a bunch of tools at your disposal. It's more of a backpacking simulator than a walking simulator. If you like grueling treks across the wilderness, or even if you don't like the actual thing but can understand the sense of accomplishment there, this aspect of the game is hugely satisfying. And, like I said, there's a lot more going on. That fairly mundane baseline is essential for the emotional magnitude of the game's other mechanics -- without spoilers, let's just say it lulls you into a sense of calm so the other stuff really hits home. And they really keep it fresh -- throughout the majority of the game they're continuously introducing new mechanics, and finding ways of messing with your comfort zone. 

Overall the controls are great. You feel very physically connected to the world. There were a few moments where the interface caused frustration, and if I was feeling impatient the frequent micro-cutscenes were a little tiresome. No deal-breakers there though.

The story is wacky. It's a lot of fun once you get into it. It's confusing at first, but gradually comes together into something undeniably unique and frequently surprising. Personally, the parts I liked least about this game have to do with the campiness that features prominently in its core narrative. It's not that I hate camp, it's just that in this context some of the cheese here feels like a blemish on an otherwise perfectly realized world. Maybe it won't seem cheesy to everyone -- it's really not any cheesier than the majority of games, it's just noticeable here. Even with the cheese I ultimately loved the storyline. The characters are excellent and the game managed to illicit more feeling from my cold, jaded heart than anything else so far in 2020.  

It's worth noting that a few of the cutscenes are LONG. Mostly this feels earned, but they drop a big one on you right near the beginning of the game, and I will admit I wasn't sure if this game was for me at that point.

61,DEATH STRANDING,76044949,english,"As a long-time Kojima Productions fan who was disappointed with MGSV's messy implementation of busy mechanics that cluttered and obscured key story elements to the point of cumulative frustration, I am extremely impressed by Death Stranding. I'm going to keep this brief, and let other reviewers do the bulk of the... heavy lifting...

The way this game's mechanics unfurl before you is a really enjoyable experience. What at first seems to be a potentially tedious hiking simulator offers up ample in-game rewards for your initial slog, in the form of tools which ease your task significantly, trek by trek. The net result of this progression is that you feel that you  are working hard, and getting rewarded for it: 'likes' from real players who are using the structures, handouts, and roads [b] you've [/b] built; incremental upgrades to your tools and weapons; unlocked vehicles... Death Stranding is like a study on what positive feedback means to the human who wants to play and be rewarded. Themes of oxytocin and the neuroscience of 'reward' and the value of social connection play out in optionally-read 'interview' data that fills you in on backstory as you progress. These themes set up a cohesive, yet often pleasingly unintrusive 'strand' which inspires a nice impetus to keep playing to see what will come.

Traditionally, I hate grinding with a passion. It is--for me--play distilled into the kind of meaningless work that I use videogames to try to escape from in the first place. But the game rewards you for grinding, without keeping you at arm's length for tens of hours first; the golden ring is always in sight, and the tangible, useful rewards that shooting for them nets you are near-certain. Almost every action that you can do serves some kind of purpose which feeds into the overall systemic web of mechanics that will make your game easier the more of these actions you fulfil. But you're the agent here; grinding is something you'll do when you want to do it (and if I do, you will), and you won't have to do it when you don't want to.

This is a very rewarding time-sink of a game, with neat thematic layers exploded into various elements of the game: plot exposition; gameplay; the Dark-Souls-esque 'convoluted time'-flavoured online multi-verse co-operation which really re-invigorates a sense of humanity through a very brute lack of firearms and egoic grandstanding (can you imagine?).

I recommend this to ANYONE who likes stories, movies, relaxing, horror as well as survival games. 

Because whilst your walking up a mountain, or down, a song could pop on half way up, and then you're surrounded by BTs (invisible enemies in the game), and then each region of the game you unlock, more of the story you uncover.

I wasn't going to think I'd like this game, but I'm not going to lie, I love this game for what it is, as well as its universe. 
It's wacky, crazy and interesting all at the same time, whilst feeling believable. You get attached to the characters and feel like they're real too.

69,DEATH STRANDING,76163726,english,"Death Stranding is so-so.

On the one hand, the game is unique. Story is weird as af but makes me very curious to know more. The game mechanics and the idea of sharing resources with other players is very interesting. It feels very good to work together and the sharing. Actors-Actresses are also great. World is beautiful.

On the other hand, gameplay wise is basically a walking sim. 90% you will be just carrying resources from A to B. There is a lot of repetitive cutscenes-transition animation that makes it very tedious too. Even though you can skip them but since there is a lot of them, it's getting really tiring. You get more tools and weapons in the later stage of the game but a lot of times you can just ignore it and not really use them.

In conclusion, I think Kojima took a lot of (bad) elements from MGS5 and continued with it in Death Stranding. The open-world aspect is interesting but the world is quite generic. Same as MGS5 you go from one location and do the same quest over and over again which in the case of Death Stranding is carrying items from A to B. The way the story progresses is weird. It's not exactly linear but every time you finish an order they tease you with a tiny bit of lore you don't understand. At the beginning or by the end of a chapter they may tease you with bigger cutscenes but you still don't understand anything.

All in all, I miss the linear, compact experience from MGS1-4. MGS5 lack variety and it's basically a grindfest of same quests and the pace of the story is weird.

Me after playing DS: This is one of the best games I have ever played in my life.

Point is, this game does appear to be boring but it is one of those games you have to play to truly understand and grasp what the creator was going for. At first glance it does look like a boring game and truth be told, at times it can be. But the awesome narrative will keep you going forward and wanting to make the next delivery. The story is amazing, and it's full of popular actors/directors playing the characters of the game such as Norman Reedus, Mads Mikkelson, and Guillermo Del Toro that really do the games plot justice with their professional acting. The visuals are some of the best I've seen and the optimization is spot on. Gameplay wise, don't get this if you're looking for a fun experience and couldn't care less for story. The gameplay consists of delivering packages over the continent to link up the remaining cities, and to do this you need to tough out certain terrain, bring supplies to help you cross certain paths and hope other players have set up devices for you to use as well to make it to your destination while braving BT and terrorist territories. As you go you unlock more equipment that make the job easier such as vehicles, mechs, and weapons. Boss fights are very unique and fun too, but they take a while to get to, and each combat sequence means something which is why there is very few. 

If you want to experience an amazing story with some different gameplay from other games that can sometimes be fun or infuriating with some occasional (yet really cool) action, or if you're just a Kojima fanboy, get this game.

Content is varied and there are a lot of choices you can make (mostly about your loadout), all of which have a clear/satisfying impact on play. There are several competing systems that make these decisions interesting -- weight and energy vs. speed, terrain maneuverability, contract efficiency, firepower, stealth, etc. I went into the game expecting it to be mostly post office simulator, so I got a solid chunk of enjoyment out of this.Mechanics were fine -- supporting all of the systems in play is mostly enough for me. They work acceptably, though not perfectly. E.g., movement is a bit buggy in edge cases. Moving on a steep hill, if you hit the wrong terrain, you might just teleport instantly 50 yards down a slope and take a bunch of damage/drop a bunch of stuff. Not great, but if you know that these kinds of issues exist, it's not terribly taxing to play around.Menuing and UX were not great. The whole experience of being in your private room is super annoying. Cutscenes and animations on every interaction. Weird camera switches. Have to aim with the mouse before you can use a hotkey. The inventory management menuing was redundant 3 times over. Not a showstopper, but a completely unnecessary pain point.The delivery of the worldbuilding, plot, and message of the game are all piss-poor.

96,DEATH STRANDING,72692671,english,"[h1] Death Stranding: [/h1]For years since the release of MGS1 on the original playstation, gamers have been asking themselves whether or not Hideo Kojima is a narcissistic madman or an industry savant. With the corporate shackles off from leaving Konami, and having his first independent release with his own studio we can finally begin to answer that question. [h1] Preface: [/h1]I originally played through Death Stranding on PS4 Pro, and went in with healthy skepticism yet was hoping for a special gaming experience. And I must say that personally I think Death Stranding is a great game. I think it has niche appeal and will not resonate with your average video game enthusiast, however the audience it aims for will love this experience. The story admittedly can be preachy at times and over dramatic. The gameplay can sometimes feel monotonous. And you may or may not grow to like the main cast of characters. However I think if you look beyond certain flaws the game has you'll find one of the most unique interactive experiences you'll ever potentially have. It's not a game you can watch someone else play or get a grasp of through gameplay footage, even I wouldn't watch someone else play Death Stranding. It must be experienced first hand by actually playing it to really understand it's appeal. Despite the game socially commentating on how we live in an isolationist society relying too much on parasocial relationships, it ironically asks the player to experience the game alone to best enjoy it (Asynchronous multiplayer system aside which is actually great). [h1] Rambling: [/h1]The game itself deconstructs traversal making the environment an obstacle whereas in a regular game that would be via enemies, over the top set pieces, or static puzzles. And in stereotypical open world/sandbox games traversal is relatively boring by just holding down a direction waiting for your destination to appear without having to consider your surroundings. Death Stranding really makes you consider your approach to the ""Journey"" as opposed to the destination itself. What I mean by that is the planning of what equipment to take, how much cargo you want to take on, the route you'll follow, and consideration of potential hazards that come along the way. This also includes potentially being flexible since things can go south fast and you have to be ready to improvise in those situations. Reaching the end of a delivery is satisfying, but only because of how difficult and arduous deliveries can be. Luckily the game becomes easier as you play along by unlocking tools/resources over time that'll make your trips less stressful.The story while a bit convoluted and may sometimes even make you cringe (The more self-indulgent side to Kojima that you may or may not like) has some well executed overarching positive messages that can be felt the further you progress into the game. There's a decent amount of character growth and discovery as you learn more about the world around you while going west to reconnect a fictionally fractured America. I'd like to think that the abstract and vague presentation of the story's themes allows for open interpretation on what Kojima was trying to communicate to the player. Sometimes the symbolism is clever and other times you might roll your eyes.Personally I cared more about the character driven narrative in Sam's personal journey with BB as they cross the country together than the reconnecting of the post-apocalyptic America plot line (Not that the overarching plot was bad, but it felt weaker than the individual character stories), but that may just be me. There's a lot of lore for people into finding out every little detail of the game through written logs in the form of emails, interviews, and memory chips that help with unanswered questions and some plot holes. It's a shame that this bit of world building is implemented this way, but I don't think they would have been able to fit it in with the regular cutscene sequences. Also I think Kojima wanted you to work for the ""full picture"" in terms of the story (This can be a good or bad thing depending on the player's sensibilities). The ending itself will probably get you emotionally and will cause you to take some time to think introspectively about a lot of different things. Unrelated but it's ironic that the events in-game are parallel in an abstract sort of way to how things are currently going now IRL (As of the time I'm writing this review) in 2020, but that's neither here nor there. Playing through Death Stranding made me realize what qualities I really like and do not like in the way Kojima crafts his games. I think the campy nature of MGS3 made its way here just toning it down a bit with the goofiness and increasing the character drama. I also think the worlds that Kojima builds are very atmospheric and immersive with Death Stranding being the best out of all his titles in that regard. He has a knack for bringing together talented people like the actors that portray the characters in-game, and the music he's curated that come in as BGM when necessary. Speaking of the soundtrack its amazing, the music really fits the tone and themes of the game. However the story telling is a mixed bag sometimes it's awe inspiring and engaging, other times it feels needlessly drawn out for the sake of over the top theatrics similar but maybe not quite as bad as MGS4. (I'm using Metal Gear games as a point of reference since there are certain elements/conventions from those games storytelling wise that are here in Death Stranding).[h1] Concluding Thoughts: [/h1]Ultimately Death Stranding shines for me personally because it's a perfectly imperfect game if that makes any sense (In an odd way I think that's part of why I like it so much). The positives outweigh the negatives in terms of the execution of all the ideas put into place here. Kojima put all his eggs in this basket and I think he mostly succeeded in the creation of this avant-garde styled interactive experience. It may or may not be a masterpiece to some, but I believe this will be a game that will be talked about for a long time regardless, especially as it ages. I think how it's perceived by the public matters a lot less than the fact it exists at all in the first place, finally finding it's place on PC. So I implore you to please enjoy what it has to offer, the good and the bad. To those that give Death Stranding a chance, take your time, and enjoy the ride. It's a game that is much more rewarding going at your own pace (As opposed to rushing yourself), and taking in the world that Kojima built. It's easy to fall into the trap of only doing side quests, but I'd recommend primarily focusing on the main campaign if you don't want to get burnt out (If this is your first rodeo with the game). If you just do those simple things you'll probably find something that resonates with you in Death Stranding.

Or how we were dreaded by the mysterious 5 humanoid figures floating in the sky in the first beach trailer? Or how metaphorical and a mysterious mindfck we thought this was going to be? You do? Well sucks to be you then because THEY MADE EVERYTHING COMPLETELY LITERAL!The game started interesting with cutscenes and heavy dialogues. Then the gameplay happened and it was surprisingly satisfying. I was genuinely happy with the gameplay. Then I completely forgot about the story and instead build roads etc. like crazy. Then it got boring and I remembered that the game had a story and decided to go with the main quests for a while. Then the story became repetitive and boring and I went back to building crap and delivering sh*t to some irrelevant NPCs again. This cycle continued until the last snowy mountain area. Then I snapped and stopped giving 2 cents about deliveries and all those side quests and went for the story without any detour.When I was at that point, the game lost its charm in my opinion when it took everything too literal. When the game finally (reluctantly and half assed) decided to reveal some things I was like ""yeah I thought so"" or ""duh"" or ""really? that's it?"". Also let's not forget that this is such a dialogue and cutscene heavy game but it expects you to stop caring about them most of the time and instead go read lots and lots of texts in the form of mails and interviews etc.The game also likes to drag itself on and on and on and on and on by leaving you hanging every time the story is about to advance. I've never sighed this much before while playing a game I think. Game reveals (not really) most of its secrets at the very last chapter but by that time you already figure out everything for like 12 times thanks to same cutscenes/dialogues repeating themselves from different POVs.Lastly, dialogues are sometimes dull and slooooow so enjoy catching some Zs.After playing this for 96 hours straight I can safely say that I hate this game as much as I love it. I don't think I'll ever touch it again though. So yeah buy it and play it. It's a different game and has a different pace.

38,DEATH STRANDING,76039867,english,"Honestly One of the Best Games I've Played

This game features avant-garde gameplay coupled with a seriously esoteric story. It's new and refreshing, and that's part of what makes this game so much fun to play, but there is a lot more to the game than just that. As of right now, I haven't finished the game, but I already feel confident in saying that this experimental title probably holds the most meaningful game mechanics I've ever experienced.

Death Stranding, at bottom, is all about one thing: building bridges. Not literally of course, though it is possible to build bridges, but figuratively speaking. In terms of story, the country is divided, and it is your job to bring it together by spreading the message that we are stronger together than divided. A common message, to be sure, but it is not just the story of the game which holds this meaning, it is the gameplay itself, specifically, it is the way that the disparate ""singleplayer"" experiences bleed together into a ""quasi-muliplayer"" experience. Every structure you (the player) places could show up in someone else's game, their parallel universe, thereby easing their journey of uniting the country. This collective easing of each others' journeys is what builds the bridges between us, the players, and it is what makes this game so unique: it's about competition and mutually beneficial relationships with others.

Often when I find myself climbing a mountain, crossing a waterfall, or barely escaping from a band of terrorists with my life, I deliberately try to place items, signs, or structures in the hopes that, maybe, just maybe, I can make the job of the next player to follow in my footsteps easier. I build roads to connect all the cities to enable both myself and other players to more easily traverse the otherwise shattered landscapes of Death Stranding's world easier. And whenever I find myself in trouble, with sparse equipment and empty weapons, I can usually find my way out of any sticky situation more easily by relying upon the bridges other players have built to make my journey easier in turn; bridges that come in the form of ladders, ziplines, motorcycles, shelters, or even the literal bridges built by others to make my journey easier.

It is truly a wonderful experience. We are each on our own odyssey, unable to work together on the same one, but able to help others on their way as we briefly cross paths in the world of death stranding. It is a powerful message, one which I hope can be realized outside of this video game also... whether that be in the real world, or in other video games also. Kojima's latest masterpiece is truly a revolutionary title.

And to give us accolades and motivation for helping others along in their journey, we are given likes, likes which (even in the game) are said to release oxytocin, though I'm sure that for me, as well as many others, it isn't simply about the likes. In fact, I believe that Kojima specifically put the MULE enemies, porters who are so hooked on delivering cargo, into the game to remind us that we are not there just to deliver packages for likes, but to finish our mission and to help others finish theirs. In a nutshell: we're here to build bridges.

So for anyone who is tired of playing murder-simulators, or other games where violence and competition is the answer to all of life's problems, I recommend that you give this innovative new walking-simulator a try.",1600206644,1600206644,TRUE,1,0,0.476190478,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,316,9,4372,58,3249,1601180607,,

Since you're a mailman, combat isn't really a thing here.  So avoid you must as your cargo degrades.  and oh yeah, who cares about delivering the cargo because you get a star sticker on your virtual leg.  Yay.  Oh and pat on the back from a virtual AI.  Woot, I feel so nice, the hologram of a fictional character in a video game telling me I'm a legend.  That makes it worthwhile.

50,DEATH STRANDING,75973003,english,"DEATH STRANDING has some gorgeous landscapes.  Mossy, boulder-strewn plains divided by flowing rivers, dusty dunes that feel almost Martian, all overlooked by an imposing, snow-capped mountain range.  It may not have a lot in common with the America it's supposed to represent, but then this IS a future where rain causes anything it touches to age decades within minutes.  When you put it like that, it's a wonder new canyons aren't forming by the week.

""Timefall"" is just one of many arcane concepts thrown at us in the opening hours of DEATH STRANDING, along with ""BTs,"" ""voidouts,"" and ""chiral crystals.""  But the story is still more or less straightforward- at first.  You are Sam, a courier in a post-apocalyptic world turned upside-down by the appearance of the spectral BTs, and your mission is to link up settlements and shelters in order to rebuild America.  You do this by delivering packages.  Lots and lots of packages.  This is the big idea behind DEATH STRANDING's gameplay: a game about loading yourself up with weight, and trying to balance that weight as you negotiate a challenging terrain.  Carefully controlling your character's momentum, using the triggers to maintain balance, and keeping track of your weight distribution are all essential- at first.  It's a unique idea for a core gameplay loop, and in theory it puts a new spin on the familiar tropes of open-world gameplay.  In practice?  Well... the physics governing your movement are pretty well-programmed, and the animations are impressively detailed.  Watching Sam nimbly step across the terrain is something to behold, and the game milks this quiet spectacle for all it's worth*, frequently pulling back the camera to view him as a tiny figure making his way across the vast landscape, playing the occasional artsy indie track to set the mood.  And that mood is bleak and quiet... downbeat and slow... and more than a little boring.

And here we reach the elephant in the room.  Actually, DEATH STRANDING can get *very* boring at times.  It often turns into the kind of non-game where you need to have a podcast or YouTube video on just to keep going.  To its credit, the game peppers the landscape with a variety of obstacles- when you're not figuring out how to ascend a slope or cross a river, you'll be evading packs of bandits or sneaking by the BTs.  But all the same, it gets monotonous very easily, which isn't helped by how much the game drags some things out.  The act of completing a delivery springs to mind- instead of just showing one ""Mission Complete!"" screen with all your stats readily available, the game slowly loads every stat before giving you your final grade, THEN showing a bunch of different stats that affect your current rating, THEN informing you of any new benefits you've unlocked, THEN playing a message from your client that inevitably boils down to ""Wow, great job you did!""

So why did I play it for at least sixty hours?  No, really, what the hell is wrong with me?  I mean, I was readily aware of this game's flaws after less than a dozen hours, but I kept at it anyways.  Partially just to see where the hell Hideo Kojima was going with all this... but also, I have to admit, DEATH STRANDING does some things I haven't really seen in other open-world games.  For starters, it's one of the only open-world games I've played where your mode of travel significantly evolves over the course of the game.  In most open-world games, you spend the whole game either walking, riding, driving, or parkouring across the game world, and all that changes is how much of the map you unlock.  Meanwhile in DEATH STRANDING, you progress from laboriously crossing the terrain on foot, to riding a motorbike, and eventually erecting entire  roads and ziplines to help you navigate more efficiently.  There's something bizarrely addictive about doing deliveries to unlock access to more supplies, so I can erect more bridges, roads, and ziplines.  It feels like the first time I've ever seen a AAA open-world game make construction a core part of gameplay, rather than a tacked-on extra like in FALLOUT 4.

I also have to give props to the bola gun.  DEATH STRANDING occasionally sends you off to bandit camps where rogue deliverymen try to steal your goods, and you're encouraged to take them out nonlethally.  One of the methods for doing so is a gun that fires a bola at the target, which wraps around them before causing them to trip and fall to the ground.  To put it plainly, this weapon is fucking hilarious, and possibly the first instance I've seen where the nonlethal option is much MORE fun than the regular guns.  Aiming a bola at a charging enemy, before firing and watching it wrap around them in slow-motion, sending them tumbling to the ground- that NEVER gets old.  I highly recommend bola guns be implemented as a standard option in every shooter going forward, and possibly all video games in general.

Unfortunately, the rest of the combat is a total letdown.  There's no creativity in any of the other weapons, and while the game makes a big deal out of how you have to use your own blood for ammo against the BTs- thus creating a hypothetically interesting tug-of-war between your need to defeat enemies versus your own survival- the fact remains that virtually every fight in the game was a cakewalk, including most of the boss fights.  In fact, for a game about death, it's shockingly easy to avoid getting killed.  The times when I died from being genuinely beaten- rather than just experimentation or not understanding game mechanics- could probably be counted on one hand.

Perhaps as befits its origins, DEATH STRANDING is one of the most ambitious, original AAA games to be released in years- but that's not the same thing as being a good game.   All the same, I can't help but feel greatness was within reach.  I actually really want to see another game use the same construction and carrying mechanics to tell a better story.  There's potential for a great game set in, say, a medieval setting, where your character has to carry goods from town to town, and slowly tame a harsh wilderness.  And I'm certainly curious to see what Hideo Kojima does next. I just have a bad feeling it won't be ""finally hire a decent editor.""

*I hasten to add this spectacle is impressive as long as DEATH STRANDING is actually running properly, which it often did not on my laptop. Even at the lowest resolution and mostly while running in a window, it was highly inconsistent- sometimes the game loaded quickly and ran smoothly, other times it would get stuck at 21% loaded, or have a framerate in the single digits.  And yes, I'm aware my gaming laptop was probably under the recommended specs, but the issue I still have is this:  Why SHOULD I have to get a better system to play this game?  Kojima's previous game was also developed primarily for the PS4 and Xbone, and it ran fine on my OLD laptop.  How does it make any sense that graphical standards advance so quickly that I can't even keep pace if I upgrade my system?

Going back and forth, making deliveries, interrupted with the odd fight here and there, and some pretty cool horror elements, that’s it really! At least you can also take part in rebuilding things, which is nice, and there are some vehicles to use later on, although a Monster Truck is missing.  😉

Another quote I remember is about art being an umbrella in the shit storm of life, and maybe I’m lucky to have realized a long time ago, that everyone on this planet is struggling in some way or other; so I guess everyone needs art in their life, too.
And Death Stranding is such a magnificent cinematic work of art, It has to be said; you’ll find some amazing moments, if you have the patience to put up with it’s slow pace and the gameplay which is a bit on the repetitive side.

[i]Of course, the slow pace could be seen as a message:[/i]

[b]If you want enlightenment, you will have to put up with suffering.[/b]

The networking in this game does make me question social networks even more, with their likes, a lot of them fake, or the real likes for and from fake people for real fake news. Is it a problem of the internet, or just a mirror of real life? Is this game mirroring both?
In real life a courier at least gets some real feedback, when someone receives a parcel, there is some real interaction, but unfortunately even irl this is changing nowadays with this current epidemic, and as a courier you might be placing parcels into some unpersonal collect station instead. What a cold world we live in.
And apparently you get a rise of oxytocin for likes? Maybe I’m wired differently (I’m sure I am, haha), but I don’t really get much out of that or social media as a whole. It’s too much of a fake world. I want flesh and blood, endorphins and adrenalin. 😉 Not rice crispies and some metrosexual twitter feed. 😉

Do you need likes from people you never met irl to boost your ego?

Is oxytocin addictive? Isn’t hugging someone a healthier way?
And wearing tight latex could even keep your Fragile body save from viruses! 😉

There are many masks people wear to hide their struggle and darkness. When do masks become part of a person, part of a soul? How much of the ego is real? In a world full of egoic people, can one function without an ego? How far are you willing to lose yourself in something, to find yourself?

I remember a river I visited earlier this year in spring, which had loads of piles of balanced Zen Stones on the embankment on the other side near a hiking trail. Now I’m not a person who likes to hike, I’m more of a cyclist, and prefer a bit more speed, a faster pace, but of course I had to walk a few meters and explore to find those stone piles, where someone else had meditated.

It’s nice to wander off the beaten track, even to get lost sometimes, and to question the reality you live in. I seems to me that a lot of people just keep moving to stop themselves from falling over, as they are haunted by their inner dialog; so to stand still is like a threat to them. 

You can’t always meditate either, there has to be a balance of stillness, motion and emotion.

There is no peace without war, no joy without suffering, no light without the dark. 
Every end is a new beginning, for every door which closes, another one opens. 
There is no order without chaos.

It’s quite possible that humanity or the civilisation that we know will end one day, maybe sooner than we would like to think.

82,DEATH STRANDING,75973306,english,"so, death stranding. finally comes to pc, after 5 years of witing for the release on consoles and 1 for the pc edition. i will begin by saying that i was extremely excited about the game, and have been theorizing since the announcement trailer (i'll keep coming); when i managed to get my hands on the game i was obviously shaking by excitement since the game was really hyped by some players yet hated by others, and that only made my interest on what kind of game i was getting myself into.

So, the game is all booted up, i get some unique requests about my personal info (all good, just your birth date and your constellation, for chiral analysis).

i play the first chapter, and im shocked by how creative and just indescribably cool the world and feeling was, since the first minutes i knew this game was something on a different league (and i'm going to be honest, also the jank is on another league).

so i keep on playing, with an incredible urge of feeling as much as i could everything, the refined organization of the items, the incredibly deep feeling of walking, the weird uncanny yet particular characters,  the beautiful and bleak loneliness of a world where you're just about the only living thing, except a few freaks with lightning sticks.

then, it happens. i get one particular mission, a difficult one at that; and i just couldn't do it, sam dies, and i have to reenter my body and spend 5 hours delivering an already fucked up delivery that wasnt even going to give me a good score (i later discovered that i could've just canceled the order. foolish me.)

i felt, really, damn, bad. i felt lost and disappointed; thought i was going to drop the game then and there.

but something grew in me, something i had discovered in games like dark souls and sekiro, that feeling of ""fuck it, push beyond it and go forth, get it done.""
and so i did, i kept on pushing, the same way that sam struggles walking with 150 Kgs of cargo after a bad rain and some lightning stick men insisting to help him complete his order.
going through and through i eventually break in a very open area of the map and, right there, i get it. i get why i was doing this, i get why i kept pushing to the end, i get why i kept delivering those packages, even the secondary ones:
that loneliness, that sense of being on your own in this huge world, it feels so emptying yet beautiful, in a mistifying way. and yet there was always a sense of connection; signs, player cargo, tools dropped by other players and structures, all made you feel like you were everything and nothing, its a weird pool of emotions i have to say. but it was so immersive and fullfilling, that i wanted more, and still do. i will probably 100% the game, since the world of the death stranding is so weirdly beautiful.

- mechanics are different and interesting, you feel progress and getting better at doing deliveries as you do the main quests and side quests.
- the environment design and art direction is AMAZING (I recommend the artbook is really well done) and the music, it adds a lot to the game experience  (wish it have a feature like MGS 5 to listen music tracks while playing)

Is my favorite 2020 game, like it so much got it again on PC and looks real nice, and the extra features and cosmetics, I'm looking foward to get them.

- build all the roads

First of all, I had to endure 6 hours of the game to actually get to play a total of 1 hour.
Since this is a game and not a movie I am not so fond on such a grand exposition dump.
But the main problem is, that although there are some interesting meta layers embedded in the story, the way they are executed is anything, but subtle. Like a game that wants to be interlectual, but thinks their audience is compiled out of morons. That's why the game explaines everything in detail to you and then repeats it up to three times !!
I really like this different approach to gameplay. Here the game is literaly, running from one end of the map to another, which is boring in most games, because it hinders the actual gameplay, but here it is the actual gameplay. Since it is somewhat challengeing it's quiet enternaining. Problem is, it was fun for 20 hours, not the 40 it was build around.
So I think this game is cool, because it's so different and it's cool, that Sony financed it, but I think Kojima went a little overboard. A little bit of supervision and streamlining would have helped the game.

If you are looking for an action-game, you wont find it here. The game is a ""walking simulator"" with some sporadic action. Its a slow paced game that allows you to play in a pace that stands in stark contrast to most other games. Giving you time to enjoy the landscape, think and plan ahead! But giving you the freedom to tackle the challenges up ahead in the way that you want to.

The game focuses on story and the progress you make on your way. Better equipment and structures helping you overcome obstacles that were time-consuming and difficult at the start of the game.

The indirect way you help other players or get helped is motivating.

For me this is a true masterpiece and innovation i was craving for for a long time. Focusing on value of life and companionship.

This is what happens when you have a ""George Lucas""-style visionary have his way, and I wouldn't have it any other way.
Death Stranding is probably one of the most unique games I have played and (while I am only wading through this crater lake of a game) it has captivated me the entire time.

I isolated myself from 95% of the marketing and was thoroughly impressed. While I very much enjoy playing this game and it's surprising intricacies for a Amazon delivery simulator in a craggy hell, this is obviously not for everyone to enjoy. I watched several impressions/reviews and they all line up on these points.

It's really fever dream like, it's obvious that Kojima is off the walls, and it's a weirdly satisfying but often cumbersome game.

If you haven't experienced Hideo Kojima's games prior, I'd encourage you to watch gameplay of them at least. You will be either taxed by the almost suffocating and questionable gameplay choices or overwhelmed by the intense and surreal feeling that accompanies his games. Likewise, being prepared makes you enjoy a very memorable game that doesn't suffer from today's triple AAA money vacuums.

It's worth the ~60 I put in. Don't get this game expecting a quick distraction for a few days... Because this is does feel like a hike across the USA, and it isn't much quicker than in real life.

I was on the fence a long time about buying this game. I am glad I didn't miss out. After 40 hours of playing, I thought it was time to write a review as my way of saying thanks to the creators for giving me an awesome experience that is different from everything else out there.

The most amazing thing about this game is the multiplayer element. Without it, it wouldn't be much of a game really. You can enjoy other people's stuff, and they can enjoy yours. There is something just satisfying about it that is hard to explain. It's not like regular online games where people get over competitive, and do everything they can to ruin your fun. You never have to worry about aimbot jerks and god mode hackers. You just share ""likes"", and keep puting one foot in front of the other.

Be aware that sometimes people will compare the multiplayer element to dark souls. Well, being a huge souls fan, I can say it's not like that at all. You can not invade people, or be invaded. You share structures and can donate equipment and materials. Sometimes people can throw you items during a boss fight. It's great fun, and feels like you are all working together to build a better world.

If you are in to competitive games worried about kill/death ratio stuff, then this isn't for you. If you are tired of the same old crap paying 10 to 20 bucks for some silly new skin, this could be for you. It's both relaxing with times of intense terror thrown in to keep you on your toes. The story and world are also highly immersive.

It breaks every rule in the book, so wont be for everyone,  but for most of us it's an amazing game.

Quite a few criticise the story as unrealistic. IMO the story is actually far more real than the partly fake story’s we tell each other about the world in the news and other media.  I guess the reviewers who appreciate the story's relevance are maybe a step ahead of most  - e.g. they might know the very different way that Japan has already been responding to Technological Unemployment these past few years. They might be engaged in politics, rather than just hearing about it on the news.  They might read some of the most discerning writers on environmentalism like Cynan Jones or Kingsnorth.    Or just be more open than most to new perspectives.  And also not bothered by the literary liberties like the ""childish"" metaphoric character names.

One draw back of the game is that the hiking simulator part can feel like hard work especially when you need to haul a heavy load on the clock.  So maybe not a game to play after a hard days work  - even though it does have relaxing qualities,  as many mention.

52,DEATH STRANDING,75895862,english,"In Death Stranding you travel through identical landscapes between bases doing delivery quests for likes. You can build things like ladders and bridges to help with this since you will keep travelling that distance again and again. First time you arrive to a new base you unlock it's connection to other players. That means their ladders and bridges start appearing in your world, making travelling easier.

The story vibes of post apocalyptic anime but it feels like Kojima has these visions of certain moments, certain scenes, that are cool. It's just that they haven't successfully built up the in-game realism to justify the scenes. And there are plenty of glaring almost juvenile writing. A few examples that are straight eye-sores:

[list]
[*]The president dies in roughly the first scene, so her daughter is now the president? The US is a monarchy now? And her middle name is AMERICA?

 [*]The right hand of the president is called DIEHARDMAN and has a skeleton mask. DIE HARD MAN? Was that idea from a 10 year old? And the skeleton mask? He just has that. Noone else has any masks. Similarly we have DEADMAN. Your mother named you that? Or you thought it was cool so you chose that? Did you go to your colleagues and tell them that you were no longer John Smith, you were DEADMAN? [i] Now I'm definetly going to get the ladies! [/i]

[*]There is a woman leading a delivery company who wants to get in touch with you. You've met once and it was not a friendly meeting. Since you were sleeping she decides to use your shower while you are literally sleeping 3 meters away? Do you know any women that would break into peoples apartments that they've met once and then proceed to use their shower?

[*] There is a story with a couple that were separated in a disaster and you rejoin them, but it is so painfully badly written my eyes were bleeding. The girl who should probably be around 30 behaves like a 8-year old.

[/list]
It goes on.

My main problem in the end is the gameplay loop. Your reward for continuing to play is that you get more vehicles and eventually roads that you can grind up resources to build. These make travelling easier, like the game knows that it's boring so it rewards you with doing the boring things quicker. This type of gameplay has certainly been around a long time. I just think it's a bad one and I'm sorry to see Death Stranding take that route.

There is potentially some combat. Sometimes you enter an area with the ghosts called BT. However, you can just scan, take a few steps, and if you see one with your scan you can one shot them with a blood/poop grenade and then move forward. So you rarely need to actually fight. Certainly there are also some crazy humans in the wastelands but they can be avoided.

I think there is an overall message Kojima tries to convey here, about collaboration, about sending positive reinforcements. Sending likes. We work together against the hardships of the game by building bridges. If someone else has built a bridge that I make use of I send them a bunch of likes, similarly I get some when others use infrastructure I've built. [u]I really like that idea[/u]. Especially as a metaphor for society at large. But what if the gameplay was complex and interesting like Dark Souls? And we would still collaborate. It would have been a way better product.

I'm going to stop you right there. 

Ok, yes, in the most basic form you do spend a lot of time hauling stuff to and from, but in reality it really isn't that as a whole.
So, some backstory : I picked up this game based on the recommendation of my best friend. Before I picked up this game I had watched a few negative reviews (one was most notably by Video game Dunky,) talking about how boring and bad this game was.

Most reviews who complain about this game or who say that this is just a walking simulator, frankly, are simply spewing a bunch of misinformation and B.S. No really, they are.
The game is very much a stealth oriented, open world exploration game.

In fact, I would actually go so far as to say that the element of doing deliveries is more secondary (at least for me,) than going in and doing stealth runs or combat runs against Mules / BTs while I do optional deliveries that make the world a more complete place.

Just the other day I went and completed the building of a highway that lets people just drive cars around instead of hauling on foot. And, in doing so I had as much fun as I would have doing the open world elements of MGS as I do in this?
Why? I chalk it up to playstyle if anything else.


I've gotten a bit off track, but to summarize, this game is what I consider a hidden and niche gem. It's exactly like if you spent hours in the open world of MGS Phantom Pain but, with the focus being more on the development and stealth element, rather than primarily on the combat and recourse attainment element.
The world feels alive when you're contributing to the world and interacting with players, player's deliveries, and helping other players indirectly through their structures or other development projects. 

It's extremely calming, relaxing, exciting, and full of tension all at once. I really would recommend people this game if you loved the open world element of MGS Phantom Pain.",1599970979,1599970979,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,393,10,3145,929,700,1601998716,,

This game is not a ""walking simulator."" It has real gameplay, and it's very good. You just have to stick with the game long enough for it to open up.
The story is not ""nonsense."" It explains itself, and it's very good. You just have to stick with the game long enough for you to understand.
If you watched a youtuber play the opening hour of this game, and think it's boring, or garbage nonsensical storytelling, you have seen NOTHING, of what this game actually has to offer. It just takes a while to get there. The opening is designed to be slow, and the story at the beginning is designed to confuse you. If you just expect to understand the game's whole universe at the start of a 50-60 hour experience, then I don't know what to tell you. Boo hoo if a murder mystery novel doesn't tell you who the murderer is in the first chapter.
It's a slow experience, meant to be savored and enjoyed without trying to rush everything. If you can't deal with that and need instant gratification, this game isn't for you.

73,DEATH STRANDING,75868672,english,"Without even knowing, Death Stranding is the game I waited my whole (gaming) life for.

When I saw the E3-trailer 2018 I completely fell in love with Death Stranding – the confusing pictures, beautiful music and Norman Reedus as main character – I just had to play it. I nearly bought a PS4 for it, so you can imagine how I felt when it was announced on steam – I was jumping for joy.

You play as Sam Porter Bridges, one of a few package deliverers who supply the remnants of American civilization with the things they need to survive. Because of the Death Stranding, a cataclysmic event that wiped out most of the population, the remaining people live in fortified cities or underground shelters. You’re tasked to go from coast to coast to connect all cities and preppers onto a network to reunite them and make America whole again.

The structure of the story is multidimensional: As the Death Stranding happened several years before the story starts, the characters know the world and the (for the uninitiated seemingly) weird stuff that determines their days. Not much is explained in the beginning of game. As a player, you always sit on the edge of your seat and hope to grasp the bigger picture or get some kind of explanation for any of the incomprehensible elements of this game. But Kojima just throws more odd stuff at you.
I really liked this withholding of information. It made for a strong immersive experience and I played every day for many hours. It also allowed to focus a bit more on the gameplay (you unlock new equipment, weapons and modes of transportation in short succession) – just as it gets a little bit repetitive after the first half of the game, the story catches up and completely captivates you once again, only this time you get the (somewhat) coherent mind-blowing revelation.

The gameplay contains a really unique “semi-online”-mechanic. You can build structures – ladders, bridges, ziplines – to better traverse the ruins of former America. Other players can see and use your structures and you can use theirs. In Sam’s mission to cross the country all by himself, this gives a nice feeling of connectedness and the sense of striving for a common goal (despite never directly interacting with one another).
The currency is Death Stranding are likes. What sounds a bit bizarre at the beginning really adds to the motivation in the long run; just like we know today from social media, you really get that little euphoria boost every time someone gives you a like.

The cast of characters is just brilliant – from Norman Reedus and Mads Mikkelson to Léa Seydoux, Margaret Qualley and Guillermo del Toro – everyone fits into their role perfectly.
Music and soundtrack are often triggered when reaching certain points in the environment. Most songs are from Low Roar, though not produced for the game itself, fit into the story and the landscape like they were originally made for Death Stranding.

Sam says at the beginning: “I deliver packages. That’s all I do.” What’s sounds straightforward at the start quickly becomes much more – by delivering packages and rebuilding America, Sam – the lone wolf and outsider – becomes the new nation’s great hero. As he crosses the continent, Sam meets people, forges connections and puts his fractured past and therefore himself back together. He becomes a part of the world.

I like this game so much, I finished every achievement and spent a lot of time doing stuff that wasn’t really necessary. The game was just perfect for me at this point. The weeks I played it only really consisted of two things: Playing Death Stranding and thinking about playing Death Stranding.

What a game!

-The voice actors appear with their own likeness in the game. Some celebrities as well. Not one bad voice-over
-Not a sandbox. You go through a forward progression but it is open world and go at your own pace
-Many difficulty levels
-The horror part of it is really, REALLY frightening
-The story is built on cooperation- you and others in the game contribute to the success, or failure, of getting things done
-Real physics come into play when carrying things, as in you can lose your balance, fall ,etc., and weighted cargo in your vehicle can slow you down, just like in real life

Cons:
-not a point-and-click easy game
-You need to think- on inventory management, routes of getting places, and how to do it, with or without equipment, with or without facing ""the bad guys"" (no spoilers)
-If you are not ok with moral dilemmas, hard choices and having to keep people alive, even though some want to kill you, this is not the game for you
-If you're not ok with a game where you need to rest, eat, drink, build stuff to help yourself survive, this is not the game for you

Overall verdict: Outstanding. The information you get about a whole bunch of deep topics from the NPC's about what is going on is astounding. The story concept is wonderful. Frustrating at times because I didn't want to deal with some enemies, but had no choice. The horror is frightening, and you need to be quick on your feet and have a plan before encountering them on the way to somewhere, because you may not be able to save yourself if you don't.  When an npc offers you a blueprint to build something, it's for a reason. You can sometimes get by without it, in the next part of what you need to do to progress the story, but sometimes you can't and need to build it.

This has been my most anticipated for almost 3 years now since I had seen the original teaser trailers. My friends were quick to joke with me about how the game was going to be a walking and USPS simulator. But after I played this game I'm glad the game play is exactly that.

Death Stranding is now my favorite game of all time. There's something so magical and unique about it that no other game quite delivers on. At first I figured I would enjoy the Kojima story and the game play would be something to pass the time between the cut scenes, but I found myself staying up countless nights just completing orders and delivering packages.

Also you have a baby attached to your chest that detects these spooky ghost things that will pull you into the underworld. Also, you can't die, you kinda just respawn on a beach or something. 

When you build structures, other people will see it and can give you LIKES. Makes it easier for other people running through the game after you. And they'll do the same for you. Because we're all connected through STRANDS. Protip: when you get to chapter 3, prioritize building roads. It'll help you A LOT in the long run (or...drive...rather...)

Only 10h in, but so far I have  had a very unique, fun experience. Is it a walking simulator? Yes, it is a walking simulator. It is a massive open world filled up with outposts you can ignore or clear while you are walking around carrying massive cargo; which makes it up to you, if you wish to risk to clear the outposts or not. 

[h1] Lots of walking awaits you - or driving [/h1]

The map is clustered with tough terrains, cliffs, rivers, streams and rocks to make your journey hard and make your boots rip apart - until your feet are sticking out (literally). 
I'm currently playing on normal difficulty and I must admit, the game can be slightly too easy when it comes to combat (and yes, there is also combat). Melee and guns, among other stuff. Is it the best combat? Far from it, but it is fun and impactful. 

[h1] Not a spectator game [/h1]

I'm not going to go into full details and say you need 1000IQ to understand or like the game or story; you don't. Concept is unique, but it is still inspired. Story so far is good, albeit confusing, just like in Kojima style. I know I'm only 10H in, so I suppose it all gets explained over time. From a gameplay perspective though, this game is really good and really fun. It is a fun, interesting and interactive walking simulator. You will just have to play it to know if it's something you like or not - it is not a spectator game. Watching someone play it can be boring and not a good way to judge the game. It's not a good way to judge if the game is for you. 

[h1] CONNECT THE WORLD [/h1]

And the online part of it is really nice and feels rewarding and makes you feel as if you are contributing selflessly and making other player's trips easier. If you put down a ladder to use to cross over a small canyon, or climb over a cliff - that ladder, if you leave it, will be there for another player to use. If they are kind, they will award you likes.
Tools you use to help yourself, can help others.

[h1] TL:DR WHY SHOULD I PLAY THIS WALKING SIMULATOR? [/h1]

1. Good story so far
2. Depth in the gameplay (traversing tough terrain, managing cargo, balancing yourself, combat while shallow, is still fun and feels impactful)
3. It is fun to use all the tools at your disposal to traverse tough terrain (ladders to cross rivers or climb up cliffs, ropes to climb/descent a cliff/obstacle, or use vehicles to carry more cargo and faster)
4. Good atmosphere.

30,DEATH STRANDING,75814399,english,"Highly recommend this game if you're looking for something different, and by different I mean much different. To sum this game up, it's an innovation on the Open World genre and is definitely worth a play. I think Death Stranding is one of those [b]pivotal[/b] releases that does certain things so well that it will have lasting effects on the genre and gaming as a whole. If you're not convinced by the rest of these reviews who took this game for what it is instead of playing for 5 hours and whined because it's not MGS, I suggest you read on.

First, some background. I've been tired of the Open World formula for a long time mostly because it didn't leave me with any sense of accomplishment. In theory the idea of a Open World is great, an alternate reality where you can really sink your teeth into it's content and grow the world through your own effort. But most of the time they prove to be dull empty stretches of land with little reason to explore or ability to improve the game play experience. They tend to be very much of a grind which can be okay if the reward is great enough, however these games often don't have much of an endgame which means all your hard work just goes away once your done.

In come Death Stranding, where the beginning of the game is arguably the hardest part. You start off alone, in a barren landscape with little to help you on your journey from point A to point B. But as you play you unlock equipment which help make your travel easier, more efficient and downright more fun. You grow the world around you with lasting improvements to traverse the hostile terrain. And not only that, while you help improve your world with bridges, zip-lines, vehicles, etc; your structures bleed through into other players worlds and theirs the same. This by far is the selling point of this game and one of the key innovations that make it so great. I'll talk about this feature in detail in the next section.

[h1]Scratch their back by scratching your own[/h1]
Why is it so common for people to be toxic in a multiplayer game? Well it's fairly simple, it's fun to fuck with people. It's not always fun to be on the receiving end of the stick but oh boy can it be fun to be the one doing the fucking. But what happens when you create a game that, as a premise, is fucking you? Is fucking the entire player base by putting them on hostile terrain with demanding controls (demanding meaning you literally have to grip your controller to balance yourself and hold things in your hands). You would think that this would create a player base of annoyed, toxic children who just get mad at the game and make the experience worse from everyone around them. Quite the opposite, this player base has banded together as if the game itself is the boss. Not that playing the game is that bad, but just that it requires cooperation and community to do the best. 

Plus the game has zero competition at all, you could easily speedrun if you wanted but you know that you'll be crossing that same canyon again so might as well take the time to build a bridge instead of just putting down a ladder to cross. And then after building that bridge you get notifications when other players use it and those others players may put a generator next to it or help provide materials to upgrade it. It's amazing the amount of real interaction you get just by playing this game, without the chaos of having other players actually in it. There isn't any room for griefing and abuse, just a group of people trying to make the world a better place. 

[h1]Story[/h1]
Not gonna get into spoilers here but don't have much to note on the story. I'm at the very end of the game and from my understanding it's almost all cutscenes and story going forward. I'll update this once I finish but overall just wanted to give some general thoughts.

The world and lore is cool. There's a lot of interesting concepts this game presents and does it well with it's top notch graphics. The game is just beautiful and pairs really well with the story. I especially like the balance between Sci Fi elements and the Natural beauty in the world. Mountains and Canyons look like something I would have as my wallpaper. 

When I first typed wrote my opinion on the main character, I said he was boring. And while he definitely is pretty dull he has his moments and I couldn't think of someone else playing as Sam. I just wish that he took his performance to another level, it seems like he's just the exact same character from The Walking Dead.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
Death Stranding is a game you won't be beating anytime soon. It's something that sticks with you like a clicker or animal crossing. If you don't play for a week next time you login you'll see all the people who indirectly interacted with you while you were gone. You have a really interesting concept to follow along with and some pretty big questions that get answered along the way. The characters overall I think are well acted and tell their stories well.

What I found awesome:
[list]
[*] The coop aspects are really fleshed out, you can collaborate creating structures, delivering the packages of fallen players and sharing your equipment.
[*] The environments are breath taking, even if you don't like this kind of game, i recommend you to look up some screenshots.
[*] The cast is 10/10,  at first I wasn't really feeling it, but they really deliver. I cried more than once.
[*] The combat, yes this game HAS COMBAT and quite a lot actually. The more unconventional weapons are really fun to use.
[/list]

What I didn't found awesome:
[list]
[*] Some pretty important aspects of the history are hidden in written interviews, considering that you are more than 70% of this game walking it's a wasted opportunity to not use audiologs.
[*] The menus are stylized but are really slow and convoluted, you get used to them but they can be streamlined. You can at least skip every cutscene/animation.
[*] The game doesn't let you play the OST like in MGSV, that's huge wasted opportunity.
[*] Every difficulty lower than hard is just game journalist mode, i would love more difficulty settings.
[/list]

What I hated (Pls fix):
[list]
[*] The vehicles, the physics are really really bad, I don't understand how this game was released with these vehicles, they are serviceable, but you will encounter problems soon enough. This entire aspect of the game should be revamped.
[*] The songs, the game has a bad habit of just cutting songs if you get in an encounter and then not resume playback, this completely kills this moments. It's specially bad beacuse this system is implemented for when you rest.
[*] There is a serious bug in the ending chapter, that can completely kill the delivery of some pretty emotional moment. [spoiler] The BB Theme doesn't starts sometimes, i had to load the last checkpoint.[/spoiler]

I am not really a Kojima fan either since I had only played Phantom Pain and Metal Gear Rising: Revengence. So my expectations were low but I thought I would give the game a try, surprisingly I actually really enjoyed it. I would call it a hiking simulator since you have to plan optimal routes, pack cargo efficiently and keep an eye out for risky terrain you should avoid. When you  are a few hours in you are able to build roads and other structures like zip-lines in mid-late game which made the game really fun for me. Planning zip-line placements or building road networks to let me get from A to B as fast and safely as possible with minimal effort was very satisfying as someone who is very lazy and the effort to make these systems was enough to make it feel earned but not frustrating. I personally liked the story too as the world building was very well thought out and consistent, making it one of the better sci-fi plots. There are some parts which are about as subtle as being hit by a train involving Trump and the wall (which still hasn't happened yet) but I can generally forgive this because its mostly in optional reading material lore. Soundtrack is good too but you are not able to listen to it when outside your room, which feels like a missed opportunity but it makes the times when the music does kick in during certain parts of the story more special I suppose.

It is not for the faintest of heart and definitely requires a lot of patience as you will be making quite a lot of deliveries before the action starts (Episode 7 I think). For me personally, I didn't mind making the deliveries as the game blesses us with gorgeous visuals, amazing views/draw distances and a soundtrack which complements all of the above. My only complaint is that, right from the start the game just throws random terms from the lore at you (like DOOMS, BTs, Chiralium etc.,) and expects you to understand and know what all of this means. The least that could have been done, was an intro cutscene explaining the world/lore, instead of us googling every single thing.

So, not much different than a Florida highway.

This game is absolutely unplayable, and I don't just mean the god awful controls, tedious story, and repetitive tasks, but it also crashes randomly anywhere from 10 seconds to 1 hour into playing.

System is greater than ""minimum"" and and slightly better than ""recommended"", but every single time the game starts, my graphics settings are returned to default and I'm warned that my system ""does not meet  requirements"". Go back into settings, set correct resolution and switch from ""windowed"" to ""full-screen"", set graphics back to medium, and try to get more than 10 minutes of game play in at a time.

But that doesn't even matter because you find yourself trying so hard not to scream at just how clunky, awful, and all-around horrible the gameplay is. It seems that they spent a ton of effort designing the terrain of the first level, and then just gave up on everything else. Story? Bland, short, and not nearly as engaging as something you'd expect from Kojima. Controls? Worse than any MGS game ever. Driving? Holy potatoes, driving is just... I cannot express how BAD driving is in this game. And since 99.9999999999999999999999999999% of the game is driving on a highway back and forth between the same few places, it's so hard to put up with it.

The game also has a HUGE issue with double-, triple-, or just repeatedly pressing the same buttons that you've pressed only once. Different controller? Same issue. Keyboard and mouse? Same issue. Trying to open the menu? Well be prepared for it to open and close and open and close and open and close and...... You get the idea. Another massive issue is that it won't recognize you've STOPPED pressing a button, or pressed a different button. Driving straight and trying to stop, there's about a 10% chance that not only does the vehicle not stop, but it continues accelerating forward. Trying to stop Sam while he's running? About a 10% chance that he won't stop and just continue running. Sometimes the button to open a menu at a structure is ""X"", sometimes it's ""START"", sometimes it's ""Y"". Sometimes the button to pick up an item is ""Y"", sometimes it's ""X"". Some cut-scenes can be skipped with ""B"", but it's pretty much random which and when that works. You watch the same exact cut scenes dozens and dozens of times every time you sit down to play. Donate materials to a facility? Here's a cut-scene. Recycle materials? Here's an UNSKIPPABLE cut-scene. Set out on a delivery (which is all you do), here's a cut-scene. Want to rest in your room? Here's FIVE cut-scenes!!! Want to get in your vehicle? Here's a unskippable, unstoppable cut-scene where the NPC continue to move/attack you!!!!!! It's madness. It's stupidity. It's awful!

I have never in my life ever played a game that has controls as awful and clunky and massively irritating as this, and that's including Sekiro and MGSV.

The most fun I had in this game was the first 30 minutes, walking and navigating my way over rocks and mountains and streams using ladders and ropes and with the help of others. After that, you get vehicles, and you never walk anywhere ever again. Really? I thought this was a walking simulator? Not an unforgivably bad pizza hut delivery driving sim.

There's also combat?? In this game???? Why? It's such an afterthought. There's 0 effort put into the system (like literally every other system in the game). Combat had me ready to chuck my $60 controller across the room because it's just.... It's......... I'm running out of superlatives to describe just how poorly this game was made! And when your game crashes randomly multiple times every time you play... There's no point to even trying!

You spend your time building highways through ""enemy"" territory where groups of marauders will actively try to kill you (despite a death causing a ""void out"" which kills everyone within miles). Killing anyone would also result in the death of everyone there, so why the F^#& are they trying to kill me??? And WHY THE EVER-LOVING F^#& WOULD YOU PUT A HIGHWAY STRAIGHT INTO THEIR TERRITORY WHEN IT COULD BE PLACED AROUND THEM? Unfortunately you don't control WHERE the roads go when you construct them, it's all pre-set. Mind-numbing stupidity!

I do want to say that the first level is gorgeous. Probably the best looking level/area of any game I've personally played. I was in awe of the work and detail put into it. Great music to accompany the slow walking and navigating. Unfortunately this doesn't continue, and the subsequent areas are bland and boring and all you do is drive back and forth... back and forth... back and forth.... 

I am not a ""gamer"". I play a few games occasionally and suck at all of them. I just want to take my mind off of my day/work and enjoy something. So when the game IS work, and that work is even more irritating than customer service.... It's just no fun.

Yeah, this game is really different. But that's what makes it great, and ultimately its my favorite game since the first Mass Effect all the way back in 2007.

Performance wise, the game is incredibly well optimized. I ran it on max settings at 1080P with an RX590.  I've had a couple crash-to-desktops in 100 hours, but that might be more to blame on me running loads of other stuff in the background.

In terms of the gameplay... you know how in games like Skyrim, half the fun is just trying to find your way to where your going, and sometimes that means trying to glitch your way up a mountain, or find some aspect of the terrain you can exploit to make a shortcut. Death Stranding is like if you took that activity, refined the hell out of it, and made a full fledged game unto itself. There is very little combat in this game. 95% of it is trying to figure out how to safely get from point A to point B, or figuring out where you can build infrastructure to make trips between point A and point B faster and easier.

The main story can be completed in 30-40 hours if you stick to it, but you can easily spend twice that long if you do a lot of side content, or spend time building infrastructure. The story itself is also just lovely. Really something different and unique. It is very weird of course, as are all of Kojima's games. And while the story is especially strange in the beginning, Kojima actually does a much better job of bringing this in for a landing than any of the Metal Gear games.

A very unique game and a pioneer of its genre. Calling it a 'Walking sim' is almost unfair, since the depth of the mechanics and gameplay is way bigger than any previous games in the category. The delivery mechanics are well thought out, the various tools made available to you to help with your traversal, plotting your route taking into account various terrain obstacles and areas crawling with enemies, make it really satisfying once you reach your destination and looking back at the path you've taken, trying to make it even more efficient the next time you'll take it, especially with the multiplayer mechanic.

The soundtrack is great, coupled with amazing acting performances and great visuals and interesting characters. The story is very interesting and makes you think, however falls short in some areas and almost bashes you over the head with it's deep, metaphorical monologues which could be summarised as ""This is really [b]DEEP[/b], do you get it ?!"".

The game has big pacing issues, some areas of the game feel dragged out just for the sake of it, and make the game feel very repetitive and like a chore in a bad way (if you're a completionist good luck). Same can be said with some parts of the story that drag on with no real new information learned.

Without saying to much about the game, the basic premise is you are delivery man walking simulator. Except there are ghosts that you have to avoid, and cliffs you have to climb. the story elements are woven into these deliveries, each main delivery furthering the overall plot. there are also the standard (side) quests that you would expect. These side quests are there so you can flex on everyone else by getting stars for each one fully completed, as well as getting equipment upgrades that are honestly amazing.

Aside from just completing quests there is also making such quests easier to do by building structures, this can go two ways. Either one, you have played minecr*** and enjoy getting materials and constructing things that make your life easier or path prettier, or you don't. Though it can be time consuming i would recommend actually doing this, is it needed? No, not at all, however the sense of fulfilment that you get after completing such things is genuinely pleasing. Once again, i recommend playing this game to it's fullest as both completing deliveries in and of themselves, as well as making such deliveries easier are a big part of having fun with the game.
Aside from basic gameplay you can expect a sizeable amount of lore and in game communications from npc that make from some great in game reading (if you're into that).

	Some of the positives of this game as well some of the story line. 
The games visuals are absolutely stunning! I mean ill just stop and take screen shots to use later on for background pictures. Also, normally i do not leave the music in games on, this soundtrack though has been very enjoyable. I dont even mind that the walk will be tedious and long because the music and the visuals are so amazing. There have been a few times I climb a big mountain and I'll look over the edge and I'll get that falling feeling for a second in my stomach. I love it!
	
                    So, you play the game as Sam Port Bridges (Norman Reedus) and you're a courier of sorts in the apocalypse. Earth was consumed by what they call ""The Death Stranding"" which somehow merges the world of the dead with the world of the living. Your characher Sam is altered somehow and is able to sense what they call ""BT's"" which are the dead. You eventually acquire whats called a ""BB"" or ""Bridge Baby"" which is the creepiest thing ever but its basically a baby in a metal enclosure to simulate the baby still being in the mothers stomach. The ""BB"" helps you plug into ""the other side"" so you can see the ""BT's"". The ""Bridge Baby"" does need to be coddled and if you fall it will start screaming. Basically the ""BB's"" are typically not in service more than 1 year. They are pull from whats called a ""Still Mother"" which from what i gather is someone whos in a hospital bed. They have to make the ""BB"" think they are inside the ""Still Mothers"" womb for it to have the abilities it does. The ""Bridge Baby"" was totally a creepy idea but oddly enough it works for the story.
	
          You also realize really quickly that the rain is toxic somehow. They call the rain ""Time Fall"" and I assume its because if you dont find shelter or cover up, itll age you when it touches your skin so you lose ""time""  hense ""Time Fall"" really cool concept. 
	
          Upon delivering your first set of goods which just so happens to be where the president of the UCA (United Cities of America) is, which just so happens to be your MOM!
You find out the President is sick and she wants you to find your sister and then BAM! President dies. You're then tasked with bringing the President's body to the incinerator at the top of a Mountain. The reason it's at the top of a mountain is because when they burn a body they dont want this stuff called ""Chiral Matter"" to get in the air where people can breath it in as its toxic. Chrial Matter has something to do with the ""Death Stranding"" on the planet. 
	
          It doesn't take you long to find your sister as she shows up right after you bring your moms body to the incinerator and return back to Capital Knot City. Upon your return you are told the ""President"" needs to speak with you which is weird because you just brought her body to the incinerator. So of course I'm originally thinking ""these mother fuckers I do not trust them they staged a Coup d'etat but it ended up being my sister. Which I was like oh shit that was easy. But, she ends up being a hologram and you're told she is stuck on the west coast of the UCA by the enemy. You are stuck on the East Coast and must get to her. Her captors know she is talking to you and is allowed to have as much time to be with her people as a hologram as she wants which is really weird. Also, weird everyone for the most part are all holograms. Everyone seems to be somewhere else. 
	
You're goal so far is find your sister and start rebuilding America!

59,DEATH STRANDING,75672478,english,"Hideo Kojima is a nutcase. A beautiful, intangible mind. But I feel like going into detail for this review because this is the kind of game people won't understand ""why"" it's good or bad unless you lay out the specifics.

This story is wild and barely makes sense even after having finished it, but it was immersive and feels analogous to our current COVID-induced isolation and distancing from one another. As Sam Bridges, your job is trying to connect the people of America back together via the Chiral Network (a.k.a. ""The Internet"") after a mass extinction event tries to wipe out humanity and decimates almost all infrastructure. On the way to linking everybody together, you also deliver many (MANY) packages to those in need. It's well acted, well shot, and the music is well composed. Certain scenes could've used better writing though.

The gameplay loop is probably where most people will take issue with Death Stranding. You traverse a variety of difficult terrain on foot or via vehicle. As the story progresses, you also unlock a bunch of useful personal utility and infrastructure schematics to make your job easier. When an area is connected to the Chiral Network, you'll start to see other players' built structures crop up, once again meaning less work for you. I enjoyed the feel of conquering a tough area knowing it's only going to get easier to backtrack it from then on, and the scenery is certainly something to gawk at while you're completing your tasks. But, it is what you could consider an action-focused ""walking simulator"" going from various point A's to various point B's.

Combat and movement/sneaking has remnants of Metal Gear Solid V in it, but you lack a prone feature and a lot of enemy encampments are mostly flat earth so sneaking into a densely populated area proves particularly challenging aside from the occasional patch of tall grass to hide in. There is also no such thing as a day/night cycle in the open world so usually they see you from a mile away. I personally preferred to avoid conflict as Sam just doesn't feel adequately badass in those situations. You're very weak, ammo is limited, takedowns/melee feels like it whiffs half the time, and in the heat of the moment it's annoying navigating a multi-page emporium of weapons and contraptions to figure out what toy you should be using to best get out of your predicament. There's no more concise way to describe it all besides ""clunky"" in my opinion.

Avoiding BT's (the monsters of this game) can be fun and intense but other times made me roll my eyes when I'd waltz into a BT-infested area that was mischievously placed right before my goal destination, slowing down my traversal considerably. If you're caught by a BT, you're dragged over to a mini-boss and have to fight your way out (or literally just run outside the combat area and it disappears). Said mini-bosses are boring, repetitive, and I think they should've figured out a less wasteful punishment for being caught.

So why a positive review after so much ""eh""?

Memorability. Uniqueness. Impression. The open world was carefully thought out, the characters were quirky and lovingly brought to life by their A-tier actors, Kojima's zany vision for how the future looks and what advancements in technology may come are always a treat to see, and to top it all off for the PC version it not only looks jaw-dropping at unlocked FPS but we also get a great photo mode that I personally enjoy utilizing for games with a lot of eye candy like this.

There just isn't anything like Death Stranding on the market, and while I wouldn't go as far as to say it's its own genre like Kojima himself has infamously stated, I'd say we're not going to see something like this again for a very long time.

62,DEATH STRANDING,75671007,english,"Death Stranding isn't for everyone, but it's definitely for me.

Performance on this game is fantastic for a start, I only meet the minimum requirements for it which had me worried at first but I have had ZERO issues running this game, I booted it up, started playing half expecting to need to fiddle with settings to get a smooth frame rate etc, but no. It runs like a dream 10/10 performance.

The story is a typical Kojima story meaning its not typical at all, The world he has crafted here is fascinating and deep with concepts that it may take some time to wrap your head around, but fantastic none the less. If you're aware of SCP's the enemies/lore in this game gives me expertly written SCP vibes and I just want to learn more at every stage. 

The Gameplay is the thing that may make or break the game for you though. There has been a lot of memes about how this game is a UPS simulator, and they're not completely wrong, but they do sell the game short. Personally I love simulation games, I like the struggle to push through a long and medial task to receive a reward at the end, but even then I wouldn't call the tasks in Death Stranding ""Medial"". There is always something to keep you on your feet, whether its the possibility of a BT encounter and the tension that can bring, or an interesting formation of land that you think could use a structure to help traverse, then you have various useful items scattered around, packages dropped by other players that you might have cargo space to pick up and claim their reward for your own.

The multiplayer aspect is great too! Its a great feeling logging on the next day and having notifications telling you other players made use of and liked that ladder you left or the rope you put down to traverse a rock face. 

In summary Death Stranding is a great game if you're looking for this unique experience. If you are looking for something more like Far Cry, Assasins Creed or GTA, you won't find it here but if you're looking for something different, something unlike anything else, and delivering packages to unite a post apocalyptic world.

The idea of a game where online strangers help each other with random acts of kindness isn't brand new but it's done in such a way that it really hits you hard. It's unfortunate that with the massive amount of technology we have put into the internet, it seems we've accidentally created an environment where receiving hate from online strangers is normal. Facing a direct opposition to that feels almost wrong at first, helping others without any benefit for yourself, and receiving help from others without any expectation of a return.

its not a simulator, it is an adventure and an epic story almost a sci fi movie.

tip was to avoid some of the missions and concentrate on Sam's orders.  yes there was still walking to be done but then when you think of other games, you always have to do this sort of walking about.

Have you ever been wondering around your favorite video game map, grinding out tedious side-quests, and thought to yourself:  ""I wish there was a game just about this!"" Well here you have it. 

Here's how game-play goes: watch cut-scene movie for a while, then wander around for a few minutes; scan area, go pick up boxes. Careful not to trip and fall, or you could break a box! Excitement! Sometimes the screen will auto-zoom out, crank up some hipster music, and you get a full-blown perspective of what it looks like when a game designer gets WAY excited about himself. Usually those kinds of moments are built into a scene to help develop dramatic tension, or to emphasize some important event like the climax or big ordeal. Instead we get to experience an awkwardly forced, full-blown dramatic reveal of what might make a nice screenshot about every 4 minutes, complete with a screen tilt to reveal the ""Death Stranding"" title... again, and again... like a series of commercial trailers slapped together. I realize that not every game has to be about explosions and fighting all the time, but honestly, playing this game feels like an over-produced interactive advertisement. 

It just tries as HARD AS IT CAN to be some transcendental amazing experience, and really wants you to warship this Koji guy as some visionary, game-creating genius, and shoves it in your face every chance it gets. Here's a tip for everybody: The product should speak for the brand. If a brand spends more time trying to sell itself instead of the product, don't trust the product.


TLDR:
So here's what $40 gets you here:
-Daryl delivers boxes
-Pretty graphics
-Emo/Tween music, with no volume controls
and my fav:
-Don't trip and fall!

death stranding is basically just a Walking Sim But Better. its fun to run from point to point while you force sam to fumble over the slippery landscape. its fun to drive your truck over a mountain and listen to sam OOF and AUGH as you smash into rocks on the way down. getting the messages that other people have used your roads and interacted with your signs makes the game feel less lonely, without ever taking away your peaceful solo wandering. its also pretty funny to see the desolate spots other people have *weewee'd in.

very interesting to see how sams' relationships with the other characters in the game changes as you progress, and i think as a whole sam is a good character. he starts as a gruff idiot surrounded by people smarter than him, trying to help him understand their new world Stranded world---and he ends as a gruff idiot surrounded by smart people, but now he's begrudgingly fond of them.

for the negatives... the story is a bit of a *poopshow, but its not bad. you do have to wait until the last few chapters for things to be completely cleared up---the worst part about THAT, is that in the last couple chapters there is a part where it tells you what happens and makes you sit through a long sequence where credits play. then a chapter later it tells you what happens and forces you again to sit through a long sequence where credits play. unfortunately if you want to know all the story there's no real way to skip through any of the repeated shit without losing the little bits of clarifying information, and there's no option to skip through either set of credits---which is EXTREMELY annoying as they're spaced maybe 20 minutes apart and as far as i could tell it's the entire credits, both times. i'm all for handholding if your story is a bit convoluted, but this felt like the game was beating the story into me. twice.

the only other major failing of death stranding was the music. the music choice is DELICIOUS! but the music is constantly cut off and there's no way to play it on your own WITHOUT sitting in your private room and doing nothing. if you get too close to a landmark, the music stops. if you open a menu, the music stops---it'll start back up when you unpause, but for *fricks sake theres no reason it needs to pause unless there's dialogue. if sam can have a music player in his room, there is no reason he can't take a portable one with him. being able to play music on your own time would make the game 10000x better.


i'd still absolutely give the game a 10/10 as my enjoyment of it far outweighs my annoyances.

34,DEATH STRANDING,75609836,english,"I really liked this game, but I know it's definitely not for everybody. Most of the game is incredibly peaceful and relaxing package delivery, broken up occasionally by the odd bandit camp or ""ghost minefeild,"" which is higher tension but still feels like a natural transition. The story is pretty understandable, and the story setup is really interesting. I do have two major gripes about the game though.

1) The story based combat sections are insane difficulty spikes. I love a hard challenge, but 90% of the game has you cleverly avoiding enemies, and using the terrain to your advantage. Even if you do fight something, the enemies are complete pushovers and pose little challenge. Then out of nowhere at multiple points in the story, it tosses you an assault rifle and proceeds to kick your teeth in. I actually would have really enjoyed the difficulty as the sequences really feel like epic showdowns, it's just that these sequences are really long with no checkpoints. This means every time you die you have to repeat the last 10-15 minutes of stealth/combat/inventory management gameplay. The more ""supernatural,"" boss fights don't have this problem, and feel really natural and fun, even while being high energy and exciting.

2) The ""ending sequence,"" went on for about 10 hours. This is a Kojima game after all. From the time I went ""Ok, this is the final epic showdown,"" to the actual end, I went through 2 different (long) play sessions, 4 boss fights (including one of the aforementioned hard combat sequences), and 2 completely separate credit sequences. There's nothing bad about any of the individual parts and they could each stand on their own, but around the 8hr mark it's hard to keep your energy up and I just kind of wanted it to be over. It's also during this section that the story starts to fall apart a little, and raises more questions than answers, and not in a good way.

Would I buy this game again knowing what I know now? Definitely. Would I recommend it to anybody else? Probably very few people, but there are definitely some.",1599503375,1599503375,TRUE,1,0,0.523809552,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,160,35,3387,0,3387,1599459332,,

[b]Great Music[/b]: Orchestrated by Ludvig Forssell, an incredible score that really fills in the silence of walking hundreds of miles.
[b]Intriguing World and Story[/b]: An incredible and interesting take on Post-apocalism and a lawless America.
[b]Unique Characters[/b]: Every character has their own unique motives, packages and interactions.
[b]Unique Online System that makes the game excruciatingly painful without[/b]: Seriously, don't play without an internet connection, it's pretty much hardmode.

[h2]Cons[/h2]
[b]Combat is Lackluster[/b]: This I can give a pass on personally, as it's a story game not a fighting game, books don't exactly have the most incredible fight scenes now do the?
[b]Movement is Jank[/b]: The movement can be quite infuriating at times, but you can adjust to it eventually
[b]Non-stop tedious tasks and repetition[/b]: This is not a game for someone who wants a million different mechanics that are constantly changing 24/7. It is Tedious and Monotonous. That's the point.
[b]Lots of Talking[/b]: When Kojima makes a story game, he makes a story game, period. This is not a point to even argue about, as you should always expect talking in a story game.

[h3]Conclusion[/h3]
[b]Death Stranding is a game for people who just want to kill time.[/b] If you have nothing else to do but want a story that'll keep you invested, Death Stranding's for you. In the beginning the game can be stressful, but once you unlock Anti-BT weapons, the game is much calmer and you can be much more relaxed than before.

Currently i'm only halfway through the game so this inst a full review, but based on my experience so far. 
Death Stranding is like Skyrim, but with barley any fast travel, and its not terrible. The environment is beautiful and almost every time i enter a new area the view just gets more breathtaking, and their is alot of things to see, explore and do. While the online feature is really cool being able to team up with other ""porters"" to build bridges, roads, and even safehouses where the player can stay. Even though you cant see other players you can still feel like working together twords an objective. The story may be confusing at first but a deeper glance reveals all the lore that sets in a backstory for what happened to the world and the characters. The characters may start off bland and will make you want to skip every cutscene but eventually the turn into more interesting characters with compelling backstories. The game so far is long with also long cutscenes and many character building moments with alot of side-quest style missions which have the player going back and fourth between distribution centers. And while these missions can get very repetitve and lose grip of the player, they do build up the setting and plot. 

So far my opinion is that while the game is fun and a explorer's sandbox, the game starts off rough but settles into a compelling plot with interesting characters and lore. SO FAR i rate it a 3.5/5 for amazing artwork, scenery, Characters, and gameplay. 

Dm me if you have any questions.

77,DEATH STRANDING,75576395,english,"This game is a huge wasted opportunity. The core gameplay, which is essentially a hiking simulator through a bleak, post-apocalyptic landscape, is also fascinating. I love the idea of a nice, slow game where exploration and atmosphere are more important than run-and-gun combat. Death Stranding provides an open world whose physical contours are more fully realized than any other game I have played. You spend a great deal of time traversing this world on foot while balancing an enormous pile of things on your back which need to be delivered. There is an element of ""The Postman"" in all of this, as the act of carrying goods from one city to another bonds people together who have been isolated by a...well...unnatural disaster of epic proportions. The setting, which is supposed to be the United States, looks more like Iceland than anything else. It is also much, much smaller than you would think. Fortunately, the landscape is quite haunting and lovingly rendered. It is strangely satisfying to navigate, as long as you aren't looking for any actual connection to the good ol' US of A. 

There are just too many aspects of this game, however, which irritated me to no end. The story is bonkers. It is a turgid mix of puns, third-rate philosphy, surrealism, spirituality, furrowed-brow artistic ambition, and icy science-fiction. There were several times, during the many, many cutscenes that I had flashbacks to the starting screen from ""Bad Dudes"" on the NES...you know, where the President was kidnapped by ninjas. That's the wavelength this game is on. It makes Luc Besson's movie ""The Fifth Element"" look restrained by comparison. 

This could all be forgiven if the ridiculous cutscenes would get out of the game's way, but they constantly elbow their way in and spoil the fun. I found myself spending far too much time frantically trying to skip through one cutscene only to jump right into another one...and then another one. I never made it to the end of the game where, according to what I've heard, the cutscene orgy gets spectacularly overblown. 

I love open world games. SubNautica, Green Hell, and others have proven that solitary explorations can be compelling without explosions and combat.

Story: 
(Disclaimer I haven't fully finished the game) but if you're interested in mind bending Sci-Fi then this is a good one for you. Much of the time you're thrown into the fray without much context and you have to dive into the world to put pieces together for yourself. You will be asking more questions about what is going on then there are answers. I am hesitant to divulge much because part of why I've enjoyed it was because I didn't know what it was truly about. But that's what makes the game so special in a sense; it's refreshing to be so confused in a crazy narrative. In a basic sense the world, in this setting America, has been brought to near extinction from an event. Your character is tasked with helping the fractured country come together, dealing with a terrorist organization that doesn't want you to succeed, and navigating the horrors of what the event has done to the world. In typical Kojima style the cutscenes can be both breathtaking and engaging as they can be boring and bloated. Some cutscenes I really enjoyed but other times I was losing patience and just wanted to play. But I feel like if you've enjoyed the Metal Gear Solid franchise then this isn't too far off from those kinds of vibes. Kojima definitely has a ""Kojima"" feel in his games and you can tell he's involved from a mile away. He can get a bit over the top in what I might consider needless complexity but that's just the way he makes games. Overall Kojima is a mastermind of complex weird ideas and it really shines here. 

Gameplay: 
This is where the game gets into its unique niche. You're mainly going to be tasked with delivering various things from outpost to outpost, traversing difficult terrain on both foot and vehicles. In theory it's fairly straightforward and in practice it can be quite repetitive. But you are offered limited freedom on how exactly you want to get to your destination. You have access to craft a variety of tools like ladders, bridges, towers, ropes, etc, to utilize where you see fit in the world. There are dozens of routes you can create on your own to complete your journey in whatever way you like. You have to be careful with your cargo as it can get damaged and part of the challenge of the game is to safely get from point A to B cresting mountains, rocks, and cliffs. If you overload your carrying capacity you'll be prone to falling and if you neglect your footing you can fall off a cliff in an instant. Part of the gameplay is to balance your cargo as you walk and make sure you don't tip over. You will be tasked with special requirements for certain deliveries; some being dependent on low damage and some being timed. There are story objectives but plenty of sidequests to keep you busy. You get different rewards from different outposts that can help make life easier for future deliveries. As odd as that all sounds it's pretty fun to just sit back and enjoy the lonely peaceful treks. Occasionally somber music will accompany you and the rain will start falling to set the mood for the struggles you'll face. There are multiple maps that offer some variety and room to breathe in a new location every now and then. The game offers harsh environments and there is little comfort apart from the help provided by other players (more on that below) 

Combat:
The game doesn't have much combat in the traditional gaming sense but during your deliveries you will run across ""mule"" territories. These guys are basically out to steal your stuff and part of the challenge is either avoiding them, taking them out with stealth, running, or punching them in the face. You do get tools like smoke grenades for escaping and a bola gun to help take them down with non lethal finesse. They do have loot you can steal but if they take you down you'll have to sneak back into their camp to get your stuff. You will also encounter ""BTs"" and without spoiling much they are essentially ghost-like creatures that you will need to sneak past or deal with in other ways. They can offer tense moments between deliveries where you have to sneak by several while holding your breath. You use a baby to help detect them (I know it's odd) and this baby will accompany you throughout your journey. There are other tools I haven't mentioned here that you will be able to use in combat situations; the main point being you have some freedom on how to approach every combat situation and plan ahead. You'll have to make conscious decisions on whether or not to sacrifice delivery cargo space or bring along additional weapons to deal with threats. Part of the gameplay is weighing your risks and prepping how you see fit. There are also bosses that you'll face but again without spoiling much I can't say much more. The last comments I have is that combat does get rather repetitive after the first few instances in one location. I think it loses its charm after you eventually backtrack through an area after your 20th delivery. 

Multiplayer Element:
In my opinion this is where the game really shines in a humble way. Equipment that is placed by you can potentially be used by other players to their advantage while they are pursuing their own journeys. If you place a ladder across a river it helps not only you but any other players who need to cross there can get across safely as well. Additionally, over time, you can see the paths that players have created that can give you a good idea of the best ways forward. Players can also leave markers that show up in the world that can provide warnings of danger ahead, helpful hints, and even encouraging words. You can leave ""likes"" on facilities that you've used or markers that you've found helpful. Overall this aspect of the game creates a positive bonding experience with complete strangers in a way that few games have done. It's a great feeling knowing that your equipment or signs have helped others. 

Graphics/UI:
This one is fairly evident but the game looks stunning. The landscapes, characters, items, and everything in-between has intense detail that keeps you super immersed. I would wager they used Iceland as a reference for the landscapes that are seen in the game as they managed to capture the bleak, lonely, and beautiful scenery portrayed there perfectly. The animations are all buttery smooth and speak well of the time that went into development. The UI and menus are complicated/overwhelming at first but you eventually familiarize yourself and can navigate them well enough. The maps and menus offer a host of tools that help you traverse the game and gain intel on whatever you might need. In my time playing I have seen no glitches or errors of any kind; they really did well here. For a PC port it runs perfectly.

Conclusion:
It's a weird game that tries to go against the norm and I believe it has succeeded in several ways. Kojima has a fantastic mind and has come up with some unique ideas that I haven't seen before. It's a refreshing Sci-Fi story that keeps me interested as I press on to make sense of things. They definitely took some risks and I'm sure many people will be bored or alienated from the game. There are a lot of repetitive aspects that bring the game down as a whole and it's unfortunate they weren't able to add more variety in the gameplay loop. Without nitpicking too much the game does suffer from a tediousness that can get old very quick. I think most of the issues are not game breaking but you can get burned out and bored very quick if this game isn't for you. The involvement of other players in your own singleplayer story was a fantastic touch that uplifted the game without really affecting the story, without it I think the game would have suffered greatly. It's an imperfect but unique experience I'm glad to have played.

87,DEATH STRANDING,75570413,english,"[h1] Presentation [/h1]
Death Stranding will surprise you with a very deep and cinematic experience that shows you exactly what type of world and game you're gonna get into.
The beginning hours may feel too overwhelming for the average gamer, throwing at you too many concepts about life, death, sci-fi, supernatural and survival elements right away in a seemly post-apocalyptic America.

[h1] Story [/h1]
Probably the strongest feature in the game is the story. It is slow and part of it being told through flashbacks, but once you start to link all the pieces you'll discover a great, well-crafted story that is worth the wait.
It will always keep you wondering what's gonna happen next, as you learn more about the world of Death Stranding, its characters, past incidents and other pieces of information only discovered via interviews and emails.
Narrative-wise, the story is divided by episodes, providing long cutscenes specially at the end of each episode, building more tension and unfolding a journey until it reaches its climax ending that's not easy to forget any time soon.
The only downside to this is the vast open world and gameplay that break the immersion and distract you from the main plot.

[h1] Gameplay [/h1]
By far the weakest aspect of Death Stranding is the gameplay. The story itself can be really interesting and unique, but it all boils down to walking/driving long distances to make deliveries, it's really all the game has to offer and while it can get addicting as you'll always try to take on the next order, there's no denying how poorly designed the gameplay actually is, almost abusive even as you constantly stumble, tip and fall over basically easy to walk grounds.
When it comes to the game physics and collisions, it's probably one of the worst in recent years for a game of this caliber, with the main character, objects and vehicles moving in a very strange fashion and having almost over exaggerated animations.
There's absolutely no quality content except for the main orders and maybe a few standard orders, the progression system is always the same, consisting on gaining trust for different facilities and preppers by making deliveries to get new equipment or leveling up certain equipment or weapons.
Engaging in combat is totally optional, there's no reward by doing so unless it's related to certain retrieving item orders from hostile territories, although it's acceptable, it's not a game about killing, bur rather connecting and striving as one.

[h1] Visuals [/h1]
The game looks beautiful, with absolute stunning areas and a decent photo mode. The Decima Engine stands as one of the most advanced game engines graphically-wise speaking. The water simulation, character models, grassland and draw distances are actually pretty nice.

[h1] Sound Design and OST [/h1]
The music and sound design is really on point. From vehicle sounds to basic actions such as footsteps, ghostly voices, combat music, you name it, it all sounds great.
The game features a very sad, ambient, romantic and even nostalgic feeling OST by Low Roar, Silent Poets, Chvrches, Alan Walker, Khalid, Bring Me The Horizon, and many other artists which did great with tracks that offered value to the story.
Once again composer Ludvig Forssell did an amazing job with the music score.

[h1] Technical Issues [/h1]
This game suffers form Access Violations on multiple threads, also having memory and GPU leaks. Access Violations errors (which causes the game to crash and losing your progress) may have been caused by running scripts from the Decima Engine itself and as of version v1.02 they have not been fixed.

I don't understand why is everyone saying this game is not for everybody. In fact it's a game everyone should experience at least once, if only because of its story, world, lore and visuals. Not everything has to be a shooter, action or RPG to be a great game that everyone must play or just a great piece of art in general.
With Death Stranding, however, if you can put up with its ridiculously repetitive gameplay and funky physics, you can find a really memorable journey, one that will not be forgotten for a long while.

So, down to it. Death Stranding's world and lore is very interesting, though very weird. You can tell its a Kojima game, simply because the story is really... well, vague and kinda boring. I loved the voice acting, and they chose some really great actors for that, so that's a plus, but it all falls apart when the story they're trying to push along barely makes any sense or completely loses you halfway. Most of my time in the cutscenes was trying to understand and figure out wtf was going on.  
I'll admit, the gameplay in Death Stranding is barely there. There's packages that you deliver from point A to point B, and maybe you avoid some invisible monsters on the way, and a cutscene every now and then. That's literally the entirety of the game, even to advance the story. BUT the little gameplay mechanics it has, it does [i]extremely[/i] well, which I can commend them for, they didn't try adding in 5 billion different mechanics and end up half-assing them all. Buuut it could've done with something more.  
Graphics are stunning, though the landscape is super bland, empty, and dead. Settlements are (almost) all underground bunkers so all you see are the same delivery warehouse assets for each location. Would've liked to at least see what the inside of these are like.  
Performance is phenomenal, though at release there was big stutters, freezes and frame-skips (can't confirm if that's been fixed recently). A big plus if you've got an Nvidia RTX card is DLSS 2.0 drastically improves performance and even makes the game look better. Probably the best console port I've seen to date.  
You can tell Kojima's proud of his work because he plasters his name all over the credits. I gotta admit though, guy's no professional movie director, and it shows. I've seen better directing in small-budget indie films or no-budget indie shorts. The story kept me intrigued, simply because I love weird stuff, but its not a point id praise the game over.  
IF you want to give it a try, be warned that it starts to get interesting well after the 2hr mark (in my experience, though I didn't rush through either).",1599428972,1599428972,TRUE,2,0,0.533494771,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,435,84,1839,0,1839,1594970036,,

The story is gripping and keeps you thinking constantly. 
The acting is great. 
The soundtrack is pleasant. 
The gameplay is engaging, makes you think and plan while also being very rewarding with lots of different styles of playing to choose from.

BUT, let me just give a slight warning: Try not to grind too much, don't focus on side stuff too much, continue the story here and there. I've played the game quite a bit and focused too much on 100% everything, so I got a bit fed up with the gameplay towards the end. BUT that was my own damn fault.

97,DEATH STRANDING,73393014,english,"As of writing this review, I have not finished the game yet, but I've come to my conclusion.  There will be spoilers so read at your own risk.


Death Stranding is by no means a typical game.  When it was originally released many called it ""boring"" or ""intentionally frustrating"".  I think that these are both lies.  At first, this may feel like the case, but slowly the game's ever increasing difficulty creeps up on you.  First you start out simply walking through a valley between two stations to deliver some documents, then later you're forced to scale entire mountains in the middle of a blizzard to deliver fragile lifesaving medicine all within a time limit.  Each area of the map feels meticulously crafted to provide a challenge to you.  There's no one ""right"" solution to get around each problem.  The fastest methods can mean multiple trips and leaving your cargo behind to degrade in bad weather, but at the same time, slower yet higher-volume methods can mean trekking through BT territory with a full load of cargo and risking losing it in a deadly fight.  Achieving S rank on all your deliveries, especially on higher difficulties, becomes a major challenge that pays off so well when you fully max out stars on a prepper.

The gameplay, however, is not the best part of Death Stranding.  What makes Death Stranding art to me is the masterfully written plot and characters.  Each and every character feels like it was given hours of writing and development before the game was released, even the minor side characters.  Every single character in this game has their own unique struggles, trauma, and backstory that explains why they act the way they do.  Some see Fragile Express and Bridges as terrorists, coming to take away their liberty, and some eagerly join the UCA, hoping to save others from the same suffering that they've endured.  Watching Mama send her BT child into the ""other side"" and thus sacrificing herself to help Sam expand UCA was one of the first time I have ever had a game make me cry.  The acting is world-class, making every character feel so real.  Heartman's story of losing his family and going into cardiac arrest every 20 minutes just so he can have even the slightest chance of seeing them one more time is truly painful.  Reedus and the rest of the cast bring the characters from being characters to real people who all struggle just the same as we do.

There are times in this game when you feel truly alone, walking a lonely path, simply a porter living just to transport cargo.  The fucking fantastic soundtrack hammers this feeling in so well, kicking in on long stretches.  However, for each of these moments, there are so many more times where you are reminded that you are not the only one who struggles.  Other players' structures can save your cargo and your life at times.  Together with everyone else you can build you own infrastructure that allows players to get around safely.

The ultimate message of Death Stranding is that we are in this together.  Despite every characters differences they can all come together to save America.  I often stop to think that, despite likely never interacting with any of the people who's building I use or who use mine, we have connected ourselves through this online game.  In uniting players in one grand struggle, Kojima reminds us how important unity and community is.  Every single person who plays this game is connected and relies on one another to survive and ""save America"".

So, if you want an action-packed bloody mess like Ghost of Tsushima (which looks fucking amazing btw) or Call of Duty, I don't blame you in the slightest.  This game will [b]NOT[/b] be everyone's cup of tea, but if you like Kojima or don't mind a slower paced story oriented game, I beg you to give Death Stranding a play.

The game if definitely over-hyped and over-praised, but is still on the good side.

The story while not phenomenal is innovative and decently interesting (if you can overlook some of  the new age mishmash it is based upon) and it is definitely the best part. It is mostly well told and most importantly, although confusing at times, is presented in sufficient detail. The main characters are fantastically well acted, beautifully animated and the main cutscenes are masterfully directed.

All the main characters are well designed and each has his/hers unique story and place in the grand scheme of things. The support characters though range from bland to cringy to fairly annoying. All characters names are puns of some sort - Barbara Strand, Die-Hardman, Heartman.... I personally find that quite irritating.

Also most of the characters are designed with some form of shock value intended to force an emotional response out of you. And when it has served it's punch, they're usually discarded. (even some of the main cast)

The story suffers from some pacing issues. It starts well with the right mix of exposition and gameplay. Then it drags a bit in the middle when you travel across the country connecting stuff. Then it picks up again , then races through by the end, dumping huge amounts of exposition. And while the main storyline is fairly conclusive, some of the supporting stories are either underdeveloped or left unresolved.

The gameplay is exceptionally narrow. The entire game you do one thing and one thing only - carry packages form A to B. Literally all missions consist of this, except one or two tutorials and a few action sequences. The monotony is only broken by a few stipulations. The packages you'll have to deliver will sometimes have to be wrestled from bandits and sometimes collected from a remote area. Also there are various types of packages, some with restrictions on how to be handled. And sometimes you're tasked with carrying a live bomb which has to be meticulously babysat.

Thankfully you have a lot of tools at your disposal to get the job done. There are various climbing gear, boots , exoskeletons and vehicles that help you carry the packages over the roughest of terrains. There is also a set of buildings to be built. Some of them help immensely on the way.

One very cool feature is the passive interaction with other players. You can use buildings , vehicles and equipment left by others to help you on your way and you can also leave stuff for others to find. One annoying part of this though is that the game takes every opportunity to bombard you with communist propaganda urging you to do so.

Controls mostly logical and satisfying and keep the flow going. UI is mostly sensible. Although there are a lot of menus, once you get used to them, you can navigate easily. One minor annoyance is whenever you unlock new equipment, it is usually presented to you in a cutscene. Then a large text box appears, explaining how to use it. Then somebody calls you - Hey, by the way, did you know that you can now do ... whatever was already explained twice.

The game overall looks great. The character models are meticulously detailed and the colors are very true to life which I love. The world design though leaves mixed feelings. It definitely has  it's fair share of beautiful vistas and scenic spots, but most of the time you're looking at just mosses and rocks. There are mostly three types of terrain - green mossy fields , snowy mountains and something that faithfully resembles the surface of Mars.

19,DEATH STRANDING,75539066,english,"I just wish to start by saying that I have over 200 hours on the game on PS4, even though it says I only have around 9 Hours as of writing this review. 

I've seen many people say that the game is nothing but a movie, with no gameplay and only cutscenes, and while there are long cutscenes in the game, it's wrong to say that this is just a ""60 Dollar Movie"" and not a ""60 Dollar Game"" I'll be going into spoiler territory so for those who wish to experience the game themselves can stick to the TL:DR at the bottom.

You start off the game as Sam (Played by Norman Reedus). You are a porter, a person whom handles packages and deliveries in a post apocalyptic america. Your primary objective is to deliver packages to people who need it and connect them to the Chiral Network (Basically the Internet but cooler). In the beginning, you can only carry the packages on your back and walk to the destinations. You have access to ladders, ropes etc to help you traverse the land covered by rivers that can wash you away, rocks that can make you slip and fall and so on. As you progress through the game, you get items that can help you with your package deliveries. 

You will unlock cars, bikes, zip lines etc to make your life easier. I've seen people complain that the zip line makes the game trivial because it takes away all the challenge to climb mountains and stuff, but I have to disagree, is it's just a tool in your disposal that allows you to tackle challenges in different ways. Does it become a lot easier to climb mountains with it? Yes it does, but that shouldn't be a negative thing. You're rewarded for setting up and maintaining these zip lines that allow you to complete deliveries faster and safer, just like how a Truck driver gets his job done faster and safer because he's driving a truck. 

As you continue through the game, you come to realize that most of the gameplay loop revolves around you picking up packages, and delivering these packages. This might not be for everyone, but saying that there is no ""gameplay"" at all because of this is plain wrong. 

You have enemies that you must fight, enemies you must hide from and different environmental mechanics like slipping, getting washed away, losing balance etc. This game revolves heavily on taking smart paths, while not losing and destroying your cargo that people so desperately need. You also build structures to help other players in the game, something that is my favourite part. 

TL:DR: Is this game for you? Well, that depends entirely on the person who's looking to buy. For me, this is the best game I've played in a very long time. I find it very chill to just do deliveries and traversing the beautiful landscape. If you find games like Euro Truck Simulator fun, then this game could be very much for you.

33,DEATH STRANDING,75524813,english,"[h1] SPOILER FREE REVIEW [/h1]

At the time of this review, I am 31 hours in. Will update when finished the campaign.

[h1] Story [/h1]

If I had to ratio this game's appeal, it'd be 80% story and 20% gameplay mechanics. Let me explain. Inside of the first half hour, you already begin to feel a gleaming sense of familiarity as [i] Death Stranding [/i] has that classic Kojima touch we've all come to love. The way it almost feels you're playing a large budget film at times with tracking shots, close ups, overhead shots of the world. Talk about big on presentation. Over the course of this long journey, we're developing unique relationships with those we come across. [i] Death Stranding [/i] takes its time fleshing out the world, dispensing information at an infrequent yet rewarding rate. Should you be patient enough between each story beat, it certainly unloads enough to compel you to move forward and unlock more of the confusing yet fascinating story. 

[h1] Gameplay [/h1]

So let's address the elephant in the room. [b] Yes, this is a niche game. No, not everyone will enjoy it. [/b] When it comes to the gameplay, [i] Death Stranding [/i] revolves almost entirely around delivering packages. You are, in fact, a porter. It isn't just a title. The entire world surrounding you has been constructed in such a way to provide challenging ways for you to traverse it. Elements like weight, movement speed, package location and various tools at your disposal all play a part in your success of getting a package from Point A to Point B. Some may joke this game is considered a [b] Walking Simulation. [/b] You're free to view it that way. 

This is not [i] Metal Gear Solid. [/i] If you come in expecting massive bouts of action and shooty shooty gun kill EXPLOSIONS!!!! ... You'll be sorely mistaken. Yes, there are ELEMENTS of combat, but it certainly is not the main focal point in any way, shape or form. Though if you come in with an open mind, you'll find that the 'way of play' you're encouraged to try can be quite enthralling, too. Devising careful paths and approaches to overcome the dangerous obstacles standing in your way and executing them flawlessly, or failing miserably and improvising a way to get yourself out of a mess can make for exhilarating moments.

[h1] Fidelity/Fluidity [/h1]

Simply put, this game was meant to be played on PC. What a flawless port. The world as you step out into it is vast and colorful, with gorgeous terrain scattered all around you. Easy on the eyes when you're engaged in playing or taking a break to just admire. The character models, especially in cutscenes, are bar none some of the most impressive I've seen in ages. That IS Norman Reedus. That IS Mads Mikkelsen. Down to the spottiness of Norman's facial hair to the creases in Mads' face. Truly impressive stuff. Running the game at a consistent 60 frames per second or more absolutely makes for a fluid play experience. Couldn't go back to the hard 30 on console, personally. Many of the encounters you'll come to face can partially rely on the sounds emitted and my goodness, does it do it well. In certain scenarios, the noises made by certain... THINGS have absolutely creeped me out. That's a good thing. Sound good. 

[h1] Overview [/h1]

It's no secret that [i] Death Stranding [/i] isn't for everyone. Your main player base here are proper Kojima fans, story-rich lovers and appreciators of new experiences. That's exactly what this new IP from Kojima Productions provides you with- an experience unlike any other you've ever had. Is the game perfect? Of course not, none is without their shortcomings. But I'd be remiss to give any other impression than my honest one, which is solely that the pros FULLY outweigh the cons. If you can stand or prefer long play experiences, compelling story, unique gameplay and thinking you know what's going on only to be dead wrong over and over again, look no further. THIS is what a sixty dollar game feels like. Absolute major props to Hideo Kojima and his whole studio for putting together such a remarkable experience in such a relatively short window of time.

47,DEATH STRANDING,75513071,english,"[h1]Overall impressions[/h1]
Delivering packages and building infrastructure is unexpectedly satisfying but may turn off some as being a bit grindy when it comes to resource gathering.  I had reservations before release upon hearing the early details of the mechanics, it did not exactly sound engaging on paper as glorified fetch-questing.  This was unfounded though, as the general process of getting from one place to another has plenty of nuanced mechanics that reward attention to detail and planning.  Aside from that, the narrative and characters all line up with expectations for a Hideo Kojima game - a bit over-the-top in a way that tends to be very memorable.

[h1]Nitty-Gritty[/h1]
The main loop is simple - chose packages to deliver from point a to point b.  The underlining mechanics though encourage the player to consider terrain, prepare by choosing a route either from other players or their own, optimize their load and orders and pick out tools for the job.  When out in the environment, the topography of the trail can be scanned in-game to give visual indications of bad footing.  It also helps highlight other packages that are may be picked up along the way.  Most of the time when progressing through the story they are for previous areas and would require back-tracking to complete but can be worthwhile to stock up in a private locker or to pass off to other players to finish for a reduced rating.  Walking in those areas tend to make it harder to balance and can easily lead to tripping when running.  If you fall, packages get scattered and potentially damaged, which will lower your rating for the delivery.  Most of the time this is easy to avoid though unless you purposely load up too many items.

The online elements provide indirect co-operation in three main forms: signs, buildings and tools.  The signs can be placed in order to provide boosts or warnings to other players.  Tools like ladders and ropes that are used in the environment can be seen and by other players or may appear in your game.  Buildings act similarly but have more specific utility such as storage containers in which packages can be stored for later delivery or left for other players to finish.  These are all related to the overall progress that has been made on an area - as when you first enter, very few tools or buildings appear.  As you gain more reputation (in the form of likes) from the area's inhabitants via the main terminal, the more other players items appear.  You can also add likes to the items form other players and receive them - resulting in bonuses for stats.  Using them often will reward one like for the player who left and item, but you can button-mash to add a lot of likes for those that you really appreciate.

Those concerned with having some actiony-bits will be pleased to know that there are two other main aspects to deliveries - mules and BT's.  Without getting into the details of the story, BT's provide the main stealth portion of the game and mules the gun-play.  Granted, either can be approached interchangeably as you get access to more tools.  Your engagement with them can vary, as sometimes it is often required in order to get into new areas but later can be beneficial to seek them out for resource gathering.  Each generally are only found in certain areas, so they can at times be avoided entirely if you know where to go or pay attention to the community signs.

Aside from that, there are enough smaller-scale mechanics that make it difficult to get into them all.  As an example, you can make Sam pee – which I would normally expect to be a throw-away addition but instead has varied affects.  Doing so in the environment results in mushrooms and has a cumulative size based on the efforts of player contributions.  On the PS4, the community decided to do so in one specific spot in front of a character’s home [spoiler]Conan O’Brian’s[/spoiler], which in response I naturally marked with a Deep River sign.

[h1]Some Strategy[/h1]
Most seem to recommend not worrying too much about ratings until you get at least into chapter 3 mainly due to new items you receive later in the game: roads and eventually zip-lines.
Throughout the central region there are road drop points that require a lot of resources - ceramics, metal and crystals.  The total amount required can be alleviated by contributions from other players though.  The precise nature of this is not very clear, but the result is that for the most part you can be the sole provider of all the materials mainly in areas which have not yet been connected to the network.  Once an area is connected, the higher the rating and connections made, the more will appear to be added from other players to the various road build points.  You potentially avoid spending much (or at all) on completed road sections in this manner but they are also a massive source of likes.  Often completing a few sections of road can lead to getting enough likes to hit the soft cap on the player-related stat.  Other than that, they also provide constant power for vehicles on the central line and relative safety from mules and BT's.  Keep in mind though that mules can hit you from unexpected places if you are not traveling at high speeds.

Zip-lines on the other hand provide quick transportation form one area to the next.  The main catch though is that they are very network-intensive per node, and usually require some finessing.  Based on your current ratings in each area, the network determines how many structures you can build based on a bandwidth point value.  Zip-Lines themselves take up quite a bit at 500 a pop.  They also have limits to length (300 regular, 350 level 2) and require line-of-sight.  These can be used to easily connect areas that otherwise do not connect directly to roads, making speed deliveries for S+ ranks much easier to complete - or possible at all for those that are speed-based.  Additionally, the eastern region can be networked with zip-lines to the point in which all terminals are connected.

[h1]Some Dark Souls[/h1]
As much as I probably should avoid it - a lot of things I like in Death Stranding are comparable to Dark Souls.  The online features build upon the foundation of Dark Souls and Demon's Souls use of World Tendency and player notes as a sort of multiplayer-but-not-directly-multiplayer approach to building a community.  The commitment to atmosphere in both is strong and includes aspects of the lore into gameplay in a way that many games do not.  Death provides more of an inconvenience, not a hard-stop, allowing players to maintain immersion even when they fail.  There are some game-over screens but they tend to be limited to boss-battles and specific story missions.

[h1]Something Personal[/h1]
The themes of the game resonated in a way that I really did not anticipate, but probably should have guessed.  My wife is home-bound due to illness (MCS), and so much of my time not working as an early father was spent gathering things we needed from the outside world while carrying my daughter in a wrap.  The similarities obviously stop there, but in the playing of the game it endeared me more and more to Sam and BB as characters.  Throughout the story there are moments that made me even wonder if the director was a father himself - which apparently, he is.  Fatherhood as a theme is one of those things that appears to be coming up more commonly in games these days, but despite all of the sci-fi and horror elements, Death Stranding has been for me the most relatable.",1599350945,1599351154,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,447,7,4444,0,3696,1600317587,,

94,DEATH STRANDING,75457984,english,"[h1]A Walking Simulator?[/h1]
Death Stranding is definitely not a game for everyone. You have probably heard that its a ""walking simulator"". While I wouldn't agree, it is accurate to say you're the 'FEDEX guy' which is mainly walking from point A to point B. 
""Wait!"" I hear you say ""That sounds like a walking simulator to me!"" I would agree. However, Death Stranding was made with this in mind, and is built around it. Just like how a good stealth game is fully built around stealth. If you shoehorn stealth into a game that is not built around it, it often comes off as contrived and unenjoyable. When many people hear about what you do in Death Stranding they imagine the equivalent of a whole game of shoehorned stealth sections. 

Death Stranding is built around the idea of carrying a package from point A to point B, and I have never seen a game do a better job at it. Something that sounds so dull as planning a path through some rocky hills is actually a pleasurable experience. 

The world of Death Stranding is so grounded as well. There are a few fantasy elements put into the world, not a lot. However, each element is taken to its limit. The world is shaped by these elements down to the minute details. 

It is great seeing Kojima make the game that he wanted to make with no restrictions. This isn't a big action game, this isn't a big stealth game. This isn't one big hero pulling America together. This is everyone chipping in to do their part. This isn't a game for everyone, and it might not be a game for you, but I would love to have another porter out there to walk with.

3,DEATH STRANDING,75449349,english,"Oh my god. I am unable to express my approval for this game well enough. I'm a picky gamer, and I'm always looking for something different, this is it.

I installed it, kind of tired, figured i'd try it out for a bit, and go to sleep. I've now been up for 28-29 hours, and I regret nothing.

The Story is totally unique, the gameplay itself, is also totally unique. Everything about Death Stranding is a gem. I will not spoil anything, but I will give you a little description of what kind of gameplay is involved.

Delivery: Everyone sees this part. You run cargo from a city/outpost to another city, settlement, waystation, etc. You will also find cargo littered across the landscape from previous dead couriers, and deliver that as well. You'll have to manage your weight and how it's stacked however, if you get too top heavy, you'll be falling all over the place.

Dark Souls style help: Dark souls is the closest explanation to it, remember the tips you'd get in messages through darksouls that could be upvoted? The same type of system exists here, except it's picturesque holograms to tell you where it's safe to wait out the rain, where a nearby bridge is, and where enemies are. The biggest difference however is, Objects transfer over as well. You may be scaling a cliff, and find a ladder not far from you, from where a previous courier traveled, or some of the cargo you find may have been theirs, but they had to leave it behind, or it got knocked into a canyon.

Combat is a thing: It's not a pacifist game. You'll be fighting all sorts of interesting and unique enemies.

Stealth is a must: Sneaking and even holding your breath to reduce the sound you make is a very important feature in this game at certain times. Do you need stealth? Absolutely not. It's much easier by sneaking through some places, but if you want to walk through like you own the world, it's still quite possible.

Many different ways to play: As I said above, it's not a ""You must do this to get through here."" type of game, there are endless ways to do everything.

and finally, the Massive World: I do not feel constrained at all. I have found no borders, I have not hit any ""out of bounds"" barriers. Any hill, any mountain I've wanted to climb, I have. Thing is however, some mountains you'll simply look at and think: Nah, it's a pain in the ass. I COULD, but I choose not to. and that's how the barriers work.

I recommend this game. It is worth full price without a shadow of a doubt. If you can get it on sale, go for it, but even if it's not... If you need a GOOD game, this is it. If you're stuck between this, and another game, choose this.

Generally enjoying the weirdness of the game.
Slow to start off in the first area, you lose you bike and have to walk/run around for a bit but still interesting enough to keep you occupied, your introduced to characters and game mechanics. slowly making you way around the map on foot and eventually move onto area 2.
Area 2 is where the issue start, but not until your over half way though.

You start off on foot and have to run everywhere again to start opening things up.
You come across MULES, which after a while you realise just how little threat they actually are and are easy enough to beat even if they come as a group.
You get your bike back and things start to get easier...yay, except for the really rough terrain at times
You get a van, which makes things interesting, just how bad the handling is for a ""delivery"" vehicle and just how useful it can be when you start to get the bigger deliveries.
You start to get the road network rebuilt, takes a while but makes things so much better, magical floating roads...yay
Then...you reach the mountain...OMG...which then turns the game into an even slowly slog than the first area.
Crawling thought the snow to open up areas, so you can build ziplines at least.
Going to BT areas makes things even more slower...found i preferred just to agro them and defeat the mini boss just to clear the area out and move on far easier.
Wind and snow storms every 2 mins so you have even more trouble moving and seeing just where your suppose to be getting too. 
Delivery orders to collect stuff from certain areas of the mountain, so again having to slog thought the snow to retrieve as there is no easy method to really get about.
First part of the 2nd area, was enjoyable and in a way relaxing...this is just ...ugh....people want to take shelter on a mountain....don't expect anyone to deliver....just let them DIE....
And when clearly the roads are floating in some places cant you just continue to build roads to these remote areas.
Ziplines are pretty cool but sometimes you just would prefer a road.

Prolly edit when i finally get around to finishing it, but for now...back to the ruddy snow :(

Perhaps this would be the case where a scoring system would be appropriate. If such system would exist, I'd give it 3/5, being generous. IS a good game, but there's a few fundamental flaws.

Okay, so, this game is done by Mr. Kojima and such, which we all love and all. [b]But let's all be honest: Is not a game for everyone, BUT going from point A to point B, for the millionth time could be still fun[/b]. Might be fun, in some cases. To get it out of my system, here's a few cons, then the pros, to end in a positive note.

[h1] Cons [/h1] 
[list]
 [*] [b]Controls/Movement. [/b]
Animations are great, but there's this very annoying issue about momentum. Yes, could be nice to be aware of your surroundings to avoid tripping, but sometimes, because of weight or whatever, your character will continue its movement, and this could get very annoying, specially on combat. If you are on PC try this: run to your right or left, and then press the key in the opposite direction: your character will slow down, stop dead for a second, then will turn towards the camera direction for a split second, and then it will run where you want to. This is extremely annoying and can't say the times I got killed because I went for cover, or wanted to avoid this fall or catch a ladder, etc.
Other games solves this by going into ""combat"" mode, where your input is favoured, instead of waiting for the animation to end. If there's Death Stranding 2, I think it could benefit from this.
Also, soothing BB, which is done on a regular basis, takes multiple key interactions
 [*] [b]Combat. [/b]
Where there's lots of weapon options, combat is clunky. Most of the weapons, if not all, are projectile based, even fire guns. [i]You can outrun bullets.[/i] That's super silly because you can't cover in those moments where the game forces you to combat, so, a valid approach is run side to side, so you don't get shot. And it goes both ways. Also, enemies can shoot you through tall grass, meaning you can not see them, but they will still shoot you.
Your cargo and your weapons are pretty much the same, so managing them is really clunky. And when your weapons are empty they stay on your back, which increases weight, which makes you tired/unstable. So you quickly get into a big issue. Why do I need to open a menu, go through my list of weapons, picking the one I want, press ""drop"" or ""offload"" and having to wait for the character to do the 'unload' animation? IN COMBAT? What's the reason to carry empty guns you can't get ammo for?
 [*] [b]Story.[/b]
[spoiler]The first ending, where the credits pops up, drags on and on and on. Come on, finish already![/spoiler]
I feel like they were afraid of the player not understanding, so they explained bits at any chance they could get. Over and over again. This takes away the mystery. The general rule would be to give the player A and B, so they can figure out C by themselves. In this game, a few interesting things should be explained more, but didn't happen.
Also, Higgs (the golden mask dude) is the most silly character I've ever met. Pretty much one-dimensional. No real purpose, no real sense of danger or urgency to defeat him.
[spoiler]Defeating some antagonists could get tiresome, because seems like you kill it/him for good, you are happy etc, then they reappear multiple times. This is bad, because you defeat it already and because gives a poor sense of accomplishment. ""This thing will appear again, why do I even bother"", was my thought at the time. And it did, for different characters.[/spoiler]
 [*] [b]BTs.[/b]
These are the most annoying enemies I've ever met, ever. Is not only them being invisible, but them catching you when you are being silent (yes, by walking, holding your breath, etc). I feel like they always get in the way, but in a very very frustrating, not fun way. If they grab you, they force you to do a mini-boss multiple times, and your cargo will be severely damaged. There's not a single approach, that could be reliable, to counter them. If you shoot them, they hear you. You can't out-run them.[spoiler]Cutting the umbilical cords works, but at that moment, chances of screwing things up are high.[/spoiler] All I wanted to do is deliver a package. They are time-wasters.
 [*] [b]Visual Interface[/b]
At first glance, animations for the UI seems fast and responsive, but between interactions, these millisecond of moving/fading, etc they all add up. Also, a few interactions requires unneeded extra steps (like recycling items from shared containers). In your private room, instead of moving your character to interact, you need to wait for the camera to fly to where you want. Is not nit picking: in 50 hs of gameplay, all of these add up, trust me. You'll end up clicking ""skip"" like a mad man.
Also, is really hard to see your markers when you are in snowy areas. White against white is quite impossible to see.
 [*] [b]World[/b]
The world looks like one of these tech demos you download from the NVIDIA page, to see what your new fancy card is capable of. Is mountains here, terrain there, a stream of water there, more grass, less grass. and that's it.

[h1] Pros [/h1] 
[list]
[*] While perhaps repetitive, [b]delivering packages feels rewarding.[/b] It gives you a sense of purpose for yourself and makes you care about what you actually delivering. They took their time to let the player know why certain packages are important. That's great.
[*] [b]Immersion is great.[/b] Is you versus the world itself, and MULES and BTs are another layer on top. Preparing yourself for terrain challenges and actually conquering them, gives you a feeling no other game will give you. Is really that rewarding.
[*] [b]Everything surrounding BB is fantastic.[/b] Specially Mads Mikkelsen.
[*] Knowing that you can connect with other players, and using their structures feels fantastic, in different layers. On a emotional level, knowing they are helping to create a path so they got your back, and on a gameplay level they are incredibly useful.
[*] Animation is top notch. You won't find a better animation technology and acting like this, in a video game, for probably years (except for Naugthy Dog games, of course).
[*] While walking through that black tar is awful, the buildings/car/structures coming in and out of it, are great. Really cool concept. Also, water technology is probably the best in the industry. Fluids are incredibly well done.
[*] Raiding MULE bases and the melee system is quite fun.

My suggestion for anyone who's interested in this game is [b]wait for it to be on sale, play it a bit and see if you like it.[/b] This is one of these games that looks boring on gameplay videos, but the experience is different if you play it yourself.

So, there you have it. Why my recommended review them? Because I want more games like this. They took a high risk and it does pay off in certain areas. [b]We need more games like this to push the medium forward, onto new ideas and unexplored territories.[/b] Ventures like this will always get my thumbs up.",1599166302,1599167210,TRUE,1,0,0.523809552,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,233,12,3608,0,3529,1600249263,,

The story and lore of the game are fascinating, and the gameplay is an excellent exercise in self-improvement, perseverance, and incremental progression. You get a real sense of connection to the characters, and to all of the fellow players who help you along the way.

Early game can be brutal, delivering through enemy territory, with no equipment, no shelter, across jagged rocky terrain, all the while being chased by ghosts. The game drip feeds you a large variety of new tools, gear, weapons, and vehicles to help you overcome obstacles in the world and overcome the world itself. The strategy is all in managing encumbrance and preparing the right equipment to complete your deliveries. 

You will spend time building up infrastructure in areas to help you navigate and avoid hazards, maintaining old infrastructure, creating paths that make traversal more easy, and clearing out bandit camps, all to deliver an old man 500 pairs of high-performance underpants.

The game is visually stunning. There are some great moments of solitude while walking around alone in the beautifully-crafted world. Cutscenes are very cinematic and I never felt bored watching them.

63,DEATH STRANDING,75355122,english,"This is probably the 80th time you've seen this, but I really wanted to like this game. There are parts that I really like and parts that I really don't. Some of this you'll really agree with and other parts you'll just want to punch me for if you've played the game. I'm going to start with the old sandwich model of structuring with good, bad, then good again at the end to lighten the blow a bit. Fair warning for those who haven't played the game I will be including light spoilers for a section of the game that's not the main story, but nevertheless the game makes you go through it.

Pros:
_I love the delivery sim and navigating some of the obstacles they really make you think hard about how you are supposed to stack things on your pack (until 16 hours in you notice there's an auto stack and spam that fucker like no one's business) while traversing this unusually rocky ground.

_I found myself sinking what felt like hours and hours into making deliveries that were (at first) really cool because they genuinely got my adrenaline going and reminded me of my favorite game in the whole world, Subnautica. The BTs are there and they're doing their own thing and you can avoid them if you play your cards right and manage your distance properly. They feel the right amount of fair, but difficult and something that you can learn how to get around with a bit of knowledge. More about this later.

_There seems to be a B plot with the BB that Sam carries around between the baby and its father. And it's alright when it's actually telling a story, but eventually it felt like it was repeating the same scenes over and over. So I just started skipping it.

I kind of left this part out of my introduction, but every one of the pros has an asterisk of *until it's not. So here's the asterisks. Also this is the section with the most spoilers.

Cons:
_The delivery sim never changes. There's progress made, but the three times I moved to a new area they reset my progress. I started with a bike then I went across a lake and they gave me the ability to build a bike out of materials then they took that away and I had to steal a truck from the MULES, but that can't be housed in the garage, which repairs your vehicles (that take damage over time due to the timefall rain, which rapidly ages things). Instead of increasing difficulty naturally they just take your progress away, and that's the most infuriating thing for me in games. It's actually why I quit playing.

_Every story in this game is so melodramatic. I saw a commercial for this game when it was first being promoted where this big city was underwater and it looked interesting then the water drains and you see it going up the stairs and back into this apartment. Inside there's a dude crying at how emotional the game is. This is peak melodrama folks. There's a story in this game where this random couple (early to mid 20s) is separated by the attack on middle knot city. She (an asian woman with some asian accent I'm not that knowledgeable about where specifically) went with her European descended mom with no accent whatsoever who told her daughter that the daughter's boyfriend was dead. Your mission is to get the boyfriend's help with your missions. He hates your guts because of the Bridges Company's lack of anything to do with what was going on or the aftermath, but he says if you can find my girl (I thought he meant his daughter because the asian woman appears really young in the holograms he shows) then I'll help. So you go do a mission for him while Bridges searches for the woman. You find where she is and you have to go get her and her back in the least interesting series of cutscenes I think I've ever seen. They expected me to care about these people and their situation when I couldn't remember their names, I don't think the mom even has a name. It was played up as the happiest moment in the world, but zero buildup. I didn't know who these people were and what's more I didn't care.

_The BTs were enemies that were interesting and slowed your progress until you got your handle on them a few hours in, but the game started using them as a roadblock anytime it didn't want you to do something. There's a point where you find a dead motorcycle on the side of the road that belonged to one of the NPCs. He says if you can get it charged you can take it. So I did. Immediately after they put in a section where you encounter the biggest set of BTs you've encountered in the game so far in the craggiest parts of the game yet. My natural reaction was to gun it through them. Huge mistake. If you bring a vehicle in these areas every BT in a few feet will land and start to chase you down which will result in you being dragged in front of the whale BT to try and escape. This is made little more than a nuisance by the time you start to get weapons. So the enemies go from admittedly terrifying to the literal reason I dislike this game. At one point I lost my cool on a stream (https://youtu.be/Jkff_jrr_cc If you care to watch my reaction in person) after encountering two BTs in a row on the same path.

_Every bit of the BB storyline is just boring. You start off meeting his dad and you seem to have some sort of working relationship with the guy and he dies to your first voidout, death, which you can come back from. Every so often you will leave your private room and a scene will play of the BB and his father, but it's shot from the same angle every time and there's always this pod with the mother in it. The dad always talks about how much he loves his wife and wants to bring her out of the (coma? I think because the BB needs a live womb sync back up with to level out after getting stressed) condition she's in. He dances and sings and I'm guessing you're supposed to feel some type of way about this, but I felt nothing because he's dead in the first hour. I never knew the guy, Sam did, but we didn't know much about the dude.

_There's a scene where the deuteragonist, Fragile, is stripped down to her underwear (white tank top and white panties) and made to walk through the rain. I get the story significance of that and you can definitely do that type of scene well. In this case I don't feel it was used a bad thing to do in this story. They are trying to set up the bad guy as the bad guy. But I felt the game lingered uncomfortably on her body in certain areas. The ones generally used for fan service. I'm all for fan service, but there's a place for it. At this spot in the story the woman is completely being dominated and forced to be in a vulnerable position by the closest thing to a god this story has setup as of now. Giving me fan service isn't what I need now. It counterbalances the message of the scene. Am I supposed to be horrified or aroused by this? This made me quit playing the game after that cut scene and delete it from my computer.

Conclusion:
There is a lot to like about this game. It really has some great aspects and when the story is good it's great. I liked the voice acting everyone seemed to be on point. The character models seemed to move like a real person would other than a few graphical glitches, which could be explained by a less than optimized PC port. I while I was engaged it was a great game to experience, just had more than a few issues that made me not like it. I definitely see why other people love the game, but It's just not my bag man.

73,DEATH STRANDING,75337515,english,"It's hard for me to push thumbs down on this game, because in some way it is brilliant but then in others it is so  abysmally bad that all the brilliant parts are overshadowed.

Yes, it is a Kojima oddity, and I knew that going in. Yes, it is a walking simulator (and later riding simulator and trucking simulator) and the story is propelled almost exclusively by the player completing fetch quests. 

Technically Death Stranding is brilliant. On highest specs, the environment is so beautiful that it makes even Red Dead Redemption 2 look a bit dated. Gameplay mechanics work very well when you are traveling on foot - Sam Porter Bridges isn't a superman, he moves like a normal human would while burdened by a stack of boxes on his back. You NEED to consider the terrain you are crossing, and the obstacles in your path, and the creatures and characters that seek to stop you.

The setting is typical Kojima, and it lays on weird and spooky very heavily and very quickly. For the first hour or so, you will very much wonder just what the hell is going on; when the game's monsters, the BTs, make their first showing, it is quite  suspenseful and terrifying. And then comes the first stumble: a rapid-fire exposition dump from the second NPC you meet in person. It does a decent job giving you an overall idea of the setting you are in, but it is delivered rather awkwardly, and is symptomatic of what's to come. 

After the game gets in gear in subsequent chapters, for a while it maintains the spooky atmosphere. The BTs are a force of nature that cannot be fought, they can only be detected and avoided, and you feel like a proper BIG DAMN HERO for daring to cross the areas infested with them to deliver the supplies to the needy when everyone else cowers in shelters. Unfortunately, this does not last: the game quickly hands you weapons that allow you first to disperse the monsters, and then to kill them outright. By the time you cross into the second area, the terrifying force of nature becomes first an annoyance, and shortly after a prey to be hunted and farmed for a certain type of resource.

Which brings me to one of the worst mechanics ever invented in a game. In order to detect the BTs and make them visible, you are given the infamous ""baby in a jar"" that is seen in the trailers. This constant companion is invaluable for keeping yourself alive and out of trouble. However, it behaves exactly as a baby would. That is, it cries, whines, and cries some more. Stumble and take a fall, and it whines. Take a punch in a fight, and it bawls. Get close enough to a monster, which is necessary at times, and - you guessed it - it cries. It's a source of constant annoyance that pops up at the worst possible time and it is about as easy to ignore as nails on a chalkboard (ain't biology fun?). According to the story, your character gradually bonds with the baby and begins to view it as more than just a piece of equipment, but in reality, I wanted nothing more than to be rid of it.

The other major problem with the game and perhaps the main reason for the thumbs-down is the way the story is handled. It is very easy to get lost in deliveries, improving relationships with the inhabitants of the map, and building stuff. But eventually you need to move the story along, and it happens in the form of ""take this VERY SPECIAL box to this one shelter, and be rewarded with a feature-length cutscene where an NPC spouts exposition at you and your character nods along."" It all culminates in a massive infodump at the end, where through multiple sequential cutscenes all questions are answered, all i's are dotted and all t's are crossed. Overall, the story is very weird, heavy on metaphor and absolutely fascinating - I would expect no less from Kojima - but the presentation via one massive endgame infodump was exhausting and spoiled the impression. It didn't help that after what FELT like the final boss fight of the game (and was emotionally satisfying) the game decided to throw a sequence of boss fights at you afterwards, culminating with a colossal monster that put the original ""final boss"" to utter shame. It served no purpose other than just to be there and present one final speed bump before the endgame exposition vomit began.

To sum it up, Death Stranding is brilliant in both technical execution and the story, but it is HOW the story is presented that severely undermines the entire thing. That, and the damn crying baby. Even if you didn't hate children before, I'm pretty certain Death Stranding will make you hate them.",1599069387,1599069387,FALSE,12,1,0.631755114,1,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,166,31,7638,0,7638,1598922491,,

 The program the game runs on, however, I do not recommend at all.

People with high-spec systems are stuck at <60 fps. The game will freeze and crash if you test it even a little bit. It's no exaggeration when I say 10-15 out of the 40 hours of my time has been lost due to crashes. Saving frequently is required.

97,DEATH STRANDING,73512205,english,"Now that i have actualy completed the story of Death Stranding. Let me update my review.

A yes Death Stranding. The walking simulator. And either some very high quility sh*tpost. Or one of those DEEP things.
Now that i completed the story. And barly remembered any of it or understood any off it. Becus im a low IQ dumbbrain i must say it was......a interesting experience. One filled with a lot of tar. Walking and.....Very interesting dialoge... But i do like meny of the concepts. I find the beaches, BB's, BT's, Time fall, a lot of it quite interesting. Just a shame i do a lot of walking...or well driving between it all. but let me get to some main points

The Story : Like i said it's wierd. Not that that isen't to be expected. Basicaly this huge cataclysmic event happend that caused the dead to come to the world of the living and if the dead capture a live person and eat them it causes a explosion. and then there is this one super BT called a EE (extinction entity) who aperantly will cause a big bang.....and then there is this dumb mario and peach pun later on in the game that i still hate. its.....yea. I do somewhat like the caracters. tough. mainly higgs.

Gameplay : Like i said. its a walking simulator. Or a driving simulator depending on how mutch you like cars. Its all about bringing item 1 from A to B. Sometimes there is a timer. Sometimes you must not submerge the package in water, Sometimes its is even extra fragile so you have to carry it by hand, Sometimes its a pizza that you must only carry horizontaly on you backpack or else it gets destroyed (And if you do the pizza delievery missions without putting the Spiderman pizza time theme in the background troughout the entire delivery YOU ARE DOING THE ENTIRE DELIVERY VERY WRONG) So there is some veriaty in the delievery missions. You can also build a lot of structures to make delivering easyer like roads. zip lines. generators to recharge your exo legs and trucks. all that jaz. + You don't just have to do missions to deliver packages. You can just find lost packages dotted around the place. There is also the Time fall. witch rapadly ages anything it comes into contact with. including your buildings and packages. if the package gets to aged. And you get a exidental bump. Or fall of a cliff. It will rilly damage the item inside it. so carefull of time fall. Take some Cargo repair sprays or hang out under a Time fall shelter. 
 
MULE Combat : combat is Probably the weakest part of Death stranding imo. Lets first talk about MULE combat. MULEs are some of the random terrorists you find around the place. There are 2 types. The ones with pocky shock sticks that only wan't your cargo. They can moostly do only melee combat. And there sticks do nothing but lower your conciousness meter. And you can for the most part just drive past em. But these guys have a mean throwing arm. And if the stick they trew hits your car. It will make it undrivable for a couple seconds. Then there is the big MULEs. the actualy big terrorists. These guys juse guns. thats pretty mutch the main diffrence. and melee combat is not the best idea so get a gun. SPEAKING OF GUNS. HERE IS THE RILLY DUMB PART ABOUT COMBAT. In the world of Death Stranding. Dead people have this thing called ''Going neckro'' Witch means there body is about to turn into a BT. And becus of that. You have to haul any bodys you make to a incinerator. Now i have never killed anyone. and even if i did it was jusualy only one that i had to bring to the incinerator. So idk what happens if you just leave a body to go neckro. But for all ik. Its a insta game over. So do yourself a favor and just juse non-lethal weapons and watch out that you don't run anyone over. Saves a lot of trouble

BT combat : 2 Sides on this coin. One is stealth and avoid. The other is fighting. You will jusualy find BT terriroty in Time fall zones. If you are in a car/on a bike. it will stop for a view seconds When your rilly close to the BT zone. If you get closer. You get stopped agian for your BB to activate the wierd detector on your shoulder and spot the BT's. So. BT stealth. plain and simple. Watch your scanner and avoid where its pointing at. If you get to close to a BT. press and hold ALT or whatever button you juse on controller to hold your breath. If you have succesfully avoided all BTs and exited the BT zone. BB will make the scanner give you a thumbs up or wave the BTs goodbye. 
Now for BT combat. You juse special weapons and ammo for this called hematic grenades/ammo. There is also the EX grenades from 0-2 Witch are Sams shower water, pee, and shit. but i never jused those. Hematic grenades and rounds juse up Sams blood. Becus Sam is infected with DOOMs and a repatriate or something. His blood has damaging effects on BTs. Becus of this. The special Hematic grenades and rounds where created. When you trow/shoot them. They drain your health. If you have blood bags on you. They drain those first instead. Normal BTs are generaly easy to kill. dying jusualy from just one hematic grenade. There is also a special upgrade you get to your com link later in the game. A chiral crystal knife or something along those lines. You sneak up to a BT and cut of there ambilical cords. Releasing them back to the land of the dead. dusent have mutch juse in combat tough. But. If BT's manage to catch you. They will drag you over to the BT mini boss's main arena

the bosses have a special arena. its a massive tar lake that slows you down. however. random buildings and cars will emerge from this lake. Giving you places you can climb on and hide from the boss. You can also skip the intire fight by exiting the tar lake radius. There will also be random Sam ghost that apear (specters of other players) Who will trow you extra gear to defeat the boss. If you defeat the boss. The tar lake disapears. The time fall stops pooring down. And left over BT's disapear. making the area completely save to loot. But. the BT precense can quickly return

Driving : cars and motorbikes. In all honesty. cars......kinda suck imo. Ik there kinda supposed to be not all that viable. Becus in a game about delivering it may make em super OP. But i...I rilly don't know about em. Sometimes they respond just fine but other times they just either respond to mutch to my imputs. Or to little. And don't try to skyrim pysicks up a mountain with them. I have done many a time and oooooh boy. Cars and mountains don't get along. Also. Despite most of the land bing a rocky wasteland. Cars have a habit of getting stuck on rock formations....Rocks are there Achilles heel. Bikes are a bit more resistend to getting stuck on rocks and going up mountains. But i feel like they controll worse. Idk.

So thats death stranding. or etleest how mutch i care to tell about it. Me? I somewhat like it. A game i can play when i have nothing better to do. Or just had a bad day and wanne look at some nice scenery. You? Well. If like me your looking for a game to play when you need to be calmed. go for it.

Have you ever heard the phrase, as wide as an ocean but as deep as a puddle? You could describe No Mans Sky like that. It's got millions of planets to explore but there is nothing to do when there. I feel like Death Stranding is the opposite. When looking at trailers or gameplay, it looks so simple. You take packages from here to there. You are a post-apocalyptic Amazon delivery dude. And while that's a decent summary, the gameplay is so much more engaging than it sounds. There are systems that feed off of everything you do. And the story, my god. Who thinks of this shiz?

GAMEPLAY is deeper than you think. For instance, taking a package from point A to point B sounds simple. First you'll want to auto sort your packages for better weight distribution otherwise you are going to fall... a lot. During your journey you will constantly be surveying the land to find the safest route through the rough terrain. When turning with a lot of cargo you with have to actively shift your weight with left and right triggers or mouse buttons. The world is full of environmental puzzles like; Coming upon a river that you don't want to deal with? Plop a ladder down to cross it faster. There's a ravine stopping you from moving forward? Construct a bridge to get your vehicle across (yes you will unlock vehicles but there is no perfect way to traverse. Some terrain requires you to travel caveman style). Oh but wait, during your travel you have to pass though MULE (people who want your stuff) territory, so now you need to either fight them head on or stealth your way around them. Adding to your journeys already thoughtful execution are delivery objectives. Such as delivery time, package condition, package orientation, or so much cargo you need a vehicle to help carry it all. There are so many systems feeding off one another that one journey can become a bit of a strategy game. Don't worry, after a couple missions everything starts to flow so well together that planning becomes second nature and doesn't stretch into tedious or daunting territory. Each delivery is an adventure worth taking.

STORY is weird af. It's way more cohesive than MGS in my opinion. This really feels like a passion project that Hideo had thought about quite a bit. And with seemingly no interference from publishers or anyone else , it's a miracle this game even exists. Still mothers, babies linked to another dimension through their dead mom, tar people, time altering rain, nukes caused from dead people, giant lovecraftian monsters than eat people, crystal hands growing out of the ground that power electronics. Who thinks of this stuff but also makes a somewhat cohesive story out of it. AND WHO FUNDS THIS? Either way, I'm genuinely happy it exists. This has been some of the best gaming experiences I've had in a while.

PERFORMANCE. Everyone's system is different. MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE with Death Stranding has been very good. I have an AMD (8core-16thread) r7 1700, 32gb of ram and a gtx 1080ti. I play at 1440p and I'm getting over 60fps 90% of the time. Some dips below that and it's 100% my CPU's fault. The 1700 does not have great single core performance and IPC so I think that's letting me down. If you have an i7 3770k or higher, you should probably be fine. But I haven't tested that. It's just a guess. The game uses about 7-8 cores. And would probably benefit from 16gb of system ram. 505 did a great job porting it. I do wish we had more graphics options though. But this game already looks stunning.

THIS GAME IS GORGEOUS. Everything about it screams quality. Most of the scenery is photo-realistic. The human models are also fantastic but the facial animations leave some room for improvement. Sometimes emotions don't shown enough through the performances. A little stiff looking. When moving through the world there are contextual animations for so many things like stumbling, walking over rocks, pushing grass away as you move through it. It's all beautiful and smoothly blends between one another. And it runs really well while being a graphics power house. Only complaint is Anisotropic Filtering will not go above what looks like x4. Others can get x16 AF. Mine might be bugged. But that's my only real complaint. Most everything in the game is high quality assets.

OVERALL. I suggest trying this game. Very unique gameplay with some fantastic graphics and world building.

UPDATE: Finished the game. Everything above still stands. BUT this game suffers from horrible game direction towards the end of the game. The story is told to you multiple times over the span of playing the game with it recapping everything you just learned 2 times in the last 4 hours of the game. It's insulting and annoying. During that time your gameplay options are EXTREMELY limited adding to the frustration. Brings my overall score of the game from an 9/10 right before the last 4 hours, to a final 7/10 for that garbage ending. Story was good. Ending was not.",1595740289,1598899168,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,403,35,3116,0,3116,1597624711,,

18,DEATH STRANDING,74216281,english,"[h1] DEATH STRANDING [/h1]
This review will contain ZERO spoilers for DEATH STRANDING, this is a review for players who are thinking about buything DEATH STRANDING.

This game is one of the kind, a game with an experience that you have never witness before. Both the gameplay and the story is something new no game has never done before. The main characters in this game are also complety unique and loveable. The game is almost perfect but sadly it has a BIG problem, the gameplay.

[h1] Gameplay [/h1]
I and many others are not a fan of the gameplay, the controlls are extremly weird and also extremly frustrating. The gameplay is EXTREMLY repetitive, all you do is go from point A to point B. There are problems on the way such as BTS (Ghosts) and Mules (Bandits that steal your cargos) however these two enemies doesn't make the game funnier but instead they are just extremly frustating. The combat system in this game is dumb and I would just recommand running away from the Mules because it's simply not fun to fight in this game. The BTS are dead people or ghosts that you can't kill early in the game so instead you just sneak past them in hope of them not noticing you, fun and scary the first three times but after the thirtieth time it's not fun anymore and instead just a frustating way to make the game slower and harder.

While you're playing you will notice that your character Sam will start to trip every second. You can prevent this from happneing by simply clicking right, left or both clicks on your mouse. Although I only fell around seven times in my 60 hours playthough, repeatly clicking on left and right click is extremly annoying and it almost pervents you from enjoying the beautiful world in DEATH STRANDING. And if you're to fall then your cargos will be damaged which makes everyone extremly pissed of because the more damaged your cargos are, the worse grade/reward you will get. Something else that is a big problem just like the tripping one are the climbing mechanics in the game. It's extremly broken and not enjoyable, they tried to do something that Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild did but sadly failed.

You will learn early in the game that you can drive vehicles, driving these vehicles are almost complety impossible and extremly frustrating. No matter where on the map you're driving, you will probably end up driving into someone every tenth second and although crashing with vechicles can be fun in some games, it's not fun in this game. The whole driving mechanics is just extremly unenjoyable and complety ruins the flow. You will get updates for the vechicles futher in the game but this isn't fixing the problem. You also have to worry about the fuel in the vechicles which I can see why they added but I personally isn't a fan of it.

I know it says on steam that this game is single-player however there are other Porters in the game that can build structures such as bridges or ladders for you which will make it easier for you on your path. By thanking them for the help you can give them a like. Although the likes doesn't do much it's still fun to grind likes and help other people, DEATH STRANDING simply have their own social media which is a really cool and fun idea.

Although walking around on you feet all the time can be extremly boring over time atleast you're not often visting old places and are almost always heading forwards new beautiful environments. Walking though this beautiful world is truly magical and are probably the highlights of the gameplay. DEATH STRANDING also have PLENTY of amazing songs made for this game and listening to these songs while climbing the beautiful mountains really feels amazing. Hideo Kojima is really a genius for this.

The game always gives you new weapons, tools, clothes and updates to old mechanics  which really makes the gameplay less repetitive. Some of these new items you get futher into the game also makes the gameplay a lot more easy and less frustrating. Finishing these game without these updates would simply not be possible.

[h1] Story [/h1]
I can not say much about the story because this is a spoiler free review however I will talk about things you learn early in the game that wouldn't be seen as spoiler but instead as your goals. Something else I can say is that the story is AMAZING, ALMOST PERFECT! The gameplay may be a big problem however the story and the characters in this game really makes up for it. The beginning and ending when the game focus more on the story and not as much of the gameplay is magical and you can't stop youself to loving the game while playing though these parts. The game as a lot of plot twists can that be confusing but other than that the story parts are almost perfects and I doesn't have much to complain about that.

Your goal as Sam Porter Bridges is to rebuild the nation America by going into every state and reconnecting the chiral network, inviting them to Bridges which is a company that was formed to reconnect the fractured society of United States of America.

Every character you meet in this game has their own story, it could be all from losing family members to getting betrayed by their group. It's really worth listening to these stories and every character has their unique story and their unique powers. Sometimes you can feel that the game could be a really good movie.

[h1] Worth Buying? [/h1]
This isn't a game for everyone and if you can't handle boring or repeative games and like action games that this probably isn't a game for you. If you're a person that enjoy a good story game that this is probably a game for you. I personally enjoyed the game.

Is it worth buying the game? Yes, if you have the money and have the feeling that you wanna play a good story game and I think you should buy it, just expect that you're gonna go though a 40-60 hours journey.

Rating of the game? I will give the game a 7.5/10, the gameplay is a complete mess with not many positive sides however everything else with the game is amazing and it mostly makes up for it. The game also has a complete new experience which is always fun to witness.

The mechanics and gameplay that is.

As someone who greatly enjoyed Euro Truck Simulator and Elite: Dangerous, I love the games where you can sit back, relax, avoid some dangerous areas, and enjoy the scenery while listening to some nice music. The soundtrack, both the original score and the licensed music, are amazing. music player when. The environment and ambiance throughout the parts where I have reached we're stunning to look at. The walking mechanics (that's new to me) are clearly the most realistic, yet easy to grasp, that I've ever seen.

However, i'm not able to enjoy this game because every 20-30 minutes, if i'm lucky, an hour, I get either a bluescreen, or a crash. Every fix that I tried on the official 505 website did not work or did not apply to me, and even the steam support forums and Reddit didn't prove very useful. I was able to solve one crash related to DSLL, however another appeared in it's place. It's not related to graphics card or CPU temperatures, or even RAM and SSD temperatures.

44,DEATH STRANDING,75151015,english,"I must admit that Kojima really did blast it out of the park with this one. The story is absolutely amazing; labyrinthine and convoluted (as always), yet an absolute masterpiece when it all comes together. The way the story is told is simply flawless. As for the game-play, this interactive piece of art is clearly not for everyone. People who love cinematographic storytelling will love the game; tuning in to walk from A to B, carrying cargo and leaving items behind to aid others in their travels (just as they help you in yours later on in the game) is extremely satisfying. Knowing that you have facilitated the rough ways you have traversed for others is lovely.

If you don't mind a ""walking simulator"" to which you can hook up and disconnect your brain for a while, then this game is definitely for you, not only during the story, but after you beat it as well. Some segments of the game, like when you make it into new areas, will trigger music that will go along with a zoomed out shot of you traversing the new landscape; those parts of the game are the absolute best.

Later on in the game, vehicles will be unlocked, which takes me to my only issue: vehicle control. The way that the bike controls is absolutely unpolished and requires clear improvements. It really breaks the immersion by making the movements look unrealistic and abrupt (especially after getting a great deal of very detailed walking motions). Even at later stages, when vehicles might seem indispensable, I chose to walk; not only was it more fun for me, but it helped restore the aforementioned immersion that was mercilessly broken by the bike. 

TL;DR:
All in all, it is a lovely game, but clearly not for everyone. If there should exist any proof that video-games are pieces of art, is would be this. If you like to look at scenery, enjoy the feeling of progression and aiding other players in their travels, then consider buying this game. If you're a fan of Kojima's stories and his amazing plot twists, then don't hesitate. There is plenty to experience. If you are keen only on fast-paced games, then this is definitely not the pick for you, but still an experience that should be played, so I'd recommend to buy it on sale at a later date. Either way, this is irrefutable proof of how right it can go in the game industry when developers don't stick to the mainstream casual players, but to a certain type of people.

First off, I will say that the concept was interesting and it really could have had potential. But really that's where it ends.

This game is more than a walking simulator, it's a crawling simulator. It's tedious. This could have been a game about the Rug Rats. The struggle to keep your balance and stay upright throughout the game is more of a curse than an additional layer. Oh and let's make a game where you have to drudge through tar pits. But wait, let's make them ethereal tar pits. 

The bottlenecks make you want to never progress through the lackluster plot. The death eaters are everywhere you expect them to be. The vehicles cannot travel to the locations you need them to.  You absolutely get a feeling of “here we go again”. Seriously, if anyone is a die hard fanboy of this game, I fear they are lying to themselves. The plot sucks. The plot sucks. Also the plot sucks. 

This game is not fun. I bought the game based on the fact that Reedus was in it. His character is a ghost of a player. Seriously. Its uninspiring. It reminds me of the Japanese concept of Seppuku. Seppuku was used voluntarily by samurai to die with honor rather than fall into the hands of their enemies. Except here there is no honor and you voluntarily have fallen on your enemies sword hoping for a swift death but let me reassure you, you will find none. So its actually nothing like Seppuku but more like Aokigahara (known as ""the Suicide Forest""), because at least here, you are willingly torturing yourself for the low price of $60. $60 dollars you will never get back unless you never spend it. 

Here is the most stupid part of the game. If you crawl or walk slow and hold your breath, you can walk past the death eaters. Seriously, with all this technology that is a part of the plot of the game, no one would have thought to make a mask with a rebreather built in. dumb. Dumb dumb dumb dumb.

This game is a perfect example of how you see really good actors in a terrible movie. The plot sounds good. The script is ok. But the execution is terrible.

53,DEATH STRANDING,75133682,english,"So, steam just ate my 3 page detailed review and I am not going to retype it. This is my first and possibly only review here and it is more of a frustration vent and an obituary for the wasted $60. I am about three hours in. I might play for another hour or two and try to find some redeeming qualities in this game. After all, this is the first time in about a decade that I paid full price for an AAA title.

The good:

* Graphics are pretty good.
* The goo monsters are pretty scary.
* The dreamlike, illogical setting feels refreshingly original

The bad:

* The acting and the writing are abysmal. There  are stupid expositions, unnatural dialogues and nobody seems to behave like an actual living human.
* In the first two hours of the game, I had about 15-20 minutes of actual gameplay. The rest were cut scenes. If this game was not released on consoles before it came to PCs I would have thought it was an intentional trick to prevent Steam refunds.
* For a walking simulator, walking does not feel natural. Like the guy clutches his chest to catch his balance instead of spreading his hands out like every other human does. And apparently if you are climbing a steep hill with a heavy load and try to stop, inertia will keep you going for like half a dozen steps upwards. I wish I knew that when I was doing backpacking.
* The game UI/UX is abysmal. Like really, read a damn book on UI/UX design before you make your next game. I spent like 10-15 minutes trying to figure out why the guy drops the stupid briefcase after a couple of seconds. The game doesn't tell you anything, it just prompts that you can pick up the case and carry it in your right hand, your left hand or on your back. But turns out that if you carry it in either hand the guy will drop it. And nobody tells you why. The map interface is super cluttered and not helpful. Key assignments are weird. Even WASD doesn't behave like in every other game.
* For a game centered around carrying weight, carrying weight is weird and unnatural. The reason he drops the briefcase is because he doesn't like carrying things in one hand if he is not carrying things in his other hand. The two seconds delay gives you a chance to pick something else with your other hand. And you, the player, go like ""Just carry the damn case, you idiot, you are a fully grown man who can kill zombies with his crossbow, but you are too chicken to carry 10 pound briefcase in your hand for a few minutes?!""",1598740205,1598740205,FALSE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,274,1,419,0,242,1598906640,,

Griefing is not possible and the way this is implemented is fantastic.  The game can be challenging at times, but the rewards for succeeding are great and each NPC story is a interesting and compelling.  That is the real winner here - a fantastic story line.  Probably the best I can remember in 40 years of game playing.  The story was deep, heart felt, emotional, and extremely well acted by cinematic greats.

The graphics are awesome.  The characters especially emote like few other games.  The characters look and act exactly like their real-world actor counterparts.  The environment is beautiful and challenging with varied landscapes and logistical problems to solve.  Even at the end of the game I was still in awe of the visuals.

There is no one way to solve a given problem although most quests are fairly linear and straight forward.  Solving the side quests can be equally important to the main line and all of them have interesting plots.  Some rewards provide special capabilities that become very useful towards the end of the game.  Hint - don't ignore Peter.

The only downside was the often whonky Xbox control on the PC.  It was at times hard to control the character which resulted in near death experiences.  Some combat situations were equally frustrating as the player character kept putting the weapon away instead of shooting it.  In this game, you learn to nudge the character instead of directing the character through the controls.  Vehicle control is also kind of difficult at times but all in all it was manageable. 

While the game can seem tedious at times, the last hour of the game is well worth it.  There is a sense of community not found in most other games and it is done very well.

84,DEATH STRANDING,75065748,english,"I played through the game and enjoyed the progression and the story. Once again I note that Kojima and his team have created a world where it's structure is explained by the story when it is actually the limitations of modern day game-making technology that define the world: The reason there are no friendly NPC characters you can meaningfully interact with is because the Death Stranding has almost completely wiped out humanity. In truth though, populating the waystations, distribution centres and 'cities' in the game with Varied NPCs with unique dialogue, interactability, furnished places of work/residence etcetera would be impossible. Only the illusion of that can be attained now, unconvincingly and frustratingly short of interactability by the likes of Ubisoft in their latest AC games. 
I prefer though how Kojima explained the structure of his world in MGSV through the context of the game. You cannot interact meaningfully with people because you are trying to remain undetected behind enemy lines. I found MGSV to be altogether a better and cooler game. I feel Kojima succeeded in his project to have people 'work together' in an oblique fashion over the internet though, but then in MGSV he had the same sort of set up with your Forward Operating Bases which would be randomly broken into and raided by other players as you would break into theirs. Loved that idea, really added to the game.
The story and acting is great, even when the plot gets ridiculous. I believe plot and context in video games should be defined by the limitations of, or the conditions set by 'video games'. Not enough pixels to make a mouth? Give him a moustache and make him Italian. Can't render more than 2 bullets on screen at one time? Make it a stealth game. Got the best actors on earth who can be rendered into photo-realistic million-polygon 3D avatars that can be seen on screen, but still no way to convincingly communicate with an artificial intelligence in games in 2020? Wipe out the world and make all communication essentially one-way. Your game character will be able to take a piss and wash his face but no dialogue system.

The game is very much ""Game light"", and what I mean by that is the game play elements are not what makes the whole of this game. The most enjoyment I got from it is the theme and character development, it's a highly engaging and extremely interesting story that grows in the telling, constantly making you think. Admittedly like the intro to Skyrim, in the first 10 - 30 mins it does not showcase what the game is about in theme or gameplay well, it's all very serious and po-faced.

I need to stress how incredible the multiplayer element of this game is, other games creators need to start doing this sort of ""passive co-operative"" in other games as well, the way it accentuates the theme and makes you feel not to alone is fantastic.

And finally: Kojima is renowned for creating experience that push gaming as a medium and creating believable stories and characters, and frankly i'd chalk this up as another great.

14,DEATH STRANDING,74993056,english,"One of the biggest questions I’ve seen is, is it worth it?

YES, this game is an experience, might be boring for you, might be incredible for others, regardless it is an experience that should not be missed. 

DEATH STRANDING is not an easy pill to swallow, it has plenty of exposition, good AND bad. Sometimes the story diverges for technobabble and other times it grips you for an emotional rollercoaster. It has action, it has consequences of just that action, it rewards you for thinking outside the box, it punishes you when you avoid making connections. If anything, making sense of the bones of the story in our era of the pandemic should create a personal connection to the story Kojima wanted to tell.

The gameplay doesn’t need to be explained, it is a unique blend of a 3rd person action game as well as a walking simulator with a purpose. The gameplay has enough variety to not become mundane and the world is formed by YOU and other porters making a lasting impression throughout the entirety of its course.

now to some personal nitpicks.
The game is structured as a long feature movie and in that narrative structure there are weird things you have to accept, for one, the game world is supposed to symbolize the entirety of North America, yet traversing it you feel a sense of freedom but not variety in this post-apocalyptic world. Characters are nuanced but also suffer from being behind holograms in bunkers or locked to cutscenes. This world is truly empty and desolate, you can meet porters on the road, Beached Things, Terrorists, and mules but never normal civilians trying to survive in this world.

Some of the plot points can be tedious and overbearing, causing a disjointed narrative that makes up “special plots” to just be special. It is when the human elements of the story are allowed some breathing room that DEATH STRANDING truly shines, the facial animation, the dialogues and emotion you can see in the characters. Those small nuanced expressions that define each character are absolutely the most impressive achievement in gaming I’ve witnessed in a long time.

In the end this game had a story to tell, and in the end, it achieved it. I just wished we had gotten a more fleshed out IN-GAME world for us to connect with, to create bonds in.

Violence / needless killing is heavily penalized in this game, which I thought would be a bummer since it's a game and I need to blow some steam (pun?) but with how the story i set up it makes perfect sense, and to be honest it was a breath of fresh air. Combat is spaced out and in lots of cases can be avoided altogether, but when it is inevitable it is so incredibly thrilling (especially that first time encountering BT's). 

Story - 10/10 (still stuck with me after closing the game for the last time. Incredible story and, as importantly, incredible story-telling. This was a pleasant surprise.)
Combat - 9/10 (thrilling as HELL but you are very limited in what you can do / bring and the boss fights, while really cool to watch, are not exactly unique from one another)
Traversal - ehhhhhhh 9.0/10 (this one is hard because on the one hand the landscape is the best I've ever seen in a game. Hands down. However, the reluctancy to give it 10/10 is rooted in the traversal itself. While I understand and massively respect the attention to detail when it comes to portraying realistic traversal through difficult landscape....randomly tripping on a rock or mis-timing a jump and destroying my fragile cargo (thus resulting in a failed delivery) in the middle of a boss fight is incredibly frustrating. I found myself at times randomly yelling at my controller when Sam decides that it's time to go from slow walking while crouched in a BT area to popping a cartwheel to show the floaty folks that he is down to party)

Overall - 9/10. Thought-provoking title with limited but thrilling combat that takes place in such a beautiful, lonely setting.

[b]Neutral thoughts:[/b]

🔸This game might not be suitable for everyone, as some might have mentioned, it's a walking simulator. Well, Kojima stated long before releasing that this is ""another type of game"". So if you expect some RPG shooter with constant action and spawning enemies and headshots, don't expect that.
🔸The interface might look a little bit hard to understand, as some minor aspects of the game. But in time you're going to understand it.
🔸For some the lore might be too complicated, and the big amount of text in the received emails
🔸Shame we don't receive trading cards for this 
🔸Maybe some stated, but I'll mention again. There's no way to control the sound settings, just the general sound volume. Maybe that's a design decision, but for some this may be inconvenient. For me it's not, the sound synchronization is great. But nevertheless, this option should have been included.

51,DEATH STRANDING,74895249,english,"As a Hideo Kojima fan, I tried to like this game, I really did. I gave the game 60 hours of my time before throwing in the towel and deleting it. 

I read the reviews (the good and the bad) and knew what I was in for. I wanted to listen to some audiobooks while giving my hands something to do, maybe experience some avant garde gaming while I'm at it, so this seemed perfect. However this game fails even at that.  

This game occupies an uncanny valley between tedium and engagement. It's long periods of boredom peppered with frustrating interactions, cutscenes, and fights. The controls are clunky to a fault, going beyond a form of expression as some believe it to be, and the interactions (i.e. the non-hiking parts) are best described as annoying chores--yes, chores compared to trudging across repetitive scenery at a slow pace. Vehicle physics are abysmal. The narrative and cutscenes are self-indulgent, disjointed, unsubtle, and puerile, yet also preachy and self-righteous--a combination that reminds me of the schizophrenic. However, this is merely an exaggeration of Kojima's writing style, so I'm not going to hold this against this game, since this is about par for the course and aren't game-breaking. The other issues are much more severe.

This is an artistically and technologically pretty game that is a joy to look at, until it opens its mouth. No doubt the technical aspects of the game is laying the groundwork for something far greater, but this game as it stands is a highly-polished, over-marketed, AAA turd. I've been on Steam for about fifteen years (since Counter Strike 1.6), yet it is this game that brought me out to write my first and probably only review.  This has significantly dampened my mood for any more AAA games.

65,DEATH STRANDING,74878583,english,"Death Stranding is the latest from Hideo Kojima.  He’s best known for his Metal Gear Solid franchise while working at Konami.  Death Stranding is the first game after leaving that series and the question is can he still deliver on the style he’s known for. 

Death Stranding is two different games.  There’s the gameplay which focuses on the main character, Sam Porter, delivering packages, and the story that focuses on the world of Death Stranding. I’ll be breaking this up because the game also breaks up these two topics as we’ll see. 

The core of the gameplay is Sam delivers packages, and while that sounds quite simplistic, that is ultimately what Death Stranding has the player do for gameplay.  It’s very much a Doordash Simulator 2020 edition.  There are several systems to assist with that or make it more interesting, but nothing that changes the base action. 

Players will traverse a vast wasteland to visit different outposts, distribution centers, or prepper houses and while it sounds like there might be something interesting in each of those locations there’s not.  Every location feels like a cold sterile mess and so much more could be done with these different sites.

There are multiple levels of gameplay when players are walking between the various locations.  Without a large load, Death Stranding feels like a very chill and relaxed walk in an unknown land.  The world of Death Stranding is beautiful at times, and yet it’s also sterile.  There’s a very peaceful feeling of being the only person for miles around. 

If Sam starts to carry a larger load, Death Stranding starts to challenge the player to keep his cargo balanced to avoid falling over, and in this, the game starts to take on minor aspects of QWOP by Bennett Foddy.

Both of these systems work well and are quite interesting.  The problem that Death Stranding runs into is when it wants to make the experience have more action.  There are two major threats to Sam, other humans, who want Sam’s Cargo, and BTs, the unknown terror.  The problem is that Death Stranding never really makes either of these threats threatening.  Players can just run past most encounters and get away with almost no danger to themselves or their cargo.  

Death Stranding has some interesting systems that work with the delivery game, such as power armor and vehicles, but all that does is change the speed that Sam can move or how the weight is distributed  Ultimately the gameplay of Death Stranding is a walking simulator where the player is just getting between points

The one part of Death Stranding that can be interesting is the inclusion of other player’s items.  A player might leave a ladder on a cliff face, and later on, you might come across it.  Another player might leave a sign warning you about something dangerous ahead of you.  But the player interaction between these systems is a bit limited, and while players will receive likes from other players for doing a good job, these likes feel like a simplistic version of experience points so players can level up through artificial systems.  

Death Stranding reminds me a lot of Metal Gear Solid V, in that it has some large systems that players can safely ignore.  There are systems such as the dangerous and damaging system of Timefall, a story element that talks about the rain that ages humans and cargo.  Timefall sounds like it’s going to be a major problem but I never once had to even consider it.  Most of the time, Timefall just warned me BTs were in the area, and all that made me do is start to sprint through it, rather than worry about the damage it could do to me or my cargo. 

There’s also the ability to create transportation systems such as a zipline but even these don’t feel that interesting and after building out a couple of pieces, I found it was a better use of my time to just move quickly between two locations then creating a new transportation system that I rarely used. 

On the other hand, the story is every type of Kojima weirdness together and the fact is Death Stranding has a compelling story.  There’s a lot to talk about with the story but with 90 percent of the story being choke-full of spoilers. I hesitate to dive in. 

I will say that story would rival an early Metal Gear Solid.  There’s a lot of interesting characters, themes, concepts, and stories.  A few moments in the game are wonderful and the game keeps revealing more and more of its story in the final moments and somehow makes the large narrative very accessible. 

The only real issue with the actual story in Death Stranding is that the game is needlessly silent on a majority of topics early on.  What the BTs are, what Death Stranding means, and what is going on with the world is not explained to the player.  While many of these topics have spoilers that Sam will find out as the game goes on, there’s a base understanding that Sam has at the beginning of the game that isn’t well conveyed to the player. 

Death Stranding’s story is a great rollercoaster ride of emotion and filled with multiple interesting and unique experiences that players will enjoy.  Every major character has an interesting level of exposition and almost every character was a joy to meet after talking to them virtually for a decent amount of time. 

The real problem with Death Stranding’s story and thus Death Stranding as a whole is not how it’s told or what is said, but rather than have a tight 10-20 hour story, Death Stranding strings the gameplay out for 60 hours, and ultimately will stretch the story out over that time.  

The delivery of the scenes are good, but when there can be between two to eight hours between critical dialogue scenes that should be connected, it’s hard to have a cohesive narrative. 

Sadly this is a critical issue for Death Stranding.  It’s a fun and interesting game, but with so much time between scenes, the story struggles to remain relevant.  The gameplay is interesting but it’s a vessel for the story. I wouldn’t mind playing the gameplay by itself as it does produce a calming and interesting experience but at 60 dollars players deserve a better experience.  

I give Death Stranding a 

6/10  

though add a couple of points if you will mostly focus on just the story because it’s one of the most interesting stories being told right now. 

At the same time, I would probably wait until the game is priced between 20 and 40 as that feels like a better price.

If you want to know more about my opinions on the gameplay as well as the idea of it being a walking simulator or further information on the story, or faces of Death Stranding I recommend checking out my video that can be seen here:

You know when you help out a random stranger and feel a momentary connection?

[i]Death Stranding[/i] is kind of like all those things. 

It's a beautiful and wholly unique experience about bringing people together. The craftsmanship on it's own is something to behold from the animations striking the exact balance between impact and speed to the absolutely stunning facial capture and detailed photogrammetry of the world.

But it's the level of engagement in the inventive gameplay loop and how it involves both mechanics and thematic ideas that is so refreshing and arresting. This is a truly unique game that is almost difficult to understand why it works as well as it does. 

In contrast to the gameplay being almost laconic in the delivery of the ideas, the narrative elements are verbose, self indulgent and lacking in any subtly. But if that's the price to pay for this weird and one of a kind experience, I'm down with it.

Overall a very zen-like game with not much difficulty. For example, once you unlock zip lines and construct them at a new location the first time you reach it any difficulty related to delivering items there is completely gone.

Combat is serviceable but not deep or complex.

World building and its resource gathering aspects in tandem with the multiplayer elements were the best and most enjoyable parts of the game play and experience.

Delivering requires a lot of preparation, in order to deal with the obstacles in your way—including your carrying capacity, condition, the elements, terrain, enemies, etc. Walking and scaling are a core part of the gameplay and feel very satisfying when done correctly. Combat and driving however feel very unsatisfying, even if they do make your journey(s) more convenient.

This is also an ‘always online’ experience. Although you don’t physically meet other players, you do interact with the paths and objects they have left behind. This can greatly help the unprepared or (at worst) be an annoyance.

I went into it without reading any criticisms or reviews. This game is essentially a story delivery vehicle for the most part. The gameplay isn't too thrilling except when you are dealing with BTs. There is a lot of walking, which can be tedious, but isn't too bad. Although for a game which relies so heavily on movement, the movement itself is pretty lackluster. Walking down slopes and driving in general is janky. Combat is entertaining enough, but this isn't really a shooter. 

I feel like the BT battles weren't hard enough. I had the game set on the second highest difficulty, and while early encounters without a proper counter to BTs were thrilling, once you have weapons it lost its edge. I felt challenged only 3 times. Leaving the incinerator for the first time, the one sided battle with higgs on the beach, and the LAST BT encounter before the end of the game: getting ambushed by 4 anus monsters simultaneously.

The community mechanic is interesting, helpful most of the time, with a troll or two tossed in there.

If you are younger, I wouldn't recommend this game, as it won't really effect someone the same way as if they are older. As you age, you 'get' things better, understand them. 

That being said, the story is truly epic, and makes up for a lot of the game's other downfalls. As mentioned above, I found this game because of its music, and its music is very good. Overall, I would rate 8/10.

2.) Game tends to have control issues where its weird to ride the bike around so you will be walking and i mean lots of climbing and walking around. You can make this game easier by just using the online features to help guide you and let you use other players ladders, ropes, etc.

41,DEATH STRANDING,74750861,english,"Death Stranding is a somewhat controversial game; its slower-paced with minimal combat and the majority of the gameplay is delivering packages. Despite this, I still enjoyed my time with Death Stranding and never really got bored. The game starts off slow with most deliveries being done on foot, however, it begins introduces many structures throughout the story to make your life easier. Part of the fun is figuring out where to build ziplines or bridges in order to make future deliveries easier. 

There is some combat and stealth in the game, but nothing too major. Human enemies are mostly in camps and can be dealt with fairly easily during the cargo-recovery deliveries. The BTs (supernatural enemies) appear all over the map and are best dealt with a stealth-based approach. There are also a couple of boss battles, but they aren't too challenging and mostly rely on good inventory/health management. 

The story was amazing. Hideo Kojima incorporates a lot of original ideas that I haven't seen before in any other games or movies. My only complaint is that certain cutscenes are quite long. They aren't boring by any means, but it can be annoying if you want to save the game and pick it up another time. [spoiler] In particular, the ending lasted over 2 hours during which the credits played twice... [/spoiler] The graphics are also pretty, and enabling DLSS 2.0 can give you a significant bump in performance with no quality loss.

* Story: 0 / 5 
The story is simply garbage. I understand that this is a ""Hideo Kojima"" game and he likes to do things a bit different than other games. which is why i bought it thinking it might be similar to Metal Gear story which was amazing. 

But Deathstranding story is so bad it is on another level of garbage. It is as if he had no other stories or ideas, and wanted to make a game so bad that he said ok I will bring more celebrities and add a ton of emotions and add freaky stuff and mix it all up it will be a master piece!.... 

The answer is no... the story is garbage to a level that i was skipping cut scenes and was literally not interested in the characters or what do they have to say... 

To make it even worse... The game is almost 60% cut scenes! and you know it... every time they pop up and try to explain the story (Which I'm sure they think is amazing) I find myself trying to skip it... because it is simply boring and not fun... I was connected to the story in the beginning of the game and then slowly started hating it slowly until I reached a point where I was skipping cut scenes and just wanted to end it... 

What is funny is that as if the game knew that the story was garbage... because the closer you are to the end the more cut scenes it throws at you! As if the game is trying to say wait let me explain.. Just want let me explina... I was like NO Enough garbage just give me the credits already! 

* Graphics: 4 / 5 
Graphics are simply amazing. The open world and nature is simply amazing. Not as good as Withcer 3 but close. 

* Sound: 4 / 5 
Sound was beautiful. Captures the surroundings and on point. 

* Game play: 2 / 5 
Meh, there are a lot of small issues that makes you want to rage quit. 

Example, when you are reversing with a car and then want to go forward, it takes some time for the car to shift into gear and go forward which will ultimately end up with you sliding the car and then falling off a cliff. Hard to explain but trust me when you play the game and run into this situation you will understand. 

There are some areas of the game which the game suddenly wants you to get killed because it forces you to use some mechanics which needless to say was not fun. 

* Fun: 3 / 5 
Amazingly I found the Transporting cargo part Fun! 

Remove the garbage story. 
Remove the garbage mechanics. 
Remove the garbage game logic. 

It was fun meeting new people and delivering what they need and bringing them what they need. It was fun making my first car and hauling everything I found on the road and transporting stuff from one location to the other. It was fun building those roads so I can get to my customers quickly while building more reputations and gaining more tools as rewards. Anything else was garbage. 

Wish they would make a game which is JUST that and maybe add more options for cars. Now that would be a fun game. 

* End Comments/Hint: 
Second screen and your Phone are MANDATORY! 

This way you can watch Youtube or Netflix or check your phone or anything. Because the game has a lot of garbage cutscenes and you need something else to keep you awake otherwise you will end up rage quitting. 

* Knowing what I know now, would I buy it again: 
Yes... The delivery part and graphics are fun as I mentioned above. Just ignore the story and you will be fine.

All that.

From a regular Kojima hater, it hurts me to say this but somehow he created a very unique and coherent (which is not usually the case with him) story about reuniting humans at the brink of extinction. Yes, all you do is deliver stuff, however, at the same time your connection to the in-game (and ""online"") characters grows, constantly revealing new aspects of the game. For me seeing Sam, all of the main characters and the overall community you unite was the best thing about this game. Heartwarming stuff.

I did not even get to the weird stuff which most Kojima fans expected from this game. Not to spoil anything, it is all there but integrated into much more subtle game. Overall, if you search for more story-rich games, for me, this one is the best AAA games released ever. Plot resolution hit me hard with that bittersweet feeling and I was shocked that in a Kojima game basically every aspect of it was explained and purposefully connected to the overall story in a major way. No random bullshit just to leave ominous impression on a player. Best casting, acting and VA too. The amount of quotable, cheesy one-liners dropped in the most serious scenes was the most Kojima thing ever. 

Loved it. Everyone should play it. Still, most people will probably say that all you do is walk for hours with barely any gameplay (nearly no gunplay) until the next pretentious 1 h cutscene that is not even that clever:) Requires slightly longer attention span for sure.

It's a great game, however, the story is typical Kojima nonsense. The story is convoluted and just as hard to follow or get immersed in as any Metal Gear Solid game, just thinly veiled subtle nods to our current lives and what not, but despite the annoyance of trying to follow the story the game is solid. 

HOWEVER THE VEHICLES ARE THE WORST IN ANY GAME I HAVE EVER PLAYED! Seriously for a game that is all about deliveries and moving goods between points, the vehicles couldn't handle worse, be more annoyingly designed to get hung up on every single rock, or high center, randomly boost in the opposite direction, or just generally be a frustrating aspect to the game.

Despite the annoying ass vehicles and the weird convoluted story, the actual Gameplay is super addictive and incredibly fun when you finally drop off that cargo and GET THEM LIKES SON!

51,DEATH STRANDING,74743489,english,"Death Stranding is one of the most unique experiences in a game that I've played. It is a wholly Kojima game with many Kojima-isms (4th wall breaking, celebrity cameos, callbacks to Metal Gear Solid).

The gameplay is centered around taking packages from one location to another. That's it. However, the way that you plan your routes and utilize the structures that you can build in the game are where the fun is to be had. I often found myself becoming the road builder of the game in order to make taking packages between some of the main facilities an easy task.

The game also has a pseudo-online feature (reminiscent of Dark Souls). Other players that are a part of your world instance (you won't see them in the game) are able to build and leave behind structures and equipment that will also show up in your world. You are able to reward these players with virtual likes (does nothing, but is a cool mechanic to show how beloved you are by the community).

Another great aspect about this game in particular is the port. Along with Kojima's previous entry on Steam (Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain), this game got the A+ treatment on its PC port. I encountered no glitches, frame rate stuttering, or any other performance related issues. This game runs especially well if you have a RTX GPU with DLSS enabled.

So I actually enjoyed my first 3 hours in the game, even if my PC still can't handle it in its best settings, still looks pretty good to me. Hopefully, once I have the budget for my upgrade I would be gladly play this game in High Settings.

In terms of gameplay, I kinda get it why some people don't like this WALKING SIMULATOR but for me the gameplay is freaking creative and I highly suggest that Death Stranding should be played using a controller because you can feel the weight of the cargo you're carrying. I can really relate to this because during my days in Tarlac, I had to make deliveries to various people in Capas and I always love the journey of carrying heavy things and delivering it to various people who needs Water, Cooking Oil, Money,Soy Sauce, etc. I can totally agree tho, this is a FoodPanda Simulator, not a Walking Simulator.

About 25 hours in, still on Chapter 3:

I'm still making the most out of the side jobs and deliveries as I can and I love how much love was put into this game. HOWEVER, the only problem I've had with this game is the controller input. For some strange reason, the controller input repeats itself... EX: I press X to hop on the motorcycle, and 4 seconds later I randomly jump out of it damaging all my cargo. It's annoying and frustrating to deal with, especially going against enemies that are chasing after you. I know the simple solution is to change to KBM but it's a big issue for people who want a controller experience. 

This game is incredible and should not just be dismissed as a ""walking simulator"". The story is very enticing with characters that makes you want to learn about their backstory (Fragile, Higgs, Cliff, etc.) I'm still not super deep into the game but it's been an amazing experience by far and highly recommend it for people who want an immersive, slow-paced, adventure game.

It is what happens between these deliveries.  You have mildly annoying humans who want to steal your cargo and you have the supernatural trying to take your soul.

Why have I spent 145 hours in it and am not even halfway done?  I enjoy the scouting.  I would look at a mission and its route, not accept it, go towards where I need to make this trip and scout for the best route. Sounds simple enough, but you are dealing with areas vehicles do not always fit through, streams/rivers, avoiding the supernatural, making sure your electric vehicle doesn't run out of charge, etc. It is a real threat to have driven and not have reached your destination, your vehicle's charge is half gone, and you are unable to carry all the cargo on your back.  Do you turn back or do continue forward to your destination?

The grinding in the game is fully optional.  Will you build your highway systems to make your future orders far easier to deal with?  Or will you just deal with off roading it the entire game?

Playing the game with DLSS makes it pure eye candy.  Even 145 hours in I still find myself looking at the scenery and marveling at how amazing it all looks.

If you like plowing through games and not even putting any thought into the wildly imaginative story and think the supernatural is something silly, then the game is probably not for you.  But if you love building, connecting NPCs, seeing insanely looking beings, and have an affinity for appreciating landscape, then you just might enjoy the game.",1598023743,1598023743,TRUE,2,0,0.525179863,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,59,5,15615,805,8651,1601860581,,

Positives: Unique gameplay, beautiful visuals, interesting story and world, low minimum specs.

Negatives: Third person shooting mechanics feel dated.

In terms of world building, characters, story it is my favorite Kojima game. It has very experimental gameplay. It takes some getting used to, but I enjoy it a great deal. It's very addictive too. Walking simulator just doesn't do it justice. Planning the best route to make your delivery is an important aspect of gameplay. What hazards are on the path to your destination and would it be better to take an easier, but longer route? The combat mechanics need work, but it's a very small aspect of the gameplay. Nonetheless, it is important to mention that the combat is awkward. Compared to other third-person shooter, it just doesn't hold up. It ins't bad, it just feels dated. There are many things in the gameplay that has potential. A sequel would definitely have things to improve. The most significant innovation this game features is the 'Social Strand System'. This is the passive multiplayer feature which allows you to interact with other players in unique ways. Giving someone an item they need in a remote area. Building a helpful structure that appears in other players world. Everyone loves to see the numbers go up in games. Without a money system, this game uses 'likes' that you get for helping others. The visuals are unbelievably stunning! 4K, High framerate, Ultra-Widescreen and DLSS support gives Death Stranding some great high end PC visuals. It isn't a particularly difficult game to run and relatively low end PCs should have no trouble running it. The game offers lots of content. I have 100% the game in a little over 100 hours.

5,DEATH STRANDING,74645605,english,"A friend once quoted an article to me ""PC is coming to Death Stranding""

Jokes aside, I love this game, But for many people, this game is a walking simulator. And it is, but if anything, This game should be played by aspiring dame designers, as this game introduces new gameplay mechanics I think should be in new AAA games.

My taste in video games is weird, I love moving, I love it when a game has really interesting movement mechanics, N++ introduced momentum so that you can launch yourself across the room, Celeste has a sharp, but fair, movement set like wall jumps, climbs, etc. and Team Fortress 2 is all about movement, where you place yourself against the enemy will almost always dictate the winning player. So what makes Death Stranding interesting to me? Its all about walking, so there is alot of mechanics here. The terrain will make your progress fast or slow, the graphics of rocks on the floor may look like its safe to traverse, but reality, you have to hop rock from rock to make it past what looks like a safe passage. if you were climbing a hill, and you find yourself falling over, crouching will lower your center of gravity, making it easier to traverse hills. Going down a snowy slope can prove diffucult since snow cant support all the weight at one time, it will give, so you have to make diaganal movements, just like going down a sand dune.

Of all of this, I think designers can learn here, they can learn how to make walking fun. instead of some boring walk to point B, why dont you make designs that make walking more fun, like walking on a path will make you move faster, or make the terrain interact with the player, decreased defense or attack power. I imagine alot of people fast travel in Skyrim because walking is boring, but you might meet people on the roads of Skyrim, Walking is boring, and Hideo has taught the game industry that walking can be fun.

for all future games, If walking is a major thing you do, I expect walking to be fun, Im looking at you, Elder Scrolls VI",1597977739,1597977739,TRUE,1,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,336,25,2941,0,2792,1599019363,,

It is not a bad game, but it isn't a great one. This game feels a lot like Metal Gear Solid V: a really empty open world with almost to no reward for exploration.
It is really simple to summarize it. You are a delivery boy that keeps coming from point A to point B and so on if, and only if, you decide to mainly just do the ""Main Quests"" which are basically the same as the optional ones, with the exception that you don't usually keep coming back to the same places over and over again.

There is combat, but it was clearly not the focus on the game due to the focus of the story and of the character, although it is kinda sad because those mechanics work really well.

The ONLY reason to buy this game is just the story which is actually really good, but this is what you AT LEAST expect from Hideo Kojima.
There is some really lazy explanation that this game is actually for you to ""feel like you are helping the world"" and that you have to enjoy the trip and not the destination itself. This could be true if you didn't have to simply keep coming back through the same damn way over and over again.

I only tend to get about 4 hours a weekend to play a game which a far less than i am used to even on a busy week. I first put my feelers out on the discussions board because with what little time i have to game i don't want to waste it all as i've got 4 other games on my list at the moment that i want to work through and i'm glad i did. Further down you will find a ""For gamer dads"" score/list hopefully it will help fellow gamer dads like me.
When i first head about this game i thought what a joke, Kojima has finally lost his little mind. But the joke is on me, this is one of the best games i've played, my total play time is all in the first map! This game is pure Kojima, arty, deep and full of documents and audio logs. 

Let’s start with the mechanics, the main mechanic of the game is delivering orders carrying boxes from one place to another at first I thought how can that be engrossing enough to carry a whole game it turns out it is very engrossing. The satisfaction comes from making it to a new delivery spot as the environments are full of slopes, lumps, bumps, rivers (which can make you fall over and damage your cargo, you can regain balance if you are quick enough and plan accordingly) and hostile life forms human and other worldly which keep each delivery engaging from start from start to finish. You get tools to help you along your way (what I’ve used): A massive ladder that extends to climb cliff edges, across rivers and gaps, a climbing rope that you stick into the ground to get down slopes and cliff faces forging your own path for deliveries was so satisfying for me I find my self looking for ways to go just to use these tools. Once you’ve added the delivery spot to the network other players items appear in the word; like placed ladders and ropes which you can use at will (all helpfully on your map in green whilst your items are blue) which can help with future deliveries.
Other mechanics, We’ve got shooting (which I’ve not managed to unlock yet only just made it to the 3rd chapter), stealth thanks to mules who are a group of people who are addicted to amazo… packages and will stop at nothing to steal deliveries, driving is also a thing which is very helpful for delivering items quickly (you do unlock a bike early on but can’t take it with you off the 1st map) because they can carry some of the weight for you, allows you to easily out run most on enemies except for the BTs (not sure why they are called BTs not dived into the flavour text, will explore in the dad gamer section) if you run into them they will drag you kicking and screaming to a mini boss encounter if they can drag you down to the ground, signs work like Dark souls by leaving hints, requests and encouagements that can replenish your stamina which after a long haul though BT land is much needed (looking at you wind farm), lastly building, you can build structures like (what I’ve come across) watch towers to get a better view of an area, postboxes to drop off packages you can’t deliver for other players to drop off for extra likes (which rase your rating), power generators to recharge things and bridges, these structures will appear in other players games for them to use.

More mechanics, this the other USP when you add someone to the network other players items and structures appear because you don’t help other players directly or even see other players but you feel their presence by what has been left behind and you can leave a like or few hundred to rate the item. This is all fits together so well none of if feels like it’s been put in there just because, everything has been done for a reason and it shows.

Artistic merit, This game is choc full of symbolism there is a lot of talk about strands which is to symbolise connections and bridge gaps between people/different societies, you know typical Kojima fair but this is pure Kojima it all culminates in happy marriage between art and gameplay, all the little details from story to game mechanics make it an experience that just needs to be seen.

Gamer Dad plus points
+Generous auto saves (which can be triggered when safe by just resting)
+Saves start exactly where you save 
+Can pause any story videos and codec conversations
+Can be relaxing and fulfilling
+Emails highlight important information for you
+Not overly gory, more intense horror scares than gore
+Not much swearing
+Feel good vibes through out

Meaning that should you need to stop you can without any major loss in progession (or any at all) and is just a great game to turn on, listen to a podcast whilst you walk across some of the best in game scenery I have seen, I love looking at the environment and soaking it up

Gamer Dad Negitives
-LOTS to read if you want to flesh out the rest of the universe and story, my data page has over 99 entries to read and the emails do tend to waffle on a little much for my taste.
-Cinematics although infrequent but when they do happen take time (I had to skip 2 cinematics at the start of chapter 3 because my son was trying to turn off my PC after his nap and I needed to save)

Yeah. ""A Hideo Kojima Game."" It's no Metal Gear Solid, but it ticks all his boxes. The focus is absolutely on the story; Gameplay will be either hate it or get used to it and take in the little things; primary mechanic is movement and balance of cargo, occasionaly, you knock out crazy unemployed delivery guys, sneak by ghosts, fight big ghost bosses. The Gameplay isn't that special, unique as it is.

The story is insane, absolutely. I won't bother to try to explain, you'll either love the bonkers creativity or get lost and confused too much - don't skip cutscenes, read the lore entries. The theme that Kojima goes for in this outing is all about the connections and bonds you make with others, no man is an Island, re-uniting divided people, death, Extinction, that sort of thing.

If you just want to walk around and enjoy the scenery or pass time being a mailman, this is a decent enough itch to scratch. If you're the kind to pour over story and lore, or just enjoy a game with a message, this is absolutely something to check out. But if you're looking for a more typical action game, you're not gonna find it here...think this thing has more cutscenes than MGS4.

To those who want tips (also contains spoiler, i think):
[list]
    [*] [spoiler] First connect all preppers and distro centers to allow structure building and allow the game to add materials to roads from other players. [/spoiler]
    [*] [spoiler] If short on materials do materials standard order or hit the mules/terrorist camps. [/spoiler]
    [*] [spoiler] Before maxing out the connection level, wait for at least the zipline to become available to you and all will be much easier. That or unlock the truck from junk dealer and rebuild the roads. [/spoiler]
    [*] [spoiler] Thermals will destroy chilled deliveries. [/spoiler]

Story: The story is convoluted. Convoluted does not mean bad. I actually had my own theories while playing through the storyline, because the storytelling purposefully leaves blanks to be filled in later. Hideo Kojima tells the story that he wants to tell, and you can either decide to have an open mind about it and let the story unfold before you, or you can decide that you don't like that kind of storytelling.

Pros: 

1- Gameplay: Excellent gameplay. I became addicted with the delivering of the packages. Sam moves very smoothly, driving a vehicle is fun as well.
2- Action: There are moments when the game becomes a third person shooter and it is really fun and frenetic.
3- Story: One of the best story in a video game. Hideo makes this kind of things like no one else.
4- Duration: A lot to do, long game, a lot things to deliver.
5- Graphics: Awesome graphics impressive scenery 
6- Music: Great gloomy trip music. It really matched the atmosphere of the game
7- Difficulty: moderate, i played in normal difficulty and the game was enjoyed accordingly.
8- Replayable: I will wait some time to re play it. But I will definitely play it again. 

Cons

1- For some reason, in chapter 3 I had a lot of errors and crashes. For example i had the ""Error violation"" that is supposed to be related to the GPU drivers. But i had everything in place. I have checked everything that is related to. I have also re - downloaded the game but the error was  random
2-. Again in chapter three infinite loading times when I arrived in Every Terminal in that chapter. Specially when i  was riding a vehicle. Maybe this would need a fix.
3- Maybe it is done on purpose, but i would  have expected some fauna in the game o dead fauna at least. 
 
In conclusion, it is a 9.75/10 because this is a port of the PS4 game. Some errors needs to be fixed. But it does not change the fact that this game is a masterpiece. There is no game like this one in the industry. If you expect an action game like gears of war or call duty go and grab those games and forget about death stranding.

That being said, it isn't a game for everyone. This game is not combat based, but there are a few bits with combat.
This game is tagged ""Walking Simulator"" for a reason. It's about balance, carrying what you can, being cautious, planning ahead, and most importantly; patience.
To be more specific (With NO spoilers):

[h1]Story.[/h1]
This game is placed fairly modern day. The technology is boosted by the event this game is about, but other than that everything is standard. Science fiction for sure, but no flying cars or jetpacks.
The story is told mostly in cutscenes, with a few exceptions during a boss fight or exposition during gameplay. Not all the exposition is necessary and therefore some of it is tucked into seemingly regular delivery missions for mundane people.
Again, it's not required to understand the story, but more for the player that wants to dig deep. Or a completionist.
The story is told from the main characters perspective. He is neither ordinary or extraordinary. It's hard to explain without giving away spoilers.
Overall the story is excellent. It's more unique with a heavy focus on life, death, and limbo. It wants to tell you a story and that's that.

[h1]Storytelling.[/h1]
It does a good job getting the complicated world across. There are so many ways for lack of clarity in any topic in this game to result in confusion and an incoherent story/universe.
They take care to give you every bit of help along the way. While I'm 100% on board for stories that aren't always explained, this game didn't want to leave it open ended. There's no ""1,000,000 possibilities"" or questions unanswered. The game will show you the world, pose the questions, and answer all necessary questions.
If I were to compare the way they told this story I would say it's far more like a Quantic Dream game, like Detroit: Become Human. As opposed to God of War. The gameplay has some story, but it's 95% cutscenes.
But, to be clear, there are NO multiple paths to the end. There are NO multiple endings.
This game has one singular story. One beginning, middle, and end.
Quality story, world, and characters.

[h1]Visuals.[/h1]
Just ridiculously beautiful. I've run this game on max settings with 140fps easy. I run a GTX 1080. Nothing special hardware wise, but this game has wonderful optimization and runs smoothly.
There are reports that a few people have issues with the game crashing on loading up or fails to load up at all. I do not know how widespread that issue is. I have heard of it, seen it, and have seen a few solutions for those afflicted.
However, the support appears to be excellent and whomever is handling customer support is on the case. They have responded quickly and offered numerous potential fixes for a variety of problems.
The game has a lovingly crafted world. This game is screenshot heaven. With plenty of vantage points to appreciate scenery or boss fights that give fantastic shots of tension.

[h1]Gameplay.[/h1]
It's solid across the board. With very little focus on combat.
Your point is to deliver, not to fight. So the gameplay difficulty is almost entirely geared around how challenging it is to deliver your packages with minimal damage. There are many ways to achieve this. Use of vehicles for long distance, gear that help you traverse rough terrain, tools to assist in overcoming various obstacles. Your careful selection and balancing the weight of tools and packages, as well as the path you take to your destination; those sum up the difficulty of the game.
Combat is a part for sure and most people like more combat in games. Death Stranding doesn't really break new ground with combat. It's pretty simple. There are guns, your fists, and vehicles. You can use stealth (recommended), but when stealth isn't an option you can engage in decent combat.
The combat in the world like with MULES and some unsavory types really isn't anything special. Shoot them or not. Kill them or not. Killing results in a greater number of BTs in the area, which makes life more difficult. So you should be careful of that.
The combat the game puts you in, like in a boss fight, isn't unique. Once more you have common weapons like a handgun, assault rifle, rocket launcher, etc. You aim, you shoot, the boss gets hurt.
Combat is smooth, but definitely nothing ground breaking. Once more, with feeling; this game doesn't focus on combat.

[h1]Dialogue/Characters.[/h1]
This area gets some flak at times. Some people love the characters, some people hate them.
Personally, I adore them. I had my healthy suspicions at first of their intent or, outside of the game, their writing and design. But as I played more I found myself growing fond of the characters and their strangeness.
The dialogue could definitely be worked on in a few areas. Certain conversations feel forced or lacking in sincereity. It can feel awkward or, for me, sometimes cringey.
Not that it detracts from the game really. After playing it and getting deeper into the story I had adjusted quickly to how awkward some things were. Some people were strange and there were rational reasons for it. A few rare moments where I wanted to take the script to Kojima Productions, lay it out in front of them, and ask what were they thinking.
At the end of the day, having completed the story in this game, I can now say I care for these characters. Their awkwardness, their unusual behaviors. At the end of it all it kind of just came together for me and all I wanted to see is what happens to them now.
So a lot of the strange issues with dialogue or writing did not detract from the story itself.

There are a few characters that utter puns in this game and they know who they are.

[h1]Overview[/h1]
I'm trying not to give any spoilers at all so the review is safe to read. It is hard trying to give criticism to something I cannot explain.
I'm not a professional reviewer and I very rarely review anything at all. So my thoughts are not as organized or as well put as others. I would definitely look through a good number of reviews before making a decision to buy.

This game is unique. It is its own kind and I love it. I want to see another Death Stranding or more games like it.
I think this is a rare game that belongs up there with the great games of the last few decades.

I do not believe this game ""has a little something for everyone"" as IGN likes to list in all their reviews.

This game has a lot for the right players and absolutely nothing for others.
People who prefer a game to drop you in and say ""Go play!"" This is not that kind of game.
People who prefer a game to tell you a story subtly. This is not that kind of game.
People who like fast paced games, combat oriented games, or games that turn you loose with a thousand different options.
This is not that kind of game.

You have one goal and only one way to get it done. The path is rough and riddled with rocks, mountains, rivers, and frustration. You have to build the road to cross it and even then you are forced to traverse the worst terrain with the most delicate cargo. You have a task that must be repeated a hundred times.
This game is tedious and slow. Patience really is a virtue here.

But I love this game. Despite the hours I spent walking from city to city or to the small prepper shelters out and about, I never listened to music, watched a video on my other monitor, or had anything playing in the background while I traveled. I was always in the moment.

Not a lot of people will pay $60 to trip on a rock and destroy all your fragile cargo you just spent the last 15 minutes struggling your way up a mountain to deliver.

Also, the more I play this game the more I realize no one at Kojima Productions has ever either driven a vehicle or been in one being driven.

I highly recommend this game. But if it's not your style, than wait for Horizon: Zero Dawn. That game is fantastic too.",1595228406,1597854679,TRUE,307,6,0.913475513,14,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,250,17,4010,0,3416,1595472933,,

[*]The trailers make the story out to be weird just for the sake of ""being out there"" and confusing to the player but a lot of the weirdness is explained and the game has a real narrative. The weird things you see in the trailers make sense in-game.

Those who say otherwise are merely pandering to the Kojima hype surrounding this title. This game is so lacking in content that it is decades behind a modern open world AAA title. A perfect metaphor for the enjoyable content found in this game can be seen in the screenshots above this comment. What do you see in the vast majority of those screenshots? Rocks? Grass? And not much more. This game is hollow. It is empty. There's just nothing there. The story is so overly complicated that it is constantly tripping over itself. The textures are good, but the graphics are terrible. How can that be? Density. This game has nice AAA textures with the density of a game that came out 20 years ago. And finally, the game-play. If the game-play were good, I could forgive any other offense, but it's not. It's the worst part of the game. Take a moment to think about other open world games. The Witcher 3, Skyrim, Fallout, Red Dead 2, hell, even GTA V and Assassin's Creed. There are things to do. You may run into an interesting NPC, find a location worthy of exploration, discover some interesting treasure, a unique vehicle or weapon, you may be impressed by the animals you see and how they interact with one another, or a random event taking place, there are many ways to breath life into a sandbox game. Death Stranding employs none of these techniques. It's you, a copy and pasted terrain, and some crates walking A to B, A to B, A to B. THAT'S IT.

Story and everything about it. No spoilers, but trust me it was amazing.
Runs well FPS wise

Has the distinct Kojima charm


Cons:
The gameplay got boring for me about half way through the game. It was novel at first to try and pick up as much stuff as possible, but in the latter half I found myself rushing through missions just to see the next cutscene. I wont go into too much detail, but know that if you're playing Death Stranding for the gameplay you might be disappointed.
I encountered a few performance issues. My game crashed about 10 times throughout my playthrough. Nothing too crazy, but still worth noting. Also, if you go too far too fast on a vehicle, expect to spend some time loading. It may have been my system(somehow, even though I'm running an NVME SSD???), but I would sometimes spend over a minute loading smack dab in the middle of gameplay. It really broke the immersion a few times.


I personally loved the game in the end, but to each their own. TLDR, if you like story based games, buy this right now. If you don't give a shit about story, definitely pass.

The graphics are great and everyone seems to agree that it's ported very well. I was very surprised I could run it in 4k with (I think) everything set to the max setting with my 1060.

The story is unique and interesting and as weird as you could hope for (you poop at bases and then get poop grenades to throw at enemies because yOu hAvE sPeCiAl DnA), it has famous people in it like a movie.

The gameplay is slow-paced but kind of soothing because you travel through environments and really pay attention to them. In all honesty, before I finished the game I had gotten tired of navigating environments. It's rocky everywhere so you're either walking or driving around or over rocks, or slowwwwly walking in snow, etc.

I really enjoyed the online aspect, and it's rewarding to see that you built a bridge and hundreds of people gave you likes because it helped them too. Plus you'll come across ladders or recharging stations or helpful signs that other people placed, and you appreciate them doing it.

Honestly it's pretty easy unless you go for high difficulty. It rewards you for doing extra side missions, and you could put a lot more time in than I did.

87,DEATH STRANDING,74527275,english,"This game fills a niche that I think a lot of people have been longing for, a game where the challenge lies not in twitch reactions or precise aiming, but the adventure itself. 

Where going from A to B in most open world games is at best a nice disconnect from the action and at worst a tedious chore, in Death Stranding it is the challenge, the experience. It allows for players to approach the problem of getting somewhere in their own fashion and pace, and does so with a wonderful pacing. Even though a route may seem nearly insurmountable at first, it gives a great feeling of accomplishment and relief when you arrive, goods safely in hand. This is coupled with a great story that unfolds slowly at first, but becomes more intense the deeper you get. 

Rest assured that, story-wise, this is one of those games that challenges you with a lot of mysteries, but answers them all by the time you are done, in a way that I'd wager very few would find predictable.

The only downside sticking out for me would be the actual fights that occur a few times. The nature of the controls make battles seem unnecessarily clunky, and bosses sometimes have way higher health pools than what is necessary. Luckily, such fights are few and far between.

Important to note, I would recommend going as high as you are comfortable with in difficulty, as it really does improve the experience, and immersion into the story by making it more challenging. 

All in all I'd say, on a scale where 1 is trash and 10 is a must play, it's a solid 9/10 if not actually 10, only being hampered by somewhat lackluster boss fights. This score is however assuming that you are not looking for yet another MGS, or yet another Assassins Creed.

99,DEATH STRANDING,73575669,english,"you think this is a nice game with cool graphics and a story like from a movie or a book.
but I gotta tell you, its not as nice as it seems.
but lets talk about the good things first:

+ graphics are good, just as good as they are in any ubisoft game (division2/ac odyssey)

+ mvp of the game was the audio designer, such a genius!!!!

+ the implemented songs that were added on certain triggered spots are nice, but they're not very different to eachother. maybe cause most of them are by the same band

+ the visual design of the fonts the interface the scanner, looks beautiful

+ dynamic effects like weather switching from sunny to rain/snow or even give u a total whiteout or bossfights and just everything that moves looks excellent

+ scanning multiple celebrities into a game isnt always a good thing but some were lovely to see, such as ""margaret qualley"" who plays Lockne and Mama or ""Tommie Earl Jenkins"" as Die-Hardman. Also Mads Mikkelsen was pretty fitting at some scenes

+ the movement feels real, the combat the step-by-step walking felt very nice

lets hop to the negative parts of the game:

- it takes 3hrs with maybe 30min of actual gameplay to get into the game and you're already 100% confused what all this is supposed to mean

- once theres no cutscene to watch you just grind yourself thru delivery missions doing kind of the same over and over again. you can upgrade structures you build or just do nothing cause u dont have to to complete the game. half of the structures are already placed by other players and thats enough to reach your targets most of the time

- as soon as u end up in an npc conversation it just never seem to end quickly enough. their chatting is extended to the maximum and another point why this game might make u sleepy af

- the first bossfight on ""normal"" difficulty wasnt doing anything at all, way too easy, the other bossfights are kinda easy too cause the game doesn't want you to die I guess. and with that being said, there's the option to donate gear which then might appear in other players bossfights. as far as I know is that once you use your ""5"" key to yell for other players like ""hello I'm sam"" or whatsoever turns into ""I need help"" during a bossfight which then lets grey figures appear that throw weapons and medkits at you to just pick it up and continue fighting. so you can just be unprepared as usual. 

- for 9 episodes you been chasing an evil guy that you finally beat in episode 9, but the game isnt over yet... it couldve been done but there are 6 more episodes to play. therefore the dramatical ending was a bit useless. as if they added more and more content to the game cause they had a bit more time to invest.

- the ending of the game is sooo stretched out ... I stopped counting how many creditrolls I noticed, it just keeps going on and on..  and within the last 3 hrs theres no actual gameplay ( zzzZZZ )

- the acting looks awful sometimes, not sure what rigs they used to scan those people but ninja theory did it way better. if you like those games where they scanned actual people into a game, u gotta check out hellblade. thats pure perfection which blends from game to cutscene with such a nice transition that you won't even notice it. 

- the interface of death stranding is an absolute mess. the cargo management and mission / item windows are a pain to scroll through. and after each mission you're just skipping for your life...  entering a vehicle, dropping items, doing things in a terminal.. takes way too long for a game thats focused on cargo delivery.

- is there even a way to die in this game? or is it just trying to scare you and thats it ? cause once you see a bt, you can just act like being caught and then run out of the area with ease instead of sneaking around for hours.

- the story kept being confusing til the very end, and still then it has lots of things that don't make any sense.

result:

if you still want to play this game.. get it somewhere cheaper , maybe with a voucher discount or something like that.

Bad character development for most except sam, he cool but he suffers from an even worse edition of ""i cant talk Snake snek"" from mgsv. But in this game it's supposed to make sense for that since he's a quiet and lonely person in nature. But it's just shown to the player very poorly especially when dealing with certain side storys, like the couple reunion since in that big cutscene, he's not even there.

Do I recommend this game? 100% Yes. Once in a life time experience. But I want to tell you, that you HAVE to be in a mood for something more than a game. 
This game is about death, obviously; about inevitable end of everything and your choice to accept it or to fight it; about love of a father - aggressive, defensive, warrior-like love; about love of a mother - caring and protecting; about family; about conflict negotiating; about coping with fear; about searching for something good when everything feels like falling apart; about revenge; about sacrifice.
But in the end - this game is about life, with all the obstacles, people, connections, deaths. 
This game rises so many questions - for 1 answered there's 5 unanswered, yet, it's awesome to turn on your imagination to try to understand what's this all about. 
You might feel like burnt out at some point - just make a pause and return. Or just continue the story which unlocks you all the possibilities to overcome the challenges. 
It's all about journey. 

My review might looks confusing, but this is what I feel right now, a confusion. And deep sorrow for finishing the game, because if I could - I would delete my memories of it just to play it again. 

Definitely - this is the game 100% WORTH of your support. And we need to see more such original AAA projects.

From the unbelievable visual detail to the unforgettable soundtrack, Death Stranding draws players in and securely holds their attention like precious cargo. It carries that attention across spanning landscapes, thought provoking dialogue, and immensely tense encounters with the other side. 

There are a certainly things Death Stranding doesn't do right, but if nothing else this game masterfully delivers its message.

Kojima set out to build a game that pushed players towards connection; Death Stranding connected with me as one of the most engaging, rewarding, and meditative experiences I've enjoyed in a long time.",1597711143,1597711143,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,163,5,2016,54,1907,1601357444,,

It reminds me of MGS4, where the focus is on telling a complete story. The game is not heavy on action. You can go into camps where you can fight, but the story only has a handful of action sequences. It is a bit convoluted, which you might expect if you played other Kojima games.

The best thing about the game is its uniqueness. So many new games today are just remakes or remasters just the same game with a different paint job. This is something completely different. It's a game for the sake of a game not making money. You can feel a lot of love went into it.

21,DEATH STRANDING,74478029,english,"This game is a simulator. 

If you've ever been hiking, and had to decide what to take & how much, considering the total weight and terrain, and then going on that hike, this game is very similar to that sort of experience. But how is that fun in a game? Without spoiling Death Stranding, the game constantly rewards you for each successful ""hike"" most often by giving you a new feature, items, vehicle types, weapon types, and tool types for the player to increasingly consider which items to take on the NEXT hike. For example, if your path goes through an enemy camp or through a ghost-zone, you'll have to take items accordingly. A smoke-emitting decoy cargo box is much more interesting to the enemy camp than it would be for the ghosts, who only care about how close you get to them. If you get too close, then you'll need to do some damage. They're not difficult fights, but they're there to distract you from the rest of the game.

What you're NOT doing is calculating and remembering the weight of each individual item, constantly fretting over it's position on your back or if you've carried too much. Instead, you simply accept the delivery order, use the ""auto-arrange"" button, and carefully consider what you can take on your next hike within the clearly defined ""load limit"" which is actually quite generous. 

For the Online structures, I found them to be an optional but very neat part of the game. Someone else built a bridge over a river that saved you the trouble from trying to find a rocky spot to make a makeshift ladder bridge. Someone else placed a convenient rope down a mountainside or put a generator just before the next unconnected zone. You're not always spoiled by these luxuries, and plenty of times you place them yourself. Your first time into each ""zone"" will not have any player-built structures in them, they'll only appear after you satisfy the requirement to ""connect"" that area (which most often is easily done by finishing story quests). 

Story is classic Kojima. It doesn't make much sense, and tries very hard to make broad philosophical pokes but it really just wax and wanes. It does its job by keeping you interested in the world of Death Stranding itself.

Just because this game is not a  shooter game  like previous games made by Hideo Kojima.  (there is a little bit of third-person shooting gameplay)

so the game starts off by going through a cutscenes (btw theres LOTS of cutscenes) and intorduce you to the cargo carrying mechanics and deliver packages in a open world. You might get bored really quickly because the story takes off very slowly and weird at beginning. it starts to get good from about 10 hours in. but around the end it becomes all worth it. 

this is also a punishing game when you're going though a tough terrains and one mistake causes your packages to be destroyed or lost. you might scream in rage or cry. That's when you place some equipment. so not only can you get yourself out of tough situations but also for the other players. and that's the whole point of this game. you connect by helping others and being helped by stuff left by other players. I remember someone left a ""all terrain skeleton"" in the random postbox while i was stuck in the snowy mountain. i was so happy to find it and climb the rest of the mountain to my destination. its kind of a wholesome game of helping each others out even though we don't see each other in the game. you can ""like"" the stuff people built as in 'nice' or 'thank you'


here's some main things in game that i didn't like. 

-ads. theres few ads in game like:  the tv show Norman Reedus is in. i just don't like this because its breaking the forth wall and cuts away from the immersion of playing the game and also for the main character Sam. 

-cutscenes. like i mentioned above, there's few too many unnecessary cutscenes. i find myself also clicking the skip button all the time when Sam is in private room. (safe house) 
 
-inventory management. its made by Hideo Kojima and you know he loves those crazy inventory management mechanics like MGS5. 

also the price. its a really hard choice to make for a game that you're not too sure about. if money is the problem then i recommend PS4 version. its on sale for $30CAD on amazon at the time I'm typing this. I just chose to pay full price on steam because of the fps and graphics setting that can be offered for the PC version. i heard that console version's fps is capped at 30 fps (you might wanna look it up) but honestly didnt look that bad on youtube review i saw.

The gameplay isn't perfect, but it's close. It's the same with the pacing of the game. 

It is without a doubt Hideo Kojima's crowning masterpiece, and really unlike anything I've played before. Perhaps the closest game I can link it to is Shadow of the Colossus, in that I feel both game transcend into the realm of legitimate art.

30,DEATH STRANDING,74467401,english,"This game evoked many feelings for me, and not all of them were pleasant. In fact, while I enjoyed most this game, and even loved some of it, there are a few glaring issues that are impossible to ignore and did take away some level of enjoyment I had. But, it's art. It's experimental and pushes the boundries. So those things can be overlooked right?

Let's start with the good. 

I'm reminded of some of my enjoyment from Zelda: BotW. You travel across the land, except now the game mechanics are built around that traversal. Lately, the most boring thing you can tell me to do, is to kill a room full of enemies, especially if killing them means shooting them. Majority of video games ask you to kill something, over and over again. This game, how ever, asks you to cross a river, and it's tense. You're brain has to work out all these different possibilities of what could happen. You could get swept away, you could trip on a rock, maybe you should build a ladder, but you might need that ladder later, so maybe if you look further down the stream you'll find a smaller gap you can jump over, or maybe another player will have built something that aided you. It's like using muscles my brain has never really gotten to work out in a video game. Early game is cross river, towards the end you'll be climbing deadly mountain passes and clifffaces, all whilst hauling around tons and tons of packages and there's real tension when you trip and watch your packages start floating down a river or rolling down a hill. It brings out a lot of the same feelings I have when playing a game like Animal Crossing or Harvest Moon. 

While your going from point A to point B, your greeted with beautiful, otherworldly vistas. They are mostly barren and without life, yet each area you come across has the touch of having been meticulously hand-painted by someone. Every rock placement, and figuration, and deformation looks stunning and I swear that someone went over every area of this damn place with the amount care and detail that a landscape artist spends on a painting. Every time I looked up, my jaw dropped. The colors are surreal and alien, you feel like your on another planet so often that I'd have to slow my pace and just walk slowly, taking it all in. The sci-fi elements are outstanding, from the design to the implications in the world you explore amazing. Here's where the first issue comes up.

Kojima spills soooo many beans within the first several hours, that it makes it feel like so much of what he put in the trailers was just for hype. All the lore slaps you in the face with about two books full of theories and emails from people you do not care about. I don't know if I've ever been less interested in NPC's wants and needs. Most the people you meet, you never actually meet! You just get a hologram of them telling you thanks for the delivery, by the way, here's my opinions and theories on everything. Even the main cast of characters that the game is like this, they tell you should care about them an why. Most characters only one or two moments where they actually do anything, and most of this happens in the later half. Even more important moments happen in the last 10%. It's a shame too, because some of the actors really fucking sell their performances. There's two at the very end that are nearly Oscar worthy.

It's jarring because the whole game is about connection with other people. Yet so many of these connections are emails, emails are people who never are willing to leave there homes to say hi to you. It's a little to real to the current state of the world (even before covid-19) where most people spend more time on their cellphones than with actual people, and again, MAYBE that was the point. There's even a metaphor by making what is basically your cellphone into a handcuff. I can't tell how much of this was intentional, avent garde stuff that Kojima likes to try to pull off with MGS2 and Phantom Pain, or if it's just actually bad and Kojima's ego has just gotten to him a bit to where he assumes anything he comes up will be genius. Or he's gotten tired, he's already made plenty of games with iconic characters, maybe he just didnt wanna try and prove himself again. Probably a bit of both. 

Honestly, that's okay. I came here for a lonely trek across strange lands doing weird Kojima things like taking a bath in hotsprings while singing to a baby in a jar whilst a parellel universe version of myself joins in from afar.

That being said, the trek sometimes disappointed me too. The game does not reward exploration. Any time I strode off the beaten path and went where the game didn't want to me to go, I returned back the that lonesome road in tears. Either what I found wasn't suppose to be found yet and could only be accessed later in the story, or just had no real relevance despite looking important. On the latter for example, there's this huge crater that's there because of story reasons, and there's this little narrow passageway seemingly off the map, being a noticable part the game will allow you to explore. Yet the moment you get to the top of the crater, you hit an invisible wall. The area is shaped in a way that is BEGGING me to explore it, but I go there and, nothing? Really? Are you kidding? I'm still mad about this. I'm mad how many times I dared explore only to find I had wasted my time. Even if there was nothing to physically obtain, just let me look inside the crater! I wanna see it! That's why we go on hikes right? I still can't understand why its programmed this way.

One more thing I loved about this game. The action, when it hits, hits hard. Some set pieces blew me [spoiler]haha pun[/spoiler] away. For those of you wondering if there's more to do than just haul packages, you do get weapons, and there are enemies. They are far and few in between, but I found that made their encounters more meaningful and more tense. I didn't defeat these men cuz the game told me that's what I should do, I defeated them to protect my precious cargo. [spoiler] The boss fights are some of the best I've seen in any game ever. I'm making this a spoiler because I didn't even know there were bosses in this game and I was pleasantly surprised. [/spoiler]

Oh yeah, the music in this game is also great. It fits the tone of the game so well and anytime a track came on I felt great.

Final thoughts, there is also some outstanding imagery the game uses. If you've seen any of the trailers or images you probably know what I am talking about. There's some stuff in cut scenes that looks fantastic, but doesn't ever give you a good enough reason for why it's happening, and stumbles over itself trying to make sure you get why it's important. 

TL;DR. This game is a clusterfuck of amazing moments, music, vistas, refreshing gameplay, solid performances from both voice and motion capped actors, art design, and epic high-octane action. But they all sort of feel like they exist within a vacuum, floating around, and having no real connection to each other. I imagine Kojima sitting there, bless his heart, coming up with these fantastic ideas, seeing all these cool things happen in his mind, and saying ""Wouldn't it be cool if this also happened?"" And his staff is like ""Ahh! Yes Kojima-san, excellent idea. But, what does that have to do with the story?"" To which he paid no mind, he merely wanted to see all these things in his game. I actually really admire that. I feel like it's the type of game you would have gotten if you had given a few million dollars to a child, right down to the green army figures you collect, and the monster energy drink.

You know if you'll enjoy this game or not. If you like walking sims, and new takes on the video game medium as a whole, then you'll enjoy this. If it looks boring, then it will probably bore you. This game is art. It's why there are so many polarizing opinions on it, because it breaks the mold. And in that sense, it's worth experiencing.",1597685516,1597685516,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,206,39,3410,0,3410,1597647313,,

32,DEATH STRANDING,74466904,english,"Lets get one thing straight, this game was seriously misunderstood at launch, didn't help that all the media and early reviews of this game deemed it a 'walking simulator' or 'no gameplay'. Its a shame because this is truely a gem of a game that more people should play. Yes you deliver packages from point A to B 90% of the game, and you might ask, 'whats the appeal of that?'. Well let me tell you, as cliche as it sounds, its not about the packages themselves but the journey you had. This game is all about making connections, time and time again Sam is reminded he brings people together and thats what you do in this game. You connect a broken american together by essentially hooking up their internet so they can use their 3D printers lol.

This game is beautiful, its captivating, it has amazing story telling, and top notch voice acting. Not to mention it has an addictive game loop. Its hard to understand the draw of this game if all you have seen from others is the frustrations and inconveniences set by the games mechanics. However, once you make it about 3 hours in and the game opens up its gorgeous open world, you really can appreciate the grind of this game. I would hardly call it a grind, as i look at all the hours i've accumulated, i can remember so many instances where i told myself 'just one hour today', only to see the next moment i checked the time, 4 hours had gone by. 

Its the satisfaction you get from delivering these packages to the NPCs, the fact that every path you take makes it easier for the person to come after you. This open world of broken america feels so empty and daunting at first, but once you unlock zip lines and you're wizzing past previous stretches of land you once trecked and see all those blue lights of the watch towers, bridges, roads, generators, vehicles, the world seems so much more inviting and developed. 

Now i understand the criticisms of this game, yes the story is long, yes you're walking, and absolutely YES is the UI the weakest link in this game, but if you already think the previous work of Kojima in the MGS series was not your taste, maybe this isnt for you as this is really peak kojima. Still, i implore you to at least try this game, if not for the story, then for the world, if not for that, then how about the enemies in this game.

About those, i feel like thats an entirely different game. You've probably seen some boss fights online and thought 'wtf is this' well its bat sh*t crazy let me tell you. Theres really two different games in Death Stranding,  you deliver packages in one game and then fight BTs in the second layer of it. Now the gun play is a little janky at time, its definitely no shooter, and i dont think its trying to be. I played this game on Very hard and i actually had a difficult time in SOME parts. Most the time you can just put this game on easy and enjoy the story and cut scenes unbothered, however it would do it injustice if you didnt at least try to fight the enemies in this game. The boss fights are a spectical in itself and you might find yourself in awe looking before you die and get pulled into the seam. You should really push through to the end of this game and ACTUALLY finished it around the 45 hour mark to see, just some incredible battles that make you think 'how did anyone think of this?'.

Some things that really stand out in this game that make the gameplay even better is the sound design. I played MGSV on console and PC and thats probably one if not the best stealth game ever. This game is no MGS game BUT its still pretty good. Everything makes a sound in this game and everything rewards the player, like the sound of likes you get from pretty much everything you do in the game. The guns sound great, the rain, the noise your little spinny thing make, the BTs are quite scary at times early on, BB even when crying still sounds good. 

In conclusion, this game is amazing. Its truely a masterpiece in my opinion and deserves all the praise it gets. Its story is moving, its combat enticing, its game mechanics are tricky but rewarding, its greater meaning and metaphors will have me ponder this game for some time long past this games prime. Its worth every penny and you should absolutely give this game a chance. Theres so many things i want to bring up, but at the end of the day, you'll play it and see how it all clicks and then you'll be smiling on your face when you reach the top of that mountain, or cross that river, or build that road.",1597684783,1597684783,TRUE,1,0,0.523809552,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,77,5,4022,0,3630,1599088859,,
33,DEATH STRANDING,72682491,english,"Edit after some consideration: So I feel like I've taken off Sam's Gold Sunglasses and starting to see some issues with DS. Mainly in the difficulty balance. I feel like DS did a really bad job of minimizing spoilers (I had the no spoilers option enabled). I was seeing Safe Houses before I could build them myself (for example). There was WAY too much help. I never came close to running out of ammo and never needed to eat a cryptobiote until the fight with Higgs. I always had some extra blood. There were always way too many player structures, I never needed to place anything other than a few zip lines after I opened up a place because there was an abundance of player structures. I also 5 starred every place, which may have contributed to this, but I just with there was about half as much help.

If a higher difficulty would have fixed this issue, that's my fault I guess, but I remember having the impression that all difficulty was based on combat.

I never died on Normal difficulty. Because I was warned not to kill anyone, I never got to see what happened when someone died. That is kinda my fault, but I just had no clue what would happen and didn't want to screw up my playthrough.

This game is great, I would play it again if there was a major expansion. However it wasn't without some big flaws that I needed to overlook.

Final Review after 130+ hours: Finally completed the game (not 100%) and I can say that I enjoyed 99% of it. The end cutscenes were extremely overkill. The over acting and repeated scenes really started to kill the epicness they were trying to achieve. However, in the end, I was fine with it. I get that they wanted to tie up all loose ends and they definately did so. I'll tell you what though, I guessed every twist from the very beginning, not exactly, but for the most part everytime a new character or concept was introduced, I started to puzzle everything together and the end only confirmed my suspicions. Again, I loved this game so much and endured what I didn't enjoy because I know that the devs put their soul into it.

However, after getting to the end and having the option to 100% it. After 131 hours, I'm done. Time to move on to the next epic game. I'll always remember how great this game is and would always recommend it to anyone. Probably one of the best games I've played in maybe 10 years.

Edit after 100 hours: This game still has me entranced. I just can't get away from it. Although I do have the occasional crash, I never lose too much progress due to its great autosave and manual save system. However, I do wish that it would autosave when leaving a safe house/private room.

My only real complaint is that the only place you can customize your backpack and apply a backpack cover is in a private room. It should really be something you do at a kiosk, as forgetting to do so and then having to go back into the private room is such a pain in the ass.

Other than that, and the desire to be able to listen to music in a vehicle, this game is 9/10 for me even after 100 hours. As much as I want to play HZD, I'm happy waiting until I 100% this game. In fact, I'm now so enticed by Kojima that I might even play MGSV before HZD.

WOOOT! A game so great I bought it twice! I like how they made the PC version with lots of configuration options, can't wait to try it out with keyboard mouse. Though I suspect it will still be better via controller.

FYI, I have this game on PS4, but just don't care for the console. I probably put 30-40 hours before deciding to wait for the PC port.

The story makes no sense from the beginning and can be quite confusing for a while, but once it clicks, it's super cool.

It looks like this game is a mailman sim in a dystopian future, and it is, but there is way more to it. The acting is superb, the atmosphere is amazing. At first I didn't like the emoji holograms everywhere, but you kind of understand why they did this. Either way, you can just turn them off if you don't like them.

A lot mention that this game is repetitive and it is, but the game is all about the story, and the progression. It's a relaxing, casual game that can become very tense at times. It can be frustrating as well, but once you get the hang of everything, it gets easier.

It's probably not for everyone, but no game is. I immensely enjoyed it and it was certainly my game of the year in 2019.",1594742809,1597683885,TRUE,1,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,572,53,7884,0,60,1597436874,,

I'm not much of a gamer, but DS looked interesting so I gave it a go. For me, the game had two main problems:
- First it seemed full of missed opportunities.
- Second, it couldn't decide what it wanted to be and consequently didn't do any one thing as well as it could have.

The setting is beautiful, and it's great to explore. The problem is the exploring doesn't yield anything interesting. No deep hidden secrets at the top of a mountain, or interesting Easter eggs. The datachips you find are mostly unimportant and don't reveal anything interesting - in fact they just appear to be a few factoids about the game designers favorite things - and seem incredibly egotistical.

I like the premise of being a porter that has to overcome difficult obstacles - trouble is, once you have access to bikes, every delivery is easy! It then becomes a driving game, and the trouble with that is the driving mechanics are f**king abysmal, and easily the worst aspect.

The game then morphs into a building game briefly, but again there's no real reward for building roads, unless you're one of those Facebook types that live for likes. Building structures that can be used by other players, also makes the game easier for everyone, which is silly. So it becomes a little MMO with weakly interacting players for a while. But this feels mostly unrewarding too and often annoying with all the signs and structures dotted EVERYWHERE! It destroys the sense of being remote that the game starts with.

BTs can all be circumvented or killed with exactly the same tactics with a couple of exceptions. They are certainly interesting and spooky though, they add a real sense of dread.

The sudden morphing into a FPS game is done well, but too brief and it doesn't fit super well with the backpack mechanics of the game. It's stunning scenery, but the FPS game sections are repetitive.

The cut scenes are interesting, but yes they are WAY too long at times.

The game really suffers from an identity crisis, it's a jack of all trades and a master of none. These also seems to be true of the character Sam, his personality seems entirely inconsistent. He goes from being peaceful, lovable, and whimsical, to gruff, belligerent, and antisocial - with no seeming cause for his personality changes. The message the game is trying to portray seems equally inconstant, just for the sake of it.

The design, theme, and setting is amazing, and at moments it really shines. But overall it's tripping over itself trying to be everything and trying way too hard to be clever.

The UI is extremely cluttered too.

Overall, definitely worth a play, a thinking persons game that just fails to deliver on it's promises. I think it would have been better focusing more an the isolation, desolation, mystery, travel and adventure aspect, mixed in with the deliveries.

- you get deliveries from one place, you take them to another. Sometimes with a vehicle, sometimes on foot. Terrain varies from rocky plains to mountains. Flat, hilly, treacherous.
- Sometimes bad people are on the way.
- Sometimes scary ghosts are on the way.
- You are given the means to deal with these.
- While you make your deliveries, you reconnect people living in the boonies, and disconnected bases. You also build helpful infrastructure. Sometimes the infrastructure that other people have built in their games will show up in yours.
- You do this for many hours, play through a 5 hour end game, then watch credits twice.
- It's Kojima crazy for the duration.

The whole atmosphere in the game, from its narrative to the way how it expresses the story, how it let you feel  through your character, how you accept an hour long traversing the mountains, which is not making you bored but rather curious what new horizons you will see IS ABSOLUTELY STUNNING. From this perspective, this game is unbelievably original and its own kind of experience. This experience was finally the reason to finish the game.

---

The negatives.
AMERICA FIRST. Why the he11 the whole story is about absurd American exceptionalism? Time to time the characters talk about the world but the whole story is that the ""world"" you have to save is actually America. It's boring and it's what is exactly not cool on America. 

YOU ARE A HERO. All the dialogues you have after all deliveries need to ensure you that you are absolutetly the best porter on this world. The NPCs are surprised in what condition you have delivered the cargo. Why? Do we really need to be ensured that we are the best all the time? It's annoying.

GUI. The game interface and its animations is so annoying that I had to close my eyes time to time. I had to go through unbelievable senseless statistics that have nothing to do with RPG-kind of a game. You need to see all the shining glowing graphics and texts with final statistics after delivery that have little sense for your progress through the game. In the end, everytime you take an order you cannot make the decision what equipment you want to take with your. E.g. you can't recycle in this moment, so you must finish this part of preparations and go back to the terminal. This is something every player must experienced but such a bug was kept in the game not by mistake but by game design.

Graphics, Story, Gameplay loops.    All bloody fun.  It's a Kojima game.  The first areas and early game are a slog,  if only to emphasize just how important the help from your fellow porters can be.  Once an area is on the network, your fellow porters have placed items to help you.   (I myself created a transportation system that lets you get anywhere on the mountain in less than two minutes)

YOU WILL PROBABLY NOT ENJOY THIS GAME IF YOU FOCUS ONLY ON OR PRIORITIZE STORY MISSIONS.

Build roads as you go,  in fact build roads before you move forward.  Use any city or distro center as a base to unlock the stuff in the area before moving on.     That means unlock any prepper shelters and max them.  The game generally gives you great upgrade item's that make life easier for the upcoming part of the game.   

Don't move on in the story til you've five starred every shelter in the area you're in. 

 The upgrades are valuable.

Build.  Make life easier. Come back, repair structures that still help, even other player's stuff.     Leaving behind a solid infrastructure to come back to means when you do return to an area, it's not a slog, and your fellow powers will like your stuff, which gives you stamina bumps when they tally it.  

BTW UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES PLAY THIS GAME OFFLINE.

You need the stuff your fellow porters build.    This is emphasized by the chiral bandwidth that limits your own building.   I found it helped to delete structures people weren't using and focus on a couple types.   For instance I relied on my other porters to build shelters.

I can't emphasize enough, build roads.   Roads make your life easier.

Make it a point to seek out those preppers tho.  Their items drive you forward,  and the extra chiral bandwidth and supply store is nice.     

Oh one last thing.... don't be afraid to pull materials you need from shelters and centers.... that's what they're there for.  Load that dang truck up.     

ANY MISSION MARKED MATERIALS WILL GIVE YOUR VARIOUS PREPPERS/CENTERS FREE MATERIALS OF THAT KIND.

So (Spoiler for a feature but it's a minor non-story spoiler) send your autodeliver bots to deliver materials when you can and then when you end up going back to an area or needing supplies, your preppers and centers are stocked.

Every shelter/prepper place you unlock passively generates chiralium crystals, so snag em when you can.

You play as Sam Bridges (Norman Reedus) and go on an journey with BB in an effort to reconnect America.
This definitely isn't a game for everyone but if you want a chill yet engaging game it may be worth checking out, its definitely very high budget (as expected from a Hideo Kojima game).

The Gameplay:
Sam's main mechanic is his backpack which is used to store the majority of cargo when travelling, at the start this is what you'll be using the most until you unlock vehicles and carriers.
The enemies in the game that you will encounter are MULE's/Terrorists and BT's.
The mules attempt to steal your cargo if you enter their territory and the BT's are these ghost type creatures that rely on hearing so you need to slow and careful through BT territory

The Soundtrack:
Absolutely amazing put simply. Kojima's choice of both licensed and original music is beautiful and carefully placed in key moments throughout the game.

As a bonus exclusive to PC there's an added difficulty and a collaboration with Half-Life and Portal which by completing quests you can unlock unique accessories for Sam.

The game also offers a lot of replayability through the amount of deliveries you can accept and each facility has a relationship meter to fill up to unlock new items and such which increases by deliveries made.",1597558142,1597558142,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,401,20,3639,0,3639,1596822291,,
95,DEATH STRANDING,74384040,english,"Death Stranding has a completely unique story, beautiful scenery and graphics, and compelling world-building. But true to form, Kojima prefers to ""tell"" instead of ""show."" It's always been a flaw of his storytelling, where he explains to you how you should feel about things instead of letting you feel out and figure out the world around you on your own. He gives you the illusion of a sandbox, but it's very much his sandbox. The result is, if you actually want an open world, you come away feeling railroaded; and if you want pure story, you come away feeling overwhelmed and talked at. The game gets bogged down by constant interruptions, making me cringe every time I hear the crackling ringtone and a certain someone going, ""Sam, you might have noticed that..."" And after a while, the game starts to feel incredibly hamfisted in how it decides to force-feed you its narrative and insist that you care.

My other criticism is that the terror and threat that the story establishes early on quickly disappears. The game becomes very easy, very quickly. It's really no big deal to tromp into bad-guy territory, knock everyone out with a Bola Gun, and steal a truck. At that point, the primary threat is almost completely negated because you can simply drive through it fast enough. I hope this continues to become more difficult - and I have some indication that it might - but it also feels like I'm nearing the end of the game. 

Anyway - great idea, unique worldbuilding, but underwhelming story and action.

Last thought - ""walking simulator"" is a tired criticism. I actually love how challenging it is to roam across the landscape and how much strategy is involved in just staying upright.

This is a Goddamn work of art.""

That is what I said on release, less than an hour into the game. This is still what I say 52 hours later.

I guess to be a ""review"" I should give you more info, but I'm not going to go into the story at all.

What everyone says about it (Walking simulator, errand boy simulator, etc.) is pretty much true. The ""gameplay"" isn't really there. It's seeing what others build, what you build alongside them. Watching the world change around you as you play. It's not ""fun"" like ""action"" games (First person shooters, ARPG's) because you don't DO anything. You don't fight people for money or better gear. You don't fight in armies or kill people by the score. You just have a job, and you do your job.

The missions you take on are literally just ""Take this pile of cargo a couple kilometers down to that place with so-and-so and see if they want to ally with us or something. Oh, and try not to break it.""

Then ""These guys left some pretty cool tech that will build roads for you. Help out and supply the materials if you can."" 

That's the gist of the ""gameplay."" If it doesn't sound fun to you, it's because it's NOT ""fun."" It's a means of continuing the story, of exploring the world, and it just feels ""satisfying"" to complete these missions. It's experiencing the feeling of utter terror the first few times you encounter the primary enemy of the game turn to absolutely demolishing them (if you come prepared!). The elation and absolute satisfaction when, after the hopelessness you feel when you turn around and see a truck load of your valuable cargo stolen while you were climbing down a hill to retrieve another piece getting further and further away, you chase it down on foot to the base it was taken to and manage to get everything back before delivering it all to your destination successfully.

It's seeing a destination you have never been to in the distance and feeling hopeless about trying to get there. As you get closer, you see ways others have made it and then it's time to figure out the best path to take, or perhaps forge your own way: ""I've got a vehicle, but would it be smarter to go on foot? Would it be easier to go around a little further to make it up that hill? Would a few ladders placed here and there be worth it or should I just grit my teeth and trudge up this hill?""

It's cliched, but I have to agree with many others: It's not a game, it's an experience, and it's frankly not for everyone. No hard feelings to any who hate it and don't see the point. It's a beautiful experience regardless.",1594793941,1597539229,TRUE,1,0,0.521739125,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,228,16,4391,0,30,1600408423,,

17,DEATH STRANDING,74360523,english,"Quick: I really wanted to finish the game before writing this review, but I just can't force myself to play it any longer. The game is very unique and I understand why many would recommend it. But ultimately it is painfully boring/redundant. 

Details: At its core, the game is a delivery sim. The unique spin is that you are delivering goods in a post-apocalyptic future across untamed and often ""haunted"" environments (trade invisible poltergeists for undead). You can also craft structures as you travel to help with return trips. You start with basics like ropes and ladders and the tech improves as the game progresses.

There are plenty of games that offer similar empire building experiences, but what makes this one unique is that it has massive-multiplayer elements quietly included. By default, the game will show you the structures and signs other recent players have created dotting the landscape. Conversely, the things you do will be shared with a small group of randomly selected players who have unlocked the same tech as yourself. You don't actually see the other players, but you share a common infrastructure.

Some positives: 

- The graphics are amazing. The universe lends itself to some physics defying visuals and vistas that are hands down the best part of the game. I am particularly impressed by the games water effects. Rain, rivers, streams, beaches, etc... Extremely well done.

- The story is Okay. Probably even ""good"" by video game standards.  Fortunately, the voice acting is great. It turns what would be an unremarkable story into a memorable experience. Props to all the actors and actresses involved in the making of the game. 

- The game poses some interesting philosophical questions, at least for those who believe in an afterlife. 

For some, the positives above are worth playing the game. And I would agree if the game were $20 or less. But not at the $60 price point. At that price point, I expect choices that matter, multiple endings, traveling companions, romance opportunities, mini-games, inventory management, good enemy AI... A day/night cycle. For $60 you are better off playing something like The Outer Worlds.

Negatives. 

- The game is nothing like the trailers make it out to be. Does the game have a story in the background? Sure. Go find a youtube video and watch it. But as a game, 99% of the time is taking and delivering items. Transporting goods from point A to point B by yourself. The pickup and drop off sequence is exactly the same everywhere you go. The scenery may be great, but you spend most the time staring at the ground/road, trying not to fall or keep your vehicle on the power strip. 50 hours staring at a road. Might as well be playing American Truck Simulator.

- I like games that make me feel like I am surrounded by or traveling with people, especially during a pandemic. This game actually managed to make me feel more alone than I actually am. It is the most empty game I have ever played. There are no animals, no birds. not even the sound of insects. Just the sound of wind and rain. The handful of NPC interactions are mostly in cut-scenes. When the cut-scene ends, you are back to standing in the world by yourself again. Even your primary enemy, the poltergeists, are (wait for it)... invisible.

- Enemy AI is non existent. I mean, at least zombies and undead have to still walk towards you. These enemies just float in the air. They are glorified land-mines. And the bosses are not challenging. They walk slowly towards you, giving you plenty of time to ready your grenade and throw it at them. They probably had to water combat down for console users, but as a result, combat is a joke on PC. 

- If I had known the game had MMO elements, I wouldn't have bought it. While some will claim you can turn it off, the reality is there are projects in the game like roads that are too big to do on your own.  When you are 60 hours in, ask yourself... are you still playing because you like the game... or are you simply building things in hopes of getting some likes from other random people you don't know and will never meet. It feels like this game uses the online component as a crutch to keep it interesting, but without that component, it is a beautiful but ultimately boring experience.

- While new tech is one of the few things to look forward to in this game, often times it also negates any infrastructure work you did. This game likes to slap completionists in the face repeatedly. IE: When bikes and trucks come along, it basically negates all that time you spent placing ladders and ropes. Then later, rail lines come along, letting you fly through the air between cities. This negates all the time you spent building roads and bridges. Word of advice for those who are going to buy it anyway: Don't get caught up building infrastructure for other people because it all quickly becomes obsolete. Only build what you personally want/need, not what you think others might need.

- Sam has a baby in a bottle (called a BB) that he travels with. BB is hooked up some to some tech that allows Sam to ""see"" ghosts. The relationship between Sam and BB is cute, but the baby starts crying when Sam falls or gets in deep water. I don't know if you have ever tried to play video games with a kid crying in the room, but this really irritates me to no end. If you deal with babies crying in real life, be it your younger brother/sister, at work or with your own children, this may make the game unplayable for you.  

- There is no day/night cycle and the sky is always cloudy. This may seem minor, but a $60 open world game released in 2020 that has no day/night cycle? Really? 

- The game doesn't PAY you for deliveries. You get ""likes"" and reputation increases for doing a good job, but you can't buy things with likes. I prefer games that offer a store model. You know... where you get paid and you can see items  that you can't initially afford. Gives you motivation to make money. As is, this game really lacks motivation both for Sam's character's perspective and for you as the player. 

- Sam supposedly knows his own history and thus why he is so withdrawn and reclusive. Yet you have to play the game to learn about his past. And sometimes his own reactions are like he doesn't know what is going on. ""What... you mean I am a middle aged Man? I had no idea!"". I wish the game had officially given him amnesia at the beginning so that he was discovering the world and his own backstory along with the player.

Kojima, you've done it again! Somebody tell me he isn't a prophet. God bless this man.

tl;dr Death Stranding is a high quality story and universe placed within a tech demo for literally every type of game that Kojima is known to make from tactical espionage to horror. All of these elements and more are put to the limits thanks to the creative vision of Kojima. I can't wait to see upcoming titles using this as a jumping point.
-----------------------------------------------

This game is very similar to MGSV: Ground Zeroes in that it's more of a tech demo than it is a game. When I classify it as a tech demo it no way means it's any less of a game but rather they are trying to innovate new gameplay mechanics more than rehashing older mechanics to create a ""safe"" game for people to enjoy. This new system has a plethora of calculations that needed to be inputted to determine the physics of weight distribution, character models interactions with the environment and structures, open-world boss fights (and the effects that come with that), and last but not least optimizing an online experience without harassing the player with online connectivity and the ability to backtrack progress made in an online game (this is probably the most consumer friendly online mechanics that people are undervaluing.)

Kojima was bold to call this a strand-style game which people are still debating on what that means. My theory is that he is describing an indirect interaction online gaming experience. Similar to Dark Souls messaging system, Kojima takes a step further and makes it even more interactive without having the player directly be there (i.e. each player's gameplay is a ""strand"" that can be ""knotted"" into other ""strands"" with the moral of this system being that advancement is amplified through cooperation.) It must not be forgotten the nuance required in programming an indirect online experience but also allow players to backtrack on save progression. Something no other strand-type game has done before.

The fact that Kojima was able to pull off all these mechanics near perfectly is deserving of the $60 but the story and graphical quality cement it's place as an iconic game. After seeing Death Stranding I am so excited to see how these mechanics will work in Kojima's next tactical espionage game. I can already imagine a loadout screen similar to Phantom Pain and Death Stranding where each gear can be placed in a certain area to minimize noise, visibility, and speed. Mechanics like this would make the skill system that Phantom Pain offers for some their mercenary soldiers a more meta/viable option. 

To summarize: Kojima is a prophetic genius, this game is the foundation we'll see in future games for years to come, and finally Konami is a despicable company that endorses profiting off gambling as well as scummy practices such as preventing Kojima to get health insurance for his employees. #Fuc-Konami (had to add the ""-"" to make it uncensored because I hate Konami that much.)",1594764383,1597460129,TRUE,8,0,0.601328909,5,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,911,25,11080,0,88,1598933940,,

Overall this is a unique and worthy game that I'm glad exists.

After finishing the main story, and still wanting to play, I can easily say this is one of my Games of the Year! Not only was the ending confusing as hell (helps to record, and watch again), the very end almost had me in tears. AND IM A MAN, DAMNIT.

Hideo Kojima has proven with this game that he is still one of the best (and one of my favorite) writers for a game's story, and fleshing it out by producing a game like this.

My only gripe? I wish you could edit certain sounds in the game to make them quieter (Accelerating on a bike, wandering into a Timefall Storm, etc) as the noise can get downright repetitive.

Even the walking part is exceptional. Jaw-dropping landscapes, atmosphere and wonderful moments of music bring life and hope to an otherwise desolate existence. I can't tell you how good it feels to endure the journeys this game takes you on and then make it out the other side. 

This game is all about reaching out and building connections, even though you don't want to; even though it can hurt. 
But those connections make everyone stronger. Players have such a special impact on each other without ever being able to see or know the other. A bridge built here, a ladder there, all small moments of hope that kept me going, made me feel so grateful and far less alone.

In this very unique game, he blends all of his doubts, fears, thoughts and hopes in order to provide us a story as breathtaking as heart taking.

You will sit through complex dialogue and long exposition dumps in the form of cutscenes.

On the gameplay level, this is a slow paced walking/delivery simulator that takes you through harsh terrain while carrying cargo. You have to find the best possible ways to make your way. And yes, there are enemies, and yes you can shoot them and they can shoot you back, but that's just a secondary gameplay mechanic. 

There is no multiplayer / singleplayer division, but I'm not gonna spoil that amazingly interesting side of the game. Just let me tell you that you won't find someone else on the game, but you will never feel alone.

60,DEATH STRANDING,74313491,english,"To start, the performance was phenomenal and it's probably the first time I've every loaded up a AAA game and didn't have to spend a bunch of time tweaking settings to get a stable framerate. I only have a 1080p display and a GTX1070, so I wasn't able to take advantage of the DLSS 2.0, but I was still able to keep framerates at my monitor's max refresh rate of 75Hz for most of the game, with only occasional dips below 60fps that weren't particularly troublesome due to the excellent frame timing. My only complaint would be that they probably could have pushed the visuals a bit further to take advantage of higher-end hardware.

The gameplay was incredibly unique and I enjoyed it thoroughly. I wish more games would take risks like this to create something new, even if some people won't enjoy it. It wasn't particularly difficult on the normal setting but all the systems felt like they created meaningful and enjoyable challenges to overcome without becoming tedious or punishing you greatly for being a little lazy. I really enjoyed how the game introduced new challenges and let you feel the problems it creates for your traversal, then provides you with new equipment to allow you to overcome some of that difficulty, but then later there may be an order that takes away the ability to use those tools so that you have to find new ways to overcome that obstacle. This kept the game fresh for the nearly 60 hours I played it and it never felt like any particular obstacle or system (like snowy terrain, boot degradation, BTs, stamina, balance, etc.) became trivial but they also didn't become tedious. This is actually really hard to do in a game. I've recently played games like RDR2 and Kingdom Come: Deliverance, which were both great, but in they didn't strike this balance of not-trivial but not-tedious that Death Stranding did. In RDR2 I felt like many of the systems and mechanics they introduced were more there for role-playing purposes and you could mostly ignore eating, sleeping, wearing weather-appropriate clothes, etc. while in Kingdom Come: Deliverance the survival mechanics are very important in the beginning but you can get perks that make them mostly trivial by the middle of the game.

As for the story, I won't say much other than it had probably the best acted and delivered cutscenes of any game I've played and the story and lore were intriguing enough to provide motivation to progress. It gets weird and at some points I thought it was trying a little too hard, but overall I wasn't disappointed.",1597439090,1597439090,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,38,7,3221,0,3220,1599843179,,
61,DEATH STRANDING,74312198,english,"Disclaimer: At the time of writing this, I have not completed the game.
Tl;dr: This is not a game for everyone. It is however something that is worth the time if you take to it. It definitely is worth full price.

Death Stranding is an experience. There's *much* more to it than ""Norman Reedus and the Funky Fetus"" or ""haha postman go stippy step""

On the surface, yes. It's about delivering things to people across the worst possible landscape for travel on foot, even worse for vehicles. It's a slog. However the *point* of the game is to make connections. Whether that be via connecting the various waystations and other facilities, or the more subtle way of helping other players by building useful infrastructure or giving your materials to someone else's construction. 

Now you might say, ""wait this game has player interaction?""
It does. However, not directly. When you connect a facility to the rest, the surrounding area also becomes connected to the network. This allows you to see the buildings that other players have placed for you to use and upgrade. You can interact with these structures by ""liking"" them, which increases the builder's stats as well as letting them know that their work is appreciated. The game gets easier (to an extent) the more you try to help your fellow player moreso than yourself. The more you like other players' efforts, the stronger the connections you have, which means you get more structures to use as you see fit.
Something else that I find pleasantly intriguing about this system of interaction is that there are no negative ways to communicate. If you don't like the place someone has put something, you can dismantle it without consequence, however you will not gain anything from it besides the space it took up.

On a completely subjective note: The environment is stunning. I find myself taking ""time off"" in-game just to explore. It's legitimately relaxing to just go for a walk.",1597436991,1597436991,TRUE,1,0,0.510667145,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,184,3,7667,392,3617,1601796393,,

I'm after prologue and PC port is excelent. I have i5 6600K 4,5Ghz and 1070GTX and games runs very good (50-70 fps). It says mostly above 60fps. All setting maxed out and 1440p resolution.

69,DEATH STRANDING,73143812,english,"From my experience, this is a nice game to play alone. Even though I'm only 13 hours in, I can tell I'll be putting much more time into this game. While you're traversing beautiful landscapes, you take into account what gear you should bring with you depending on the route: one that you get to set out on your own. Though, your route might be susceptible to change in either good ways, such as coming across other structures built by players in their worlds into yours (which you can do yourself to help others along their travels); or in bad ways, such as timefall suddenly raining down, slowly deteriorating your containers and/or equipment and potentially bringing enemies known as BTs. With a mix of basic stealth and combat mechanics, enemies are certainly a threat to acknowledge, and whether or not you've come prepared to face them, they provide a decent challenge along with the environment for a relaxing game such as this. I will say that some of the lore was confusing at first, but once I stopped overthinking about it, I became more focused on the plot given to me. The themes on hope and the importance of reconnecting people stand out, using the setting on what seems to be on the surface: a desolate world but with thousands of people separated, most staying within shelters underground, in what used to be the United States. And I'm glad to have the opportunity to dive into this world every time I launch it. I almost thought I'd miss another quality game with exclusivity on the ps4, but fortunately it's here on PC on Steam. And it runs amazing! While I do have a pretty good rig, I wasn't expecting it to look AND run this good at a consistent frame rate no matter how intense my encounters in-game got. DLSS 2.0 must be doing a lot behind the scenes, but this game just feels and looks amazing. If you have the chance to try the game, give it a shot. It's definitely worth checking out, but be aware that it can be time consuming in a good way, depending on whether or not that's your thing. For me, the game feels alive enough with it's player structures, messages, and lost cargo and secluded enough with my own journey in the world to feel like I'm making a difference as a lone porter, taking cargo condition, quantity, and time to deliver to account for. Thanks, Kojima Productions.
UPDATE: I just finished the game, and the story did get a little interesting until it tried doing its plot twists. I don't have a clue what's going on, and I know if I try to understand it, it's pointless because it's a mess. It's sort of like MGS where you have to wonder why there's so many versions of Snake and the supernatural behind that story, and Kingdom Hearts where it's best to just enjoy the game rather than understand what the hell's going on and why. That's what I did in Death Stranding: I enjoyed the gameplay for a little while, but as soon as I wanted to finish the story I was disappointed. I still recommend it for how laid back and enticing the gameplay was for letting me explore a vast, beautiful open world and for putting me on a journey. But, I've learned that trying to understand the details of games like this isn't worth it and that it'll only bring more questions, ones that aren't thought provoking but rather questions that are often answered with, ""Because that's the way it is.""

I would 10/10 buy, great game needs a second. 

Play at 1440p at 66fps for great results.




****EARLIER****  I would except it is 100$ and I have found to major issues with gameplay that will be obvious to anyone who gets invested in this game.

That is.

Now I play it at 75fps and still the jitters of in game rendering persist. Along with all the other problems. Fix this, look to other similar games for how this should be. 

So I have found two issues with the game In the game at 60fps 1080p. 

1. [Is present with dlss and without] 
- That is that when panning the objects being rendered within the game will at some point in the acceleration curve of the panning movement jump. That is they move there position In space back or forward (it is hard to discern) from where they should be. I.e. the mountains In the background when panning will occasionally seem to jump. Frame pacing and frame rate are perfect, this is consistent across a range of variable changes such as camera speed and acceleration as well as fps vs refresh rate with output at 60 fps.

2. [DLSS problem] 
When panning you can see on the outside of the screen a number of borders manifest. That is it looks like you are seeing a frame in a frame in a frame in a frame. The spacing varies with speed of camera panning. Possibly the actuation of this also correlates with the jump found in in game rendered objects described above.

Although marketing seems have been wrong.

In it's heart it is a logistics simulator - You start as a postman in nowhere and from that point it goes on and on with more game mechanics to play and more experiences. New features are introduced gradually which helps a lot in learning the game. It is not overwhelming as You start and it does not become boring as You continue. As You progress You get more and more toys to play with, which is amazing design concept. 

For example - as You walk, You notice You are leaving paths around You.

Then You notice there are new buildings left by other players but they do not appear instantly - it seems that building mechanic is tied to the mission system so that You get stuff from other players who are around the same point in the game as You are. Later in the game You get vehicles to drive, roads and bridges to build, etc.

I call it simulator because the detail that goes in to the simulation is real and huge. To the point that You have to keep spare pair of boots to change if something goes wrong. Also pathways that You keep making help You navigate a lot.

Game seems to me been wrongly marketed as a ""horror walking simulator"" which does not give the game full credit for what it is.

Sure there are few things that might get You scared when You meet them at first but after that - it's just an another game mechanic with a bit of drama added.

The Good - 
Unique story.  
Very MGS style character development, may seem unusual to people not used to kojima games.  
Gameplay loop is mostly optional however for those with efficiency will be rewarded and those who are risk takers can also be rewarded.
Has a very cool online mode in regards to construction projects. 
The Bad -
Some very key lore is sometimes easily missed.  The story can do without it, however it's strange they where not made more obvious.  I guess though that is the reward for finding them.
You don't get the headcrab hat on steam edition until like chapter 8, that sucked.  I wanted headcrab for most of the early cutscenes.  Almost refunded because of that but then i realized that was petty.  

Other than that, it's in my top 10.  Very memorable game for me, i enjoy most of Kojimas work and this is one of his best works so far.

9,DEATH STRANDING,74257678,english,"One of the most brilliant games to come out in recent times. So I have always been a huge fan of Hideo Kojima. I have played almost all of the metal gear solid games. So when I got to know about this game, I was disappointed to say the least. A walking simulator is what it was being called when we got to know more about this game. I thought the same. 'How can this game be fun? How can anyone enjoy this? Don't people remember the first assassin's creed game?'. 

I couldn't have been more wrong. 

This game is a masterpiece. Not a perfect game. But definitely a masterpiece. 

Yes. you have to deliver goods from one point to another point in this game. But this is a very shallow way to look at this game. In fact, that is the best part of this game. I can't tell you how happy I was the first time when I found a couple of ladders and ropes placed by other players just to make my travel easy. See the thing is, this isnt just about reaching point B from point A. Much of the fun comes from what happens in between. You have total freedom upon the path you want to choose. Along with that, come a lot of challenges in the game. The terrain, for example, is a key element here. Unlike other games, just because you are pressing a button, doesnt mean that the dude will oblige. a lot depends on the weight that he is carrying, the kind of terrain, the speed at which you were running. One wrong step on the danger spots will make you fall. Along with that, all of your luggage. The rain plays a key role in this game. Anything that it touches, will age in a short span of time. So your luggage is bound to get damaged if you spend a lot of time out in the rain. Along with that you have to deal with the BTs (ghost like figures which can be a pain in the ass but their encounters are fun and intense) and humans who are bad. have forgotten what they are called. 


Slowly as you progress in the game, you are given tools which make the journey a little bit easy. You can build roads, bridges etc. You can place ladders and ropes. You can also place markers. The best part is that you get to use items of other players as well. For example, in the first mission, you are supposed to carry a body to a place. While on my journey, while managing the weight of the body with the two mouse buttons, i came across a mountain. I couldn't have scaled up the mountain if i wouldn't have found a couple of ladders and a rope placed by other players. I can't tell you how satisfied i was when i found that. Once I finally got to the place, I was feeling tired. Not in a bad way. but for the character. Because I was there with him throughout his journey. I could feel the weight of sam. 

See, the fun in this game are those little intense moments. I consider this as a masterpiece because, unlike other games, this game isn't trying to feed you these moments after every 5 seconds. This game provides them at the perfect times. And those moments make your journey special. That moment when you scale down a cliff with the help of a rope placed by someone else. That moment when you successfully avoid the BT zone when you notice a warning placed by someone else. That moment when place the ladder at the perfect place for yourself, and once you are across the river, you leave it. So that others can use it. That perfect moment when you find your private room after a long journey with tons of stuff on your back. That perfect moment when you sneak up behind an enemy and strangle him with your rope. That perfect moment when you see your character stumbling down and watch his luggage fall on the ground, one by one. 

In this game, you just don't travel from point A to point B. You have to earn it.

Another beauty about this game is just the chilled nature of this game. Trust me, you will look forward to your next journey. You will want to step out and carve your own way towards your next destination. This game is very therapeutic. You feel the wind. You feel the rain. You feel SAM's pain as he walks towards his destination. You feel his happiness when he finds a ladder or a rope. 

Long story short, games like this one come rarely. This is a bold, and i might add, a very successful attempt at breaking the format of a video game. Of what we perceive video games to be. This one isn't playing by the rules. 

This game isn't perfect though. The clunky UI is there like a thorn which you have to touch every time you play this game. I wish someone at the company would have realised that no one wants to read all of this over and over and over again. 

I am just 7 hours in at the moment so I can't really say a lot about the story. But it is a hit and miss when it comes to characters. Some fall flat. Some (sam included), are interesting. The scenario is just what one can imagine if his name is Hideo Kojima. 

But, according to me, this shouldn't distract you from the true beauty of this game. A game, that perhaps, that will stand the test of time. A true next gen game that is not playing by the rules. 

If you get this game, thinking of it as just another third person shooter where you kill any moving object, you will be disappointed. If you buy this game with an open mind, you will fall in love with it. 

You feel this game.  I highly recommend this game to anyone who is ready to take that chance.

Construction is a cool mechanic that helps you and your creations will appear in other players worlds. You can choose to spend allot of time building roads. across america.

      1. Great Story:  At first you may not understand but in the end you will.
      2. Amazing Graphics: Everything from people to environment are so well done and optimized.
      3. Game Play: Played on Very Hard Mode and the game through everything at me.
      4. Sound: The music tracks and sounds are amazing.
Cons:
      1. Vehicles: I don't know if it was just mouse and keyboard but this was not the best. Turning was like driving a semi-truck on any vehicle. Grip was bad too trying to move sideways on a slop. Rocks, sometimes even the smallest one, was like a brick wall when you hit it.
      2. Character movement: Like above I didn't play with joystick but this got me in trouble most of the time. Trying to upgrade something on a cliff or slop having to face it made me face right off the cliff; falling and all my cargo rolling down. Same with some combat or throwing cargo I just couldn't get myself to face the way I needed too. 

Summary: 
       I got 200+ in a 60$ game so it has payed for itself. Even though I beat the game there is more to do. Replay value is high even though I know how everything ends. I think this is a great game and you would be missing out on a great story if you did pick it up and play it at least once through. Helping and bringing people together is what this game is about.

Aside from city building simulators, combat has been the main course at the restaurant of gaming for 30 years now.

The amount of avenues one could  approach Metal Gear Solid V missions is a trait that carries onward with Death Stranding. I never felt limited as a player to approach a mission the way I wanted to approach it. 

And my god- the rewarding way terrain navigation was handled in game. This game is a 10/10 for the sole reason the team managed to create a system in which the player ENJOYS navigating the terrain- a series of mini puzzles. And then gives the tools to make those paths easier on the repeat- and to other players.

EDIT: Real review

* It says walking simulator, but most of my time was spent in a bike/truck/zip lines. Infact you only need to walk once to get to your next destination, then you can setup infrastructure like roads, bridges and zip lines to make the trip a 10-15 second commute. 
* Combat is not just there but expected. You have to raid MULE camps (bandit camps) to get resources to build infrastructure. Chiral Crystals are scarce unless you fight BT bosses then you get like 1k-2k in one shot.
* The story starts slow and then dumps everything in the last few hours. Almost as if Kojima was running out of time/budget and cramped the last parts in. Some cut scenes are just cringey. 
* The actual walking simulator part is varied enough to not get repetitive, there are enough new unlocks and toys to play with to keep things fresh. 
* Optional deliveries is how you upgrade your weapons and armour. 
* Online play is strongly recommended as the infrastructure of other players randomly show up in your game. Which helps a lot.
* Inventory management during boss fights are annoying. You have to go into menu to throw away empty guns/magazines, otherwise it weighs you down.
* One of the best looking games out there. Great optimisation.

However you run into a lot of new challenges that require you to mix up your approach until you eventually find a new tech, which changes the game to be all about logistics and easy supply chains, mixing in a bit of the previous stuff you learned. Also new challenges.

Belive me, it has a very have atmosphere, and wtih those movie type flawless cut scenes that are integrated into the game, man... thats something - and interactive movie, or mini series. 
The cast, the story, the music, it got me already in the prolouge, and that scene when walking down on the hill to reach Port Knot City with Low Roar music in the backround, it is so well directed that not so many games have the same, just only a few, and they are among the all time besties. 
The story still keeps me wondering after my first playtrough, there is a lot into it, with so many life reference about our everydays. I like, that the writeres explored the full potential of this story, but still left some open space to make my own thougts about it. 
Only thing that is not so well played in the story side is that some times some specific key moments are so implentary and repeating, that makes me feel like I am a 5 year old child that needs explanation from everything even if it straight before my eyes.
The gameplay is not ordinary, it has the challanege like any other games but with other mechanics. Death Stranding is really about to be a post man and make deliveries, but how you make it is just only up to you. The game gives you a well edited map, region, with several enviroment hazards and other terrain challenges that makes you wonder how to get trough. For me tha map for the first time felt like empty or boring, but thats not the thing, its a very clever design that gives you the oppourtunity to build delivery routes with items gained later in the game. The route building and searching for the best route is some kind of '90 or early 2000's game thing, its the same when in your child you played the game and tried to pass trough the low poly levels jumping cliff by cliff. With that deliveries almost made me a MULE just like they mentioned in the game, its addictive, and well rewarding, but still not overwhelming.

57,DEATH STRANDING,74205779,english,"[h1]Death Stranding PC review[/h1]

I've played the PC port of Death Stranding for about 70 hours as of writing, and have played for over 150 hours on PlayStation 4. I can say with honesty that Death Stranding is one of my favorite games of all time. I've been a subscriber to Kojima-san's brand of storytelling since Metal Gear Solid on the original PlayStation all those years ago, so I thought I had some idea of what I was getting myself into...

I had [u][b]no idea[/b][/u] what was coming when I first played Death Stranding.

Between Kojima-san's storytelling and vision, and Shinkawa-san's environmental design, the world immediately captured my attention with its futuristic yet plausible design. I've always enjoyed Shinkawa-san's mechanical designs since I first played the Metal Gear Solid and Zone of the Enders games. If you enjoyed the open world experimentation of MGSV and want to play a game where Kojima-san was able to fully realize his vision, check this game out. It's various difficulty levels allow access by nearly any player, from super easy to incredibly punishing. It has something for everyone.

Death Stranding is an amazing experience, and has a story that both excited me and caused me to cry. This game has caused me to feel things no other video game has. It gives you a true sense of satisfaction and accomplishment, and I never felt bored once in all my playtime. It is one of those ""once in a generation"" types of video games that truly bridges the gap between a video game and a movie, and in my opinion is a work of art. 

You feel the emotions right alongside the characters, and you experience their trials and tribulations in ways that few other games have accomplished. At the end of one of the hardest deliveries in the game, the evaluation screen began to scroll and I realized I had traveled over 84 kilometers on a single delivery. I let out a astounded gasp and thought: [i]""Did I actually just walk 84 kilometers for a mission in a video game?"" [/i]I got an achievement for that one, and I'll always be proud of it. This game has a way of dragging you in, it's nothing for you to think [i]""Ah, I'll sit down and play a bit...""[/i] and next thing you know it's 3 a.m. and you're delivering a mountain-top pizza...

The PC port is nothing short of well executed. There were some hiccups at first that have all been patched out at this point for me. I have only experienced one crash in my entire playthrough of the game, and that was determined to be my fault. (driver update) And on a 2070 Super and Ryzen 3700X system while utilizing DLSS 2.0 I have zero issues playing the game at a nearly locked 120 FPS at most times.

[b]TL;DR;[/b] If you enjoy the hauntingly beautiful worlds full of lore that Kojima-san and his team create, then I highly recommend you check this game out.

   O jogo certamente não é para todo mundo, visto que a história e o gameplay são únicos e desafiadores. A história é cativante e faz com que cada minuto faça com que o jogador mergulhe ainda mais na profundidade do universo criado pelo Kojima. Já o gameplay, no início pode parecer meio monótono e chato como um walking simulator, mas tudo vai depender de como você experiencia as coisas. Na minha experiência, o gameplay me entregou um momento único, um momento de desafios pelo terreno devastado de Death Stranding e com certeza um momento para refletir e admirar a beleza da paisagem. Uma das grandes surpresas que esse jogo me proporcionou foi com toda certeza a trilha sonora que é espetacular e sensacional! Um outro ponto que preciso comentar da gameplay é o fato do mundo ser construído em conjunto com outros jogadores. Uma ponte que um outro jogador constrói, uma escada, uma corda ou até mesmo placas de informações, facilitam e muito a experiência, uma vez que você poupa muito tempo durante suas entregas, esse elemento faz com que todos se ajudem, cumprindo a promessa do jogo que é ""reconectar os humanos no mundo caótico de Death Stranding"". Isso me parece uma mensagem clara do Kojima que reflete nossa realidade de hoje, onde estamos desconectados e que precisamos nos reconectar novamente neste mundo caótico que vivemos.
   Eu definitivamente não costumo fazer análises de jogos, mas este jogo mereceu cada palavra que escrevi. Recomendo fortemente este jogo para jogadores que gostam de uma história diferente e que gostam de uma jornada solitária.

I'm only giving this a negative review because I have been experiencing controller issues. (Not the stuttering/FPS drop which got fixed in this recent patch). My game/controller (XBOX 360, corded) will input commands I'm not doing. The game will ""press"" buttons when I'm not.

However!! 
So here are some downsides you must keep in mind if you really wish to buy this game:
There are TONS of CG in the first hour, like, 70-80% of the time. 
The story telling at the beginning is, well, unclear. It spends a lot of effort to create the feelings, but if you didn't see some Youtuber play it or read the story, you will definitely get lost. You might feel this after watch like 20 mins CG ""aha, it's a great cinematic, but what does it tell?""
You CAN'T enter menu and close the game sometimes. Yes, you can't. if you started CG, you might need to skip like 6-7 times before you could take control your character. And remember in the private room, your system menu button does not work.

93,DEATH STRANDING,74180151,english,"This game started with great promise - performed and behaved well although graphics rendering would start messing up after a few hours overall little problem Some functions cannot have keys remapped on PC (middle mouse button on my PC is allocated a system function but I have to remove that because it is used int he game and cannot be remapped) Skip scene is stupid using different buttons at different times, and clearly during porting nobody bothered to think how having a keyboard might make the interactions better that on a console. 
Story starts well although got a little tired of such a long introductory learning and set of cut scenes (including repeating everything about 4 times), but that improved later.  This in fact kept me playing, but more later...  Focus on construction, improvement and sharing with NPCs and other players was good and well executed for about the first 6 chapters, until the inconsistencies and limitations of the story started impacting. 

While the story started well, the deliveries and collections needed to progress it are entirely linear, just do what you are told one at a time and the next bit is explained, not even a pretence of having any influence - and here the problems start - it starts well but becomes drawn out and contrived,  the main twists of the story are obvious mainly from clues left throughout and the tiny cast of characters, but you have to watch your player constantly ignore the blindingly obvious make stupid choices just to give you challenges at each stage.  Equipment needs to be usable properly -  consider this if you have two locations joined by a road, a truck parked outside with 2 seats, and have to take a person from your location to the other - is there a reason you have to strap them to your back and carry them by foot - just exactly what do we get from that particularly since we had to do it before we were allowed to drive trucks (why can't you use the trucks parked outside every Bridges location).  How inconsistent is it that I can steal a truck but no drive my own company trucks for a large portion of the game.

Overall a game with lots of promise that seemed to deliver to begin with but became tiresome and annoying -  yes of course I want to leave my equipment behind (that I just put together) when I go up against may main enemy - so I can play out the fight scene how someone wants me to, instead of how I want to.

[b] Let me just get this out of the way: [/b]

Is this a walking simulator? Yes it is, but with mechanics that make the walking aspect a game in itself. You have to plan and be smart about how you traverse the world. The terrain you walk on is an enemy in itself. 

Gameplay is unique, in a sense that you deliver packages. There is a lot more to it than that, but its best to leave it to the player to find that out. 

Presentation in this game is phenomenal. Cinematography, graphics, audio design, musical score, acting, etc. Its all amazingly well done.

[h1] Personal Thoughts [/h1]

I was really skeptical with this game at first, even after enjoying all of Kojima's previous works, I heard of all the backlash it was getting. I just thought it was a game trying to be different by having a lot of ""weird"" elements to it.

[i] Boy... was I wrong... [/i]

I won't go into the story as I believe this game is best experienced with having absolutely no prior knowledge.

Mental health is something I have been struggling with the past few years. Games I would pick up and play would just lose me with the traditional game mechanics being recycled and reused. Just felt like I was playing the same Ubisoft open world clone with all these open world games. Death Stranding has been the only game in recent mind to have me come back again and again just to explore the world and ""take it all in"". It has put my mind in a positive space mentally whenever I'd pick up the game. 

This game relaxes my mind, I feel safe whenever I play this game as cheesy as it sounds. Kojima has crafted a world that has had me emotionally invested in the time I played leading up to its grand finale. I told myself I wouldn't cry, I was actively testing to see if this game would make me cry. Whenever I do that with any other sort of media, I end up not actually crying... but Kojima broke me. I still think about this game's story and characters and still come back playing so I can get my fix on it. 

Kojima... you bastard, the last game I cried to that you made was MGS3 and was wondering if you'd ever be able to get that reaction from me again.

The BTs and the timefall were gone when I got to the mountaintop, and Port Knot City was within my field of view. As I trudged down the mountain feeling exhausted, ""Asylums for the Feeling"" by Silent Poets starts playing.

[h1]Story[/h1]

Every character Sam meets in this game has a story to tell that's worth listening to. Most of them had something terrible happen to them in the past, including Sam himself, yet they still choose to keep on fighting for a greater purpose. Sam Bridges' character arc was quite interesting as much as it was relatable to some us - he's a careless man who's just ""living a lie, hung up on past regrets"", who slowly grows into someone who actually cares for people. Perhaps most of us haven't reached that point yet where we can trust other people, but it gives us hope that we someday we can, too! I'd like to highlight two things about the story that I really liked:

- About Cliff
[spoiler]
The part where Cliff and Sam met as father and son for the first and last time was a beautiful yet sad moment of revalation.
At this part of the game it was shown that the visions Sam was seeing while connecting to Lou was his own memories, and that Clifford Unger was his father all along. 
Cliff gave Sam the baby (which is also Sam), then hugged him. Cliff was then (regretfully) shot by a comrade of his who loves and respects him a lot.
[/spoiler]

- About Amelie
[spoiler]
This was the part that got me the most. Halfway through the game, when Heartman was explaining things to Sam, I thought to myself, why would someone (at that point, I was thinking of Higgs) want to get it all over with, make the sixth extinction happen when there could still be a lot of time before it happens? Was he a nihilist of some sort? Later on in the game it was revealed that Amelie/Bridget was behind it all along. She is an Extinction Entity (EE) whose task is to make sure that the next extinction will happen.

Whether the next extinction shall happen in the next 1 or 100,000 years, Amelie is stuck on her beach, waiting for it to happen. Given the fact that the next extinction is inevitable, she chooses to conjure up a story to convince everyone to speed up the extinction, so as to end her agony. I'm not saying that her means and ends are justified, but, knowing her suffering as an EE, I now understand why she did those things. But since Sam and his friends were able to ""unite"" America, she's willing to wait for another lifetime.

To quote her words, ""The extinction isn't just an ending. It's an opportunity. And if I have to pay the price for that - to be the sacrifice - then so be it.""
[/spoiler]


[h1]Lore[/h1]
Almost Everything about this game is so intriguing yet so fascinating! The beaches in the game somewhat represent what most people believe as purgatories - a final place where people go to when they die, before going to the afterlife. And BTs (Beached Things) are the spirits from the Beach who can't move on to the afterlife due to some attachment to the world of the living. Does this mean that the BBs are shamans? 

In the game, every people in America has isolated themselves inside their homes, due to the fear of endangering their lives - timefall, BTs, and the possibility of a voidout is right outside of their doorsteps. They ask for Porters like Sam to deliver things to them such as documents, food, medicine, and other stuff. It's interesting how Death Stranding is uncannily similar to what's happening now to the world due to the Coronavirus pandemic.

And most importantly, about the 
[spoiler]
Five Major Extinctions, and the Inevitable Sixth. For some of you who don't know, The Five Major Extinctions did happen, though, not caused by Extinction Entities! 
There's two conflicting ideas in the game that's explained to the character: You either just make the extinction happen 'cause it'll happen anyways, or you work your ass out to evade it in order to enjoy life more. Of course, the latter is more emphasized by the game.
I wouldn't want to shed more light on this, except for the fact that I'm being brought back to a time where I was contemplating about life and its purpose - It's all in a good way, of course!
[/spoiler]

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
On a lower level of abstraction, it is a game where you're tasked to deliver things, and in order to do so, you should manage your cargo, plan your route, and build structures/vehicles to make your journey easier. As you continue with the game, you'll unlock more stuff to use, which makes the travel fun! It'll feel so damn rewarding when you get the skeletons, the carriers, and all those things for convenience. Hell yeah this is a delivery-man/truck/walking simulator, and [b]I am having fun[/b]!

On a higher level, and as all of you may know, the game is all about connection, and thinking [i]what connection truly means[/i]. The true definition of ""connection"" is all about caring for someone else (at least that's what Kojima says in one of his interviews). This resonates strongly as you progress through the game. You're not allowed to hurt other players, all you can give to them are positive things such as giving them likes, building them a structure, or leaving them a tool to use.

Your task as a porter is to connect with people, whether with the NPCs in the game or with other players online. I suppose the deliveries were meant to be hard at first, so that when you're able to use other player's structures, you would realize how easy it is with other's help. You would go through a path, then think how it could've been easier, then you build structures for others to use. As you expand the chiral network and see other players' structures, as you build your own structures for other porters' sake, you'll find out that you'll stand stronger in solidarity with other players. 

Kojima said in an interview that he is making a game in a time where everyone's so disconnected and detached from one another in spite of all the technologies that make it easy to reach out to people. He said that through this game he hopes that everyone will [i]cherish the relationships that we so strongly had[/i] a few years/decades ago.

BUT, if you are open to the type of game Death Stranding is, it will not disappoint. This is a top 5 game of the decade for me. An utterly stunning, unique and masterful experience that made me feel emotions almost no other game has been able to. This is what gaming as high art looks like.

Besides the masterpiece of a game Death Stranding is, the PC port is one the best I have ever seen for a former console exclusive. Everything worked flawlessly and the game runs like a dream, especially if you have RTX and can take advantage of DLSS. Given the recent atrocity of a port Horizon Zero Dawn has proven to be, this shows that Kojima cares about the PC platform and the studio put a lot of time and effort into giving us the premium experience.

This is truly a Kojima game, and sadly is not for everyone.
Just like many people didn't like the Metal Gear saga because it was too long with so many cutscenes, there are many people that won't like this game... but at this point, as seen in Steam reviews, 94% of the people that bought this game, already knew what they were buying, it was a Play Station exclusive in 2019 so some of those got a lot of time to watch some videos and trailers.

I will not spoil anything about the plot here.

This game has like 10-12 hours of cutscenes which are the best I've ever seen in a videogame, using photogrammetry with awesome actors, was just an amazing idea.
The plot is just immersive, well explained and it feels complete, once you finish the game, you don't end up waiting for answers, or going to youtube searching ""Death Stranding Ending Explained"", all your questions and doubts are answered at the time they need to be answered.

If you've played Euro Truck Simulator you will find out that this game will give you the same kind of satisfaction once you deliver a cargo that is big and that was far away, lucky, the second area makes everything more interesting, pushing your limits as a single delivery man with more enemies, more BT's areas, bautiful landscapes and access to build roads.

On my first playthrough I finished the game on Very Hard difficulty. Which it didn't feel quite hard after all, once you know how to fight back or avoid the enemies and how to walk on certain terrain, everything becomes easier.

The music in this game... I don't really like it, 90% of the time I found myself lowering the volume so I can hear my own music which is kinda frustrating because you lose the immersion on the game.

This game starts to get repetitive once you reach the second area, but just like Euro Truck Simulator, there are other ways, because you will find yourself going to new parts of the map, searching for lost cargo or finding new NPCs to fill the emptiness on the map that sometimes the main plot doesn't require you to go in some areas. So after all, there is always something new to discover, as in my 100hrs in this game, I still finding new areas.

To finish this review...
I really love this game, I finished it within 80 hrs of gameplay, which 40 of them I spent building roads to make my deliveries safe and faster.
The Premium Order is just an obsession to get the highest recognition from other porters which I gotta admit, it makes the game longer.
You can give likes to other porters trough their buildings and as I can see on the scoreboard, some guys from china already have 5-6 millions likes, so once the game introduces you the scoreboard, you don't get any obsession just like the Premium Order.

This game is at its best when you play it offline, without the help of everyone else on the map. It's like Extreme difficulty, which I will play again once I finish this game at 100%

As I said before, this game is not for everyone, but since I've been waiting too long to finally play it on PC (because I never played it on PS4), I really loved it.

Is just perfect. 10/10

PD. Let's hope you don't get inside of the 40% of the players that are experiencing game crashes. If you have bad luck, the only solution at the moment that have worked is limiting your fps, if you run the game at 121-135fps limit the fps to 120, 61-110fps limit it to 60, 31-50fps limit it to 30 (It's not that bad, you are not playing a fast first person shooter game) and so on.",1594744765,1597098176,TRUE,1,0,0.508101821,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,188,116,8109,0,7086,1599683273,,

2,DEATH STRANDING,74085330,english,"Story

The story is a slow burn at the beginning, and the opening cutscenes are frustratingly long. At the beginning of the game, I felt very frustrated that I had to slog through cutscenes instead of actually playing a game. Once the story started coming together, though, I ended up loving the cutscenes and happily anticipated the next set of revelations. By the end of the game, I was fully engrossed. The story is trippy and weird and follows its own strange logic that is hard to digest at first, but becomes more clear as the game progresses. It's a lovely story full of well-rounded characters, with very convincing acting. My favorite character was Mads Mikkelsen's character, played with a lot of love and warmth. The only egregiously bad acting was done by Mala Morgan as the Chiral Artist.

Gameplay

The gameplay itself can be kinda samey at times, but I still find it fun to plot routes and power through difficult terrain while still keeping my cargo in tip-top shape. The way the game reveals new upgrades makes even nonessential deliveries feel rewarding, though sometimes they can be a bit of a slog if you have to travel far. Vehicles prove not to be as useful as you'd hope; however, once you start rebuilding roads, vehicles are a huge convenience, even if restricted to a specific set of roads. The sneak mechanics are a little annoying, and I find myself either outrunning MULEs or fighting them all 9 times out of 10. Sneaking is essential in BT territory, though, especially in the early game when fighting isn't a feasible option. In general, the gameplay itself is relaxing and meditative, and you get to navigate some truly breathtaking scenery.

Overall, I'd give it an 8.5/10 and I would recommend playing the game through to its epilogue.

8,DEATH STRANDING,74082673,english,"To be honest, I was rooting against this game last year during the game awards. I thought look at this pretentious Kojima game with celebrity cameos and ""No gameplay"". Maybe I was just salty about it being a PS exclusive. When I saw it was coming to PC/Steam and effort was being put into the port, or rather it had been designed for PC from the beginning I thought I need to give this game a chance. And I'm glad I did.

This is not just ""Movie Game"" or a ""Walking Simulator"" or ""Kojima's Wild Ride"". Well actually it is that last one but that's OK. But it's also more than all that. It involves many themes and many statements and yes the lore is silly and convoluted sometimes but it has a real structure and an emotional core worth experiencing. The soundtrack, the acting, all are insanely well-produced for a game and it makes a big difference. I cringed at the naming conventions and some of the characters initially but by the end of the game all were memorable and felt like real performances, not just voice acting. The soundtrack is phenomenal, one of the best with original songs and inserts.

The gameplay can basically be boiled down to ""UPS delivery man simulator"" if you wanted to but it's a bit like calling Sekiro a hack and slash or Halo a ""run around and shoot things"" game. It's hard not to make it sound pretentious, but it's a game that uses the medium of ""the struggle"" to draw you into the experience. Sometimes things are going to suck: you're going to trip and fall and damage cargo, get rained on, get attacked by terrorists or worse. But you keep on keeping on. This is where the social aspect of the game comes in, as you connect destinations to each other you'll see other players' structures and encouraging messages and they'll see yours. It's hard to explain really without breaking it down but the game really is about bridging connections between people.

So basically tl;dr go into the game with an open mind and a healthy suspension of disbelief in parts and you will have a good time.",1597067062,1597067062,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,291,25,4605,0,2943,1598117516,,

11,DEATH STRANDING,74080104,english,"I'm trying to keep this real. I'm not going to give Kojima a pass on certain things just because he's the greatest game designer of all time.  Of course the story is just what I'd expect from a Hideo Kojima title- a deep experience that connects you to the greater human condition. I'm only 50+ hours into this game and have yet to complete the main story, but I'm guessing this will probably be up there with MGS 3 & 4 with a misty eyed you won't soon forget.
There are some elements of game play that I take issue with. If you're going for a walking simulator where real world physics are a real concern, please explain why all of your cargo and posessions in your vehicle are laying on the ground after fighting a super BT?  I wasn't even targeted. Played no role in the fight. I get that one of the themes of the game is suffering and overcoming adversity, but geez.  Also, the vehicles are almost not even worth the trouble. They are unresponsive at times and navigating rough terrain is a pain in the ass. I get that it would be that way in real life, but not when your vehicle has jumping capabilities.  They can be useful, but only in spurts, I'd argue. Maybe things will change when I've put more time into this game. I dunno.
A part of me knew that like a typical Kojima game, you WILL be penalized for killing. I just didn't know how badly. I appreciate the recurring non violent themes in Kojima's games, but sometimes they feel a little too forced.
Don't get it twisted. When it comes down to it, I'm splitting hairs, because this is a great game. Despite what I said about non violence feeling forced at times, it's also deeply rewarding putting MULES in their place wrapped up in cord or unconscious on the ground after a few well placed haymakers. lol  The terrorists are far more challenging because they have no problem killing you right out to take your stuff.  Be warned. Fighting them usually isn't worth the trouble unless you are carrying limited cargo and they have something you really want. Also, while at first I foung reading mail to be a chore, as I advanced through the game I started to get immersed in the Death Stranding universe. Maybe not to the degree of Mass Effect codex entrees, but close.

All in all, this game is very addicting.  It could be the validation you get from leveling up and being validated by the NPCs you're delivering to.

[h1]The Good[/h1]
-The Visuals and atmosphere. can be very relaxing at times.

-The Music (although I am not a fan of vocals in any kind of music, since its my personal bias but I can appreciate most of the music here)

-The online aspect of the game. The main takeaway and why I'm still even playing this.

-Animations and Cutscenes are well done. 

-The story and lore. It is very interesting and the mystery is quite appealing. However...(Go to The Bad)

[h1]The Bad[/h1]
-The non user friendly UI and the speed of navigating through it. Need better QOL changes for this.
[b]Suggestion:[/b] There are a couple of things like: 
faster way to saving, 
make it so that when you access a terminal you can access private locker, recycle, donate and shared locker on one menu instead of having to switch between each of them everytime. That way you can offload, donate, recycle or take cargo IN ONE GO.
-In Inventory UI make it so that you'reable to select all cargo to be offloaded with one click, making it so that equipping the power skeleton automatically puts the cargo on your hips to your back, 

-Unnecessary cutscenes/ Animations
[b]Suggestion:[/b] Make it so that the game has an option where it will remember what cutscene to be skipped automatically. (this will not affect any unique cutscene that comes across thouhg) If its a repeating cutscene that appears on a certain action, make it so that it's automatically skippable. No need for us to have to wait like a few seconds before manually skipping it. You think people want to watch everytime Sam drinks 1 monster energy drink in the private room? or do you think people want to watch the Bridget Poster Logo everytime they recycle something? Or do you think people want to watch Sam get on a truck for 

-Too much expository dialogue and too much dialogue where you are forced to pay attention without giving the player the ability to do anything while the dialogue plays out.
[b]Suggestion:[/b] make it so that you have them talk to the player while they are out doing missions. You do have many of this but you should incorporate more of it.

-The first few hours of the game gives such a slow burn and lacks the investment appeal and is hard to gain new players this way without at least frontloading something interesting to the player to make them look forward to the gameplay. 

-Some of the voice acting such as the Chiral Artist, Fragile and sometimes Deadman are pretty bad. All of them are trying too hard to speak in english and I feel its better for them to just use their native language or probably get someone else who can professionally dub them. And seriously...What is up with the Chiral Artist? I have to be blunt here but her voice acting is horrible. If she cant do the voice acting like this please let someone dub her or let her speak in her native language.

-The Villain. (although I cant say it yet since i havent finished the game but...) He's very one dimensional so far and his constant unexplained absence while Sam is reconnecting all the networks are yet to be revealed to me.

-The way the story is told throughout the game. The game suffers with pacing issues and the way the story is told is too much on the nose and kind of makes us as the players stupid instead of trying to tell the story in a way that it allowing us to understand the story on our own. Interview data, mails and memory chips do not help in this case.

-The lack of personality of the Delivery recipients. Their dialogue is boring at best and cringey at most. Make it so that they actually say something worthwhile whenever you deliver something at their terminal instead of waiting to get that star on the connection level to get some kind of physical reward. 

[b]Suggestion[/b] I would suggest putting off some of the mails and replacing them as dialogues for these NPCs. like each delivery instead of them just saying ""thanks again, take care Sam"" they tell a brief story on how they've improved or how they've gain back their confidence or something.

-Unexplained blatant advertising (monster energy drink, Ride trike and norman reedus flagrantly sponsoring his show while riding it)


All in all, I cant say I can recommend this a 100%. its more on 50/50.",1597052890,1597053626,TRUE,2,0,0.543568492,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,13,6,6220,0,5303,1598010191,,

My word what an amazing story.  Generally speaking I am the king of skipping cut scenes.  I genuinely hate most crappy gaming stories and look more at the actual game play for my entertainment.  This one not so.  Every aspect of the story I absorbed, wanting more the whole time, and the end.... ugh.  I haven't been this absorbed in a story maybe ever.  

Game play - I can see here why this may not have been for everyone but I like games where I get to decide what to do next so all the journeys were all or at least in part my own design and I enjoy that freedom.  Granted there is an overlaying progression for the story so there is some structure there.  The combat is not fleshed out or challenging enough to be honest and the AI design straight up sucks.  Pretty simple that even the most basic player can excel at.  I think that this is probably what motivated the past reviews by the bigger names upon release.  The real challenge here is deciding on a rout, getting to know the landscape and the hazards within it, and getting better at avoidance/navigating the terrain.  Here though I do think the game direction went a little mad - your basically a postman... the crappiest job in the entire world.... especially during the holidays and when people in large apartment complexes mail order large bags of dog food.  Considering the mail man thing and the real lack of potential with that I think they did a masterful job at making the unfun fun.  Prepare for a walking sim though with a lot of depth.

Unlocks and evolving your character - amazing.  a perfect work reward balance the entire way through the game and felt very rewarding as well as little and big items being game changers.  Yeah this was perfect.  Good job here!

34,DEATH STRANDING,73028213,english,"---UPDATED REVIEW AS OF 8/9/2020---
I wanted to provide a cautionary tale, now that I am in the middle of Chapter 8. TDLR below...

My experience with Death Stranding has been a glorious roller coaster ride of sorts. Full disclosure, I was on the Death Stranding hype train; having missed out on the PS4 release I pre-ordered this as soon as humanly possible on Steam. I also went into this game without seeing any game play footage other than Digital Foundry's (PS4 release). 

After spending a few hours with the game, I was hooked on the story and the strange yet incredibly satisfying game play. At this point in time, I wrote my initial review of the game; basically saying the game was AMAZING...and it is!

However, after I spent a few hours with the game, my OCD kicked into overdrive and before long I found myself completely distracted from the main story line and focusing on two things: (1) 5-starring (ie. completionisting (I know it's not word)) all the delivery distro centers and (2) building/upgrading structures for others players. 

At this point, I was somewhere in Chapter 2 or Chapter 3, and I was asking questions such as (1) Does Norman Reedus actually have dialogue of ANY substance? (2) Do I seriously give a crap about my BB (the baby)?? As you might guess, at 35 years of age I was seriously questioning my abilities to make solid judgement calls on video game pre-orders.  

But, I had slapped down the $$$ for the title and I wasn't about to just walk away. And thank the good Lord I didn't because wow! For me, Chapter Four is where I got hooked. I can't explain why exactly because of spoilers, but for me this is where the game truly starts to pull the curtain back a bit...and it's amazing. Also, yes Norman Reedus does in fact talk (and for the most part) he's convincing. He's out shined by some other characters IMO like Die-hard Man, Mama and Heartman. And also, I did learn to love my BB for reasons that again I cannot share (spoilers). 

Needless to say, if you don't allow yourself to get overwhelmed and try to advance the story at least every 2 hours (unlike myself) I believe you will greatly enjoy Death Stranding!

During my playtime I have experienced phantom controller inputs as well as some odd frame rate dips during some (not all) cut scenes. Otherwise, from a technical standpoint the game runs beautifully on my system. 

TLDR: If the story appears to start off a bit slow, don't lose hope! Also, don't let (as I did) OCD take over; it's fine to stop and smell the roses once in a while, just remember to advance the main story every 1-2 hours if you can and you won't regret it.

---Original Review---
Death Stranding has easily been the highlight of my Summer. The open-world is a thing of beauty and terror all at the same time.

You can't really grasp on what's even going on, especially in the beginning; just being thrown in this new world you don't have any understanding of. And as such it is really hard to tell why exactly I love this game.
Maybe it is the feeling of, again, being thrown in a place with everything so weird and conceptually new; having to learn everything as you go. Maybe the story, which believe me, is great and makes you invested in its characters, at some points sending shivers down your spine. Maaaaybe it is just me knowing that I've bought it for quite the price that makes me so invested...  alright, jokes, jokes.
Also, for this to not be your regular and vague review, I think I need to say this: Although I can see how from the outside perspective some people may find it, to put it simply, boring... and I can see some of my friends' interests not being exactly compatible with the plot or gameplay of this game overall, this game is really not about making deliveries. It's, at least for me, a duo of the storyline and the online segment:  While the storyline is obviously the main thing that pushes you forward making you experience all kinds of emotions, the other makes you go the extra mile trying to be helpful and useful to other players.  I'm, let's just say, very affectionate and every like on the things I build saying that players have found me helpful really gets me going. And just returning to the game after going to sleep, seeing something like ""A player used the road you rebuilt"" and a few thousand likes no kidding makes my day.

74,DEATH STRANDING,74043118,english,"[h1]Pretty much the best postman simulator to date![/h1]

The core gameplay loop is probably not for everyone:

- mostly [b]overcoming terrain[/b] by different means to deliver stuff
- there is [b]combat[/b], but most of it is [b]strongly disadvised[/b] for the majority of the game

If you can get into it though, it is probably unlike everything you've played before (which I'd count as a positive, seeking something different from the norm). I'd not go as far as Kojima saying that he created a ""completely new type of genre"", but it is indeed a unique experience to be had.

The [b]really strong points of the game are the story, music, and the cinematography[/b] (there are really beautifully crafted shots and scenes in the game, any of which you could use as a wallpaper or literally hang as pictures on your wall, this is complemented by a pretty good photo mode in game).

The theme is solid sci-fi with some religious/fantasy elements strewn in.

[b]It is a Hideo Kojima game[/b] though, so it can get really strange at times, and it is littered with (sometimes more, sometimes less subtle) movie references, as well as some elements that are figuratively thrown in your face (I mean the main protagonist is named ""Sam Porter Bridges"" who is a Porter working for an organization named ""Bridges"", thanks for the hint Kojima).

Story wise it is a [b]mostly linear game, but it has strong open world elements to it[/b], especially if you want to get most of the equipment and upgrades, which you get mostly by doing side quests/optional stuff, which will in turn greatly ease your future (main- or side-) quests.
If you're like me and want to get most of it, you'll have to sink in a lot of hours to optimize the delivery routes, which in turn can lead to kind of a burnout at some point, where you just want to progress the story or finish the game altogether.

The [b]PC port of the Decima Engine is mostly OK[/b], it will certainly run better than on console, though as some people have pointed out it could probably run a lot better (you won't hit 144 FPS even on the best of machines, and during most in-game/in-engine scripted scenes or cutscenes it will lock to 60 FPS).
At some point in the game I started getting DX12 errors which hard crashed the game, and I found reports from other people online having the same issues. I've put my 1080TI to default clocks (it is watercooled and had a otherwise rock solid overclock in place), which got rid of most of the crashes (it seems to me that only some specific areas are prone to crashes, as I was playing the earlier as well as the later parts of the game with the usual overclock in place without problems).


All in all if you know Kojima and know what you're getting yourself into, or if you're not shy to try something different or more ""artsy"", this game definitely has a lot to it.

[b]Story[/b]
-The story is seriously convoluted and barely makes any real sense (and I say that as a Kingdom Hearts and Metal Gear Solid fan).
-The story feels like it's trying to be ""2deep4u"" and clever, but it's just not. The dialog is mostly groan-worthy, the exposition is insulting and treats you like an idiot (all while explaining jack shit) and the game throws all these terms at you like ""DOOMS"" and ""Chirial"" from the first 10 minutes without explaining anything.
-In retrospect, the character names are even groan-worthy too. ""Mama"" is called that because she has a ghost baby, ""Deadman"" is [spoiler]made up of dead people, so he's literately a DEAD MAN[/spoiler], ""Die-Hardman's"" [spoiler]real name is quite literately John McClane as in the protagonist of the Die Hard series[/spoiler] and vice versa
-At one point, a main character [spoiler]is killed off, only to be replaced by her identical twin sister who's soul she merges with. It's completely stupid and they hand wave it with a ""twin-telepathy"" excuse. It makes killing her off feels pointless and if it wasn't for Sam reminding the player about it, I would have completely forgotten about it. The whole moment falls flat anyway because I didn't care about this character, much like the rest of the cast.[/spoiler]
-While Kojima's previous games were filled with lovable and memorable characters, the entire cast of Death Stranding is just [b]bad[/b]. Spending what was probably millions on a cast of celebrity actors didn't pay off and I didn't care for any of them. Funnily enough, the one character I did enjoy watching was portrayed by Troy Baker; the famous video game voice actor, not any of the traditional, Hollywood actors.
-""Sam"", the main character is fairly uninteresting and goes from being talkative and engaging to almost a silent protagonist. I can only imagine it was due to having cast Norman Reedus, a busy actor instead of a regular voice actor who's available. This was the same problem that plagued MGSV

[b]Gameplay[/b]
-Admittedly, the gameplay was interesting at first. It was interesting managing your cargo weight and finding the optimal way to travel to your destination. However, after a few hours of playing, I was burnt out. Sure, you get access to different modes of transport (trucks, bikes, ziplines) over the course of the game.
-In the end, this game is really just a walking simulator in which you do fetch quests. It's at least mechanically interesting compared to others I've seen (which isn't saying much), but you're not going to get anything more out of it than that.
-The game turns into a very mediocre third-person shooter halfway through with awful controls and a lack of a cover button. Not only that, ammo isn't stored separately, so you're forced to carry multiple copies of the same gun instead of just one that goes through the same pool of ammo. It turns firefights into this awkward game of running away and taking shots, emptying countless amounts of bullets into enemies, going into a menu to drop said gun and using a brand-new rifle with more ammo in it. It's a huge downgrade compared to MGS4/5.
-The game tries to chastise you for killing NPCs, but there's no real point of avoiding it. You're given non-lethal weapons like in Metal Gear, but I found it easier to just run down terrorists or the many enemies that will try to steal your cargo. There's no punishment for doing so and it's much more effective than wrestling the game's awful combat mechanics.
-The online component is well-implemented and helpful. If you build structures or leave tools like ladders in the open world, other players can use these and leave you ""likes""; helping your in-game rank go up. This whole mechanic is the game's saving grace because I doubt I would have stuck around if not for the abundance of trucks and ladders around for me to use.

97,DEATH STRANDING,74015667,english,"The excellent Kojima Productions team take the next logical step with this new game, abandoning the familiar stealth-action game they invented long ago, along with most of its combative game play for a wholly new experience. 

It's inevitable that innovation pales in comparison to sophistication, but while the latter benefits from years (decades) of refinement, the former has the advantage of novelty. I loved MGSV's endless replayability, and after 85 hours, I'm finding package delivery a tad played out. But I wouldn't want KP to go back to stealth. I've been there, done that. I'd actually be more interested in seeing them find new ways to explore non-combative game play. 

But the real treat here is the surreal storyline. The closest I can compare is if David Lynch wrote a sci-fi game and Christopher Nolan directed it. I can't tell if it's good or bad that Kojima and his writing partners have no editor, leaving endless, often repetitive dialog to run unchecked. But if I had to choose, I'll take audaciously unique stories delivered sloppily over the same old story done to perfection. 

Because what a story! It's like living in a dream, following dream rules and dream logic, where the strangeness becomes the whole of reality in a way no game ever had before. The game's juxtaposition of hyper-realism and surreality leaves one permanently off-kilter, softening and eventually eliminating the line between the real and the unreal, the literal and the symbolic, just as it erases the line between life and death. It embraces the fact that in story, there's really no difference between these things. And yet it's the juxtaposition of opposites that evokes examination of what they mean in relation to one another. 

I think these days, we often hear loud, angry complaints from certain fans when they don't get what they were expecting. Plenty of people didn't enjoy Death Stranding at all, either because of its bizarre story, its experimental non-combative game play, or even the conspicuous self-awareness studio-head Hideo Kojima brings to it, inviting his friends and colleagues to play roles. 

For good or bad, the game is a unique artifact, making it hard to judge in terms of qualities and flaws. It is what it is, as awkward as it is graceful, as pretentious as it is brilliant, as clumsy as it is masterful.

9,DEATH STRANDING,74005510,english,"Overall, I absolutely love this game. I have never racked up so many hours on a single video game. The story is detailed and beautiful. So is the environment. Those scary af BTs are soooo scary. Seriously. They can also get a little annoying at times, at least before I unlocked the BT killing cuffs. But the rest of the gameplay was satisfying for the most part. The dialogue was well thought out. The characters had emotions in their dialogues. I believe this is what Horizon Zero Dawn was lacking. Speaking of horizon, I like the fact that there were hzd easter eggs in the game in form of holograms. The soundtrack is also one of the best and I still can't stop listening to those songs, especially ""ghost"" by au/ra.

The single most annoying/boring thing is the cargo management and rebuilding all the roads. Also, the distance between cities and outposts is a little too much. Especially when you need to deliver cargo in order to unlock more bandwidth and resources. I needed them to rebuild the roads. I almost felt like giving up halfway into the game. But thankfully I didn't and that's when the story got much more interesting. Everything up to halfway was basically training and unlocking more stuff.
The jumping and stabilization thing also bugged me. I don't like the fact that I have to stabilize every single time. Mostly during heavy loads. I also think the jumping interface is a little buggy. I couldn't jump over rocks when I needed to and so I ended up falling several times during the start.

But enough negativity. The game itself is a masterpiece. I don't want to dive into the details at the risk of spoiling stuff, but all I can say is that it was well worth the $50 I spent.
Also, a word of advice... Always use trucks for cargo hauling on roads. They seemed to be slow at first, but the amount of cargo they can haul is just crazy and so you wouldn't need to make a hell lot of bike trips.

Gives an interesting take on why the dinosaurs went extinct. [spoiler] That part of the story, Sam being raised by an extinction entity is extremely imaginative.

But even if you like his previous works, this one might not be for you.

The story is in typical Kojima fashion filled with twists and turns where you truly don't understand everything until the very end. And that is not the problem this game faces. But the pacing of the gameplay. After watching through the first hour or so of cutscenes you get put into the game world. And here is where the initial frustrations can start. It seemingly takes forever to progress. Once you are somewhere in the middle of the game and are pretty much free to do as you wish the game really opens up and becomes quite enjoyable. Still, with downsides, however. The combat feels quite boring and repetitive, unlike the last Metal Gear. Towards the end, the game once again suffers pacing issues. Progressing feels once again very tedious and stretched out.

If you can overcome these hurdles however, the game can be a lot of fun.

After walking back and forth between the four posts, I still didn't get a quest to move forward to a new base, so I said flack it and i decided to walk towards west into the unknown and make my own discoveries. After about 40 mins or so I find myself enjoying it actually, just walking into the nothingness with only a direction and no quest mark. I finally found the next post (behind a path of rocks and shadow people), and I was so excited and for the first time since I began playing, I had fun. I thought maybe I finally became one of those people that enjoyed the game, that I discovered what death stranding is about, freedom of choice, and discovery on a lonely path.

No. It's the king of walking simulators, and you better respect it for it shows it with pride and ingenuity. Walking in this game is a full system of mechanics that include elements such as movement, balance, center of gravity, terrain, and climate, to the point that the very act of moving becomes fairly technical and challenges the definition of gameplay. It also serves as a metaphor for the main theme of the game, an interesting example of storytelling through game mechanics.

As for the story, it lies in the thin edge between brilliance and ridicule, characterized by the typical Kojima-esque overexposition, awkward comedy and symbolism that notwithstanding hides a phenomenal lore of a Sci-Fi dystopian world in which the planes of the living and the dead collide, changing forever the very way people interact with each other. It tells the story of mankind regaining the upper hand against certain extinction, and it reminds us the values that make us human. It's an acquired taste. It's divisive. Don't let anybody fool you and try it for yourself.

That being said, it has this very intriguing and complex story albeit married to a Facebook themed environment on achieving ""likes"", which in my opinion does not fit the overall theme of the game.  You basically have this expansive/creative map where you can venture from a pasture to mountain peaks all polluted with signs requesting likes for the 20 somethings.  It appears that the purpose of the game was to create synergy and sharing but the Facebook theme doesn't work.  It would be like providing Mario with a BFG!!!  I actually think many of the players are in it for the likes more than the story....most probably linked to their i-phones which provides notices when ""likes"" are received!!

As mentioned, the story line is good and makes you think.  However, if you think too much you begin to see where some of the parts don't fit together.  In the game there is an agent of doom surrounded by a transcending environment.   However, how does said agent become said role?...Tequila???

Another pet peeve is when engineers try to transition from a box controller to the keyboard and mouse.  Sometimes the commands and menu's are too complex for the PC environment and you just about require a foot pedal, this is one of those games.  At times the 3rd person movement doesn't function well and the weapons commands get mixed up, not good when facing a s.o.b......nope....you're done!!

Graphics 10/10 : This game is stupid gorgeous and can make even the beefiest of PC's chug at max settings. This game really makes you feel like you're playing a very buff Norman Reedus.

Game-play 4/10 to 9/10: Depending on how you feel about it the game-play can be very good. There is obviously a lot of running but it's mostly for the first part of the game as eventually you get lots of vehicles and an exoskeleton that lets you run at 30mph and jump like Spider-Man and basically become a super-athlete. The shooting and action sequences are similar to Metal Gear Solid 5 but with some changes to fit DS's mechanics. There is a ton of nuance and these mechanics are very complex and rewarding with a high skill ceiling. To be perfectly honest with how challenging the early game is you might consider giving up on the first map but please don't because the rest of the game is amazing.
 - This game utilizes online mechanics similar to Dark Souls except other players can only help you and you will need it due to the games unrelenting ruthlessness.

- The whole game isn't a walking a simulator, just the beginning which can drag a bit

Music/Sound 10/10: Soundtrack is perfect and sound is crisp, diverse, and very immersive.

Story 10/10: Complex and overarching like you would expect from the creator of Metal Gear with many twists and turns with great and memorable characters.

I waited and eventually it clicked. My problem with the game was that i hated the traversal mechanics. I somehow managed to find the core of the game (moving from point A to B) somehow simultaneously boring and so complex as to be annoying. The great problem is that you can rarely prevent Sam from, say, slipping on a mountain: he will slip, and when he does you must correct the mistake. When you are forced to make mistakes, mistakes that you believe you could prevent, it is infuriating. Breath of the Wild resolved this problem by a) letting you climb anything and b) limiting your climbing to your stamina. Thus the only true mistake you could make would be with your stamina management, and that was entirerly within your control.

This presented a great problem: how do you play a game that you hate playing? How do you play a game centred around bad traversal mechanics when you hate those same mechanics? Why its simple: you find a way to avoid the traversal mechanics. You get a trike or a van, some PCCs and you ram that vehicle to your destination. Thats it. It helps if you build roads and zip lines but I swear to goodness it works. I've seen some poor fools walking the whole game; imagine that!

Once i defeated the basic idea of the game (at one point i was literally driving a van through the mountain range you encounter around mountain knot city) , i could begin to enjoy the story. When i first encountered that story, i laughed so goddamn hard. There is something so fundamentally silly about some of the plot that they could only be the product of Kojima getting a blank check from Sony. 

I won't spoil the story because its so complex i would need to attach a link for a word document before the spoilers i provide began to make sense. In terms of characters, there are lots of big names but few good performances. Lea seydoux and guillermo del toro stand out in a bad way; mama and heartman range between dull and enjoyable; Reedus and Mikkelson are consistently good; tommie earl jenkins delivers a performance so good in one scene i would almost recommend the game solely so you can experience it. 

There are a couple burning problems i have with the game beside the above. The game has action elements in that you do some fighting at some points; the game gives you interesting, unconventional weapons to deal with those problems. Then, all of sudden, the game gives you assault rifles, shotguns and rocket launchers and never takes them away. Why? I'm sure it was a demand from Sony because its so utterly silly to have a game about hiking to deliver packages, telling this specific story, that then goes ""also here's a assault rifle which is better than all the other tools you received to this point"". Its especially disappoint given how deep the mechanics are that mean if they took out the COD guns, you could still have a good experience. 

SPOILER COMMENT FOR LAST 2hrs of game: [spoiler] you get to this point where to advance the plot and get the ending, you have to run around on a beach in order to get the credits to play. The credits only continue you when you run. this goes on for 15 minutes. Why? I almost quit the game there and then before i realised there was more stuff after. Its so stupid and it crowns this games consistent problem of being unable to communicate plot to beyond making you stand still and push a button to advance dialogue. [/spoiler]

I recommend Death Stranding despite my experience with it rather than because of it. This game obviously produces a lot of reactions, many of which i think reflect how comfortable someone is with the mechanics and gameplay loop; if you cannot develop a working strategy, the game is a chore; as a chore, the indulgent, sometimes laughable, occasionally gripping story becomes impossible to engage with.

Death Stranding is an action/adventure—can only be described as a delivery simulator set in the ruins of post-America, following a mysterious event that crippled normalcy. You play Sam by the famed Norman Reedus, a porter and one of the few to have DOOMS, an ability to use the beach.

The gameplay is exceptionally different from the norm. You are essentially a courier sounds easy, doesn't it? It does actually, but there is common sense involved; even weight distribution and centre of gravity, momentum and, well, common sense. You deliver from point A to point B, dealing with obstacles and MULEs (Bandits), sneaking past or fighting BTs and babysitting your... baby or BB, an apparent human-tool that exists between life and death. DS plays a con-game making everyone believe it's a difficult game, but it's not, as I find it simple. I can't place [i]how I feel about gameplay[/i], it's different and extraordinary. There are combat and stealth bits as well. There are no revolutionary differences—a part used items stay in your inventory taking space and BTs are invisible. 

Landscapes are captivating and alive. One known factor for traversing these beautiful vistas is that they are especially dangerous. DS uses a terrain colour code system—variable data via the scanner, they are as follows; [b]blue[/b] is easy, [b]yellow[/b] is used with caution and [b]red[/b] is danger—ill-advised. Slowly over time, it can cause damage to your hiking boots and possibly damage/losing your cargo. Thankfully, there are items to use to save you on the pitch. Besides that, rain. Yes, seamlessly harmless drops of water can ""deteriorate"" your cargo and equipment. This is called time fall.

The asynchronous multiplayer is not original by any means, it was first used in Demon's Souls (2009) and later for Journey (2012)—only ones I know of. In laymen's terms, players can/assist you in-game by leaving markers/or messages on the ground. While I get the idea of forming connections in DS, not everyone will be on board with the idea. In my opinion, it ruins surprises around every corner. I don't know about you; I don't need seven signs saying: [b]WARNING! THERE ARE BTS IN THE AREA! USE CAUTION![/b] Do wish it was optional.

The VA is incredible, with some of the finest actings I've seen in years, with many being renowned. I didn't found the OST that much impact on me, it wasn't bad or anything. Just didn't click.

DS is an exceptionally weird and intense journey across America, while at first cosmic horror themes are hidden. They are gradually unveiled; the concept of the dead has changed—sorta Quasi-Poe, being dead is inherited dangerous. Time is sorta shattered as it rains in small pockets and crystallized to Chiral crystals. BTS is the by-product of the circumstances, but they're not like gods or aliens. They are the dead, misplace and disconnected. To say DS is fun or enjoyable is like saying ""going to the dentist is enjoyable."" I felt I was [i]along for the ride[/i]. DS isn't bad or good, it was a unique experience and only from Kojima's visionary mind can think of.

Death Stranding is one of those games where having seen countless teasers and trailers for a couple of years prior, I couldn't grasp what the game was even about other than it starred Norman Reedus. There was actually a time before release where I thought the game seemed a bit convoluted. 

Its with great relief that I say that the game is anything but convoluted. It lets you into a world that is so fleshed out with detail and depth that it's actually refreshing. Over on the PS4 I spent so many game hours between objectives just exploring the world, getting a kick out of creating structures for other players to use and completing the more trickier deliveries. 

The graphics are beautiful, the music is gorgeous, the characters are interesting, the voice acting is excellent and I think the main important thing with this particular version of the game is that it really is an excellent port.

It's a very unique game what's not what it seems to be at first glance, it's a game about the journey you make and people you interact with, not just about connecting america(would be nice if actual america tried connecting everyone). It has a nice story, breathtaking scenery and sense of being connected while being disconnected from everyone.
To me it's a masterpiece, but it has its issues, it's a console port so limited settings because of that, it crashes in some areas way too often, hindering gameplay but it's still somewhat new so lets hope the issues get ironed out

The game is about making walking from point A to B as interesting and thoughtful as possible. In that sense, because of the way it treats the mechanics of walking, it is never not interesting and engaging. Every step and piece of the environment matters. So you are never not thinking about where you are going.

It isn't a game about exploring in the sense of ""whats in this mountain?""  but it is about planning and executing specific runs. It is rarely boring because every movement requires thought and consideration. But it also isn't tedious. As a result, it is one of the few open world games where I didn't look at an ""point A to B"" mission and sigh because I thought it would just be a time suck to go there. As a side note, the multiplayer aspect is fun because it is genuinely rewarding to contribute to connecting the world in terms of building roads and ziplines. Building roads and planting ziplines is fun, especially because you know it will help others, and if you play you will appreciate the work others have done for you.

At the same time, a few short action missions aside, the pacing of the game doesn't change significantly, and honestly, if the first couple of hours don't impress you, you may not enjoy the game. In the end, it is what it is. You walk or drive from one place to the other while managing heavy cargo and trying to avoid rocks.

80,DEATH STRANDING,72690153,english,"Death Stranding is a highly subjective game. You will absolutely need to play it yourself in order to determine whether or not you will like it. No review of this game will be able to make that verdict for you, and almost every review that you read about it is going to sound like a personal memoir. That said, I loved it. 

I originally played Death Stranding on my PS4, and at first I was skeptical of the game. It felt like I was playing a glorified ""walking simulator"", as many would call it. But the thing is, walking simulator or not, there was no denying that I had an experience unlike any other with it. And after pouring over a hundred hours into this game and exploring everything that it had to offer, it wasn't just a walking simulator to me anymore. It became one of my top 3 favourite games of all time - next to Bloodborne (release a PC port already damnit) and Final Fantasy VII. An incredibly bold statement, I know. 

The reason for that is simple - it helped me. When Death Stranding came out, I was in a pretty tough spot. I was miserable and felt hopeless. It wasn't until I played through the game that I began to ease up. There was something so unusually relaxing about delivering packages across barren, unforgiving landscapes and it felt nice to help other players across worlds asynchronously - placing ladders, building roads, and returning their lost parcels. Being able to leave an indelible mark within someone else's game world was such a small yet meaningful gesture that really made me feel better, like I was worth something. And then it clicked. I realized that I was playing a game that was the antithesis to video game toxicity. In a world where many video games are so full of spiteful playerbases, I found myself playing a game where every single person was helping each other. This alone completely changed my perception towards so many things in life, and gave me hope that there is some kindness in our world. 

The story, too, was nothing short of beautiful. I loved it. In my opinion, Kojima-San once again knocked it out of the park with the narrative, which involves stellar performances, especially by Norman Reedus and Mads Mikkelsen. I won't spoil anything, but I'd like to mention that I found the main protagonist to be incredibly relatable. His journey is about connecting with others, which he has difficulty doing - much like myself. As a result, I found this to be one of the most touching stories I've ever experienced in a video game. How Kojima comes up with such original adventures with powerful characters when it seems like every plot has already been explored is astonishing to me, and I eagerly await whatever he and his team come up with next. 

Death Stranding quite possibly saved my life and it is a masterpiece in my eyes. I've only just begun my second playthrough of the game on PC, and I can't wait to continue re-experiencing it in greater fidelity. If you love this game like me, that's great. If you hate it, that's fine too. Just play it.

Update: Can't believe I forgot to mention the music. Using licensed music by Low Roar was a brilliant stylistic choice on Kojima's part, and I am forever thankful to him for introducing me to this group. Their work is simply magical, and the way in which their tracks are utilized to play at certain key moments during gameplay is genius. I was listening to their music in my car today and I knew I had to come back to edit my original review of this game to show my appreciation to them. This game truly has one of the best soundtracks I've ever listened to.

Update 2: After 108 hours of playtime, I've just completed my playthrough of Death Stranding on PC. Boy, was it worth it. This game runs like an absolute dream on the platform. Death Stranding is hands down the most beautiful game I've ever played, even on a standard PS4. And so to be able to replay this game on PC with crisper resolution and an uncapped framerate was a wonderful experience, especially considering how I had no technical issues whatsoever. I was running the game on an RTX 2070 and I experienced a grand total of 0 hiccups. There were a few dips here and there with the framerate, especially when driving on roads, but overall the PC port was very well optimized. I initially thought that my playthrough would feel like a humble return to a game I already know and love, but instead it felt like a brand new experience. The visuals are just that much better. In fact, playing the game on PC made me fall in love with something that I did not expect: Photo Mode. This is a relatively new feature that a lot of games have started implementing, and I'll admit that it's one that I've often overlooked. But with its photorealistic beauty and gorgeous cinematic storytelling, Death Stranding changed that for me. A solid chunk of my playtime went into taking as many screenshots of the game as I could, and I have to say that it was very easy for me to fall in love with photo mode. The UI of the feature is simple and gives you plenty of options to make virtually any frame in the game wallpaper-worthy. You can tweak various camera settings, add color filters, change character poses and expressions, and so much more. I had a lot of fun freezing in-game time to save and admire several instances of the game's beauty, and this was definitely one of the major highlights of my PC playthrough. I'm excited to continue using photo mode in games that offer it in the future, especially when their visuals are this appealing. Until then, I'm happy to say that the graphical upgrade of Death Stranding from PS4 to PC made me enjoy one of my favourite games even more, and I wouldn't trade the experience for anything.

Death Stranding isn't the game we were hoping for but it is worth checking out.

Norman Reedus is amazing and so are all the other actors. It's a movie like game with an awesome soundtrack. 

Combat is rudimentary, it is strategic but simple and you will be sneaking around a lot hoping some invisible floating monsters don't melt you into the ground and make you explode. Honestly it is kinda scary and can be pretty fun. 

I did enjoy the walking sometimes, delivering towers of packages on Norman's back is quite amusing and stupid when you lose your balance and all your packages tumble to the ground.

Death Stranding, mechanically, is chiefly about transpiration, logistics, and infrastructure. The primary gameplay loop revolves around you transporting cargo over long stretches of treacherous terrain to disparate locations, over and over, back and forth, while occasionally constructing upgrades to your gear and refitting the land to suit those means. On rare occasions you'll have to pass through or directly attack enemy encampments, but those situations are uncommon and infrequent. The large majority of the game you will be concerning yourself with how to best travel from point A to point B, while carrying your own body weight in cargo.

But that's not to speak against the game. The actual act of travel has been refined to a razor sharp edge, and subsumed with detail. There are constantly decisions to make as you travel: moment to moment, as you keep the cargo on your back balanced; minute to minute, as you plan your route ahead; hour to hour, as you design new infrastructure to benefit your future deliveries. You may happen upon lost cargo that you can choose to take with you to your destination; you may happen upon an unexpected challenge when your batteries run dry, or you tumble and lose your cargo off a cliff, or are assaulted by an enemy and have to fend them off. The game is designed to make sure that there is never a dull moment during your travels.

The story is just as refined. It's a story of connection, common understanding, and the bonds that we all share. It's a story about fostering trust between one another, and forging new connections such that everyone can benefit. It's a strong, poignant, consistent message that is constantly broadcast throughout the entire game. And it's a refreshing change from all the games today which are about conflict, competition, and good vs. evil. Death Stranding is not a game about division; it's a game about unison, about connection.

You do that by delivering cargo to other NPCs and people, some mundane, some critical to sustaining life and humanity, all of which has meaning and value to every individual. 

For your every actions, you will not only be rewarded by NPCs in the game but also by real players too in many ways. Be it via likes, via items, weapons, resources etc. Throughout your journey, you will find help from both NPCs and actual other players alike too. Yes, even though the game is single player, there's asynchronous multiplayer in the game from start to finish where you won't see the players but will see the help they've chosen to provide you via weapons, items, structures and many others things to make the journey more convenient for you. In this game, the journey is just as important and rewarding as the destination.

You will face many obstacles along the way too, not just the enemies and bosses, which you will encounter a lot but also the seemingly beautiful and hostile environment itself. There are both human and supernatural enemies in the game. The environments are nice and varied...from huge grassy green fields to rocky plains to volcanic crevices to snowy mountain peaks. The game has unique challenges and overcoming said challenges, especially when you're helped by other players, is immensely rewarding.

Visually this one of the best, most photo-realistic game you'll ever come across. Some of the other strong points of this game are the story, character build-up and interaction, gameplay, unique combat encounters and soundtrack. Hideo Kojima and his team at Kojima has directed / crafted this game masterfully and meticulously with the finest details from start to finish and it really shows in the game.

The game is also extremely well optimized and runs beautifully on decent hardware while looking stunning. I ran the game on my I7 4790K CPU paired with a GTX 1070 GPU and 16GB ram. Maxing out the game, I had anywhere from 60 to 120+ FPS. Depending on the location and how intense the visual spectacles were.

I've spent 133 hours finishing the game even though there were still quite a handful of side missions left. I played it non-stop since launch on Steam as the game was highly addictive and rewarding. Yes, it is THAT good and I don't praise a game to this high caliber lightly. I'm telling you, this is a game you MUST experience at least once in your life as it is a one of kind unique game that is so well made, you won't believe until you've experienced it yourself.

Overall, I give Death Stranding my highest score which is a 10/10. I'm seriously hoping there be a sequel as this game has a great potential to become the next big franchise.

Death Stranding scratches a very niche itch of Post-Apocalyptic Delivery Service Walking Simulator. However the most care put into this game was in the talking mechanics and story. Yes Walking has it's own complex mechanics, you have to think about your center of gravity, where you place each step, and the amount of weight you're carrying.

12,DEATH STRANDING,73826578,english,"I can highly recommend this game, but with a big qualifier: it's not for everyone. 

I think most people will already know if this is a game that suits their preferences already, but here are 2 things I think would help determine if you'd like this game: 

Kojima Story Telling. The story is bonkers. Characters have stupid names that lack all subtly. Proper nouns are used that can be very confusing (""Beach"" being a term for the limbo between life and death?), Dialogue can range from high school creative writing to class to very moving within a conversation. If those things don't turn you off or you find Kojima's brand of story telling charming, then I think you'll like this story. 

Non-Traditional Gameplay Loop: This game has much more in common with something like Euro Truck Simulator than Kojima's previous work. If you are expecting a big action romp like the Metal Gear series you will be sadly dissapointed. There are action-packed moments, but they are few and far between, acting as contrast between the banality of delivering packages across mountains. I view this game more as a ""zen"" game. Put on a podcast or some relaxing music and enjoy the beautifully built and recognized world. 

If you can appreciate a infrastructure building/delivery simulator set in a world created by the mind of Hideo Kojima, you will probably love this game. The story can be cheesy, the dialogue hammy, but everything is so sincere that it brings a certain charm with it. The game is amazingly polished. It looks and runs beautifully. The lore creates a very unique world that is fun to explore. I'm greatly enjoying my time with the game. 

My only complaint with the game is that by it's very nature there is a lot of down time. And there's a lot of lore-rich documents you can collect. I wish Kojima would've had the lore-interviews voiced acted so you could listen to them as you make deliveries. It is kind of strange that this isn't the case as The Phantom Pain supplied players with cassette tapes they could listen to as they traversed to add more the story. 

All in all, I love this game. Not for everyone. But it's an entirely unique game that will stick with me. Currently my GOTY is between Death Stranding and Outer Wilds, that's how much I'm enjoying it.",1596652153,1596652153,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,159,2,4591,0,4264,1596729453,,

First, I hope you like cut scenes (and a lot of them) because Death Stranding is overflowing with very long (albeit well done) cut scenes. While some of them are short and simply for flavor, some of them last quite a while and hold a ton of story elements. If you just want game play, keep this in mind.

That being said, the game play is pretty engaging! The 'Strand' element to the game is pretty interesting. From what I understand, a 'Strand' is your connection to someone else playing the game. In terms of game play, as you progress throughout an area strands will start to appear. This can show up as pathways that other's have traveled down or even bridges that other's have built allowing you to use them. The buildings and paths you create in your game will likely show up in someone else's! It's a fun concept.

Gameplay is doing something really interesting, increasing the depth of mechanics outside of combat for once. That alone is worth a $30 price of admission. Its not going to be for everyone. I find the character models a little uncannyvalleyesque but the Decima engine makes landscapes look phenominal.

For the rest of the price, if you're not familiar with Kojima you're probably not going to get much out of the story. It has some interesting things to say but does so in a mostly poorly constructed way with way too much exposition, and the lore ultimately undermines itself. However it does have some really strong performances and the cinematic language is sublime in some areas which elevates it beyond its issues, at least in my opinion. But again thats the opinion of one who is familiar with Kojima's previous work.

I also think Trump derrangement syndrome has rubbed off on Kojima a little bit and it shows within the themes, which is really weird coming from the guy who wrote MGS2 and pretty much laid out how information manipulation works in the internet age 15 years before it came into full effect, but I digress.

From the mastermind of the Metal Gear Solid series, Death Stranding is a visual and story-driven experience which attempts to relay a message of isolation and connection; as Sam Bridges (a.k.a. Norman Reedus) forges across a post-apocalyptic America to re-connect its people. At it's core, the gameplay is exactly how you've probably heard described; a glorified walking-simulator wherein you as the player is tasked with handling deliveries as you travel from coast-to-coast. Its biggest appeal -and inevitably to some its biggest flaw- is the portrayal of characters and story spread throughout the 35-50 hour main questline. 

Traversal of the multiple region zones which encompass the map is at first barren and daunting, as you are not able to interact with or see other players' constructions as well as having little in the way of equipment. You do receive more benefits as you venture further into both the story and map. However this is the aspect in which I believe Kojima focuses in building the Death Stranding world, as a metaphor to the evolution of social and technological interconnection. The map opens up as you progress and with it, the ease and advantages of having other players support your own gameplay experience via useful constructions like bridges, shelters, zip-lines, or the occasional vehicle and supplies.

The area where Death Stranding really shines is its story-telling elements. From amazing acting from the likes of Mads Mikkelsen, Tommie Earl Jenkins and Troy Baker to name a few, to the insanely creative visual direction, you get the feeling that you are partaking in an interactive movie, and while to some that is not what they expect out of a video-game, it brings into question the idea that games are not only a means to experience entertainment, but also an artistic platform. The audio is sparse throughout, with music only playing during certain moments, but when it does grace you with a song it is not only impactful, but implies the introspection of the journey as a whole.

All in all, this game is not for everyone but for those that appreciate creativity and something different, Death Stranding is one of the most unique experiences out there. The type of story that, at the end of it all, makes you sit and contemplate the glorious absurdity, all the while relishing the moments that brought it together.

No bullets? No problem.  Just throw a smol package into the enemies gut while you sprint up and high-five their faces with your boot.

My only gripe is the game doesn't really start until chapter 3 (i.e. vehicle building).  Not really a negative, but I just spent way too much time in chapters 1 and 2 not knowing this.

39,DEATH STRANDING,73795208,english,"If I'm going to recommend this game for others, I would give mainly 2 reasons but this IMO also rhyme with the game itself, which seemingly consisted of 2 parts.

the first part of the game is a game like Spintires, yes it's weird and not many people know Spintires, it's a game where you drive trucks to transport goods throughout natural landscape, it is the same with this game with the major difference being here you're controlling a human, and the character is the emphasis, in here your character is the one carrying the cargo, here the character is the one getting upgrades and gears etc. Then there's also building gameplay in this game where you build or lay infrastructures so you can have easier time playing the game like putting in ladders, building bridges etc.

The game is also open world where you're being presented with vast open terrain to traverse, pretty standard open world game today with one major difference, here you are in a shared multiplayer world where you may see infrastructures that other players built in their own game, it can certainly come in handy at times so it may encourage you to share your own stuffs too.

that's in general summed up one half or one part of the game, that in itself already offers you a pretty unique game, especially in  AAA landscape... and honestly judging from that alone would make this game on par with other AAA open world titles.

But that's only half of the game, the other half of the game metal gear solid series, with some of the downside, you get get the scifi and supra natural elements to deal with, both in the story and in the gameplay itself, you would get slowly introduced with combat and firearms, you would get some stealth gameplay in this game, the difference with MGS would be that all of this stuffs would not be the focus in this game, it would not be as refined as MGSV but it would still be a nice addition for this game and also give you some unique take on that area.

Now with that being said, the MGS series is legendary because of the story, and I tell you this, death stranding story is better than the best story in any single MGS game story ever had. The story here doesn't get bog down that much by the open world nature of the game unlike say like MGSV, this is also why I said about the game being 2 parts thing, you have to play through it and see it yourself.

To be honest, the story impressed me more than the gameplay, it's HIdeo Kojima at his best here as a such unique artist with little to no equal because almost no one do the same like he does (doing significant works on and resulted in both unique gameplay and unique story at the same time), Kojima deserve an Oscar award for this game, as ridiculous as it sound, IMO it is an Oscar worthy story that hooks you with such intriguing world building and unique characters and their stories filled with metaphors and present you with intriguing story twists over and over again to the end... and you have to see it through the end, you have to experience this story unfolding through the end. If you can, don't spoil yourself by watching the story without playing XD

This game is for getting likes from other players. That dopamine hit when someone appreciates something you did. I built all the roads and pretty much every time the game syncs up, it tells me someone used it. People used my ladders and my zip lines.

56,DEATH STRANDING,72683682,english,"Death Stranding is easily one of the best action games on the PlayStation 4 ecosystem and I'm glad to have finally played it without any spoilers. Walking and delivering packages is a quintessential part of the unique gameplay which I'll add might not be for everyone, but I love it. Hideo Kojima created an odd yet very entertaining story that unfolds well with an ending that was as emotional as Metal Gear Solid 4 Guns of the Patriots. The acting in Death Stranding is on a whole other level and has so much heart that it'll probably stick with you. I cannot speak for everyone, but I can say on the RTX 2060 Super with DLSS Quality never expect to drop below 60 fps. Highly recommend, but know what you're getting into before buying it blindly and not liking what is otherwise a great title!

4K TAA vs 4K DLSS:
All RTX 20 Series GPUs can run this game at 4K 60 frames per second with DLSS 2.0 in either Performance or the higher tier Quality Mode. Even if you can get 60 fps on the 2080 Ti using 4K TAA, Quality Mode looks better and runs way better so you might as well use it. Update to the latest graphics driver otherwise you might experience major performance and graphics related bugs.

57,DEATH STRANDING,73777872,english,"[h1] Introduction [/h1] 

I just want to preface this entire review with the knowledge that I originally played this on the PS4. I am not yet complete with the game on PC but I am far enough into it to know how it handles and I know the entire story from my previous time playing through the game. 

[h1] The Review [/h1]

Before I originally bought Death Stranding, I was nervous. I heard the controversies and I was worried I would find the game too repetitive and boring. I can’t quite remember what changed, but something in me snapped because I went in to Gamestop a week before launch and was able to switch my pre-order to the Collector’s Edition of Death Stranding. 

I will start by saying the opening area of the game (roughly 5-7 hours, can be longer if you try to 100% it at the beginning, which I would say wait until the end [spoiler] because ziplines. [/spoiler] Once the game opens up, and you reach the main area, the game finds it stride. You start unlocking new things that make the game easier, and overall, the game becomes more enjoyable. I think one thing everyone needs to understand when going into this game is that it is not Single Player. If you are not connected to the Internet this game will suffer dramatically. The premise of the game is working together with other people you have never met and never will meet to help achieve a common goal, which is making deliveries. When you first enter an area, you have to suffer through it alone, but once you complete one (sometimes a few more) mission you bring that place “onto the chiral network” which allows you to see what other people have done and use their different items (such as bridges, towers, vehicles, etc.) Playing this game and not trying to work with other people is going to make this game miserable. 

As for the story, From the beginning it is great Kojima, as usual, tells a magnificent story from start to finish. It has twists, some you see coming and some you don’t, and overall a star-studded cast that surprisingly doesn’t hurt it. I was worried that all these actors and directors in real movies would potentially hinder this game because acting for a video game is definitely different than acting in a movie. Alas, the story is one of the best I have experienced, and Kojima sprinkling in music from different bands (Mostly Low Roar) always hits at the right points. 

Speaking of music, the music in this game is some of the best I have ever heard. I instantly fell in love with Silent Poets and Low Roar, two bands I never heard of before this game, and I will always thank Kojima for that. 

All of these praises said, the game is not perfect. I have played most of my time on PC with Mouse and Keyboard, only rebinding a few things to my mouse for ease. I think a controller is much better suited for this game and makes it handle much better. I have decided for the remainder of my playthrough I will be using my PS4 controller, which at times can make your fingers hurt from having to hold L2 and R2 all the time. Another complaint some people may have but wasn’t an issue for me was the fact that the game is repetitive. You are basically a UPS Delivery Man. The whole premise of the game is you delivering packages and if that seems boring, wait for a sale or watch gameplay. 

[h1] Verdict [/h1]

I think this game is hard to say whether you should play it or not. Some people will hate it, while personally it was my Game of the Year for 2019. For me it was one of the best games I have played and the story was thought provoking and felt well written, much like a Tarantino film. I personally find this game to be a 9/10 but if you are iffy watch gameplay. Gameplay is always my go-to on games I am unsure about and if you are unsure watch people playing it. I would recommend Dansgaming or even CohhCarnage. I am sure Cohh’s vods are on Youtube and I believe Dan uploads his to Youtube as well. Dan has actually been playing through the game on PC while Cohh I don’t believe did.

67,DEATH STRANDING,73764586,english,"I'd love to recommend this game, I really would. It's a wonderfully ambient world with lots of storytelling potential clearly visible. That said: a game needs to be more than a good story. At the least, gameplay should be a fluid conduit for the story, something which makes the story work. But here, the gameplay is weirdly grueling in a way that reminds me of old-school boss battles (which I absolutely hate). And that I think that's they key, sort of: the gameplay design is an evolution of the old boss-battle-styled game, with a real story, open world, and rich graphics -- but ultimately it's still that ""mash your button until you escape from the nameless thing trying to eat you"" experience. And that's just not very fun. 

There are also issues with how the plot is structured, too, though, and with how the world is built through the dialogue. Sometimes there are infodumps and sometimes there's no info. There are sequences where the responses of characters are contradictory to what the plot reveals through elaborate cut scenes just a few minutes later. I can see that a great world has been built, that an interesting story exists... but I just don't want to have to fight to experience it. 

Now, in order to get this game back in time for Steam's stupid 2-hour limit I also need to mention: that I had about thirty minutes, total, of actual gameplay in that two hours. The rest is cut scenes or menus. Now, I love rich cut scenes, but this is pushing it -- especially considering some of the issues I've already mentioned. 

This is a neat pointer on the road to new game designs, but it's not the next stage, not yet. I might even be willing to stick it out and purchase again some day if the price drops to, like, $20.

The style, the story, the atmosphere, the acting, etc. It has been a blast to interact with something like this. Elements that you genuinely have never seen before in a game. The themes touched by the story although ridiculous at times are genuinly deep.

The game play however is the main spot light when staring into this new frontier... It's not for everyone, it's chill and grindy 80% of the time delivering packages from point A to Point B. The other 20% is kind of an additional blend of third person shooter and some interesting boss fights, That overall didn't feel as great to myself... more of something I wanted to finish to get back to the core gameplay. However the multiplayer factor of item and structure sharing is phenominal. Most of the game you never really feel alone, you feel that you are a part of the community, you wanna help it cause it also benefits you in character stats reaching an amazing mutual benefit between all players.

83,DEATH STRANDING,73737191,english,"As a huge Kojima/Metal Gear/Zone of the Enders fan it pains me to say that this game is incredibly bad. Like, I'm mortified that people manage to look past all of the bad traits it possesses long enough to enjoy the game and give it 9's and 10's. It is getting a pass because Hideo Kojima has a stellar reputation as a game designer and people treat it as sacrilege to outwardly imply that he can make a mistake, whether purposefully or not. I'm only playing it as much as I am because I'm gathering footage for a YouTube video in which I explain why I hate this game so much. Very interesting way to spend my time, I know.

In Death Stranding, you deliver packages, which isn't inherently bad and could be done interestingly, but the entirety of the game is layers and layers of frustrating, punishing game design.

You manage the durability of your shoes. If your shoes break, you gradually bleed and die. You manage the durability of your packages, if you fall too many times your packages break and can't be used, and if they're a story-relevant package you simply gameover. You have a baby called BB (Bridge Baby) who cries if he's submerged in water or if you spend too much time around BTs (Beached Things; very clever acronym). BTs will often be in your way when trying to get to a plot-relevant destination, and unless you just rush through it and risk getting attacked by the BTs (I'm going to call them ghosts) your BB WILL ""die,"" which the game tries to make you think is a big deal because you won't be able to see ghosts, but it has no bearing on gameplay because you just crouch and hold your breath and the ghosts won't bother you, especially since your scanner/radar thing can point them out anyway and you have 90% as much intel about ghosts whether BB is alive or not. He cries a lot, and you're meant to cradle him to calm him down and restore his health, which can take a minute or two depending on how low his health is. The game consistently and frequently manipulates you to think BB is adorable despite giving Sam multiple nightmares (one of which involves him BASHING his head into his glass tank and breaking the glass before reaching for Sam, and another involves him turning around suddenly before it's revealed that he has Guillermo Del Toro's face) and being a giant pain in the ass.

Enemies known as MULEs (deranged Amazon postal workers who attack you and steal your packages) will obstruct your progress and swarm you with electronic spears (?) but won't actually kill you. They'll just knock your packages off of your back and attempt to steal them. If they hit you enough times they'll knock you out and you'll wake up with no packages. Ghosts will grab you with tar ghosts that emerge from the ground and drag you a mile away and force you to fight a ghost whale which can charge you and kill you, thus triggering a ""voidout"" which destroys all of your packages and leaves a gigantic 500-foot crater (but clears out BTs which is actually a good thing, since BTs will harass you every time you pass through that area and a voidout gives you a straight path). There's a lot of emphasis on packages being EXTREMELY important, but since you can re-deploy quest packages and material resources are extremely common, it simply serves as an opportunity cost, aka you just waste time as you have to go back and do it again. There is no tension aside from the feeling of ""I really don't wanna run all the way back to the base again.""

The game encourages you to build drop boxes, generators (everything is battery-operated, so your motorcycle dies if you don't recharge it soon enough and you have to abandon it), ziplines, and most commonly, bridges. These require you to lug material like metal, resin, ceramic, and special alloy back and forth to build and upgrade them. Bridges let you traverse over the terribly-designed terrain (which is just rocks, dirt and rivers that make using vehicles an absolute nightmare to the point where you're forced to abandon them and go on-foot) and effectively let you circumvent the core gameplay. You hate navigating a giant field of rocks with 1 foot of space between each individual rock? Build a bridge and just avoid them! You hate slowly climbing up snowy mountains? Just build a zipline and fly over them!

Instead of making a fun game, they decide to make a really obnoxious and tedious game and later give you tools to mitigate the tedium. These are not mutually exclusive design templates.

Every time you find something fun, it punishes you. You decide to kill enemies? Too bad, we don't want you to do that. You have to now go on an errand to cremate the bodies because if you don't they'll cause a giant explosion that literally ends the game. You enjoy going fast on your bike and launching off of ramps? Sorry, your bike has durability and if you do it too much your bike will break and you'll have to continue on foot.

There's a lot of time wasted. If you spend too much time out in the world (~30 minutes) your maximum stamina reduces. It would be one thing if your stamina simply affected your ability to sprint, but Sam will literally stop everything and kneel over if you get down to 1 Stamina Bar (there are 4 total by default) even if enemies are nearby. You can restore your stamina (but not your max stamina) by drinking Monster Energy or by sitting down and stretching/sleeping. This takes about 3 minutes of real life time on average, which was probably a design decision made by Hideo Kojima who suffers from motion sickness and constantly prompts players to take a break from the game ever since Metal Gear Solid 4 reminded players to play in short bursts with tips during loading screens. He made it a punishment if you decide to play for long stretches of time without returning to a rest base.

The entire cast is unlikeable. Norman Reedus plays Sam ""Porter"" Bridges who is a Repatriate (a person who revives after death and whose poop/pee/blood can be used as weapons against ghosts) and has a symptom called ""DOOMS"" which means he has allergies and cries when he senses chiralium (which is a thing in the air I guess). DOOMS also makes people sensitive to touch, apparently, because Kojima made Death Stranding to be all about connecting people and breaking down barriers and rebuilding society. He literally doesn't try to be subtle with his political message, as ""The Elder,"" an old man you help who lives in a mountain, will send you an email talking about old America where he talks about ""a black man and a woman were given the chance to be president,” and mentions ""a man who wanted to build a literal wall around America."" Bruh.

Solid Snake and Big Boss were interesting, cool, complex characters with an extensive backstory. Sam Bridges is a grump who tells everyone to f*ck off and mumbles and refuses to open himself up to anyone so he can eventually experience an ""arc"" where he opens up and makes friends with people (building bridges: get it?).

A man named Heartman uses a defibrillator to stop his heart every 21 minutes so he can visit his dead wife and daughter on the ""beach,"" an artsy metaphor for limbo, confusingly referred to as a ""multiverse."" He does this 60 times a day. He lives on a lake in the shape of a heart. Sam's middle name is Porter because he's a transporter of packages. His last name is Bridges because he builds bridges (literally within the context of the game mechanics and figuratively in the sense of re-unifying society).

Kojima is a goofball and it's part of the charm of his often silly games, but this time around we get to see what he's capable of when he has no one standing behind him to slap the keyboard out of his hand. He’s a man who has seen nothing but immense success over the last 20 years and this game is the end-product designed by a man who VERY clearly forgot that it's possible for him to fail.

It may be repetitive, but so are the Doom games. You just go about killing demons over and over again. Doesn't mean its not fun though. You can always find new strategies to kill them, and conversely they may do the same to you.

The same goes for death stranding except its much slower paced (may be a turn off for some), and rather than killing demons (although you can somewhat do that in death stranding as well) you deliver packages.
You discover new paths, strategies, uses of items, and much more. You should always experiment and mix up how you go about deliveries. 

A very disagreeable criticism about the game is that the world is not detailed enough. The world is packed with interesting and unique geographical features, camps/shelters, and all manner of distinctive areas. The game is intentionally vast and at times seemingly empty. One, because you're supposed to travel long distances, and long untrodden paths and feel it. And two, because the world is dynamic and changes with your own actions and those of your fellow players. Changes can certainly be witnessed, and if they are not you can be the change that you want to be.

I must reiterate though, that this game is not for everyone and disliking it is understandable even for Kojima fans as it isn't like his other games in most aspects.

Let me preface this with, if you think the gameplay itself doesn't look like something you will like you will most likely have a hard time getting through the game. I really think this game is either a love it or hate it type of game which is why there are very mixed reviews.

I found the gameplay to be relaxing and very enjoyable. The graphics were some of the prettiest i have seen in any game period. The way you unlock additional tools/weapons as you do main story and side missions felt like really good progression as well. Working together with other players and being able to benefit from their created structures, help construct them, and construct your own structures for yourself and others to use was a very cool concept as well and worked well in conjunction with the story of ""connecting America"" again. 

The story was amazing. I am not one who usually is super interested in stories but this one had me absolutely hooked. Usually i cant wait for cut scenes to be done or skip them but in Death Stranding i was excited to get to my next checkpoint so i could see the next scene. Keeps you guessing the whole way through and then they tie everything together in the end. A very unique game both in gameplay and story. Very original and one of a kind. 

Between the gameplay that i quite enjoyed and the story itself which was one of the best i have experienced i would venture to say this is my most favorite game i have ever played.

   When facing human enemies, the game become action game.
+ The music!

- Repetitive gameplay. In case you hate doing the same thing all over the game

53,DEATH STRANDING,73703289,english,"This game has great graphics thanks to photoscan assets and good modeling. But it is far from a perfect game.
It has great entertainment value. You can get around 40h of gameplay at least. And much more if you wish to continue after the end.

The environment design is great, with nice landscape and original terrain to parkour through. You are given small challenges to overcome the environment while trying to preserve your cargo in good shape or not to loose it.

The graphics of the game are not that heavy, the game runs smoothly, can be a bit taxing for a quadcore CPU.
Do use an SSD it help a lot for load times.

The sound design is excellent, but beware if you decide to stream the game or put playthrough. All of them are copyrighted and it is easy to get a claim or a strike. Better mute all of them or replace them with some copyright free ones.
The sound convey really well the mood of the game, the situation.

It doesn't feature better higher graphics then the console, but features better frame rate. There is no support for true 4k graphics, nor raytracing features but that isn't a big loss as the game is well crafted to not need it and not suffer a performance hit. But it would have been an added value to have it for better visual to enhance the horror of the BTs and flashbacks.
The motion capture and facial expressions feels very stiff and still lack life in it. Sam porter emotion at least are superbe. The rest of the crew is a pass. You won't see much NPC, the world when playing offline feels tremendously empty. Connecting to the internet really adds a value to the open world concept. seeing path and environment change or assets left by other players make you feel less alone when doing your task. This concept of sharing same assets and worlds is really an amazing and well executed concept.

Story wise, nothing was mindblowing for me as the game progress in a linear way, there is no alternative endings. But one well done ending that doesn't leave you with a bad taste (MGTPP). Metaphores and analogy are really blatant and put into your face (see my joke?). But nothing mind blowing and concept breaking in story telling. I did find it a bit annoying how sometimes it had a pretentious tone to it. Anyway, you will surely enjoy it as a good movie but it wont be for me an unforgettable experience.
Some cringe worthy moment and dragging moment can be tiring during cinematic. Like some nonsensical, illogical, irrational behavior from the character narrative. I sometimes got really bored from those antics and how blatant they were.

You play as a porter, concept that actually exist in multiple countries but quite frankly unknown by many western countries.
It is like a porter simulator, micro managing your cargo, your delivery priority, your weights, your tools that you will bring with you. You are given some minor obstacle that can be easily overcome. All depends how you decide to tackle a problem. Do you go through a Mule/terrorist territory or BT territory or decide to take a slightly longer path or more challenging one.
If you focus early on the game with deliveries you will get spoil as it will make the game easier. If you speed run you will not get any bonuses and wont be able to get items that makes your life easier (until you find them on the floor left by other players)

It is easy to get knocked out in game, but hard to die. You will have to try hard to fail a delivery, to die or screw up completely.
This game like many Kojima games is against killing, and will penalize you heavily for doing so. So avoid at all cost from going on a killing spree.
AI is very predictable and its actually good for those having a hard time to learn a pattern. This is plainly obvious and easy.
It can be seen as helpful for those having difficulties or very easy and lacking challenge for those hard player mode people.

Do note that the game suffer some input lag sometimes and car physics are a bit on the weightless side. easy to tumble your car. Beware on switching from running to walking on mountains slopes as the input lag can send you flying.

All in all, if you are in search of an excellent visual and sound design porter simulator with a minor horror twist. This game is for you. You choose whether you deliver packages like Feded, UPS, IMS or whatever.

63,DEATH STRANDING,73695561,english,"As of this moment i have played the game for 114 hours and i am close to 100%. I truly experienced everything this game has to offer. Anyone that is familiar with Kojima knows what to expect from this, its a very similar game to The phantom pain. It uses a lot of similar systems that TPP had and you can say that the way the story is delivered is the same. 

First of all graphicly the game looks great, it wont blow your mind with the visuals but it looks nice and has nice scenery to acompany that. The port is great you can play the game with both a controller and a k&m, personally i used a controler and i did encounter some bugs with it. Sometimes it would register the latest action i did onto the movement stick. So for example you decide to exit the bike and you instantly press forward to move but instead of moving it jumps on the bike again, that happened a lot, and i am not sure if its a controler issue or a game bug. Personally i would say its the game, it seemed too specific and happened with different buttons to be a controller thing. WIth that said even if it was annoying it was easy to avoid it so it didnt ruin the game for me. Now perfomance wise it run well on, i have an i5 6600 and a gtx 970, the game run at 60fps at 1080p with occasional frame drops but nothing major or annoying. The graphic options were a mix of very high and medium, i saw the digitalfoundry video and decided with what to tweek, but i would say even if you were to play this on all low options it would still look good.

Now secondly we are going to talk about the gameplay. A lot of people will label this as a walking simulator but its farm from it, the gameplay consists of 3 aspects combat, delivery missions and stealth. There some combat sequances and some enemy camps you can go and clear out, it feels good but its clear that this wasnt the focus of the game. The stealth is a step down from TPP and is there to help the story and world building more than it is as a gameplay mechanic. And lastly the transfers, this is were you gonna spend most of your time. The game basicly is this, getting cargo and delivering it from A to B, you choose the route, the medium and your equipement. It starts slow and clanky but once you get used to it and get some equipement it changes completly, suprisingly its rather addictive and fun, i dont know why but it feels that way. This deliveries dont remain the same, as i said once you unlock new tools the game changes. At the start you walk its slow and can be annoying, the you get a bike and you see the light. Delieveries that would have taken you 20min take you 3. Then you get the car and from speed you go to cargo load, you were transfering 100kilos with your feet now you carry 1 ton. Then you get a drone to help you out and you can carry on foot even more. And lastly you get a zipline and build your own system of fast transportation. Each of those items changes the gameplay drasticly, add that along with the change of scenery the game feels fresh and interesting through the ride. I would say the gameplay is the strongest part of the game. Also you would spend some of your time in your private room, you can avoid this completly.

Thirdly we have the world building, its done by 4 means. Now this is the part of the game i have the most issues with. The story gives you hints about what happened but its so rare and small that if you were to ignore all other aspects you would be completly lost. The emails are what people you help sent you, 99% of them are completly useless, and if you said to me they were writen by the same person i would believe you. You see this game is about connecting people, but every person you interact with and connect is a robot, with no personality or story. Out of all the npcs you meat the one with the most character is Connan o'brien, imagine that. All of them are definied by what they are, for example, one of them is a film director, what is his character? He likes films, thats all there is to it. So they send you all those emails talking about 3 things, they just love being alone in their shetler( not major differences in this part, they just chose to), they hate USA, they dont hate USA. Its insane, i would make a few deliveries and recieve 2 emails from one of them. So i go and check them and it would be like this, email 1 : Oh i hate america i would never join you, email 2 : I will join you, i will give america a try. And then after they join the send you a third email saying that america rules, thats all there is to it. And its basicly done withing 30minutes of gameplay. It felt so stupid, so by the mid game i just didnt give a fuck about anyone of them, they had nothing to offer. Even if you were to remove them from the game nothing would change. Its a huge missed oportunity to have some actually story there to make feel like you want to connect with them, but there isnt one. Personaly i would read only the yellow parts in emails, everything else is garbage. Then you have the interviews, the interviews are basicly the casette tapes from TPP, but not voice acted, so thats a step down for no reason other than to save budge i would say. Here you get the most character and world building, you should read these since they contain critical information. I find really stupid that this is the way the try to pass on story, i will give you an example. The protagonist is a blank slate, you dont know shit for him. At some point you get some interviews about his family and you read them and it gives you some context. Those interviews would have been much better if it was a cutscene mid game showing what the character went throught... On top of that you dont get all the interviews for this particular subject unless you complete some specific deliveries that dont appear unless you do something else specific. I havent figured out what that is, and youtube didnt help. So the story is intentionaly impossible to get, i dont know why they put so many walls to hide it but its a terrible idea. The game would have been much better if they showed some stuff in cutscenes or even in tapes... You also get some world building from the scenery but not much, its empy mostly.

The fourth part of this review is about they story. The story is interesting i wont say much to avoid spoilers, but its a unique concept that i personally thing has a few plot holes and can be a bit pretentious at times. The main cast of the story is mostly amazing, great perfomances and animation all around. And some character specific storylines are great. Now the main issue with the story is the pacing, now as i mentioned i played this game for 110 hours, i actually did whatever they asked you to do. But if you play the game like that you ruin the pacing. You see the story is split like this, you see 10% at the start of the game, 15% during the gameplay and 75% at the end. So out of the 110 hours i playd, the 85 hours had minimal story, so i felt completly blind for the majority of the game, only to get everything together at the end. This would have been easily fixed with what i mentioned about the npc and the interviews. That also creates another problem, since you dont see those characters often you dont create a connection with them, so you saw a character and their story at the first episode and then dont hear about them until the end. There is only one exception to this, and thats mads character, because you get glimmpses of his story through out the game.

Lastly the conclusion about the game, i would say its worth playing and its a game with unique enough game that i doubt you will ever get another similar experience. I am glad he was able to make a game like this. But it has many issues, issues that were part of TPP.

The game has a fascinating story set in a post-apocalyptic world, with intriguing characters and enemy concept. The music selection is top notch, the cinematics were all beautifully put together and the voice acting superb. 

The quests however are repetitive and for the most part boring. Some of the quests were completely ridiculous towards the end of the game. Traverse for hours to reach your destination, only to pick up another quest at the final location which tells you to return to the same location you originally started from. Boring, absurd, and at times infuriating. The BT's (enemies) carried mystique and were interesting foes at the beginning of the game. Similar to the quest design of the game, these enemies that you would encounter throughout the world became more of an annoying nuisance than anything and encountering them just became irritating. 

I'm not a Kojima fanboy, but I didn't hate the game either. Just giving my honest review. Overall, I'd rate this game a 5/10.

69,DEATH STRANDING,73672534,english,"I'm not one to write reviews, but the sheer variety of emotions I've felt since starting this game have compelled me to share my thoughts.

I'll begin with my major criticism: the game's narrative is terrible. Now, I don't mean the story itself, melodramatic and indulgent though it consistently is; there's more than enough imagination in this story's construction to find reasons to forgive some of the more egregious Kojima-isms. However, the actual delivery of the plot is appalling. I'm a patient guy who'll wilfully sit through 5+ hour-long pretentious arthouse movies, but Death Stranding broke me. The dialogue was interminable. Every aspect of the story was overlaid with three times as much detail as it needed, mostly through tedious, unskippable monologues. I began to literally groan when a character would declare ""Wait - I need to tell you something"". What should have been the game's most climactic moments I experienced through a minimised tab - I'd just got so bored of the overwrought exposition that any emotional impact had long since been lost. 

It's a real shame as the early hours found me excited to unpick the mystery of the world that I'd found myself in. By the end, I simply had enough of it; I wanted the mystery to be over and done with so I could go back to actually having fun. Prior to Episode 9, I was having a blast. I loved the core gameplay mechanic of the actual delivering, and had been very impressed with how the game subtly increased the challenge as you progressed. Just as I started getting cocky with my level 3 trucks and shiny new super-highway, the game's focus shifted to the mountains where I was taught an abrupt lesson in humility by the elements. It was fantastic, and I really hadn't played anything like it before. There was an authentic sense of adventure to the missions, a goal so easily missed in other open world games.

But as the story got heavier, the game became less and less fun to play. I want to avoid spoilers, so I'll just say this: reaching the West Coast was a huge disappointment and things never really picked up again from that point on. Any other gripes that I have pale in comparison to this: the game's script needs some brutal editing. There is really no excuse for a story to be told this badly.

Despite all of the above, I do recommend it. The early game strikes a perfect blend of wonder and horror and I'll forever remember my first time getting caught by a BT as one of the most thrillingly horrible experiences I've had in a video game. As you learn the ropes the game transforms into something genuinely original, at times exhilarating and at others entrancing. I did not find the delivering aspect of the game boring at all, although this seems to be a common criticism. The game can be frustrating, but more often than not the player brings those frustrations on themselves due to bad decisions - as irritating as it was to lose a truckload of ceramics, I had to admit that trying to drive top speed across a deep, fast flowing river may not have been my best-laid plan.

Flawed is an understatement, but there is something excellent at the heart of Death Stranding. You just have to remind yourself of that as you wade through the atrocious storytelling.",1596402137,1596447650,TRUE,1,0,0.502739131,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,23,1,4917,0,4802,1596652916,,

 Were the reviews right, was it actually boring, did Kojima fail his fans.  I nervously bought the game since I loved MG5 so much and waited with baited breath.  After about 40 hours of play so far I'll say I really enjoy this game.  Yes its a walking simulator but that's the point.  This game breaks down modern gaming into its most fundamental form.  Most adventure games today are essentially walking around on a map collecting and delivering packages in one way or another.  They cut the bullshit and serve that straight up and execute at an extremely high level.  Itemization is fun, planning routes is fun, encountering new obstacles is fun, and the innovative online concept is fun.  The online concept is that other players can leave objects on the map that will help you complete missions, you can also leave objects, you can also like other players' objects and they collect those likes which gives them titles and upgrades, you also collect the likes for upgrades.  Its a really fun and engaging progression that is clearly well thought out.  The mechanic itself is poetic and artful which you never see in gaming today or in culture at large.  The game feels lonely but the online element makes simple abstract social interactions that much more intimate.  I find myself wondering what the guy who liked my ladder is like, who walked over those roads I rebuilt, and if anyone ever will use the first rope I ever put out.

[b] Walking Simulator? [/b]
First, let's address the idea that it's a ""walking simulator"". The core gameplay element is deliveries. This is irrefutable. Many people get an hour or two into the first area and throw in the towel there. At this point, Sam struggles to carry 50kg and every step can feel like a balancing act. BTs feel like these insurmountable obstacles and even MULEs are this overwhelming threat.

However, as Sam does deliveries, he gets stronger. He can carry more, has better endurance, better balance, etc. On top of this, he gets more gadgets. Floating carriers, exoskeletons bolstering his strength (immensely), speed, and balancing abilities. Vehicles, the ability to build roads, and even crazier abilities.

The delivery aspect becomes less of a ""walking simulator"" and more of an optimizer. If you put forth the effort, you will reach a point where deliveries are somewhat of an auto-pilot and only as difficult as you want them to be.  There is an excellent sense of progression in Sam's arsenal and abilities.

[b] More than a walking simulator, combat [/b]
But the game is MORE than just a walking/delivery simulator. BTs and MULEs are your main threat. Early on (the first area), your focus is on avoiding BTs and MULEs. But as you go on, your arsenal expands... considerably. My math isn't perfect, but you get at least 9 weapons to combat BTs and MULEs. This is not counting different levels or the distinction between non-lethal and lethal. If you do that, it ends up being somewhere around 25-30. The point is, you get options to fight.

One of the first real combat encounters is experienced towards the end of the first area. It is a beautiful cinematic experience that I won't spoil. The problem is that most people get put off by the tutorial of the first area that they never make it this far, and are left saying ""oh it's just a walking simulator"". The game has multiple mandatory (most of which are very cool) combat sequences, and you are decently rewarded for clearing out MULE camps or fighting BT areas. While this doesn't have incredibly polished combat, it works for the most part and is satisfying.

[b] The visuals and aesthetics are beyond insane [/b]
I won't go into details here, because it's some spoilers, but the world is beautifully designed. Most of the encounters and locales are beautiful, and there are a few... interesting areas you wouldn't expect.

[b] The story, cutscenes, and acting are Kojima at his finest, and breathtaking [/b]
Kojima spared no expense for this game. The story is nuts, but not arbitrarily so. It all makes sense once you get there. It isn't left permanently shrouded, but you won't understand it until the end. And the cutscenes along the way put movies to shame. All of the actors/tresses get into their roles. The scanning and acting are absurdly high quality. Tommy Earl Jenkins and Mads Mikkelson have absolutely stellar points. I always thought it was a shame that Konami cut Phantom Pain short. It's beautiful to see Kojima actually having freedom to do what he wants.

[b] The OST is perfect [/b]
Occasionally, a scripted song will play as you are on a mandatory delivery. I can't say anything other than it's always perfection.

[b] The ""multiplayer"" exists, but it doesn't really make or break much [/b]
You'll frequently come across things other people have built. They generally don't fit in your agenda or plan for the world, but it's nice when they do. It's more of a nice touch than a huge pull to the game.

[b] Overall, this game is like a 9.8/10for me [/b]
The only real issue being some occasionally wonky controls, but they don't do much to diminish the game even then.

I highly recommend this game. But if you do play it, make sure you at least make it to the second area.",1596383951,1596383970,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,324,2,3766,0,3766,1596382091,,

Also, don't play this game if you're creeped out by creepy babies.
Or ghosts.
Or heights.
Or interdimensional shamblers.
Or fish.

No spoilers:
It's about this guy (you - also Norman Reedus) that can't die. Which comes in handy when you're running around as the only courier delivering EVERYTHING in post apocalyptic America.
Once you agree to be the only one that can save (this part of) the world by hooking everyone up to the internet from outer space, you get to run around delivering stuff to .. yeah well just about everyone you meet. Which makes people like you and they give you stuff to help you get around. Like a new backpack, better shoes, the plans for constructing powered ziplines, a death-navigating baby or a cool motorcycle. You know. Regular stuff. 

As you progress through the game you'll unlock more stuff, more vehicles, more zones to run around in and more monsties. The monsties are a kind of ghosts that are tethered to this world and want to hook up. But not in a good way. They're kind of clingy and once they get a hold of you they drag you away to a tarry pit with more bigger monsties. 
Don't. Die. Here. 
The thing is when you die from falling off a cliff or drowning or getting shot or whatever, you float back to your body and get to go again. No harm done. Just some lost cargo and a lot of time. But if you get eaten by the big monsties... KABOOM. Crater time! Anyway, try (not) to find out.

The only downside for me are the cutscenes. Not the storyline movies those are great. But every time you enter your room or get something from a warehouse or deliver a package it's the same cutscene. Sure you can skip it afer the first couple times but still. I find them annoying. 

About the storyline movies: there's tons of them. All with famous people and they're great. There's an entire movie waiting in between deliveries.

The worst bane is the UX: you have to navigate through numerous menus and watch the same cut-scene a plethora of times. I feel like 10% of play time was spent on these.

The plot was promising at the beginning though: it had those cool invisible creatures, weird weather mechanic etc, but in the end everything turns out to be total boloney. The ideas they put into the game make no sense. I don't sympathise the characters at all; they are constantly crying for some reason; in this cruel world they behave like 14year old teenage girls; all they care about is some useless emotional and esoteric stuff.

The storyline is bland and not engaging in the slightest. 
Some boss battles are not challenging enough (played on very hard mode) sometimes I found myself able to simply evade the giant BT's by walking until I reached the edge of the arena and they disappeared.
Other boss battles are utterly boring, giant health bar, the same movement pattern, all you must do is collect ammo and attack. The fact that you can come back to life after dying (in most encounters) takes away any tenseness these battles could have had.
Some weapons/items have next to no use, the sticky gun, smoke grenade, decoy cargo etc

The soundtrack of the game (the actual soundtrack, not the music that the game forces you to listen to in order to try to instil some kind of ambient feeling to your journey) is instantly forgettable and didn't grab me in the way that metal gear solid or zone of the enders OST's did.
The ending of the game was a bit drawn out. The unnecessary plot twists don't add anything and feel like they were done just for a bit of extra shock value.

All in all, I found this game to be a waste of time and money. Kojima should have stuck with what he does best (metal gear solid style) instead of making death stranding.
Sadly, because of this game, I will think long and hard before I buy another game made by Kojima productions.

Hold off if you are expecting MGS. If you do like exploration, slow progress and a story driven game, then it might be for you.

edit : 

I thought I'd add my final input after 56 hours of gameplay. 
I mostly stand behind what I said. I had only two major issues through out the game :
1 - The final chapters are way too linear and filled with almost an hour  worth of cutscenes. So you kind of watch more than you play which is never a good thing for any game. You have to play the game. Considering how amazing the gameplay itself is, it was a huge downer for me. 
2 - The exploration is story driven. Meaning if you stumble upon a node/terminal the chances are you won't be able to interract with it unless the story has taken you there. So at times I felt like my exploration efforts were not rewarded, and almost punished. It is not something that happens frequently because the story forces you to explore, so it isn't a huge deal but still worth mentioning.

Of course, that's a true statement for any game, but this one will be more divisive than most. I'll try to explain:

This isn't an action game. There are action elements, with new approaches to battle unlocked as the game progresses, but you can avoid most conflicts to the point where they do not occur often at all. Some have described the game as a ""walking simulator."" I feel you have to ignore a lot of what the game has to offer if that's your takeaway, but it's not -too- far from the truth.

So what do you do? You walk. A lot. At least, you do at first. You make deliveries by getting from point A to point B. That, essentially, is the core of the game. Should you choose to do so, you can try to unlock and use vehicles. Build roads to make the journeys easier. Meet and learn the stories behind a number of characters, and read a deep and sometimes confusing backstory as to how the world got to be the wasteland it currently is.

You could take on the most basic missions and rush through the game, or you can relax and take your time and learn more about what's going on around you.

It's weird. It's sometimes confusing. For me, though, I kept wanting to find out more. It felt rewarding to finally get the necessary materials to build a structure in a key location, and watch as other players leave ""likes"" (which you then use to ""level up"") on any that they find useful.

Ill admit, maybe the first 2 hours are, but thats before they give you vehicles to use and drive, which really isnt long. Theres 3 things that make this game just... so great

The Graphics/Physics/Mechanics
Theres was maybe 2 times something weird happened... a truck got stuck on a rock, and my game crashed loading a boss. Other than that, the game is BEAUTIFUL and runs smooth, just look online and find a cutscene. The tripping/stability mechanic for rocks, and slants works wonders, and its pretty reasonable when it comes to balance. Carrying a lot and turn around quickly? You stumble. Carrying a lot of stuff? Hit a roof and it falls off. Its the small stuff that gets you, cause it all just runs perfectly together


The Story
Man.. this game isnt as easy as ""go across the US, kill bad guy, yay you did it!"" the entire last 2 chapters (of 13) are almost all cutscenes, just DETAILING and EXPLAINING stuff, connecting and making sense of the 40 (in my case) hours you put playing this game, why this person did this or why they are how they are. Plus the twists all the way inbetween, I'd sit here and gasp at some stuff, like ""oh my god thats him!"" or just be shocked at what I was presented

The Music
Now, this seems minor, but the soundtrack for this game is unique. Of course anything made has its use, but the music in this just.... hits; it knows just when to kick on, and complete the scene. Whether emerging after a nap in your room, driving through a desolate valley, sneaking past BTs or that final delivery, people who played know what I mean. It just creeps on you and gives that extra bump or tension needed to make the feeling alive

This game is a masterpiece visually, gameplay-wise and story-wise. Combined with Soundtrack from Low Roar and other musicians the travels through rough terrain are very enjoyable, which I initially was skeptical about if I would enjoy the whole delivery aspect of the game.

The game itself has ""connections"" or ""strands"" as a overall theme. Connecting people, players and npcs alike, to build up a broken society. On the note of players, I love how you can encounter other player structures and use them to traverse through the world as well as make your own structures to help other players (I spent an embarrassing amount on building roads, but in the end it was very worth it).

And then, there is the end. Without spoiling anything, it is one of the greatest endings in a video game I have experienced in a long time. If you are curious what the other game was that made me cry, it was Mother 3... yes it's on that level.

[b]What. A. Game.[/b]

[h1]Story: 10/10[/h1]
The story is absolute class, which is something I’ve already come to expect from a Kojima Game. Having played Metal Gear and really liking the settings and stories used there, I knew this would be no different and I was not wrong. Kojima always manages to create story’s which start with the player gaining about 100 different questions in the space of 20-30 minuets and then slowly unravel as you progress which is always immensely satisfying at the end, once everything is revealed and the puzzle pieces start fitting together. This game has exactly that, which was already evident from the trailer. I loved all of it, from the premise of the Death Stranding to the people who you meet in the world. Of particular importance was Mads Mikkelsen’s character and story arc which I thought was phenomenal throughout and loved every scene he was in. I also enjoyed Heartman and thought his story and input were great, quirky, and added some light humour which I thought worked well.

[h1]Gameplay: 10/10[/h1]
Well, this one was always going to be hit and miss depending on the player. The deliveries never felt like boring fetch quests for me which was brilliant as it kept me immersed and a big part of that was the environmental setting which amazing. I loved evading or even fighting the BT’s which always added a sense of fear to the gameplay and was very welcome. Having the correct loadout and weight distribution for making trips also added to the sense of achievement I felt when I made a delivery and therefore, I never felt the task was boring or worthless. The MULES were also another great addition, providing a human NPC for me to either evade or attack and helped mix up gameplay and kept things fresh.

[h1]Soundtrack: 10/10[/h1]
Again, Kojima has a great taste in music and always manages to fit the right tune in at the right moment. Music always has the chance to really make or break game and for this, it worked perfectly. From action scenes to the cut scenes I really rated it and it adds to everything.

[h1]Graphics: 10/10[/h1]
Pretty outstanding graphics and I was able to run this at a solid frame rate (120-130fps) on max settings (Spec in profile). You have the option of enabling DLSS 2.0 if you own a Nvidia RTX card, but I did not need to enable it. I encountered no graphical glitches and no crashes so full points here.

[h1]Overall Score (in my own opinion): 10/10[/h1]
 I liked every scene in this game and had no complaints. Again, to reiterate, this is my opinion. We are all different and, in my case, I loved making deliveries and I especially loved the story and its cutscenes. I really cannot wait to see what game Kojima comes out with next.

[b] My Experience [/b]

So, I have not played this game for too long, nor did I really hear too much about it before hand. This gave me the rare opportunity to be able to start this bad boy up without any expectations, and with a sense of wonder that has been missing since the overwhelming amount of information that is usually spoiled by social media and other platforms. Now, many people know about the man, Hideo Kojima. What [i] I knew [/i] about him was that he worked primarily on the Metal Gear series - before all the hub ub went down with Konami. Regardless of what or how you may feel about that whole [i] thing [/i], the man is damn talented, and a great writer.

For the entire time I played (I know, not very long) I was completely immersed. It played less like a video game, and more like a hybrid between a game and movie. The cut scenes, story - all had me thinking that I was literally another person tagging along for the ride on Sam's journey.

It pains me to say, but obviously there is no such thing as a ""perfect"" video game - due to individual tastes, failed programming, poor engines, bad designs, and subjective perspectives, but I dare say this title comes just about as close to perfect as you can get.

- Awesome graphics - even my potato made it look good.
- Almost zero lag/hang ups - usually only when I'd rocket into a settlement too fast.
- Story is completely immersive.
- Music suits the moods offered by the game.
- Just the right amount of RPG elements.
- Makes time just whizz right by.
- Most important of all - it's damn fun.

The Meh;
- Can become tedious
- Something other than delivery quests would be nice, like go eradicate a BT territory, for example.
- Equipment interface and switching is a bit clunky.

The Bad;
- Controls are a little wonky, not unplayable, just feels like Sam is drunk.
- Vehicle controls, namely steering, is friggin hard to get used to.
- A pebble beside a stream can bring your reverse trike to a dead stop...

[b] Overall Impressions and Analysis [/b]

A very good game, worthy of being called a triple A title. The small things that made up my ""Meh"" and ""Bad"" lists are quite minor - really only annoyances, and not game breaking at all. As I continue to play, and unlock more of the game, I will update this review. I know that there is a whole lot that I haven't uncovered just yet, but I was so impressed by the first 5 hours of play that I had to put this review up.

The lore of Death Stranding is based on the real world, but in that regard, it makes almost no sense, its full of holes and it needlessly rewrites history for some reason, just for... what even? It's unnecessary and feels like an excuse to spout utter nonsense exposition at the player, through characters who seem like they're just Hideo Kojima wearing a mask, and not a believable human character. The story, though.. when the game isn't expositing garbage, is amazing, and surprisingly compelling. Its what ties the game together, and the game is trying to contextualise is so unusual and different, so the story HAD to be good. Sam is believable, and the people the game surrounds him with are believable as well, almost to a fault. They're so real, that just like real people, you'll only ever want to watch their cutscenes once. They're so awkward. They're uncomfortably real. Whenever the characters aren't... talking like they're reading a script it really is like they're just real people and i love/hate it? it's compliated. Except for Clifford, he's beautiful and I wanna watch him over and over again.

But the story is good and that's all there really is to say, so what about the game? Well, from my point of view, its incredible. Aside from a moment at the end of the game, on a beach, you know the one. but that's like 20 excruciating minutes on a beach among a 40 hour sea of utterly compelling environments, gameplay and systems. The story? I had to watch a 7 hour analysis/commentary to understand it. But the gameplay? I understood it the moment i took the first step. I want to say more, but I'm no critic, this is a game you have to experience. if you don't feel good within the first two hours, you can refund it knowing the game isnt for you. But if you enjoy those first hours like I did, stick with it, 40, 50, a hundred hours, whatever. I plan to go back and play more of this game, just spend time in it's world in it's never ending end game, to help other porters through their adventures, to give likes, to make deliveries..yeah, I think I like this game.
I discussed lore and other nonsense for hours after the credits rolled with my girlfriend, the only other games which have really compelled me to do that are Final Fantasy 14, Xenoblade and Fire Emblem.

56,DEATH STRANDING,73594431,english,"Note: I played the game start to finish on ""Very Hard"" difficulty. 

This game is one of a kind. The main gameplay is fun, delivering packages sounds boring, but when you actually get into it and play it, the numerous threats that oppose you add for a challenging, yet fun, experience. It is extremely rewarding and satisfying to take on a delivery with a massive capacity that you can just barely carry to its destination. You start off as just a person in an unfair environment, but as the game progresses, you begin to unlock new items and tools to make the game just a little bit easier to traverse. This pacing makes upgrades seem very valuable. Although it was on the highest difficulty, I still found myself racking up S - rated scores for deliveries.

What really helps the gameplay set in is the graphics. This game is absolutely gorgeous. The game will also play certain tracks of music during specific times in the game which leads to very emotional moments. One of my biggest moments of pure awe was at the very beginning, and that set the tone for the rest of the game

The story is phenomenal, if confusing at times. However, there are numerous pieces of lore available to the player that they can view at any time to help fill them in. I played the whole game without looking at any bonus lore and I still understood the story. The characters are likable and show a different viewpoint on the world as a whole. The game remains very self aware of its mechanics, and characters can be seen following the rules of mechanics in the game in cutscenes, adding to overall world building.

My only gripe with this game is the combat. The combat is very bad. The combat is so bad, that I avoided it whenever I could. The main character moves too slow and reacts too slowly to inputs to make high stakes combat fun. To add on to this, some enemies in the game create an area that slows the character's movements down, which makes fighting in these areas even more tedious. There are tools that help mitigate this, but they are not available until later in the game Weapons do not pull their ammo for one pool, they pull from their own pools of ammo, so if you are not paying attention, you could end up holding a few assault rifles with no ammo, just clogging up carrying capacity because each assault rifle has its own unique ammo count.

When there's a boss fight (plot points), it just become more of a boiling point for frustration to boil over after dealing with so many mundane craps in the game.

I felt the game actively sought to frustrate, impede, and exhaust the player. 
Yet Kojima was able to utilize these hardships to convey a positive message. 
When you set out on your current quest, the journey is difficult and exhausting. 
Completing this trek, the game enables you to see and interact with how others ahead of you tackled their journeys, instilling the idea that you are not the first to experience these hardships, nor will you be the last. Like the predecessors before you, you are given the opportunity, will you act to ameliorate suffering in the life journey of others? By building shortcuts and donating vehicles/items to nameless strangers, you could make a thankless gesture to help others on their journeys and relieve overall suffering in the world. 
It is a unique and emotional experience that I've only seen successfully done in [spoiler]Nier[/spoiler]. 

There is much more to say, but instead I'll choose to wrap this up. 
Death Stranding is a wholly unique experience, weaving messaging, setting, story, and player emotions to deeply explore concepts like the double-edged nature of connections, the perennial impact of the dearly departed, and finding a personal reason to endure the hard road of life or succumb to the nature of a fatalistic and dying world. 

Death Stranding has left a lasting impression on me, and I hope the initial reviews of the game as ""boring"" don't dissuade him from continuing to take risks in developing games that are not traditionally considered fun to explore and convey his take on complex topics and messages. It is an experience like no other and I hope interested players will give Death Stranding a chance when they are ready.

3,DEATH STRANDING,73573683,english,"The good 
- Graphics: The environment and its rendering in Death Stranding is stunning and I think I could enjoy strolling around in there just for the point of exploration (but at this stage i get a bit frustrated trying to sneak around invincible enemies).
- Audio: The soundtrack is great
- The ""semi-cooperative"" multiplayer where improvement of the game world are shared with the online community is a really great idea, you have the feeling that you're sharing stuff for the greater good when you build something.
- I like the story and setting, it is creepy and well though out.
- The game seems well optimized and I run it just fine on an older high end PC (Core i7 4790 with a GTX970) 

The bad (in my opinion)
The dialogues get pretty long, and are mostly with the player talking to a hologram or two. After just a few hours playing I got so frustrated them that I started skipping them altogether to get into the action faster (all things are relative), probably missing out on some of the story. 10-15 minutes dialogue with a couple of holograms in one go is too long and stale for me. Maybe not for you.

When you use your ""private room"" in the game to recover and organize yourself, there is an animation for every single action, some of which cannot be skipped. And between the actions the player HAS to go through the animations where he returns to his default position on his bed, staring contemplatively at the floor. What if I want to go from the toilet to the shower without sitting on the bed staring at the floor in between? It just makes it a drag to do this stuff (and it is required at some stages of the game).

My biggest gripe is that the game is mostly consisting of ""fetch quests"", travel to point A, talk to a hologram, get some cargo, take it to point B, unload cargo, talk to a hologram, get new cargo, go back to point A, talk to a hologram...
I am not a fan of these kind of missions in other open world games. Fetch quests are the worst kind of tasks in the Assassins Creed series IMO, and unfortunately I am not a fan of them here. In fact, dialogue with only holograms while standing still seems to make it worse. 

I only have 7 hours of game time so far, and I will try a bit more, mainly because I want to see different landscapes, and because it is too late to return this game. However I struggle to stay entertained already, and I doubt I will be able to motivate myself to finish the game.

But, sorry, I feel that a 'movie version' would've been better than what artist extraordinaire H.Kojima calls a ""game"" nowadays.
Correction: it is ""a game"", in the most passive and latent sense.
I know, I know: many will laud this as 'the greatest story ever told', conflating the emotion of the tale with ACTUAL GAMEPLAY, which unfortunately, it's dismally void of: 'travel for an unbearably long distance; hide; run; delivery mail - rinse and repeat'. 
The ""combat"" is more of the Alien: Isolation variety - so if that's your cup of tea, you'll probably get your fill here.
Optimization-wise, the game is first class, hands down; and for it to be running Denuvo, I'm extremely impressed.
With all that said, I don't think this is worth full price; if one wanted to experience a near true to form post-apocalyptic walking simulator, then wait for the sale.
But my Verdict: PAUPS Man: Post-Apocalyptic United Parcel Service Man! 'Coming Soon to a Theater Near You'
(EDIT: [Damn you, Kojima... ""Going To Work: The Game"" grew on me]:
Delivery after delivery, while attempting to get to a point in which the game became fun and interesting, I suddenly realized that ""The Delivery"" itself had become ""the action"" I found fun and interesting.... What a mindf***! Kudos, Kojima - another well-played Psycho Mantis gambit.)

20,DEATH STRANDING,72736203,english,"With the PC release this game has solidified it's spot in my top 10 games of all time. This game is an absolute masterpiece in my honest opinion. I have so much to say about this one, and I really don't even care if no one ends up seeing it.

The story of Death Stranding focuses on themes of depression, isolation, connections with people and what comes with them, and what comes with losing those connections we have with people. It's a very important topic, especially with the situation going on in the world right now that almost perfectly encapsulates what Death Stranding is all about.

The writing is superb. I've read every email I've received, and every interview I obtained and I don't regret a second of it. Clients email you praising your efforts on deliveries, reminding you that you really are helping these people (whether the game shows that or not) the sense of accomplishment is unmatched. Interviews are chocked FULL with tiny details you would never know about if you didn't read them. Documents explaining timefall, BB's, BT's, Chiral Density and tons of other things that you could VERY easily just pass right by without ever finding out. A lot of these fully explain things that I was confused about the game (eg. Timefall and how it worked - why we can't use planes etc. etc.) the sense of discovery in this game is absolutely incredible.

The voice acting and acting efforts put forth by everyone involved in this game is unbelievable. You FEEL the pain of these characters. You see it in their faces and hear it in their voices. They feel like real people, real friends. Every actor involved put their A game forward and you can 100% tell. Fragile had a couple of weak parts but it by no means effects the game negatively. And of course Mads Mikkelson and Norman put on amazing performances. Probably some of the best I've ever seen in video games.

The graphics are incredible. The massive snowcapped mountains, deep valleys, dense forests and rivers dotting the horizon - it's spectacular. I don't think I've stopped this many times in a game just to take in the view. (aside from Ghost of Tsushima) It's a gorgeous game, and the cutscenes are only even more gorgeous and masterfully directed. The amount of detail in the character models, from the threading of Sams backpack straps and clips to the ominous carbon fiber skull mask that Die-Hardman wears, the level of detail is mind boggeling (Which I'll touch on later as well)

Where this game shines in my opinion is its game mechanics. Throughout the game it will introduce you to new tools that will help you on your journey. You'll also receive new tools from Preppers for raising your connection with them. These tools include things like Floating Carriers, Spike Gloves, Heat Pads, Battery packs, gas masks, multiple different exoskeletons and so much more that I can't even list here. It's all given to you at a pace which keeps you expirimenting with the different tools you're getting, and as you get further through the game you'll have a much more robust toolset for whatever your mission is. A lot of the game is delivering packages yes, but a majority of it is all about planning, and the satisfaction that comes from making it from point A to point B through whatever conditions may apply after said meticulous planning. I also need to mention the sense of discovery in this game. Finding new things you've never seen before (trying to stay as non-spoilery as I can) is so incredibly satisfying and downright cool. I found MANY things in my PC playthrough that I never knew were even a thing from my console playthrough. That includes tools I didn't know existed, and entire GAME MECHANICS I had no idea about. It's amazing!

The multiplayer mechanics are VERY unique and SO much fun to play with. The game has a soft multiplayer mechanic, so buildings and tools that you place in the world (even packages you have to leave behind) will show up in other players worlds, allowing them to use those tools to their advantage, like zip-lines, ladders, bridges and climbing ropes. Players can also put down signs (akin to Dark Souls) these can be warnings, greetings, or just plain motivation to ""Keep on keeping on"" you can receive likes from these players AND NPC's, raising your courier level and allowing you to carry more cargo, keep your balance more easily, and so on. You can also sign Bridges Contracts with other players or friends allowing more of their items and yours to be placed in eachothers worlds, eventually you'll have 30+ bridges contracts signed and you'll be helping so many players with every little thing you do.

I have so much more to say about this game, but I'll leave it at this - if you know what you're getting into and you're still interested, BUY IT. This game is absolutely incredible and will forever be up there with some of my favorite games of all time, solely based on how unique, mind bending, rewarding and gratifying this game was.",1594824867,1596204951,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,402,99,6870,0,238,1597677167,,

65,DEATH STRANDING,73043312,english,"After spent quite some time on this game, I decide putting my silly jokes aside, giving a serious review of it, ‘serious’ I mean, I will critise this game strictly based on the true feelings I had along the journey through BT infested America.

I think Kojima chan messed up this time. Despite the next-gen cinematic Graphics and ‘not a usual day you would listen to’ soundtracks, Death Stranding’s highlights are finished. I admitted the graphics of this game is a real next-leveled model even comparing the other titles within the triple A game industry’s standard, however, how long will it keep your eyes-open in the game? Sorry, but not for too long. The length of DS is around 40-60 hours in average. After 4-5 hours, you will be off the graphics hook probably like I did. Then what else will it be to keep you continually playing this game for the next 35-55 hours? 

The gameplay.

DS follows the tradition Kojima chan often does: everything progresses in detail SLOWLY. It isn’t a bad thing being honest, only means the game will be long. Long or short isn’t the problem here either, plus, I am not saying the idea of ‘delivery’ should never be used in the first place, but the real matter is: this idea doesn’t last long and wears off your interests pretty quickly. If it is the only problem in the long run, it might just catch the falling grade, unfortunately, the other matter comes along killed the gameplay completely and left me can’t give DS a pass.

It’s very repetitive.

If you’re an experienced gamer like me, you probably already noticed the gameplay structure of DS is very simple and repetitive. To sum it up in detail: you start in Point A delivering a cargo to Point B, on the way enter Mules’  territory and encounter them, fight them off your road, then reach Point B, from there to Point C, delivering another parcel while going through Timefall areas which means sneaking pass BTs stealthy. Lastly, go on delivering another cargo from Point C to Point A in a long distance while encountering Mules or BTs, or both. Repeat this process until you meet the chapter boss. 
DS might looks new to you, but it still gets lots of references from Metal Gear Solid mechanics regarding the gameplay. Like game consistently suggests you to play ‘stealthy’, or add some TPS elements to shoot your way out. I don’t know wether you get what I mean or not  here: Kojima studio doesn’t really get very far by creating new things in DS, instead, the major part of it felt like familiar, even in the story, I don’t want spoil anything here, but you will notice them once you’re set to play yourself. In my opinion, their next project should seriously take some deep thoughts, learn and break this mind cycle, otherwise, they never gonna make something truly amazing that could surpass MGS franchise. And we all know that the longer a franchise is, the less idea you could have coming up to work it around.  

The idea to build facilities to help the other players is one of the few standing-outs and also happens to be original, I speak it highly and wholeheartedly think the team should be proud of themselves. It added a lot of fun to a single-player campaign. What’s more? It now becomes the sole reason I still playing this game because I found building structure in order to help the others and appreciated by him/her is way more fun than delivering cargos to the NPCs in the main missions. I personally have no doubts that the story will meet my expectations but the gameplay just barely could hold me reaching that far end. I honestly could drop this game at any point now if any new more interesting titles comes to my lab. This online feature is a small good catch but still can’t make up for the entire game, even I counted graphics and soundtracks within too.
Some players might enjoy the Iceland-America  landscapes, but for a player like me, I found it hard to enjoy them while Mules and Timefalls are consistently chasing my back. 

Tripe A games now like to use very complicated controls as the trend I say? DS is not an exception. Despite the cargo delivery is repetitive and dull, the control you need to learn are more than you can think of. The tutorial section of this game is like a thick book, well, I only say one sentence: you do need to enjoy reading otherwise you may not going to like DS. Because there are many things to read in the game and the controls takes a lot of time to read too. Once tips vanish into the ocean of the tutorial book, you will have a hard time to find it again.

Anyways, spending $60 for a game only for its cinematic graphics and beautiful soundtracks definitely are not my recommendation. I also happened to have a mix feeling about DS regarding its attachments. In one hand, I really appreciate it make its way to PC. If it stuck to PS4, I would have missed this title probably like forever. Even though I don’t recommend this game, whether to have a choice to try it or not is entirely a different matter. I’d like one and I am very grateful for it on PC. In the other hand, DS came to PC with half a year delayed, full priced no less, planting Denuvo inside it. Feeling like a back slap to my face with no joke. Well, don’t chase Kojima chan with your $60 or more while he chased his favorite actors and actresses in this one, the relationship blooms no result for you. Besides, there are many big titles lining up until the end of the 2020. Wouldn’t it be better to spend your money for the FIRST PC released titles(if proves being good ones of course) like Halo Infinite, Cyberpunk 2077, The Medium, Tell Me Why, if you’re not Steam Only Members, then also Starwars: Squadron, Watchdogs: Legion and the new Assassin’s Creed and so on? Meanwhile this parcel delivery simulator can wait a year or 2 being exactly the same with a price drop. Then, if you still insist being Uncle Sam to save the Ice-landed Unite States, go ahead and grab it, the loss would seemly be fairly low. 

If you still skeptical about what I’ve said here, go and watch a DS gameplay video, it also helps for my statements Ive listed above. Well you may still have a final question left: why the hell I had it in the first place then?

4,DEATH STRANDING,73249439,english,"I would like to preface this review by saying this is the first instance of me playing a Hideo Kojima game, and while I have had no prior experience with his works, Kojima's stentorian reputation of making unique and impactful pieces of art has duly been maintained with Death Stranding.

Death Stranding's mien is just that: a piece of art. This descriptor is not necessarily that of praise, but rather something to be experienced and digested. Not everyone wants to sit and tacitly absorb a game, but rather get into the action right away, and that's fine. But Death Stranding is at the aphelion of that. In fact, Death Stranding's gameplay is largely secondary to the plot and story, and Hideo Kojima could have easily indited the plot as a novel, and the experience and sentiments I had at the end of the game would have largely been the same.

I don't want to turn this review into a full-on harangue, so I'll now surmise my thoughts: Death Stranding is a slow burn, giving the player gratification through their own arguably herculean efforts of hauling freight across a conspicuously small America. If you enjoy games like Subnautica, where you progressively acquire minute augmentations and slowly unravel plot, you will most likely enjoy Death Stranding. Beware that there are stints of the game where I would recommend a podcast or video to listen to.

Overall, this game receives accolades from me and an emphatic recommendation. The forty-five hours of gameplay to eighty dollars Canadian I spent was well worth it, and I look forward to further games Hideo Kojima has in store.",1595664999,1596121387,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,121,21,2729,0,784,1596116275,,

Inventory MGMT could be a bit tedious with keyboard and mouse. The game seams to be designed with controller in mind. You absolutely can play it on the keyboard and get used to it, but I feel like controller would be better because things like ""Hold Left/Right triggers to balance feel more intuitive"".

So, imagine if you didn't have infinite pockets. Every single thing needs to be somewhere on your body. Now imagine that you play with other people, but you can't see them. You can only see things they put in the world for you. A ""Speed Up"" on a road to boost your bike, a ""Cheer-Up"" to restore your stamina, etc. You can sleep, rest, massage your shoulders, take a shower, pee, poop, drink and it affects game is a way - nothing critical, nothing to force you to do any of it, but everything feels very comprehensive and though-trough. In a way it reminded me playing an RPG, where I would collect all of the missions in a city and then plan a route and grind trough all of the tasks as fast a possible in a line. Except in this game that planning is a big part of it since you don't want to overload yourself. 

T H E  S T O R Y
The story is great so far. It has a Japanese approach to structuring of the gameplay. They are careful with surprises so taking a mission you can be almost sure that you will not be interrupted by some story event. And I like that very much. I want to relax and know that I'm in a sandbox, I understand the rules and the mechanics. As opposite to having some surprise behind every door because developers are worried that I'll get bored. I must say, many things in the game are scripted, but very subtly: a camera can zoom out a bit and a nice music starts playing. Also, I wish I could zoom out manually.

E M O T I O N S
There is something... off about how emotions are usually presented in modern and classical games/movies. Something sad happens and we watch people crying or looking depressed. I know for a fact that I'm not the only one who feels uncomfortable during those moments and don't understand why we need them. And for me games like Death Stranding and Persona are a breath of fresh air - they deal with it just right. Every moment is there for a good reason and not just ""Well, the person died so let's show all the other characters show emotions to make it believable"".

G A M E P L A Y
I was worried about the pacing of it all, how will it feel. And it is alright. Legs are fast enough. Getting somewhere isn't hard. The balancing challenge only happens when you overload yourself and it doesn't seem to be required. You get plenty of tools to deal with everything. It is easy to get things done and you probably will not be dying or failing a lot. In general I feel like the game loves me, it does everything to let me have a great time. One thing, it is probably good to go trough main missions first with taking additional ones only when it is in the same direction. 

G R A P H I C S
Wow. Just wow. Clearly Kojima made sure that every detail is just right. It is probably the best looking open world. There are plenty of good looking games out there, but this terrain feels more organic. Not artificially shaped to facilitate gameplay. It is, but with care.

20,DEATH STRANDING,73506123,english,"[h1]""It's about the journey, not the destination.""[/h1]

Calling this game a ""walking simulator"" is like calling Metal Gear Solid V a ""shooter"".
True, you do a lot of it in the game, but it's also so, so much more.

MGSV is also the best comparison point here, as Death Stranding is definitely ""A Hideo Kojima game.""

Is it also a brand new, revolutionary ""Strand-type game"" genre? 
No, that's just Kojima and marketing pushing it a bit too much.
Still, it takes some ideas from other games, repacks and improves them in a way that provide a fresh perspective.
Describing them all in a review would ruin it, as finding them out yourself is half the fun.

[h1]Gameplay: (8.5/10)[/h1]
Kojima again provides a sandbox world for you to play around in, explore, and master, giving you more and more toys to choose your preferred way to achieve your objectives as you progress through the game.
The vast majority of the missions are about moving items from point A to point B, however what matters more is what happens on the road and how you deal with it with the tools at your disposal.
Grades and scores after each mission return as well, giving you that extra incentive to push yourself to perfection.
The worldbuilding is done in a way that perfectly fits the gameplay mechanics such as death and respawning.
There is also this great dynamic where if a main mission proves too challenging, spending some time on optional side content is very likely to make it easier, and it's truly up to the player and their choices as to HOW to make it easier as their choices visibly change the game's world.
[i]Note: I recommend playing on Very Hard difficulty, as otherwise the gameplay mechanics are underutilized and the game becomes a bit too easy. [b]Yes, that includes walking as a game mechanic.[/b][/i]

[h1]Story: (8/10)[/h1]
In a true ""Hideo Kojima game"" fashion this story about ""Connections"" (in all the meanings of the word you can possibly think of) requires your full attention as it presents a world, characters and events filled with strong metaphores, social commentary and themes that make you think and reflect on our own world and your own life.
This effect is strong, stronger than MGSV. So strong that I would risk saying it's more important than the actual story of the game taken at face value, which, even more so than MGSV, is hard to keep track of and truly understand unless you go full detective.
Also in a pure Kojima fashion, the game contains some fourth-wall-breaking moments, characters and items. This is just something you have to get used to.

[h1]Graphics/Audio: (9/10)[/h1]
I mean, just take a look at the top screenshots. 
This game is beautiful, with photorealistic environments, fantastic lighting, insanely detailed character models and great animations.
Performance capture is a bit uneven, sometimes reaching uncanny valley (Fragile, Mama) but mostly great, really capturing the emotions (Sam, Die-Hardman).
Audio effects are great and the music really pushes the atmosphere higher, when it manages to ""get it right"" (although sometimes it doesn't quite align)

[h1]Performance/Bugs (9/10)[/h1]
My GTX 1060 was holding 45-60 FPS on high-ish settings and I could probably stabilize it to a constant 60 by dropping some settings down, however with the pace of the game I didn't feel a need to do this as I only noticed the framedrops on the frame counter and not in the game itself.
The only real bug I ran into was a potential memory leak after REALLY long (8h+) sessions that resulted in disappearing textures, but it was very rare and a restart fixed it.
I heard other people ran into some issues though, so YMMV.

[h1]Length:[/h1]
A bit over 100 hours in I completed the main story, unlocked all of the unlockables and mastered ~170 out of... 400-500 side missions (not sure exactly how many exist) playing mostly on the hardest difficulty.
I wasn't rushing to completion but I haven't been super slow either.
It feels a bit smaller in scope than MGSV, but at the same time it's a more complete experience.

[h1]Summary:[/h1]
Just like Nier: Automata, it's an unusual game that does things differently and does it well. Despite not doing everything perfectly, it's worth to be experienced.
If you enjoy Kojima games and are open to experience something new in terms of gameplay, you will like it.
If you've never heard of Hideo Kojima and/or are just looking for an universally liked, triple-A game to enjoy, MGSV might be a better starting point, as it's definitely closer to mainstream games while still introducing Kojima's signature style.

Death Stranding is a very singular game, the first game from Kojima Productions as an stand-alone studio after the departure from Konami, it’s also the first new IP from this creator for a very long time, when it was confirmed excitement was the general feeling and while people didn’t really know back then what the game was about trailer after trailer, the excitement was brutal and then the game released and reception was, well, mixed, what happened?

The game is something completely different when it comes to the AAA scene, the premise is very unique, the core idea of the gameplay is traversing a map from A to B while connecting stations one with each other, sounds boring, right? Well, that’s because this is a very common simplification of what Death Stranding is, while a true simplification it doesn’t make justice to what the game truly feels. Thankfully it looks like after the excitement settled, the fan theories stopped and the PC version arrived, the game is getting a more positive reception in general, why? Well, that will have to wait until later in this review, so let’s get this thing started, shall we? 

In the future, Humanity has discovered the afterlife and the existence of the “Beaches”, places that work as bridges between our world and the world of the dead, at the same time Earth experiences an apocalyptic event called the Death Stranding which made both worlds to collide breaking the process of dying and letting in some creatures called BTs in the process, entities which only purpose is to drag the living to the world of the death, when this happens it creates a Voidout, for that reason communities across all the old United States hide themselves in subterranean bunkers.

As people hide themselves the only way of getting resources and having any contact with the outside is thanks to the Porters, people that cross all the land with packages, we will be controlling Sam Porter Bridges, a lonely worker of bridges that will get dragged into an impossible task, reconnect all the continent alongside other members of Bridges, it won’t take long until your mission becomes something bigger and deeper. 

Story is extensive, deep and involves a lot of characters that will not only helps us accomplish our objective but also open their feelings to us in a variety of ways, at first things won’t make that much sense as a lot of information is thrown at you very quickly but the more you unlock, the more connections you make, the more sense makes the story. 
It’s pure Kojima style, tons of military, social, political and humanistic topics mixed with a great layer of obscure post-apocalyptic science fiction, make no mistake, it’s deep and very interested but it’s presented at a very slow pace, keep in mind the game wants you to be intrigued with the story but at the same time wants you to enjoy the journey.

It’s really interesting at all levels, the world is completely gone, most characters are broken one way or the other and all actions have consequences in the long term, I would say everything is well connected and while not everything makes sense, it works pretty well.

And with that we come to the divisive part of this game, gameplay, as I pointed out before, if simplified this game sounds boring and maybe even stupid, we all know the “Amazon deliver” joke from when it was shown for the first time and let me tell you, it is not boring and it’s not stupid, on the contrary, it is quite addictive, it is challenging and the progression feels natural and not forced to the point in which you have so many tools that the traversal process becomes something quite cool, at least for me after playing it for almost 40 hours. 

Let’s start with the map's progression, the game is divided in 2 maps, the first area is the one you will be playing in chapters 1 and 2 while the second area (which is bigger) will be your playground from chapter 3 up to the very end of the game, what’s with this? Well, you will notice how the game throws at you a very stable but crescent challenge, from not so difficult hills, little rivers and a bit rocky slopes and then comes the next part of the challenge, big rocky hills, desertic areas, big rivers and mountains but by the time you need to pass this challenges you already got used to the traversal controls and fundamentals, your equipment is better than when you first started this journey and the progressions feels always like something you have accomplished, even with other players objects and/or interactions, never feels like something game breaking and always as something complementary to your own equipment. 

The movement, the balance, climbing, all the systems work amazingly well making the experience of traveling a very pleasant one and as you are enjoying your journey, why not pick up some lost cargo? Yes, this happens, a lot and almost without realizing it by yourself, deviating from your route just to pick another piece of cargo because you want more upgrades and better level, I didn’t feel like this was boring but a really great and challenging gameplay, sure, it’s not for everyone but if it catches your attention at first, you will surely enjoy it. 

Speaking of levels, keep an eye on those stars, Sam will improve his skills the more cargo you deliver here and there. 

There’s combat too against BTs, MULES and “special encounters” but I felt like this wasn’t the best part of the game, those 3 elements will go up in difficulty the further you go, from simple enemies to better armed or more challenging monsters, however you always have to options here, fight or run, if you decide to run then that’s it, you will just not face them and you will be able to continue your journey but if you decide you want to fight you will probably face a combat system that, while it works, it doesn’t feel like the main core of this game, it has some benefits to sometimes face the combat but most of the time is not worthy.

For such combats you will be unlocking both lethal and non-lethal weapons too, the first group for the BTs and the second one for human enemies.

Something very interesting from the technical perspective is the shifting area effect that will happen once BTs get you, imagine a complete transformation of the environment due to the chiral energy of the zone, once the combat starts a very interesting effect will happen that will change your area completely, I won’t spoil it cause’ I think it’s amazing but it’s visually stunning.

And speaking of visual elements, graphically this game is top tier, let’s keep in mind that the game is very nature focused and they nailed it, each natural perspective and scene gives you the opportunity to take a good picture. Seriously, this game is one of the best looking games I have seen in a very long time in terms of nature representation and biome integration, plus character models are superb, really expressive and detailed, each acting moment is amazing and the same could be said about the assets, high visual quality in this game everywhere. 

Of course we are talking about a PC version of a previous console exclusive and made with a console exclusive engine, the Decima, so it’s one of those cases in which the port itself is interesting enough to compare against it’s console counterpart and I’m happy to say that it’s a world of difference. The higher framerate makes this experience to go really smooth, the general performance is absolutely great with a great scalability with a wide variety of systems.

In general I have a very positive vision of this game, as you can see, I wasn’t really expecting anything from this and I found a really pleasant experience that I loved every single minute, it can be cheesy, it can be repetitive at times but story, characters and their performances, the world, everything in general really caught my attention and after spending almost 40 hours on it I can safely say that it’s a game that I absolutely recommend.",1596098670,1596098694,TRUE,44,2,0.738696694,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,973,33,2206,0,2206,1595927561,,

It got to the point where i was doing deliveries and not progressing the story for like 3 days as i was completely dedicated to getting 100% completion for achievements, and boy was that a struggle that was rewarding and enjoyable.

graphics are top notch, but the actors...the facial expression and motion capture, thats amazing.
there are many cutscene between gameplay but every cutscene you know more about the world and its a pure enjoyment to watch those cutscene.
and for the gameplay, planning route, delivering goods is okay for me. afterall i also played ETS2 and ATS

14 hrs: 
what a game
while delivery goods sounds boring, the story keep on open up the no there are many ways to deliver goods
one thing i didnt mention is music, the musics pops up when you think you need them, and the music they play is 100% match with the game.
a bit of the downside is, as the community of this game is so active, the infrastructure is everywhere, sometimes making the delivery too easy.

The game is getting more tense up 
delivery became more and more dangerous 
both the story and gameplay are superb.

On the other hand though this game is absolutely flawless. The game looks incredible with a beautiful unique environment across the areas of the game. The music that plays throughout the game is in a word perfect. All of the music that plays coincide very well with the point of the game you are at. Now on to the game play, there are certain aspects of the game play that I find to be a little buggy, the vehicles being probably the most buggy. I'm not saying that the vehicles are unusable in the slightest, there are just times were you get your vehicle stuck and the jump feature won't work or occasionally the vehicle will hit a rock or something that just doesn't exist. Enough about the bad stuff. I feel that this game runs super smooth and everything works like a well oiled machine. The gun play in the game I find to be very good and it is really enjoyable to be able to have gunfights in a game you wouldn't think would have any. There are countless little things that just enhance the game and coincide with the lore of the game and just make sense. Now we are finally on to the story. Death Stranding is by far the best story game I have ever played. It keeps you thinking about what everything means and throws curveballs at you constantly throughout the game. There is never a dull moment in the story because you are always doing something that directly has a purpose to the main story. The ending of the game is flawless, it answers every remaining unanswered question you might have and still surprises you with plot twists even when you think you have it all figured out.

Yes - you deliver things, but there's enough depth and challenge simply in doing this that it's rewarding and entertaining to accomplish. Death Stranding is as much a pioneering simulator as a delivery simulator, there is a ton of exploration depth and it can take some real thought to navigate difficult terrain. Made a new path you like more than the ones other players have come up with? Lay some equipment down to make traversing it easier. 

I took three hours to make a path tracing the tips of each of the big mountains in a range, then laid equipment down to make traveling that route easier. On the way back, it only took about one hour. Imagine my surprise when I was notified other players had started following my route. With ziplines laid along that path by myself and other players, it now takes less than five minutes to cross that mountain range. There's a real sense of progression in the world, and lots of incentive for exploration and cooperation between players.

Given this is a Kojima game, your enjoyment of the story will improve immensely if you just accept the premise as face value and not question it. The story is esoteric, but a high degree of effort has gone into the writing and it shows.

[h1] Gameplay [/h1]

imma be real, it is kinda a walking sim, but not really. It's not fair to the game to just disregard it as such, because there is a lot more to it than just holding down your stick or W key. Navigating through the landscape, the equipment you'll probably need to get to B safely and the most efficiently, do you use a vehicle and potentially having to leave it when you come across an area where it's just impossible to take it with you, dangers, such as MUELS and BTs, the equipment and countermeasures against them, timefall, which will degrade the container that protects the contents inside (the cargo) so unless you prepared against that (which is a total must) you'll be on a timer to get to your location before it starts damaging the cargo. It all plays into getting to B with your cargo in a condition as pristine as possible. It's quite nice for the first 10-20 hours... until you realize you'll be repeating this if you greatly care about potential rewards and getting 5-star ratings, and I've never been a person to care about side stuff. So after a while, I just solely focused on the story.

And I guess I'm just that damn good at the game, but it was just so fucking easy?? Never once in my 40 hours of playtime did I get caught by the BTs or knocked out by the MULES, tho the MULES were the biggest challenge overall, able to immobilize your vehicle and chasing you around until you get out of their territory. But that threat ended momentarily when you unlock nonlethal weapons. As you progress the game and connect the bunkers to the chiral network you'll start unlocking new equipment and weapons. Leveling your rating from bunkers will give you better versions of your stuff. But again, it'll require you to deliver the cargo back and forth, and it gets tedious.

Oh yea, those boss battles... yea, never encountered them unless it was scripted... You see, to go against a ""hunter"" you have to get caught by a BT, dragging you into the Tar, which is hard to move in and they're trying to drag you into it, if they're successful, they'll drag you around for a bit and a hunter will appear, big motherfuckers. But again, I never encountered them. BTs are insanely easy (at least for me) to avoid, just sneak and hold your breath when too close. Quite disappointing. Something else that was disappointing, the boss battles. Out of 3 times I got up against the Hunters only 1 of them was a good battle, there was more times when I encountered them, but as easy as they are to beat, they're even easier to escape. Can't go into it as it's spoiler territory. I played the game on normal difficulty, perhaps that was the big mistake. But no way am I gonna replay all of it again.

[h1] Story [/h1]

It's decently good. Has a lot of problems, but it's nonetheless good. Going through the game, you have a good handful of characters in the story, all there helping you reconnect America. They're all written well, but as you're a porter out on the field, so you'll be communicating with them through the coms. There'll be very few times where you meet them in person and that's where the character interactions shrine, because that's when Sam finally really talks. As you play the game, you realize Sam is partly, Sam, but also a silent protagonist when you're in control. But you soon come to learn, that's just the character of Sam, a quiet guy. You also learn how the cast are all affected by the Death Stranding in their own unique ways, being a theme in the story.

A reason, if not the only reason we bought this game was because of the man behind it all, Hideo Kojima. Getting this game, that's what I wanted, a Hideo Kojima game, and we certainly got it. Through his career, he's known for Metal Gear Solid, a franchise about soldiers and special operations. Action and stealth, violence, but also philosophy, patriotism and loyalty, a lot of themes and messages tucked in the story of his games, and that's the shit I love, so for Kojima to totally 180, making a game about just walking and avoiding violence was unexpected, but understandable. I understand if Kojima was tired of making games about War when violence it isn't his entire being. This game really did demonstrate who he really is.


So there are some of the thoughts on the game I wanted to put into words. The game really isn't me, it was an interesting experience, but no eye-opener. The game wasn't really able to carry itself in the long run before I just wanted to get to the story's conclusion so I didn't have to carry any more cargo. But you should totally buy it, for what Kojima goodness it has in it, and it does, it's good game, a Hideo Kojima game.

But for the love of god Kojima, as a mega-fan, a dedicated cocksucker of yours, make your next title resemble a more traditional videogame next time around

4,DEATH STRANDING,73470812,english,"There are a lot of negative reviews for this game out there, is this a bad game? In my opinion, it's not, but I'm also the target audience for this game.

If you are looking for a high intensity game without story do yourself a favour and move on, you won't like this game. This game is touted as a walking simulator because for the most part you'll be delivering packages to various outposts around the world. Most of the challenge here comes from how to get there, whether you walk there, ride a motorcycle or load up a truck. The terrain can be pretty janky to get around and with the rain that damages your stuff, invisible monster fields (BTs), and balancing huge loads on your back which you have to control the tilt of manually it can actually be pretty tricky to get where you need to go initially. I say initially because eventually you can rebuild the road network with some of those materials you are hauling which makes it much easier to get to most areas on the map, reducing the grind considerably. 

One of the shining areas the game has is the story. If you skip through the many cutscenes and story elements of the game it's understandable you likely wouldn't like the game. The world and the characters in it are very well done and the story is interesting, I'm 34 hours in and the game is only now starting to answer many of the questions that have built up from playing the game. Overall I am quite impressed with the game but I can understand why it hasn't done super well because you need a little patience to play this game and it's not all action all the time.

8,DEATH STRANDING,73469169,english,"What can i say about this game? Is it good? I guess that depends on your point of view. Is it mediocre? I think so. To me, it's one of the most boring games I've played. The story is fragmented, like it came from the mind of a heroin addicted robot with no sense of humanity. I can tell that Kojima really needed Konami to round out his games, because left to his own devices, this mastermind falls flat. From the boring landscapes, the 30 minute long cut-scenes, right down to the GOD awful niche music that for some reason he decided he would make you suffer through instead of allowing you to turn it off. Whomever that band is...it has to be friends with Hideo, because no one else on earth would play that garbage.
I mean...I hate to rip on it like this. I did like the Metal Gear series, ( for the most part). I hate to get all the Kojima fans feeling hurt, but come on guys. This game was thrown at us like a spider monkey throwing his crap at your face. That's exactly what this is though isn't it? It's a pile of after Taco Bell poops. The actors have no real expression on their faces. The dialogue was written by jellyfish it seems. It almost makes me wonder if the development team has ever even met humans at all. Do i recommend this game? Sure...if you absolutely have zero excitement in your life. Maybe if there were literally no other games to choose from. I'm not entirely sure why this game is getting Very Positive on Steam. Maybe they got payed off? Maybe it's a Steam/Kojima collusion? Who knows. I will say this though.

and while the story is very interesting, it's only in the last 10% of the game where so much is finally revealed, and i mean a LOT of connections are finally defined. it would have been much better to have big reveals all along the journey so you could in fact mistake what was happening until the next reveal.

Now, even with a brilliant narrative like this, I don't think I would be this invested if the gameplay was lacking or barely ok. That's so not the case with this game.

55,DEATH STRANDING,73444832,english,"STORY - Long story short, you're a UPS delivery man in a post apocalyptic setting. The story is by far the best thing about this game, though the pacing could be better in the beginning where it feels like its dropping too much information on the player at once, however, all questions you may have are answered by the time you complete this 25+ hour story (or longer if you dont rush main missions like me). Either way it makes the experience worth it for the story alone.

GAMEPLAY - The gameplay itself is a little tedious and can become very monotonous at certain points in the story. The building concept is a great idea, allowing you to build your own bridges, ladders, vehicles, etc. to allow you to roam the massive landscape easier, even allowing some structures from other players to end up in your session for you to enjoy. Other concepts such as ""the weight you carry"" vs. the landscape are interesting at first, but just annoying in the long run. It essentially forces you to take some areas slow in a world that is already expansive enough as is. 

PROS - 
My personal favorite thing about this game are the random music cues that can happen during deliveries. You are strolling along on a mountain carrying goods to the next delivery area and suddenly you have one of many fantastic songs from this games soundtrack play to make your journey even better. 

The story is one of the best in recent years

The soundtrack is absolutely amazing, I only wish it played songs more often during deliveries

The combat (later on in the game anyways) is fun and adds a new layer to your delivery strategies

Buildings and other player structures add to the monotony of the gameplay

CONS - 
The gameplay, they don't call this game ""walking simulator"" for nothing. Its what you do for 75% of the game and the other 25% is watching the story unfold through several hours worth of cutscenes

The pacing at the beginning of the game can be duanting for some, as the game gives lots of information within a short time span
 
The vehicles are a bit rough to handle off the roads and especially in the mountains where they're borderline undrivable

Enemy encounters, mainly a ghost-like enemy called a ""BT"", are interesting and creepy at first, but the effect wears thin after the first five encounters

56,DEATH STRANDING,73444829,english,"Pros:

Tightly woven story for the most part, great mocap and acting from all the cast, satisfying ending

One of the better looking games with excellent worldbuilding and landscapes

Something new in gaming, not just the same old copy pasted Ubisoft / Bethesda / Rockstar BS

Cons:

Gameplay feels bland after 20h, ziplines way too cheap and OP

Game drags on for far too long in the middle

A fairly pretentious game that thinks too smartly of itself, with ads plastered all over and Kojima's name slapped all around from the cover to the credits

Not everyone cup of tea, since it's pretty much a glorified walking simulator for 30h of the game, with two feature films at the beginning and end. I think the only appeal of the game in the post-COVID world is the concept of a world ravaged by an unknown force, with deliverymen being hailed as heroes in society for delivering packages. Story was decent enough to make me want to finish it at the very least, but much balancing is needed between the ziplines, lategame weapons, and roads.

Some of the reviews I'd read prior to the steam launch left me wondering if we even played the same game. Or rather, it felt like they barely even finished the tutorial before writing about it. The game is kinda long, either that or I just took the scenic route every trip I made. Just doing the primary missions with 0 cutscene skips outside of run of the mill tasks was nearly 40+ hours of content. 

Before we continue, I'll just stop and say that yes: You deliver. That's your job, that's the premise of the game, if you're expecting to not be apocalypse amazon prime I'd imagine you didn't look into Death Stranding very much prior to reading this. It has atmosphere and story, the quests are not the meat of the world but rather the world itself. Funnily enough, just getting from A to B has more substance than most things on market these days though; So quit whining, pick up your shit and get moving.

Controlling the character and the mechanics take some getting used to, but the balance mechanic has both boons and banes to it in terms of use vs risk. Once you get the hang of it you'll be scaling cliffs like a goat and doing things with the vehicles your beginner self would have thought impossible.

Combat is interesting and feels rather responsive, often times I was able to switch up strategies and weapon types without feeling too outgunned. {Besides, Sam has fists of iron.} Weapons have enough variety to cover every situation I encountered and left me satisfied, expecially in the mix of all the useful terrain gear and fun gadgets.

[b] I would say all the pros and cons you hear of the game are very correct but I found the game very enjoyable and this was my experience [/b]
I played on normal and will say it took me a while to get use to the mechanics and combat of the game especially when you don't start out with pretty much nothing in the means of offense or buildings. I found myself exploring more in the initial area and found it interesting to see how people played based off of the buildings and signs they left behind. once you start unlocking more items and buildings then the game gets relatively easier to progress. when I moved on to the next area and unlocked roads that was my time and resource sink early game. I will say it took time but completing it before moving on in the story was very helpful and progressing thru the story a breeze. I completed at least 80% of the road by myself and the rest with other players but everyone seemed to enjoy the trail left behind from following the road instead of the road itself. even tho my goal was the road and progressing thru the story I still took time to listen to the music playing when going thru scenic areas, making runs to go floating carrier boarding, helping out NPC porters by stalking them and laying down buildings to make their life easier for fun. my tip for the road especially for resource gathering is resource deliveries helps but channeling your inner solid snake and raiding mule/terrorist camps helps a whole lot also fighting BTS for those crys-tals when I unlocked the grenade launcher that was my favorite weapon to use for those purposes. As for the story goes it pays off at the very end where everything comes to light and I will say its an investment of your time but to me it feel like a good investment and rewarding to see it to the very end but that is my own opinion.",1595969263,1595969263,TRUE,1,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,86,5,5643,0,5643,1595563648,,

I ran out of blood grenades, so I p*ssed on a giant oily squid monster to try and kill it but I ended up dying because I couldn't stop laughing.

Kojima you beautiful b*stard.

[h1]A Brief Review[/h1]
Pis* jokes aside, Death Stranding is fun and it kept me hooked until the very end. It's got a fantastic story, amazing world building, and beautiful motion-capture graphics. The characters are animated beautifully by their respective actors with Mads Mikkelsen as Cliff demonstrating what is in my opinion, one of the best portrayals of a villain in all of gaming (You'll really wanna see where his story goes). 

The gameplay may be boring to some but if you have Spotify open and put on your favorite playlist you'll enjoy it much more. There is a system where you manage your cargo and how it affects your balance but there's a function that has the game auto-arrange it for you to lessen your cargo's effect on your balance. If you keep losing your balance and falling just hold down the right and left mouse buttons as you walk and you won't fall (It's slower but much more efficient). You can get over encumbered as well but it gets nullified pretty early on with a certain item that you get. If you want to get around the world faster, then you can always take a bike (I highly recommend this in the [spoiler]Mountain[/spoiler] Region). 

There are also a few stealth sections with BTs (Beached Things), invisible ghosts that you can spot with your BB (Bridge Baby). You have to hold your breath when you're near them and you can get through them with some patience. They get much easier later on when you get better weapons though.

The big feature of Death Stranding is the Chiral Network, a mechanic which allows you to see other player's structures (ladders, climbing anchors, bridges, roads, etc...) and also allows them to see your structures. You can like people's structures to appreciate them and give them points which increase their level and give them extra abilities as they play. It also feels very gratifying when you see that other people used your structures and liked them as well. You also have the ability to entrust some cargo that you need to deliver to other players so that they can finish the job (they can do the same to you), however, this feature is entirely optional, so you're not obligated to deliver anyone else's lost or entrusted cargo.

The game has got a great soundtrack as well which unfortunately only plays at specific moments throughout your journey with you not being able to listen to it while travelling, however, when you rest in your private room you are given the choice to listen to music. This isn't much of a problem though since the whole soundtrack is on Spotify (see link below):

505 games did an excellent job optimizing the game because I didn't encounter any bugs and had only a few FPS dips throughout the game. Bravo.

Overall, the game is really solid and I highly recommend checking it out. If you're not having fun at first, wait until you get to the [spoiler]Central[/spoiler] Region which is when the game really picks up (it's about 8 hours in). I applaud both Kojima Productions and 505 Games for bringing an excellent game to life, and I also applaud Sony for allowing Hideo Kojima to make the game he wanted without any interference on their part, something unfortunately rare in this industry.

I'm not a huge kojima fan (MGS V was his only game I really played) and not that much of a story fan in games. Usually I play multiplayer or games with little story. But death stranding combined gameplay and story really good. And if there was a huge dump of cutscenes and story it felt like you earned it and wanted to finally get to know the world better.

It's... different. Keeps you invested. Every time you come close to getting bored by the gameplay loop it introduced something new. Every time you had enough of sidequests and delivering it pulled you back in with story and action.

I've played for about 5 hours and am sad I missed the refund window. The story is completely nonsensical (again, maybe things get better later) and is explained through very long cutscenes. These look good, but since you have no idea what's going on, you'll be hard pressed to pay attention. I like narrative-based games, but this just felt like absolute nonsense, that wasn't going anywhere in the first 5 hours. 

Then the gameplay... honestly there almost isn't any. This game is about walking and moving random packages from point a to point b. There is no real danger or challenge, and before you know it the walking part is over and you're looking at a long random cutscene again. 

I liked two things about this game: the graphics are great (faces, animations and environment all look good) and I liked the community aspect, where players can leave messages or helpful artifacts in the world for other (random) players. This is a singleplayer game though. 

Ultimately those few strong points don't save this game. After even 30 minutes I was asking myself ""why am I doing this and wasting my time?"".

DS also boasts a strong cast of main characters with equally strong performances from some great actors. Gameplay is fun and addicting and the constant evolution of the methods you use to deliver packages works really well. Through my 90 hour playthrough it really only started to get a bit tedious towards the end.

Phenomenal experience and one that I highly recommend you try. Videos of gameplay do not do it justice; it's a boring watch but a very addicting play.

6,DEATH STRANDING,73419278,english,"Here it goes

Pro's
The overall game is absolutely stunning. Over 120 hours played. Graphics are amazing (RTX 2070super)
Story is 100% Kojima and a breath of fresh air although his recurrent use of the deathmask (metal gear) is a bit cheap.

Con's
While people say it's a walking simulator, which it is not, it's definitaly not a driving simulator. The bike is kinda ok, but the car is a disaster. Doesn't break, doesn't do slopes well, wheels not spinning when you throttle, wheels still spinning when you break. Jumping the car is bad, when stuck with the front wheels it should jump the front wheels, etc.. So, stay away from cars. Use ziplines.

Likes.
If you are unlucky as I was being on a server with too many chinese, they will ruin the game. They don't work at building roads or zip lines but focus on likes. I have found a chinese bridge near every location which serves no function at all. Some of these useless bridges have over 200.000 likes while strategically placed bridges, generators etc barely reach 1.000.
They start building the pavers by putting half the amount of materials in it so their name show up. I practically have build the entire road on the map.
I have seen ziplines built just outside of range or not reachable due to an obstacle. A lonely zipline had over 100.000 likes and was absolutely unusable.
After one day playing after launch there was one guy with 225 legendary deliveries. Just like on the ark servers, they cheat and ruin games.
I can go on for hours but that wouldn't be fair to the game designers.

I still had fun and hope Kojima makes a space game next. With no Chinese if possible.",1595947911,1595947911,TRUE,0,1,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,168,12,7971,0,7514,1596024387,,

8,DEATH STRANDING,73416086,english,"I've played this game on PS4 for about 200 hours and I bought it for PC on the day it came out. Another one of my favourite games, mainly due to the storyline. The storyline and cutscenes are time consuming but a masterpiece nonetheless, in typical Hideo Kojima fashion. If you're a fan of Hideo Kojima games, such as the Metal Gear Solid Series then this game should be of interest to you.

[b] Pros: [/b]
 - Amazing Storyline (not for everyone though)
 - Online Aspect of the game encourages you to help others in their games and in turn others may help you in very beneficial ways, such as building structures to help you traverse the environment.
 - Progression throughout the game is rewarding and hard jobs are worth doing in most cases.
 - Realistic Postman simulation

[b] Cons: [/b]
 - Walking Simulator (yet somehow still interested)
 - Long cutscenes and a lot of information to take in that can go over your head.
 - Missions definitely become tedious at times, going back and forth between places.

I can't think of many pros and cons for the game to be completely honest but I enjoyed the game and I found myself binging it quite often. My favourite thing about the game is probably the fact that as Hideo intended, the game is an attempt to reunite players all around the world to reconnect and help each other, whilst not physically or verbally interacting with such players, the game gives me a positive feeling and even a sense of purpose at times.

All in all, good game, I'm a massive fan of Hideo Kojima and I think he's pretty brave for making a game such as this considering Silent Hills was cancelled to make this.

15,DEATH STRANDING,73409674,english,"I wholeheartedly recommend this game with the reservation to know what you are getting into. The game is slow, it takes around 10 hours to really get going (though it did capture me from the start).

The main gameplay loop is trying to get cargo from point a to point b safe and sound. You have to traverse rough terrain and the game simulates center of gravity, momentum and you can slip on uneven terrain. You have to make it through areas with people who wanna take your cargo and areas of spooky ghosts. You can use ladders, ropes and vehicles and build structures and roads to help you on your way. All structures, equipment and cargo you build and/or leave behind will appear in other people's games and their stuff shows up on yours.

The story is very Kojima. It's weird, complicated and at times campy. Some of the names and lines are really cheesy. Despite that, I found the story and the characters really captivating.

Now the pc port does have some issues:
- I experienced some major graphical glitches first time playing, I managed to fix this with just updating my GPU drivers.
- The game requires a CPU with AVX, so make sure your CPU supports that.
- The graphics options for the game are quite limited for a pc game.

~you're always playing with other people, getting items and structures, even if you can't see them you can say hello with 5. 
~Story made me cry.
~Soundtrack and visuals were amazing .
~Zip-Lines, even thought they would never connect when I would find one. 
~This game looks amazing even on a GTX 970.
~When this game has a scene, you're dropped into it and the only thing that exists at that moment is you and the scene. I got that feeling a lot and it's really hard to find that in a video game. 
~Every boss fight was amazing and I loved every one of them. 
~Game-play is amazing and every time I get out of a stupid BT field and the music cuts in I would just take in the scenery and enjoy the moment, you get a lot of that in this game. 
~The first couple hours are a roller coaster of fun scenes and visuals and introduction. 
~This is PC, there will be mods.

Cons:
~Fuck the Junk Collector and his story-line, the acting was the worst and the only time I was pulled out of the game.
~I had a lighting graphical issue but i'm on a 970.
~Story was kinda long but well worth it by the end. 
~It dumps a lot of exposition at the end so be prepared to stick through after you go to the beach for the final time for like 2 hours. 
~vehicles are kinda bad but they can also be really good at times. you could fix this with a mod.

29,DEATH STRANDING,72863620,english,"When I initially wrote my review I was only a few hours in.  The 1/2 of the game is kind of entertaining in an OCD kind of way.  Wanting to get 5 stars, or at least 4, so you can get the upgraded items.  The story is the best part of the game.  Too bad there aren't more of them.  The 1/3 of the game is slow, the 2/3 of the game picks up in story and in action,  but the final third of the game is where the game shines.  And the way they make it an ""online"" game but never seeing others in unique.  The ""walking simulator"" is only a small portion of the game.  You get a bike and a truck relatively soon into the game.  

The fights with BTs are easy but fun.  The gun fights can be challenging til you realize all you have to do is hit and run.   I still really enjoyed the battles though, especially when there is 2-4 BTs popping up all over the place.  

The story is great, though a bit confusing.  Its kind of on some Inception type ****.  Nothing makes sense until the end.  I'm watching the credits roll and still scratching my head on some stuff though.  One of those things I will have to google to see what everything I didn't catch means.  

There is some good music in the game, but you will never hear it.  I don't understanding why they have all these tunes in the game but never play them except for like 3 seconds when you're on a mountain 30 seconds from a city where it will stop.

You can dedicate hours into building structures creating a network of roads bridges recharge stations and pit stops to help other players through the game. You can attempt to infiltrate MULE territory to reclaim lost cargo steal their vehicles and get out with more than what you came in with. You can go BT hunting filling your inventory with blood bags and guns to or just go out there with sneaking around with your cufflinks.
The boss fights are pretty good, being caught by a BT when you are unprepared or under prepared is a punishing and devastating experience. And when you load up too much you are punished for your hubris. 
The Vehicles a good way to get around but you can go more places by foot and until you build enough structures vehicles can be a pain to lug around.

41,DEATH STRANDING,73401982,english,"I'm just going to share my honest opinions about this game.

I love the story, characters, visuals, UI, the game is smooth as butter. I have 0 performance issues and overall this is an extremely well done port from what I can see, if you have already played and enjoyed this game then it's worth picking up on PC if that's what you're into. 

That being said, this game feels like a chore, because I play it to get to the story and the characters and learn more about the world. The setting is so interesting and you want to know more, that it keeps you somewhat motivated to play the game. If not for that, I feel that this game would be a total failure. The gameplay loop does not captivate me or keep me even remotely interested. You feel pretty helpless against the enemies, even though you can dispatch enemies pretty easily most of the time. They are not super hard, even the BT's don't stand a chance if you just run away from them. Not saying that's the optimal strategy, but it works. So you're walking nearly everywhere, delivering packages on foot. That's the game, and if you're expecting more than that, I would say don't play this game, because at it's core this is a walking simulator. It's a damn good walking simulator, but a walking simulator. 

Another thing that I just personally get annoyed with in this game, is when I actually am in the mood to deliver packages and mellow out for a while, it constantly interrupts your play with tutorials, messages, guys talking to you, guys warning you, when you get a new item everyone has to explain what it does. Sometimes they are incredibly lengthy in their explanation of a mission, even though it's really not that complicated what you're doing most of the time. Sometimes characters will literally have nearly the same conversations that you just had with a previous character about a mission or item. It can actually be very annoying. 

And at the end of the day, your goal is to deliver packages safely to their location, and build roads and other items to assist others and yourself for the next journey. It's not for me. I feel like this game is missing something very important that would make it much more interesting for me, I don't think it's combat.",1595916122,1595916122,FALSE,33,3,0.686478555,1,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,156,33,442,0,442,1595913541,,

- Graphics are fantastic

- The game runs very well, great PC version (High fps and no crashes)

- The atmosphere is awesome

- The gameplay is relaxing to me (Finding the best way up big mountains, doing deliveries, etc.)

- Online aspects are great, you can build ladders, ropes, bridges and all kinds of things for others to use!

- Good voice acting

- Love the vehicles



Negatives =

- Combat that is here is not that great (Thankfully you don't have to do a crazy amount if you don't want)

-The game might just not be for some people, what I find relaxing others might find boring 

- Writing is a mixed bag, the overall idea for the story is very good and there are some great characters but Kojima stumbles overall in this department, trying to be David Lynch a little to much (Who is one of my favorite directors ever), but in the end some of the strange Lynchian style stuff feels forced at times.

This game is definitely like no other game I have ever seen at a AAA level. The soundtrack is amazing and I'm really annoyed that you do not hear it enough. You should have a music player for when you are out in the world. the gameplay is repetitive but is strangely addictive. From the surface it may look like an ""amazon delivery"" the game but that is not the whole truth. The game has elements of combat, stealth, cargo management and also small glimpses of ""horror"".

Everything fits so well and the atmosphere in the world feels convincing. The game looks very good but what new game does not? However, I have never taken this many screenshots in a game I played. the included Photomode is pretty good and fun to play around with

The story and characters are very interesting and make the game fun to play. You are always curious about what will happen next. The large group of actors does a great job of being a part of the world. Also some fun easter eggs.

The fact that you exist in the same world as other players and see how they affect your world by building equipment, buildings or leaving vehicles for you is very cool. You get the feeling that you belong to something bigger in the world.

But no game is perfect. Even though the game runs very well, especially with DLSS, it has crashed a number of times. You have no music player in the world and the threat from BTs disappears quite quickly.

This is definitely a game that is not for everyone but I think everyone should at least try it. The first 2 hours do not give the game a real chance. But when the story starts to get started and the world opens up, it gets better.

Graphics are a photo realistic dreamy masterpiece.

User interface is intricate with many layers of depth. From the fantastic quality of life camera views which allow one to experience the game from a first person view in compass mode to the very flexible third person view which feels very natural and enhances the realism of the physics to the scanners which allow me to detect resources, abandoned lost cargo deliveries, enemies in the environment etc along with the different maps everything is done in a very professional high level of function respecting the intelligence of the player to explore and figure it all out while giving a tight comforting grip of hand holding guidance which makes all these intricate systems a joy to use and experiment with where I never felt lost or frustrated.

Music and sound effects are beyond description in their excellence. All I can is when playing DEATH STRANDING I am not in my room but in another world familiar yet alien like a glimpse into a future not quite here. A deja vu moment in reverse.

Story is thus far very enjoyable where I am feeling emotionally invested in the outcome of things from making deliveries which can be very peaceful and tranquil traveling along the uncanny valley of realism that is the mountains and nature of DEATH STRANDING to terrifying throbbing with tension encounters with threats I come across where reality becomes transfigured into a disjointed jumbled nightmare of unleashed insanity to talking with inspiring charismatic characters one feels a certain bond with almost right away as they communicate with a natural lifelike authenticity not seen in many games.

6,DEATH STRANDING,73371793,english,"I understand that this is a sort of divisive game to people, but I'll try and explain why I enjoy it so much in the most succinct way I can.

If you really wanted to reduce this game down to a snappy descriptor then ""walking simulator"" would make sense, but I don't think that term does it enough justice. A lot of walking simulators, leaving out how good/not good they are, are extremely passive experiences: The Vanishing of Ethan Carter for instance, or Dear Esther - both games that I absolutely adore and have revisited many times, consist of a gameplay loop where, for the most part, you can hold ""W"" from start to finish to get this gist of the story and experience most of what there is to do. Death Stranding really diverges from this in an important way in that, since the game is first and foremost about traversal, the ACT of traversal has been made integral to the experience of the game. As you move shipments and materials across the broken American landscape you aren't just holding ""W"" to go from point A to point B... you're having to put a lot of thought into how you want to get from point A to point B, and not in the same that you might consider traversal in other open world games - there's a group of bandits here, an enemy encampment there, etc, though all of those things ARE factors in Death Stranding - it comes down ""oh there's a rock field this way that'll make it really hard to maintain my balance, and the rough terrian might lead my shoes to degrade too rapidly, maybe I should take another path thats a big longer but easier to navigate."" In this way I think that the America represented in Death Stranding is one of the more purposefully thoughtout game worlds in recent memory, because every gameplay instance requires you to consider in depth the terrain you will encounter, the rivers, the estuaries, the mountain ranges, the cliffs, the muddy river banks, etc, as you determine how you want to reach your destination. I haven't had to think about traversal in an open world game this way... probably ever. In Skyrim you can pretty much walk in a straight line to any given point as long as you're willing to deal with a couple of steep inclines. Same with Fallout, same with Grand Theft Auto, etc. I think if there wasn't the balancing mechanic in this game I wouldn't enjoy this nearly as much. Each delivery is a puzzle that can be approached multiple ways based on your equipment, gear, exoskeleton, and perserverance. 

DOOM Eternal is one of my favorite games this year in how satisfying it is to sit back and fall into a blissful state of running around, ripping and tearing, jumping and grapplehooking, etc, but Death Stranding is a close runner up in how blissful it is to just trek across the midwest with a bunch of metal and resin strapped to my back as I make deliveries for people at the top of mountains and at the bottom of gorges. I'm still rather early in the story because I've been taking my time with it but the gameplay has me hooked. 

If you want a game to sit down with and just relax to, I can't recommend this highly enough. Absolute bliss.",1595876927,1595876927,TRUE,0,1,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,383,15,4634,110,2314,1601095121,,

I endured, God knows I endured, cringy dialog, repetitive and mundane gameplay, unintuitive GUI, but the plot, the PLOT BROKE ME.

The story doesn’t make sense, the delivery is awful, the characters are bland, and pointless, there is large cast that exists purely for decoration and exposition. The biggest issue is that characters don’t have any motivation for any of their actions.

Visionary sci-fi, great graphics with some downright beautiful landscapes and the best character animations I've seen this side of LA Noire, challenging and methodical gameplay and traversal, and the asynchronous multiplayer features add to the theme of the game and give you a great feeling of camraderie with your fellow gamer.  Using the tools you have to come up with your own routes around obstacles and then seeing other players use your route feels really rewarding.  Runs great on a 1070 at 1440p.

Update: Beat the game, what a ride but the story kind of eats itself/gets up its own ass towards the end. Make sure you have several hours to spend on cutscenes before you get to the endgame, it's almost as bad as MGS4 as far as indulgent Kojima stuff but for me it does hit more often than it misses, really good performances, and I struggle to think of a more creatively and thematically ambitious game that I've played lately.  It hits tons of different notes and game styles; action, shooter, rpg, walking simulator, puzzler, light MMO elements too. I don't think I will replay it but I got my money's worth.

It's got in-depth characters and lore as well as world building. Gameplay is smooth and can be almost meditative in its style. I love the extensive list of top-tier actors alongside Norman Reedus XD ウォーキング・デッド、ボンドック・セイント、ブレード・セカンド、ライド

There's very few games I can even compare this to. I guess at times it gives me a Metal Gear Solid vibe mixed with the survival genre, walking sims, MMOs (Deliveries similar to fetch quests and lots of walking, driving, etc...) and supernatural / sci-fi horror set in an expansive post apocalyptic, cyberpunk, dystopian open world (Probably the best I've ever seen). There is potentially 100+ hours worth of content with just the side missions alone not counting the main quest line. This truly is GOD material.

This is one of those games where you can take your time and enjoy every moment. The visuals are crisp and some of the best I've ever gazed upon (Damn near photorealistic). The picture mode feature is also really fun to use and adds to the overall replayability. 

This title is way ahead of its time and is even more relevant now than ever drawing parallels to the real world (Isolation, Divided people, Divided states, Deliveries as an essential way of life, trying to help one another) as well the many layers of deep themes and pop cultural references. This is the perfect game to play without having to worry about anything. The cutscenes themselves are better than most films and shows much like the MGS games. 

This is an easy 10/10 for me and I highly recommend getting it even at full price as it is definately worth it.

Walking is boring in most games, but this one adds so much more to it.  You have to plan your route, equip yourself for the trek, decide whether or not grabbing that extra piece of cargo is worth being over encumbered.  There is a lot of story and lore to follow.  The pacing is a little slow for the first 3 hours or so.  Once you get to the next region, things get way more interesting.  Personally, even the beginning wasn't boring imo.  As you progress, the terrain gets more difficult to navigate, but you get better equipment to combat it.  Speaking of combat, this game does not have the best combat mechanics out there.  That said, that's not the point of the game.  There are vehicles and roads and zip lines to build at a certain point, all make the going a little more forgiving, however you do need to save up a lot of materials for these things.  Not to mention everything you build is shared with other players and vice versa.  Everybody's world looks a little different and we all help each other with every little thing we do.

92,DEATH STRANDING,73336312,english,"I wanted to love Death Stranding, I had seen it hyped for more than a year as a groundbreaker title.  I liked the concept, I like the backstory of Kojima struggling with those pricks at Konami and finally getting to craft his swan song game.  I jumped immediately into Very Hard difficulty and tried to immerse myself in this thing.

And struggled...and struggled...and began to hate the game.  It has terrible menus, very confusing concepts that aren't well explained, and the controls are the purest jank.  But it looked amazing, felt amazing when I was succeeding, and I could see the potential as I pushed forward.  

So there is a learning curve, less so with the core mechanics of the game and more so with the controls and menus.  In time I've learned to love this game so I'm going to just throw a couple non spoiler help for anyone like me out there (as this game is about helping others through the slog of the journey).  
You are ridiculously underpowered and incapable in the beginning, deal with it, the main threats that face you nearly destroyed humanity...so think of it like that.  Do not concern yourself with trying to 'boost up' or do anything than walk the main plot path till act 3 (after the boat), you will gain advantages after that that will make you capable enough not to feel like a punching bag.  Also use F in the cargo menu to auto balance your gear unless you are trying to create a specific weight effect, its a huge time saver.  The rain wears everything evenly so don't bother with placement tricks. The speed of the container wear is about 10x time of the item wear, so don't stress.  Once the container is toast...you can bring the container back from zero.  The restorative can is area of affect cloud so place containers smart, and don't do it in the rain unless you have to....that percentage damage score at the end of the run is nothing to worry about.
The 'yellow' grenades disperse BTs from an area but cause no harm, it make take them a second to leave.  The 'red' grenades are direct damage but one may not be enough.  When you throw a grenade, you right click to get the arc, but then you left and hold to get a different more direct arc that is 1000% a superior throw.  Anything that affects a BT will cause other BTs in the area to aggressively search the area where the 'ruckus' took place.  Use this to manipulate them out of your path.  DO NOT face the evil tentacle dolphins without superior killing firepower, but if you do take one out that local storm will be gone for a while.
Give to other players like you are Mother Teresa.  There are an excess of materials for what you need to do, and being generous with equipment and materials to their structures, and relying on other players to handle things for you pays off.  The like system is a social currency that boosts everyone dynamically.  Reward other players with glorious thumbs and your character will grow as theirs do.  There is a time window where you can rapidly give likes before it closes out, you hit the button rapidly.
Saving can be finicky, basically if you are not in harms way you can save, though there is a buffer around what is obviously 'harm's way'.  There are two types of rain storms, moving and static, early on all of them are static...deal with them as a hazard not something to wait out.  The menu system is...horrible...it will make you crazy, get used to it.  The game will throw a ton of terms and concepts at you without explaining it.  A lot of the acting is terrible, even what is handled by the Hollywood b-listers and there are so so many cut scenes (which you can mostly skip).  The plot is um...I mean the core concept is freaky and cool but...yeah it's really dumb.  Also there is a lot of male partial nudity which is...uh...I don't know, ask Hideo Kojima.  

Just be patient with the 1st two chapters (which is like 10+ hours) and the game will open up and the fun will be there.

94,DEATH STRANDING,73335612,english,"As a big, big MGS fan and Kojima defender, I really wanted to love this game and patiently avoided spoilers and gameplay until the PC release. I knew the game drew mixed reviews but I had enough faith in Kojima as an auteur that I was pretty confident it would be well worth my while. Even with MGSV burning me a bit story-wise after failing to deliver on the incredible trailers, it still provided a fantastic gameplay experience and I could blame Konami for rushing the game out. 

Unfortunately this is the first game directed by Kojima that I won't be finishing, and the second game of his in a row where I felt the trailers overall were a greater artistic achievement than the game itself. Dude should just become a film director like he clearly aspires to be.

The game started with a bang, and I was quite hooked albeit it felt awkward to handle, moreso because my controller had problems with the triggers in this game and M+KB isn't ideal in this one. About 10 hours in the gameplay started to feel like work albeit satisfying work. 20 hours in, I felt like I was having to force myself to continue. The breaking point was when I made the longest and most difficult trek yet from A to B, only to immediately be told to go back from B to A, and then immediately back from A to B. At this point I really just wanted to advance the story, so in my carelessness I Game Over'd twice on my way back to B, sending me back to A, at which point I had to admit defeat and put the game down.

While the gameplay is original and not-uninteresting, it's just not very good either. It gives you a bunch of tools to figure out novel ways to transit around the terrain, but I found myself not excited by the possibilities, and just tried to build roads and use vehicles whenever I could (this in spite of the fact that the vehicles handle TERRIBLY - there is no excuse for this in 2020). The enemies I mostly zoomed past as it was a viable option, and there didn't seem much incentive to interact with them. And exploration revealed very little interesting to discover - yes a side effect of the game's setting, but bleh. Boss fights up to the point I played were highly underwhelming, little sense of peril or agency.

The environments are beautiful but I've been to Iceland so I've seen all the types of terrain in this game in real life, and walked among them, so the game loses a bit of its glamour in that regard. And there's almost never any bloody music when you're traveling around! Terrible design choice.

The premise and themes of the game are fascinating, and the earlier cutscenes start you off with a bang (heh), but the pacing gets sooooo wack as you progress in the game. You'll go hours where you get nothing other than holograms giving you generic ""Golly Sam, thanks for the delivery!"" messages which are completely soulless. Then every few hours there's a side-story that tries to give you a little burst of emotional involvement but they tended to feel flat and awkward to me, moreso because so much of the character interactions were bland, and even many of the main-story cutscenes are just two people talking in a grey room. I am still quite interested to finish seeing the main story, because I LOVE the themes about disconnection, social media, individualism vs collectivism etc, but I am content to experience it by watching the cutscenes on YouTube instead of completing the slog.

The online elements were quite cool, it was fun sightlessly co-operating with other players and felt rewarding to build structures that other players got use out of. Not enough to compel me to keep playing though.

I would only recommend this game if it goes on sale for $20 or so. And I have lost quite a bit of faith in Kojima as a game director.",1595809893,1595809893,FALSE,4,0,0.517054558,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,74,7,1343,0,1343,1595804858,,
95,DEATH STRANDING,73335429,english,"This game is definitely a slow burn. I almost got bored of it a few hours in, but I am really digging being a delivery Reedus now! The more tools, vehicles and gear you unlock the more fun it becomes to plan your route effectively and try to accept orders in a way that you can hit multiple stations while picking up even more orders on the way. Even evading BT's and other enemies makes for some fun change up's enough to not get bored of just delivering. The cinematography and visuals in this game are amazing. I've sat in aw with my controller drooping out of my hands more then once. Just beautiful. And I'm only on a 1070, only 1080p just a rock solid 60fps almost maxed out. Very well optimized.

The building and sharing of the waste land is so clever. Even tho you never see an actual player, you feel like your helping people out and getting help in return. I just spent 3 hours today starting to build the highway system, and every once in a while I will get notifications that someone used my part of the highway or sent me a like for another structure I built that may have helped them out at a rough time. It's a very unusual sense of community, you never see or talk to anyone but you don't feel alone.

The story is so messed up, half the time I don't know what's going on, but I love every second of it. The more you actually start to understand the more interesting this world becomes. It definitely drives me to get to the next cut scene. The cast is amazing and the performances are cinema quality. Hard to talk about any story beats without spoiling, every little unveil is a treat.

If your even thinking about getting this game, just do it. There's nothing like this on the market and there may not ever be for quite some time.

98,DEATH STRANDING,73333474,english,"Like his prior works, auteurist Hideo Kojima has rain-soaked his latest masterpiece in deep spiritual and philosophical symbolism. The game itself is a meditation on koyaanisqatsi (Hopi for ""life out of balance"") and this theme can be found as immediately as the introduction to gameplay. From the grassy, desolate fields broken up by craggy hills, to the moody and melancholy sounds of Low Roar and Silent Poets, this piece exudes craftsmanship and pines for the deep consideration of the player.

In a world where humankind believed itself to nearly solve the problem of death through science, the bodies of the living now decay into invisible, restless horrors that stalk the rain-stormed plains. Those familiar with Japanese spiritualism will note that night is never shown to fall, and thus symbolically the spirit world no longer draws close to the living, stranding the souls of the dead in our reality. So also, the ocean serves as a classic motif for life while the shore can be thought of as a passage into the next realm or a barrier to it. A trip to the bay is itself a confrontation with the reality of death and life.

Many questionable aspects of modernity are unpacked throughout, much like the warning essays of Junichiro Tanizaki. The player must decide what habits are worth building up or automating away; craft against convenience. Cellular devices are depicted as shackles clipped to the wrist to feed you numbers, while the superficial networks that connect them and other installations slowly kill the environment surrounding, shown by shale plants shaped like hands reaching up through the dirt. Infants themselves are reduced to hardware commodities, necessary to better the conditions of the already living. The very footsteps of the BTs fill with oil, leaving dead earth in their wake.

Kojima continues his laudable dialog on reconciling the strengths of the American Dream against the moors of nuclear proliferation that continue to hold the natural fate of humanity hostage. He leaves it up to the player to decide whether the convenience of taking a life will outweigh the resulting ""voidout.""

While extending both the physical and information highways, players have the opportunity to form deeper connections with other characters, to juxtapose the superficial against the substantial, for a far deeper contemplation on the social aspects of media. Myself, I am only three chapters in and already I feel welcomingly confronted by the many questions being asked of me. In particular, is death something to flee, or is it a part of life?

99,DEATH STRANDING,73334761,english,"Death Stranding is a very good game.  Sure it's got some flaws, as most games do, but nonetheless, none of them were major and I really enjoyed playing it.  
Post apocalypse deliveries is the fundamental task you will be performing when you play Death Stranding. For this reason alone, this is a game that is not for everyone.  On the up side, there are very few games like it, which makes it a good title if you are tired of playing the same old types of games over and over or just want to try something different.  Additionally, I feel it's worth your while for the freaky deaky story if nothing else.   
The story of the Death Stranding is a weird one, and it is fed to you throughout playing the game.   Advance a little, and you are exposed to a little about the history and lore of the Death Stranding and the slew of other terms used in the game.  

What exactly is this game about?  Well, at some point in our future, something happened and a lot of people died as a result, this is the Death Stranding (DS).  Many years after the DS, you are working as a delivery man, living the good life, doing what you want to do, answering to no one.  Very early in the game you are convinced by the last president of the US to attempt to help bring the former United States back together in a new nation called the United Cities of America.  Your task, when making your deliveries, is to connect these cities to a network spanning coast to coast, which allows the rapid sharing of information and other resources.
The world of DS is freaking gorgeous!  The environments you encounter are a variety of natural environments and ruins of man-made ones look amazing.  But don't let the pretty mountain fool you, what may seem pretty easy to navigate from afar can turn south when you get up close and see the path is actually pretty treacherous.  You will need to use your wits and tools to navigate these environments in order to make your deliveries on-time.  Thank heavens there is no night time, you would fall off a cliff and die so hard many, many times. 

The controls can be aggravating and clunky at times, it takes a while to get a genuine feel for them.  Just when you master the controls of one aspect of the game, they throw something new at you, but the learning curve gets shorter with each new aspect.

Combat is different, not the strongest aspect of the game.  It just doesn't have a responsive FPS feel when in combat.  However, the combat system seems to work given that combat is not really your primary role in the game, delivering stuff is.  Still, some better or more responsive controls would be nice to have.
Sometimes the menus ask for different button presses when exiting a menu.  This is kind of annoying, but not a game breaker.

As you are moving through the world of DS, it would seem some nice motion mechanics have been built using some real world physics, which adds to the sense of immersion you feel while playing.  But those physics seem to be set on random at times when weird stumbles, or when vehicle speed and direction go all bizzaro on you for no apparent reason... so be prepared for that, especially in inclement weather.

Driving is even more frustrating than stumbling and falling on your face with a big load of cargo on foot.  You will curse a lot behind the wheel.

Interactions with other people are a welcome event, until it becomes repetitive and they say nothing new on repeat visits.  Conan O'Brien is in it. 

The only glitch I experienced while playing was what seemed to be an internal memory leak, which caused some issues with gameplay after 5 or so hours some of the time.

Many have said this game is too repetitive, and they are right, it is.  In conclusion I counter with this; Even though you seem to be doing the same missions and mission types over and over, your character and the resources available are always evolving in the game.  Each new discovery, or enhancement you uncover gives you a chance to take on repeating missions in new and improved ways, often much faster than before.  The game seems to have a good pace for me, one where things will get changed up right at the onset of being tired with the current way of doing things... This seems to happen all the way up until the end of the game.",1595807995,1595807995,TRUE,2,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,139,18,4575,0,4575,1595789762,,

Yes there are ghosts, which the baby you carry in a bottle on your chest (yes a baby) allows you to see. You don’t really fight the ghosts, you try to hide from them by holding your breath, but since they don’t then go away you have to eventually walk past them and when they see you, the game allows you to spam a key to ‘shake them off’. If you succeed you get to go walk some more, if you fail you die, and then get to come back to life and go find the packages you dropped so you can pick them up and walk some more. It is as though someone watched people play video games and thought, “They spend a lot of time walking around the map and trying to climb over obstacles, that must be what they like about games”  Once you deliver things you get to go to your room and rest, and go to the bathroom.

So yeah Kojima's out of control here, we have breathtaking visuals, we have setting like no other. But all together it does little sense, game tries very hard to be deep and thought provoking but all it does is dropping 15 anvils a minute,

The standart block of the game goes like this:
1) Hey sam porter BRIDGES, it's important to build BRIDGES, here's your STRAND help us all get CONNECTED.
2) You built a BRDIGE THANKS that will help us all be CONNECTED, you are like STRAND holding us all together.
3) In a world that revolves around delivering cargo where everyone's a courier you were the first one to deliver my stained comicbook 300 meters across in literally decade. THANKS SAM.
4) Some movie with Mads/Some talk on the beach mixed in.
5) You feel very clever and getting likes in the process.

At some point I had a feeling that game is consious about it's shallow overuse of CONNECTION theme and thanking protagonist for every smallest step taken and even ironic about it. But I was wrong, and it's horrifying that the game is dead serious about it.

98,DEATH STRANDING,72812244,english,"I tried to give this game a fair shot (70 hours as of writing this), but several things really put me off of this game, which is why I don't recommend it.

1) It would've been better if you weren't so limited on how much you can build, by the small amount of bandwidth they give you in the game. The building aspect opened up some really cool options for progressing in the game, but you have to be very discerning on which options to pursue, because there's no way you'll be able to accomplish more than a fraction of what you'd like to do. I really wish they didn't have a bandwidth limit in this single-player game.

2) There is so much time, effort, and resources required to rebuild the roads, reconnect the Knots, and do all the things you'd like to do, if you're the completionist type; yet so very little payoff. By the end of the game, you can have all the tools you need to conquer the terrain and the BTs, but you have to progress too far in the main story, to unlock everything. While I don't think they should give you everything at the start, I feel I had to work too hard and too long for the next item in my toolkit. This is an open world, not a linear one, so the excessive wait for the next upgrade felt too unreasonable.

3) I still have a lot of questions about the story and the world. A lot of people like to joke about, or even praise, how abstract the lore is, but I just find it to be an unnecessary pain in the ♥♥♥. I still don't have a solid understanding of how the original catastrophe took place, and that's something that most other games would explain early on, so that you can feel a connection to the past, and make sense of the present. I'm definitely not impressed with Kojima's rambling abstraction.

4) You are CONSTANTLY backtracking in this game. I really feel like games which rely on a lot of backtracking to pad out their content, are lazy. And this game compounds the non-stop (that's not an exaggeration) backtracking with frustratingly-difficult terrain, which must be overcome to get from point A to point B. You have the option to fabricate tools to help you with this, to an extent, but you can't just build bridges over everything, because your bandwidth is limited. You can lay down ladders, but the rain causes everything to degrade over time (including structures you had to spend resources on to build), and the vehicles you unlock are only useful when you don't have to constantly fight the same terrain over the same routes.

5) Quest design in this game is simply lazy. It is apparent that very little effort went into making running cargo fun and interesting. It's always the same copy/paste mission where you load up on packages from the north city, move them to the east city, then move packages from the east city to the north city. Over the same terrain obstacles. Over and over. Then eventually, you'll unlock the west city. Will the method to transport packages to the west city be different? lol, nah. The terrain might change, and you may need to use a different set of tools to get there, but you'll stop being impressed after the 15th run there and back, in order to get enough stars to unlock the next upgrade.

6) Interacting with the NPCs outside the main plot is pointless. You usually don't ever get to meet them in person (except for a couple notable exceptions), instead just communicating with their hologram. And their reaction can be boiled down to, ""Oh wow; you're the chosen one! It's such an honor to get a package from you, and it's in such good condition too. And the next 20 times you deliver something to me, in order to unlock my next upgrade, I will deliver the exact same dialogue.""

In conclusion, if the game had been more generous with the frequency at which you unlock the next upgrade, removed the unreasonably-strict building bandwidth limitations, and not lazily relied so heavily on non-stop backtracking over the same frustrating terrain obstacles, I could've enjoyed it a lot more. Or perhaps if I just focused on the main story and skipped the side content (I tend to try and complete as much as I can), I wouldn't have felt so frustrated and bored. But at the end of the day, it all just left me feeling a bit tired and poorly rewarded for all my effort.",1594941375,1595738758,FALSE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,164,2,4219,0,4219,1595733410,,

I was completely hooked from the start. The first couple of hours were packed with a story I could get into it. It sets the tone of the game, and is the reason that makes wanting to come back to the game. After around 5 hours the story starts to show a little less, and the main game-play loop starts. For me I enjoyed the game-play. I felt it to be satisfying and actually enjoyable. I know some find it to be a drag, but I am a fan of the delivery sim style of game-play. Anyway, after the opening of the story and the end of the game you decided what pace you go at to complete the game. I have seen people say they spent the first 30+ hours in just chapter 3! Personally I was so interested in the story that I didn't do many of the side missions, but instead powered through the story. The last couple of hours are just like the start, a lot of story told through many fantastic cutscenes. Honestly the animation and voice acting in this game is 100% some of gaming's greatest. As I continue to write this review I realize I want to say so much, but I'm not trying to write an essay. I start to close it up now. Honestly I loved every second of this game.

The story all in all, is pretty good, but not as amazing as you'd might expect from Kojima. 
The game itself is really enjoyable though. The tie-in with Half-life and Portal, is a funny little distraction.

It's also this however, which might keep some people from playing the game. The vast majority of the game, is just you, delivering packages, walking or driving from city to city.

I was this >< close to getting a refund. 
Then you get let loose to do your own thing and make your way in the world and it gets interesting. 
It was probably helped by me being a hiker who very often is in almost exactly the wet upland environment of the early game. It felt very recognisable. 
Then I spent a couple of RL days wandering lost in snow in the game. The snow visuals and mechanisms are really well done. The experience was immersive in a way that I've not felt in a game for a long time.
When looking for a new game on Steam I have a thought in mind: “I want to go on an adventure”. This is very rarely fulfilled but, just for once, it was with Death Stranding. 
The story is still a ridiculous eco/pseudo-intellectual crack-dream. But never mind that, DS is an adventure.   

Update:
Just finished it. Including the 2 hours of  ""cut"" scene ending that had the credits twice!

Opinion after these hours of gameplay?
Menu are horrible you don't understand what is your destination cause everything looks the same, im used to skip all the menus after delivery something cause they are hard only to look at and to read.

When you enter the game everytimes and you forgot what you were doing, You go to your orders and it's just a mess to look at the map, full of indicators and weird simbles.

Why every menu must be blue in the game? They could have added different colors for different waypoints, everything is blue even sam clothes are Blue.

Another thing that bothers me are the waypoint paths that disappears everytimes and it's pressing G or Tab everytime to recalibrate your path to show it. If you get too far away from the path you won't see it again, and everytimes you have to press G to locate your destinations, but it's hard cause you got so many waypoints that you loose yourself, so you have to erase all your waypoints and recreate the path you have to follow... the solution was simply to have a specific key that shows you the position of your path and a compass would have been so useful...they are so advanced but they don't use a compass.

Also it's a game of Kojima you will hate it and love it for his complicated mechanics.

It's slow, boring and convoluted. The gameplay mechanics are questionable and make me think that Kojima maybe smoking the frog glue or something.

15,DEATH STRANDING,73253740,english,"Absolute masterpiece and work of art. This game will not be for everyone, but if you want to see excellence in cinematography and storytelling, you're in for a FANTASTIC journey. The gameplay itself is decent for what it is. On foot, the game shines. It has its janky moments but there was something oddly satisfying about conquering the worst terrain ""post Death Stranding"" America had to offer. Vehicular travel left much to be desired, if they had tuned it more towards GTA levels of fidelity, it would have been a lot better, but its not too huge of a deal. (Because ziplines are king) 

A lot of people ask in my long hours of gameplay if I would recommend Death Stranding... and thats honestly hard for me to answer... because the answer is different based on the person asking. Are you someone who only cares about gameplay, hates cutscenes and dialogue? Don't get it. Its not for you. 

Do you love deep and intricate storytelling with beautiful landscapes and scenery? Then I would recommend this game for  you. This game is more like watching a movie. If you've played Metal Gear Solid.. you're already in tune with what to expect from a Hideo Kojima game. You'll get the quirkiness, the humor, and the little oddities. But if you're not the patient type or you do not want to try anything new and out of the ordinary, just skip.. I would rather hear you say you did not try it because you're not into it, rather than listen to another dunkey review of it. Just know what you're getting into and the type of person you are. 

Its much like people who don't like sushi or only like cheese pizza. If you'd just try something new, you might find a whole world of experiences you never knew you'd enjoy, but instead you settle for cheese fucking pizza for your entire existence... sad. 

As for me, I appreciated everything and I feel Death Stranding puts a LOT of movies and TV shows to shame. It told a complete story, no loose ends, no questions, no sequel baiting in and of itself. The stars who lent their talent to the game are amazing. Having characters modeled after actual people does wonders for immersion. It was a brilliant move, it made the strange world of Death Stranding actually believable. 

Anyways, full disclosure I am a Hideo Kojima fan if you didn't guess so already, but I would not spend the time to write a review if I did not enjoy the game.

24,DEATH STRANDING,72795774,english,"There is nothing new I can say about Death Stranding that you haven't already been told if you're looking at reviews.

This is definitely not a game for everyone, it's a game where the core gameplay is literally walking from point A to point B and delivering packages. You have various places to pick up packages from, the packages are different size and weight. Some are fragile (but not that fragile), some can't be placed placed vertically or they will be ruined. You take these packages where they need to go, and then you get points for how good condition the packages are, how fast you got there, how much you carried or things like that you had to travel into the mountains or something.

The idea of the gameplay is terrible. It does sound absolutely awful. But it isn't. The gameplay is really engaging. You see, walking isn't usually something that you get gameplay from. Walking is what you do between gameplay moments. In World of Warcraft, you walk between areas where you kill enemies, gather rocks or whatever else. In Minecraft you walk to get to resources or your home or whatever.

In Death Stranding walking isn't something you do to get to gameplay. Walking IS the gameplay. Picking up packages, choosing equipment, planning routes is all part of the preparation for the walking, the gameplay.

The walking isn't simply holding forward on the left stick or holding down W. If you have packages that are heavy, you might start to sway from side to side, you might start to trip over rocks or get swept away in rivers. It requires you to pay attention to what you are doing. There is a geographical scanner called an odradek, which scans the landscape and tells you of potential hazards. You get to a river, you scan to see where you can cross without falling over.

The map isn't flat. There are mountains and cliffs, which means you can't just walk straight to your goal. You can bring ladders with you, climbing ropes too. You can construct bridges to get over rivers. The ladders and machines to construct things take up space on your back though, meaning you have to choose how much to bring with you.

The structures you build can also be put into another players world. Sometimes you'll find a ladder built by another player, with a sign next to it with a happy face. If you want to say thank you to the player, you can like the structure. This shows a message in the other players world, showing them that their ladder was useful to someone else.

This extends to the entire game and almost everything in it. You can't see other players, but there are ladders built in places. You can't do anything else but like them if they are useful. Seeing a massive river that you can't cross, but seeing a bridge someone built for you further up the river is a blessing.

There is progression. I will not spoil gear progression, which there is. The progression that is most important is the feeling of quality of life. Walking through a snowstorm ruins your packages, so does rain. Someone putting up a roof over a place or showing you a way to a small cave where you can wait out the rain makes your journey slightly easier. This is the progression. In the beginning, you walk slowly from place to place, while later gameplay allows you to traverse areas faster and more easily.

The important thing is that the game doesn't allow you to have it easy to begin with, but that it slowly makes it easier with time. Allowing you to have all quality of life improvements to begin with wouldn't make you appreciate them. Spending multiple hours setting up bridges over areas and them using them to deliver packages really does it for me. Then seeing that people have liked the bridges, and seeing outlines of their footprints on them is the cherry on top. Knowing that you helped not only yourself but others too is the true endgame.

All of this is wrapped up in a confusing story. If you have played any Hideo Kojima games before, you know to expect strange stories. If you haven't played any games he's been working with, get ready for some confusion. 

There are NO story spoilers in this review.

The story is told through cutscenes, calls on the phone and hologram meeting. There are also lore texts to read, in the form of shorter ""interviews"" with characters in the game, which basically translates to shorter texts expanding the world and ideas around it.

The story is confusing, as I said. No details will be discussed. The story does not stay confusing forever. There are answers that make sense in the lore. There is an ending. There are characters with actual personalities and motivations. There are ACTUAL character-arcs if you can believe it.

The graphics are really nice. The implementation of Anti-Aliasing is not perfect, there is some noise around thinner details, like necklaces. This can be improved if you turn off sharpening. The game runs well. I ran the game on highest settings, in 1080p, on a 6700k at 4,5GHz and a 1080ti with no overclock. The game ran at over 120fps for the most part.

All of the cutscenes are at 60fps, which is a strange choice, as they seem to be in-engine, and not pre-rendered. This change of fps can be jarring if you are running a high refresh-rate monitor, but it is not a problem for the most part.

Controls on keyboard and mouse are completely fine. There are some moments when you want to hold down a few too many buttons at the same time, and there are some overly complicated situations, like having to click G, then 2, then F, then W to do a thing. There were a couple moments when I needed to press W and ALT and SPACE, left click and right click at the same time. No input lag, no mouse acc or smooth. 

Took me about 60 hours to beat the story. There is gameplay after the story is finished if you wanna keep delivering. Don't worry about how it fits into the story, it will make sense when you get there.

I did cry a couple times. If you know the game, you will know towards the end when the walk happens, with the music about seeing the sun setting. There was some real loud sobs, some real shaking ugly crying. A couple moments left me crying, saying ""it's not fair"" repeatedly, so that's a testament to storytelling.

A word of caution, many reviews show spoilers they don't deem spoilers. So does a lot of videos about tips and tricks. Let's say you buy the game and start playing it. Let's say you meet character A. Then you meet character B. In a video you watch on the Steam-page you see character A and B meeting. In the game you then see character A in a bad spot where they might die. You then remember that A and B haven't met yet, or that you haven't seen A do a specific thing in a cutscene yet. This makes you realize that A isn't going to die. Only watch as much as you need to before choosing to buy the game, especially if you get invested in the story.

All in all, as I said, this is not a game for everyone, but it is a game for me. If you wanna discuss this at all, my comments are open just for you.",1594917837,1595666601,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,961,35,3703,0,3703,1595614789,,

26,DEATH STRANDING,73249457,english,"Here's the thing with this game... I don't know whether to recommend it or not, but this is my second playthrough(first was on PS4) and I feel like the genius of Death Stranding unravels at a kind of glacial pace, but it does indeed reveal itself. Playing this game amidst the lockdown has really helped me out, as Death Stranding requires a bit of planning and endurance. You identify where you're going, and as the game progresses, the trips get a lot longer. The gameplay requires that you pay attention whilst on these treks across the landscape, but much of that time isn't particularly stressful or action packed. Death Stranding evolves into a kind of meditative experience, choosing routes and changing them on the fly as you encounter the realities of the terrain, staying balanced and pushing forward. It was no slouch on PS4, but on PC the game is breathtaking. It just seems like the landscape stretches forever, and it is hauntingly beautiful with the world being almost entirely void of humanity for much of the game. When battles do happen, they serve as a nice distraction from the travel, though the BT encounters can become a bit annoying at times, as they are less challenging than their disturbing presence initially suggests, and they can scatter your equipment around the landscape, making them a nuisance when you want to get your packages safely to their destination. I know this game will not be for everyone, but you know, the more I play it the more I see this as a kind of breakthrough for Kojima. Something like Death Stranding could only be done in a video game, demanding both patience and commitment, and rewarding you infrequently with exposition and narrative elements. It is a game that is unique in the sense that it stays true to its message of forging connections, and you will do this much more frequently than you beat up bad guys, which is why I believe the game is so divisive. In the end however, I've really never played a game like Death Stranding, and I think Kojima is to be applauded for that. It's a game that I believe grows on you the more time you put into it, and I think, given how unique the game is, everyone should give it a real shot and commit a bit of time, as the complete image of Death Stranding will not be revealed by playing it for a couple of hours.",1595665029,1595665029,TRUE,2,0,0.548872173,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,709,8,4994,1583,2627,1601598132,,

I originally got this game on PS4 but only played to Mountain Knot city-which is only halfway or less through the game-but then stopped as I had other things come up. I decided to pick this game up on PC and was met with AMAZING performance increases and even better visuals.

The story and moments in between made me fall in love with the game. It is a refreshing open-world to play in as you must carefully consider what you take with you and where you go, and one which has rekindled my favor for open-worlds.
But it isn't perfect.
I find the controls clunky for combat, which made some encounters tricky, but did not ruin the experience for me. Sometimes Sam controls in a way I feel clunky too, even when I am not carrying a lot.

Instead, there's a ton of filler content where you have to pick up random boxes that are scattered around and drop them in postboxes while trying to not lose your balance, while running from point A to B.  And the deliveries, even the main quests, feel very tacked on - like you have to take some morphine to an important person early on.  They even tell you they probably already have morphine there - it's a high tech facility.  They should just scrap the delivery stuff and make the quest just to travel there and speak to the person.

56,DEATH STRANDING,73238323,english,"My Official Verdict On Death Stranding: BUY IT

This review will be split into 5 SECTIONS: Gameplay, Story, Combat, Experience, Opinions

[GAMEPLAY]
Lets get the basics out of the way. This game [On PC] is optimized extremely well for most graphics cards and can push decent to great frames. Keyboard and Mouse are so easily integrated it DOES NOT feel like a console port, it feels like it was made for PC, and I respect Kojima for accomplishing that. AI in this game is very different and varies for sure. BT's will attack you if your loud enough (Example is if you fast crouch instead of slow crouching you make a decent amount of noise compared to slow crouching and holding your breathe makes a HUGE difference if you go for stealth kills). Mules get progressively harder once they aquire weapons they will do a lot more damage, but the weapons they use affect their skill and aim, so be careful when near their hideouts and areas (People say combat in this game isn't that good but for a Story driven game its on par with other games like LOUII and ghost of tsushima). Walking in this game DOES NOT take up as much time as people truly say if you are only playing to finish the story (about 10 hours of walking for 60 hours of gameplay, you'll be crouching, hiding, running, ect more than actually walking and doing nothing). Lastly multiplayer in this game functions very strangely but I think that's a good thing. So If you enjoy helping people by providing resources for others, building bunkers for everyone, bridges to making traveling a LOT easier, and get a TON of likes from real people for helping make their lives easier, I promise you'll enjoy it way past its story, if your into that sorta thing.

[STORY] [NO SPOILERS]
This is hands down a better story than 90% of games that have ever been made. This is not debatable. Its on the level of Halo, LOU, and RDR2. This story (If you can handle a little bit of walking) will take you on a emotional roller coaster and provide a very realistic sci-fi plot that is extremely creative and well thought out (Kojima is great with plots). The Begging, The middle, The End ALL reveal different ideas, entrances, moments, and gameplay. You never feel like your repeating anything (Yes walking is repeated all the way through, but honestly its like saying Riding a horse in ghost of tsushima takes up too much times and its annoying). The Characters are extremely developed in this game (Better than most TV Shows and Movies). Sam (Main Character) was the easiest to bond with because of how similar he is to you, the character, and Kojima knows how to take advantage of that. Every surprise, every choice had an impact to an extent, and the ending was breathtaking. If your not sure about buying this game, because someone told you its boring, they are dead wrong. This game has one of the greatest stories, plots, and development ever thought of. If you love a good story, this one will keep you thinking.

[COMBAT]
This game isn't exactly revolutionary when it comes to PvE, but it does it decently, enough to offer you a challenge. In the begging the game doesn't give you many weapons, most are non-lethal (Don't kill anyone = NO Voidouts). But once you start getting weapons, the games intensity goes up different stages. With new weapons unlocking, you'll also unlock new enemies and boss's to fight. For those who want a challenge HARD mode is required, as Normal mode might feel to easy and boring, trust me it makes many PvE scenerio's much harder and require much more skill (If your crazy and want a challenge start your first game in Hard Mode). Boss's Battles are mostly the same except three different strategies of boss battles (I won't spoil them because people should find out for themselves), there are 5+ boss's but some approach the player similarly, and you can fight some boss's repeatedly, and there are mini boss's (Red BT's).

[Experience]
This game isn't like other games, in fact its one of a kind, and that's a fact. This game adds realism, depth, progression, skill, tactics, multiplayer, combat, and development like no other before, in a very unique way of course. Kojima did something very different with this game, and it WILL require you to be able to accept the difference right at the BEGGINING, if you don't accept that, you wont enjoy it. Most people are used to the re-released products Game Companies sell every year, and by nature, we get used to them being the same, and this game is something you need to get used to very differently, because in essence its not a game, its a little bit of everything (Movies, Game, and Simulator). I do believe that the experience depends on a person's taste bud's, so if you only like a specific category of game, you might not like this, But if you like a wide variety of categories you might like it, you might not care. So the experience really depends on how willingly you are to embrace it, cause this is definetly a masterpiece, on a story level.

[Opinions]
Of course this is now my own idea and opinion on the approach the director and company decided to take with this game. I would also like to state I have played almost every category of game. Simulator's, FPS Shooters, Campaign's, Survival, City Builders, Horror, Multiplayer, Sports, etc. This game fits a lot into just one game, and it can be overwhelming if your not ready, since most people I know did not enjoy the game because of the walking it started to develop over time. That is the problem though, most gamers when they first start playing don't look at the bigger picture so they dismiss it instantly. That's why it upsets me that people are willing to stop playing a game because of something they are not even fully aware of. I know this might sound generic, but if your three hours into a game and you still don't know if you like it, question every part of the game and see if there is a chance you'r missing something, or not looking at it like the developer designed it to be enjoyed (It's like buying a Honda Civic when what you want is the most Fancy Sedan money can buy, and ruin your expectations of the civic). People need to stop thinking ahead of the game, but think about whats happening and whats being presented to you, thats' when you can start appreciating the game for what it is (Whether you like it or not). The story was TOP 3 in all of gaming history (I truly mean this, as I've poured thousands of hours into hundreds of games). The experience is something you will have NEVER experienced in any other games (Thats a fact). A lot of little details; High Detail in the Terrain (Looks like real life), Customizing your buildings and items, connecting bridges with online people, Sharing your resources with friends, walking through different types of terrain, and different types of encounters. This game is truly a masterpiece, I have never played anything like it, and I don't think I ever will again.",1595643557,1595644317,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,33,6,3842,0,3842,1595641338,,
57,DEATH STRANDING,73238248,english,"Easily - 9/10 (1 point lost on how the ending was planned, it could've been better; more on this at the bottom of the review)

Where do I begin with? I mean you obviously know how it looks and how everyone calls it a walking simulator. Then there are reviews who calls it a masterpiece by Hideo Kojima. And that is true.

To summarize my experience (finished the storyline in 29 hours, including the cutscenes): 
- It IS a masterpiece. 
- It is not much of a walking simulator. [spoiler] You get the bike in about an hour in the game and based on how you manage, you can pretty much have a ride throughout the game, except a few parts. Yes there are BTs, but you can always just nade them into oblivion, and keep riding on. Saves you a lot of time.[/spoiler]
- Sometimes terrain makes you feel like it'd be just easier walking but then you learn ways to ride through them anyway, by spamming boost + jump. 
- Visuals are stunning, story is also brilliant.
- It is nice to see that some eastern friends of ours have deployed bridges for you in the places you least expect it and you just have to appreciate the bridge being there, so you don't have to take a detour (if you don't have stuff to create the bridge, which often, you don't)

It's worth it, overall.

Now the only thing that I think that was mildly annoying was, how it ends. I believe at the 23-24th hour I was at a point where I thought, ""Ah, the ending boss fight"", and then there was some more little gameplay inside and outside of the ""BEACH"", and I believe this happened for the next few hours until it actually ended. They try to explain everything in the end, which kind of makes sense but it would've been better if it was much better spread across in-between the game, than just throwing it all on us at the end.",1595643444,1595643444,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,163,2,2060,0,1759,1597511083,,

Walking through the wasteland and listening to the well picked music for the game was also just another bonus. I hope that other developers use the frame work from this game and create a great open world survival game. For new players the beginning of the game was very annoying specially when you find out your really just a delivery boy. I promise it gets better, the beginning is like a very long tutorial and eventually opens up.

Some things I did find annoying was the animations of getting in and out of vehicles though it looked great, it became very annoying when you need to get out and pick up the next lost cargo. speaking of vehicles, the truck will make you want to break your monitor when trying to navigate through uphill rocky terrain, hitting one of the million rocks and turning your truck just to watch it slide all the way back down to the bottom. I also ran into my vehicles acting crazy and going forward quickly and not being able to stop it.

So, to wrap up my review:
If you are a gamer that prefers visuals over anything, this is the game for you.

For anyone wondering, Keyboard and Mouse works perfectly fine. I used to thought that I need Gamepad to play this game. But now don't use my new gamepad because the Keyboard&Mouse control is perfect and very comfortable. You use Ctrl and Shift to speed up/down walking/running speed.  Use left/right mouse button to balance.

P/S: People complains about Denuvo decreases the game performance, but in my game it just running like a charm :-)

P/S 2: My suggestions for beginners, after you reach Chapter 3, then start doing Standard Delivery for everyone in East Region (The map from beginning) and Central Region (The second map when you reach Chapter 3). The reason to do Standard Delivery in Chapter 3 is:

- In Chapter 3 you have unlocked a lot of new stuff that make your delivery trip more easier.
- Some NPC will unlock new stuff for you when they reach 3 4 5 stars. Stuff will make your delivery trip more and more easier.",1594778338,1595640815,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,162,76,3863,0,30,1596506603,,

Overall I liked the game, it's a good game but I don't think it's amazing or a masterpiece. The game has some phenomenal concept but it stumbles a lot in execution. 
The games visuals looks amazing 👌. The cinematography, the direction and performances are top notch.
The gameplay is a mixed bag. I liked the delivery mechanics and controls but the combat and vehicle handling are horrible.
As far as story goes I liked the story, lore, world, it was interesting and unique but the pacing was way off, Way too much exposition dump and lot word but saying nothing, sometimes dialogues are soo bad. Sometimes serious moments are ruined by corky things. Using weird names making things harder to understand than they are.
The characters are also a mixed bag. I didn't care for most of the characters, I liked Cliff, Deadman and the relationship between Sam and baby. 
With that being said I still applaud Kojima's team for coming up with a unique new IP in the age sequels and reboots. I hope in the future they iron out these issues with the sequel or the next game.

88,DEATH STRANDING,73229467,english,"Don't buy this unless you want to play something that takes risks and has a ps1 era feel when it comes to how nonsensical the world is. Most of its appeal to me is piecing together lore and trying to understand what is going on. There is a lot to unpack and definitely is confusing since most of it is abstract. An excessive use of metaphors and symbolism may lead to you getting bored or annoyed. 

Most of your time will be in cut-scenes and walking. combat exists and can be difficult if you are too wreckless or play on the higher difficulties, which I recommend if you want the tension to stick throughout the game. Normal is just to make it as accessible as possible by default. Most gameplay is traversing the environments and overcoming obstacles. There is not constant action but when action occurs it can be intense but once you learn how these sections work they can be easy, which is why I recommend playing on Hard or Very Hard difficulty. Learning Sam's (Norman Reedus) limitations is key to not flubbing deliveries, and these limitations improve as you take on different types of deliveries,

As for the PC port itself, I have only had one issue. A bug from my gpu driver not being up to date, caused models to not render properly, which was fixed when updated. A common issue seems to be a frame rate stutter for others, but I'm not having that issue. I don't think it's hardware limitations since people that have better hardware are having the issue. I'm not sure what quality of life improvements where made for the port specifically, but a lot of the time wasting functions like the sensor activating when entering BT areas can be altered to not stop and do a small cut-scene every time. which I agree got annoying when going in and out of them constantly.

The visual presentation is very impressive. It's what makes the long treks more bearable if you appreciate that kind of thing, which I do. Character models have some ridiculous detail, like Normie Reedus' armpit hair. 

In conclusion, If you aren't sure about it, wait until a sale price you are more comfortable wasting in case you don't enjoy it. However, if you want to enjoy some dumb nonsense and a game that is exactly as intended by the minds behind it then go for it. A certain mindset is required to enjoy it.

2,DEATH STRANDING,73225946,english,"This is quite possibly the best video game I've ever played, and I've been playing video games avidly since I got an NES for my 5th birthday in 1988.

It's very hard to do the game justice in words. Put it this way, this game is more than the sum of its parts, and the parts (individual mechanics -- everything from managing cargo weight/distribution to stealth invasions of enemy camps to a resident evil style literal bloodbath that will often pop up and continued to scare the s*** out of me after many encounters) are all perfect. 

The reason for that is the online/community aspect and the way that fits into the themes of the story, which starts out seeming very convoluted and frankly sort of dumb and, as you work your way through the game, it feels like you are filling in the gaps with your own actions. And your actions are comprised mostly of just delivering things to people! Anyway, the story starts to really click and make sense, and the way you kind of discover that along the way is worth the price alone, but the online part is really what makes it stand out as a potential GOAT.

I love that you can share items and resources with other players, create buildings and structures with multiple players all pitching in materials, and find cargo other players lost and deliver it for them. It inspires a sense of hope. It's a timely thing to experience right now, and it honestly ends up feeling great that you've helped other people - pretty ingenious the way the creators kind of harnessed the Facebook/social media positive feedback loop and managed to make it work in the game. But after climbing a really tough mountain or getting stuck in a crazy river that badly damaged your cargo, building a bridge or a zipline, etc., that other players (and you) can use to make it easier next time, it feels like all the hard work was worth it. I really don't think it'd be near as satisfying if this were a single player offline game and you only had access to structures you'd built and nothing else.

Lets break it down into Pro's and Con's

Pro's
     - A refreshing game inside a very stagnant industry, the gaming industry is stagnant with tons of the 
        ""same"" game, Death Stranding is not like any other game.
     - Very story Rich. 
     - This game makes you cry in all the right ways

Con's
     - Very long cinematic's (Not exactly a con as the story is amazing, but it creates a sort of get to the game 
         anxiety)
     - Combat mechanic felt clunky at times, To add to that some enemies are laughable as combat felt more 
          like a three stooges skit.
     - Vehicle Physics, my constant complaint throughout the entire game was how vehicle collision's would 
          cause hilarious flying car/bike incidents.

Overview:
      This game was absolutely fantastic, I laughed, I cried, but more importantly i had an absolutely great time traversing the broken UCA. This game is a refreshing breath of air in a relatively cookie cutter gaming industry, It is not only just unique, it is a Masterpiece. 
If you're debating on buying this game, DO IT. Death Stranding is a well lengthened game with tons of turns and surprises that will keep you enthralled by its mystery.

Overall: 9/10, would purchase again, will play over and over

My concerns about the game play are three-fold. First, the movie like cut scenes are nice at first, but eventually they just felts repetitive and some rather unnecessary. The first couple of hours in, you basically spend watching cut scene to cut scene. After playing a little, there are many less engaging cut scenes that take way too long for my taste. Second, the game play comprises of the game throwing annoying obstacles on the player's path. I see that developers tried their best to make the game not feel 'annoying.' However, its main premise is overcoming difficult and hostile territory. I am not sure how appealing such game play is for a broad audience in the long run.

24,DEATH STRANDING,73170939,english,"I don't review games as much, so long as the're getting their rightful praises and recognition. However, this game, no, this masterpiece has been so controversial, being called a walking simulator, a huge disappointment from kojima and so on, that I had to write a full review as soon as i finished it! 

To begin with, i always expect the most out of kojima's work, following metal gear solid v: the phantom pain being a tremendous accomplishment even though it was never fully completed and had alot of missing parts, while just because it granted the player freedom, making it a masterpiece among pc games. Death stranding also grants the player freedom in a variety of ways, from controlling how they'll be getting from point A to point B to how many packages are you willing to challenge yourself to handle. I never seemed to feel the sense of repetition, as different deliveries required management of different terrains and the vast amount of devices and tools you'll be granted will never cease the excitement of heading out on a fresh new journey. 

The game's graphics and optimisation is one of the few you'd see nowadays in new games, mostly they just want you to own top of the line hardware, on the other hand, kojima is like HELL NAW, everyone's getting a chance to play this game at 60 fps and definitely have same beautiful experience. The music is out of this world, and captures memorable moments strongly as you journey across america (fictional & based on Icelandic landscapes). The gameplay is surprisingly smooth, and i felt super comfortable with keyboard and mouse as my main controls, although the vehicles are somehow stuck to the ground and it's physics are terrible, but still manageable after getting used to, on the contrary it encourages walking, climbing and running through the amazing landscapes, or stealth through a mule's camp or terrorist occupied land, and only not missing on a single experience or to using roads. Roads which you'll be required to rebuild with materials & ofc. with the online social experience of players helping out, we repaired all roads leading around the map, makin' it easier for players to grind at a faster pace to complete achievements and connect america again

Lastly, the story and OMFG it is a masterpiece, it's how i want next generation line of games to inspire to be. The innovation behind it is absolutely stunning, while konami took metal gear and turned into a zombie game that no one was interested in, kojima just straight up invented new type of paranormal monsters that will make you feel more intense and legit sometimes freaked out. I'm not gonna give out any details, as being curious and figuring stuff out as you play along is what sold the game for me. 

So to summarise like every other person here on steam

Positives:
+++ story
+++ ending 
+++ graphics
+++ music
+++ Boss fights
++ gameplay


Negatives:
- vehicles
- no option to play music as you free roam

25,DEATH STRANDING,73216904,english,"If you can get past the ""walking simulator"" memes, and aren't one of the morons who expected MGS6, this game is tight. A lot of people have said ""just wait until Episode 3, it gets better,"" but imo, if you aren't in by then, you probably won't ever be. It's more or less the same gameplay from beginning to end, you just get access to more tools as the game goes on. You're still just delivering things for people, though. It had me hooked within the first few hours, and it only got better from there, for me, personally.

Anyway, it's basically an overworld travel game. If you've ever played D&D, overworld travel there is basically always ignored. You might get some random battles, but most likely you'll just get narrated from town to the dungeon entrance. The gameplay in Death Stranding is completely centered around traveling between destinations, to an extent that I don't think I've ever seen before. As you overcome obstacles, the game provides you with new tools to help deal with them the next time. It comes up with new challenges, you get new tools, and this cycle goes all the way through the end of the game.

I played the game on Hard, but honestly, most of the game was still kind of easy. I'd recommend Very Hard, honestly. You can change the difficulty up or down mid-game, so definitely try it out on a lower difficulty, but bump it up if you realize you're enjoying it. Very Hard also adds at least one new mechanic, so there's that, too.

The plot is your usual Kojima fare. It's wildly confusing for pretty much the whole game, as it basically doesn't explain anything for quite a while. It does start making more sense, and the ""interview"" data the game periodically gives you helps a lot with understanding what's going on (you do have to read it, though). You can also unlock some interviews from doing some of the ""Standard Orders"", aka sidequests, which I wish I'd known from the start, since the game otherwise leaves a few mysteries unexplained.

Honestly, if I didn't have other games that I wanted to play, I'd probably keep playing it past the ending. There's a lot of extra stuff to unlock and discover, like new customization options, equipment, and probably more that I don't know about. And honestly, I was having a lot of fun.

I would talk more about specific things, but honestly, I feel like the game benefits from discovering those things as it goes on. You'll experience a good amount of what I really liked about it within the first 5-6 hours. It does not take until Episode 3 (about 10ish hours in).

Like a good book, if you allow yourself to slow down and become engrossed in the characters and story this game comes alive, it really does. 

If there are any negatives, it's the scale of the States which is off, I am a quarter the way across the States and I feel like I've run, ridden 4 or 5 miles in game, that is clearly not right, (little disappointing) but hey its a game right?

It's not necessarily the best game in any specific area but as a whole package it's really, properly good. 

I expected at least a vaguely interesting (if baffling) story from Hideo Kojima but what I got was an absolutely insane yet incredibly creative supernatural/sci-fi story where the supremely  camp and the genuinely horrific were mixed to perfection, where every thread and arc was concluded in a satisfying way and with every element of gameplay + mechanics tying in to reinforce the themes the story was presenting. Absolute masterclass on games as art.

The main gameplay loop probably isn't for everyone (Deliver this cargo from point A to point B, repeat for 40-50 hours) but I found it engaging and deeply satisfying. 

I strongly recommend playing this game through to the end if you're even slightly interested in seeing how games can offer unique story experiences that you can't get in any other medium. Also to anyone who is intrigued by the idea of a game in which you throw bottles of your own piss at angry ghosts.

46,DEATH STRANDING,72743769,english,"POST FINISHING THE STORY: I still think this game is pretty great :) I didnt like the story all that much and thought it was too cliche and predictable but the gameplay was enjoyable for me and made up for it

Let me start off by saying that the fact that this game is made by ""Hideo Kojima"" means almost nothing to me, I am not a fan boy, I have played one maybe two games made by this creator in the past and mostly I just find them to be okay. (not saying they are bad games they just aren't my thing)

THIS GAME. However, this game takes so many risks its absolutely CRAZY when it comes to creativity. It is extremely weird but quite damn engaging. The story telling and dialogue can still be a bit cheesy and a bit weird at times but if you can look past that (with the help of some fantastic acting and character animation this is not that hard to do which is why Im still enjoying the story) this game offers something not many other games companies or even indie game companies would DARE to do. Deliver something SOOOOO outrageous it makes you think the writers need to see some kind of psych because of the stuff going on in there head, having game developers and planners that come up with ways to make walking and engaging as hell experience for people that would rather play a game with mechanics of walking than do it ourselves and then graphic designers that make a bunch of rocks, rivers and grass turn into beautiful landscapes whilst not turning your computer into the sun and melting it through the floor of your house.

IT IS VERY well made and whilst it does have some flaws I cannot think of a single game like it and although I may not be done or close to done and thus I have no idea how well the story evolves, one thing is for sure it is a story I will never forget having you dumbfounded and amazed all at the same time.",1594834511,1595596354,TRUE,1,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,543,165,3755,0,486,1595231352,,

In this game the story doesn't matter that much as the gameplay is the main focus of the game.
So before buying consider this : This is the ""DHL simulator"". You will be walking, running, falling, delivering packages, fighting paranormal beings and normal humans.

However the game is Centered around package delivery and the goal to ""Unite America"".
In order for you to deliver packages more efficiently and more safely you will be building bridges, ladders, ropes, Safe stations,Generators, zip-lines, roadways, Bikes,trucks, Exoskeletons (to help you carry more weight). These however degrade over time, especially under the effect of rain (Timefall) as the rain is abnormal and it ages anything it touches, this mechanic will force you to re-think your delivery route as the rain damages your Parcels and vehicles alike: will you wait inside in a cave for the rain, snow to pass ? Are you going to go around the storm and all the ""baddies"" that are present in the storm ? Or are you going to go Rambo on the rain and paranormal beings and push through the storm ?

In any case, the game might not be for everyone as it is not your usual action packed Shooter.
As this game was directed by one and only Hideo Kojima, people who liked his metal gear series should feel right at home when playing his newest masterpiece. 
So the Evaluation of things separately :
Gameplay and it's mechanics :  8.5

Story : 6.0
Hideo Kojima game with weird Story, not understandable for mere mortals, usually has a deeper meaning hidden inside of it, Even Norma Reedus main actor who plays the main character in the game Doesn't fully understand the story

PC Port optimization and Graphical aspect : 9.0

 As for 2020 the game runs smooth on old generation GTX Cards 1060-1080 should handle the game no problem on 1080p 60 FPS
 (On my specific rig I could get a stable 100 FPS)
Asus Nvidia GTX 1080 Strix
Intel I7-4790K
DDR3 2133HZ 16GB Ram

The game is advised to be played on a controller, as it really immerses you more with the Vibration feedback from your controller, helping you balance the packages, detect enemies and other.
Also controller will assist with the sneaking sections as there might be a few.
One grind on my side is the shooting itself, as I'm not used to play shooters on controller that part was kind of hard, so on full action shooting sections i Would switch to PC controls, that however only applies to people who are not used to controllers, so if you are cod or halo junkie on a console you shouldn't have a problem.
Hopefully the review gave you at least some insight on the game if not my apologies(This is my first review after all ;) )

I've never been a massive fan of Kojima, ever. I played the MGSV demo thingy way back in 2014 (?) and that's the only real piece of content I've consumed from Kojima.

Even so, I love Death Stranding so far. Of course, the game isn't for everyone, but I am thoroughly enjoying my time with it. The way you have to think about everywhere you go, having to plan around MULE territory, BT territory, Timefall patterns, etc. You have to think about every step, as one foot in the wrong place can send you barreling down a massive hill. The systems put in place make something as mundane as walking into something engaging and fun. Crouching and holding my breath while I make my way around BTs, being careful of where my feet land in order not to fall and create noise was truly engaging and scary. The music is also incredible, with an indie track slowly creeping in as you make your way up a hill and are awarded with a beautiful view of the landscape. And those graphics.. absolutely incredible, and on top of all that it runs amazing even though I barely meet the recommended specs.

I wouldn't recommend this game to everyone, but if you're looking for something relaxing and engaging, I'd recommend picking this game up at full price. 100% worth it.

This is probably one of the most memorable games I have ever played since I was a child.

What this game really is: All of Hideo Kojima's crazy ideas as a game director put into an intricate physics based movement system (you need to keep your weight and weight distribution in mind as you are ascending and descending different terrain types, thankfully there is a very easy auto-distribution in the cargo screen). 

You get a very interesting and weird world that you are dumped into, stealth elements where you are trying to avoid invisible creatures that can hear you breath, and some action-stealth elements in fighting or sneaking past the MULEs (crazy people who want to steal your cargo and equipment to get an endorphin hit off ""delivering"" something)

And on top of it, as you expand the game features you built into the environment (like ropes and ladders to navigate cliffs, or more permanent structures like bridges) become shared online, and you also suddenly have access to other peoples work.  Even pathways forming in the dirt from people traveling the same path repeatedly.

Is this game for everyone?  No.  
Is this game MGS?  A little but not really?

After managing to avoid any and all spoilers since the game was released on PS4, I finally got to experience it for myself on PC. I'll start this review by saying what many others have already said - this game is not for everyone. If you aren't the kind of person to get invested in a long, singleplayer narrative that takes place largely through cutscenes, then what you're left with is gameplay that many label a ""walking simulator"", with intermittent sections of stealth or action that can often be avoided entirely. However, if story is something that you value, then what you'll find here is a [b]compelling narrative[/b] set in a very unique and interesting universe, with a cast of great actors to carry it. The acting and delivery can at times be a bit hit or miss, perhaps because of the writing, but the parts that 'miss' are often not important enough to detract from the storytelling. Some of the cutscene sequences are phenomenal - Mads Mikkelsen especially stole the show, and his character's backstory was so interestingly woven into the main storyline that I found myself excited to learn more (this game has plenty of cool reveals, and an important plot twist to boot). I previously quoted ""walking simulator"" - well, if you are invested in the story, these walking/delivery segments have a lot of meaning added to them, and I often found that the main reason I was continuing was to learn more of the story. Everything comes together at the end, and it feels amazing to finally understand everything (given that parts of the story can be confusing). 

The delivery segments are more than just 'walking', too. The game gives you a phenomenal [b]sense of progression[/b], dealing out various upgrades and new pieces of equipment over the course of your travels. A particularly unique feature that I love is [b]the ability to place down structures that will appear in the worlds of other real players[/b], and vice versa. You can award arbitrary 'likes' to such structures (or vehicles later on), and receiving likes on a bridge, zipline, etc that you yourself have placed down feels very gratifying. For some deliveries you will find yourself simply travelling from point A to point B, with only the terrain as your enemy. The environment itself is gorgeous - [b]this game is one of the nicest looking I've seen on PC[/b]. I often found myself stopping to take screenshots with the in-game 'Photo Mode', which allows you to pause time and apply various filters or photo effects to whatever scene it is you've captured. Sometimes, you'll find yourself doing deliveries that take you through hostile territory, and these hostiles come in one of two forms - BTs and MULEs/terrorists. A very unique and often intense mechanic revolves around the former - they are invisible enemies whose whereabouts are hinted at with a device that blinks based on proximity (and this device is hooked up to a baby, but that'll make sense if you play it for yourself). These segments can be quite spooky, and you always feel the atmosphere shift upon entering one of these BT areas. The latter, MULEs, are human enemies that are out to steal your packages. This is where I [b]recommend playing the game on hard or very hard[/b], because these encounters can be easy if you play it right - the MULEs go down easily and, especially later in the game, some of the equipment available to you can trivialise the fights. Nonetheless, MULE or terrorist encounters add a great spice to the gameplay. This game also features a few boss fights, and honestly the things you face in some of these (more so in the later ones) are breathtaking - I remember panicking on more than one occasion when something many many times larger than me emerged from the ground and started chasing me or flying around in the sky.

This game is great as a PC port. I'd say 99% of the time it [b]controls really nicely[/b], and despite there being heaps of mechanics everything feels very intuitive and smooth, with the same button being used for many purposes depending on the menu/context. The game is [b]very immersive[/b] thanks to a combination of the environment/atmosphere, story and sense of purpose, but another element that adds to this is the movement. Thanks to the need for [b]weight management, balance, being able to fall over obstacles[/b], etc, it really feels like you're in full control of the character (as opposed to typical WASD movement). The handling of one of the vehicles, namely the bike, occasionally feels a bit off - for example you can sometimes lose all momentum instantly when driving on uneven ground or when you hit a tiny rock or protrusion; arguably sort of unrealistic and annoying. This isn't something that occurs consistently though, for the most part the vehicles feel great and really help with the sense of progression. Sometimes they can trivialise deliveries (especially if roads have been constructed), and whilst this may sound like a bad thing, when you're actually playing it can be relieving after completing so many deliveries on foot. The same goes for the ziplines (which are essentially usable to skip entire areas of terrain) - they often trivialise deliveries, but after a difficult segment of trudging uphill through stamina-consuming snow, it can feel pretty good to be able to take a free ride to your destination. 

One last major point: [b]this game has a phenomenal soundtrack[/b], perhaps one of the most fitting that I've heard. Some really emotional songs play during important parts of the story, and other times you will be walking and you'll be hit with a sudden song that plays to break the silence, and to be honest it can be quite motivational. To make it better, songs are unlocked after you've heard them, and you can play them as you please in your private room (a feature of every major stop-off where you can rest). 

Lastly, here are a few random, minor game details that brought me amusement or otherwise just pleased me throughout my playthrough:
- don't quite know what I expected, but upon walking through a low doorway with a pile of containers twice my size on my back, a bunch of them got knocked off and that made me laugh for some reason
- whilst resting in the private room you can choose to drink to restore stamina, and in the later part of the game where beer is the drink of choice, he suddenly shook a can and let it explode onto the camera, saying 'right in your face'. surprised me and made me laugh
- you can urinate in snow and it melts (also you can control where you aim)
- half-life references (actual deliveries that you can choose to do which unlock you hl-themed goodies)
- oh yeah, there are three insane segments where [spoiler]you are placed onto battlefields (WW1, WW2, Vietnam, in that order) and it's honestly pretty mindblowing. really big shift from the ordinary gameplay cycle[/spoiler]

[u]Rating[/u]: 9/10

TL;DR - Masterpiece of a game with a few minor hiccups that, in my opinion, don't detract at all from the experience. I only recommend this game if you're likely to get invested in the story, because otherwise you may find the gameplay loop repetitive - and in a game about making deliveries, what reason is there for you to make them if you don't care about why you're doing it or who you're delivering to?

This isn't a game where the substance of the story is about 4 hours long and spread out across 40 hours of filler, it's story end to end and everything you do outside of required story events will frequently give you MORE pieces of the story and context. Investing in the story, paying attention, and not ignoring messages is incredibly rewarding as a result. If you can't invest yourself into playing the game you are doing yourself and the game a great disservice. There are dozens of questions I asked myself throughout my 104 hours about the story and each one was answered in time, by the end the entire experience just felt complete. I was invested enough to get everything in the game since much of the content rewards you with story and tools, I have the 100% ""Greatest of Great Deliverers"" achievement to testify that.

Gameplay is seemingly simple but brutal if you ignore the rules. Enemies are easy to deal with (I beat this on Very Hard) but can overwhelm you if you rush in, moreso if you didn't bring the right tools. 

If this game is a walking simulator, you're not using the tools you are provided. For me, I spent a good majority of the game in vehicles or using other buildable gagdets. Yes, there are walking mechanics but they're not difficult to manage passively, and many of the mechanics are made easier to handle simply through playing the game. 

If you're hung up about overblown hype just because it was made by Hideo Kojima I'd encourage you to ignore it and let the game speak for itself if you'd otherwise be interested, you would be missing out.

I, like many others, took my time in the play-through. I just finished the final episode and let me just say that this is the most captivating game I've ever played. 

The story & character progression: Fair warning, as others have stated, it does start off slow. I promise this ends up being worth it as games need to have a feeling of character and story development; know that grinding through this slow start is simply just that. Enjoy the cut-scenes, as there are many at the start, and take in the story as much as you can. When it does pick up, it keeps picking up... I promise. Episodes get shorter and shorter as you start unraveling more and more of the story and you can't help but get further and further drawn to it. 

The soundtrack: absolutely f*** beautiful... enough said. Each and every song is presented at the right spot in the story to fit into the emotions of the moment, and I honestly don't think the choices could have been any better.

Gameplay: Intuitively unique... the system of ""multiplayer"" and helping others is extremely rewarding. The building aspect triggers the creativity of making routes and travel more efficient and to your liking, while at the same time making it available to others and building off what others have started to create your own world and system of travel. Combat is also unique and delicate... discouraged from using lethal weapons on anything living is a unique concepts that keeps the focus on being strategic with movement and combat that helped the feeling of personal development. The combat on the non-living (bt's, etc.) is also fun and engaging, as well as caters to multiple different preferences for combat; that being close ranged melee (cutting amb cord), long range AR, short range shotgun, grenades, rocket launchers... I mean it's not a combat focused game, so when it does come up, it's a thrill and is exciting to live through it. 

There's really so much more to be said, but to keep it short I'll just leave my final comment to this one is absolutely worth a try and a playthrough. I get that some may be discouraged by the pace at times, but if you're into really captivating stories and the ability to play through it - do it!

Only negative thing I can note is that there are some technical issues and limitations. For ex, my native reso is 3840x1080 UWD, but it's not a default supported reso, it's an easy fix to force to work, but just a heads up for those with odd resolutions like myself. I also had one occurrence where my save ended up corrupted and kept receiving an error when trying to load in... the support for the error was so vast and I had to spend a lot of time troubleshooting only to figure out it wasn't on my end and there was something wrong with the save; reverting a couple saves (about 10-15m back) resolved the issue and I didn't have any further issues from there.",1595538423,1595538423,TRUE,5,0,0.561357677,2,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,44,1,5382,0,4226,1596135927,,
57,DEATH STRANDING,73178182,english,"Kojima's newest game didn't fail to be a unique experience. While not up to everyone's tastes, the gameplay is far beyond any ""walking simulator"" that games journalists lap up. There's a certain meditative feeling to it, most of the time when not throwing jarate at ghosts or aiming for the legs of any bandits, you'll be alone with your own thoughts, either of your own life or of the themes the game will hammer into you whenever you're not in control.
The boss fights are pretty lame and disappointing coming from the same man who designed Metal Gear Solid 3. Most of them are BTs that you just gotta lob grenades at and aren't challenging the skills you're developing alongside Sam.
Kojima's message of the importance of connections being important for humanity and using them to move on in the future are as subtle as a brick thrown in your window while a noisy jazz punk fusion band sings a song about how you should look out for that brick. But I wouldn't have it any other way.
All in all, a great game well worth the 40 or so hours it'll take for you to beat and the 60 dollars (or less depending on sales or price cuts).

I'm an older gamer, and the mechanics of the game (not the basic ones, but the social ones) took me a while to get used to. Now that I 'get it' I like them and they make sense (NOTE: playing with a controller).

The seemingly endless side-missions are a bit much. I wish there was a clearer distinction if they really matter or not. Maybe if player progression was more visible (and I'm not talking about the colored star filling in), that could help.

I also have to say... the BTs are getting OLD, FAST. I don't mind them on occasion, but when you've already cleared a route they should not be there again the next time you play a mission. Enough already. I wish I could just drive around areas that have already been cleared, take care of side missions, level up and learn more about the mechanics. Driving around, fast, on the reverse trike is fun!

75,DEATH STRANDING,73171326,english,"Death Stranding is quite possibly one of the most thought-provoking games I have ever played. You will hear from many people, myself included, that this game is a 'slow-burn' and that's absolutely true. Nothing however, could be more ideal for a game with such narrative ambition and complexity; you will *want* to take your time, not only for gameplay reasons but also to simply take in and understand the world you find yourself in. Some meals are best enjoyed with pace and Death Stranding is a pizza that needs to be taken one sumptuous slice at a time.

Some reviews will give you a synopsis of the story in an attempt to draw you in, however I will not as taking it in without any knowledge prior, like myself, I think allows for an even greater appreciation of just how well the themes, stories and ideas of Death Stranding are conveyed. Be it through dialogue, cutscenes or codex-like 'interviews' Death Stranding doesn't fail in giving you just the right amount of information to keep you thinking without getting frustrated. You simply *need* the pace of the game to be slow, lest you be swept up in the throes of the story with nary an idea as to how or why you got there.

The setting through which you'll traverse is largely, if not completely, based on Icelandic geography. At points you'll be walking along rivers flowing through mountain passes, others wandering across volcanic sand beaches lying in the shadow of snow-topped peaks. Death Stranding is a feast for the eyes and a marvel of photo-realistic graphical technology which is only further enhanced by its powerful suite of in-game capture tools which allow you take some truly breathtaking, and occasionally hilarious, photos. Students of photography may want to try this game for this set of tools alone, as it provides both the means and locations for some of the most staggeringly breathtaking screenshots I've seen in a video game to date.

The attention to detail is not only present in how the landscape is constructed; interior modelling, character detail, sound and effects are all produced with an immaculate level of polish. En route to deliver goods to a distant waystation I found myself caught in the rain; from the first few drops splashing from the shoulders to the steps being taken on the increasingly sodden ground I could have easily been forgiven for thinking that I really was caught out in it myself. Visually, the distant glow of player made structures stood out in the rain as beacons of hope moreso made convincing by the lack of overall visibility that comes with actual storms, not simply those in a game.

This is not to say, however, that Death Stranding does not have its weaker points. It falls into an all too common trap with its pacing towards the latter half of its story. Episodes and events switch from nudging you in the right direction to outright forcing you through it's denouement without much acknowledgement to it's pacing up until that point. It can be argued that the story requires this change of pace as dictated by the ongoing events, but personally I found there was too little room to breathe between segments in the last 10 hours or so of the game. This simultaneously leads to another, more minor issue; exposition. Death Stranding is an example of complex story-telling done in the right way, for the most part. Questions that might have been raised throughout the story in some cases, for the less observant or perceptive, are answered all at once through monologues by several key characters. Understandably, some information needs to be given for context and understanding however at times it feels more like spoon-feeding than overall story-telling. Little is left to the discovery of the player unless it is actively thought on and pursued, though this may be more of a benefit to some.

Death Stranding's gameplay is both visceral and rewarding. The core loop involves picking up orders at one location and delivering the goods to another with the challenge being in navigating the environment without causing too much damage to your cargo. This challenge is made harder by geographical constraints, be it wide rivers or steep cliffs, and enemy entities located throughout each region be they of the human or more supernatural variety. Investing time in finding and using the best route, along with performing multiple deliveries is rewarded with a wide repertoire of feature and equipment unlocks, making future deliveries easier and faster.

Death Stranding is not so much a multiplayer game as it is a social game (or not, if you're so inclined). Cargo, equipment, signs and structures left by other players can be seen throughout your game as you progress, which in many cases can serve to aid you on your journey. Fortunately, for those who want to be rid of eyesores from their sweeping vistas, the option remains to remove the creations of other players either partially or entirely. The Instagram generation is well served in Death Stranding, with players being able to positively rate others through a 'liking' system. The concept of 'likes' is both a gameplay mechanic and core concept to the America you find yourself in, though you'll have to play yourself to find out how. It both provides welcoming boosts of serotonin and a measure of social commentary which is simultaneously engaging and surreal.

Death Stranding is not a game that everyone will enjoy; dare I say not even a game that the majority of people will enjoy. It is, however, for those engaged by it an excellent and wholeheartedly recommended addition to their library. While not having the replay value of other games, it leaves you feeling satisfied with its finish while wishing there truly was more reason to 'keep on keeping on'.

It really is a Walking Sim. Through and through. Combat is there but not necessary, stealth is there but highly encouraged.

Now for the bad and also important part. The game is entirely unplayable in its current form.

I built a new computer last month specifically to play Death Stranding when it was released on Steam in July. And for the first 35 hours is was all blissfully smooth sailing. However, now the game crashes due to internal errors and issues with the callstack at least every thirty minutes, and often times the game crashes in less than 3 minutes after startup. I finally gave up when I failed to make the same short delivery 4 times in a row due to repeated crashes. Just not how I want to spend an hour of my time.

I've done the internet forum circuit and this problem seems recent and widespread.

12,DEATH STRANDING,73157123,english,"Went into this game extremely skeptical, having ever only played MGSV from Kojima before this. I was drawn in by how good the gameplay was in MGSV, and expected more of the same from this game-- got way more than I expected. While the game is a ""walking simulator"", it's more than that. You're a porter (delivery guy.)  You have to prepare for each delivery carefully, managing your inventory's space effectively based off the kind of terrain you're going through. Going through territory that has lots of steep inclines and mountainous terrain? You'll bring ladders to ascend slippery rocky terraces, heating pads to reduce your stamina depletion from the cold, and your exoskeleton will be one focused on maintaining balance rather than increasing your overall carrying capacity/strength.  
If you're venturing through territory haunted by BT's (ghosts), you'll occupy more of your inventory space with anti-BT weaponry. Every delivery feels like a carefully planned and executed adventure. There are even frequent Metal Gear-esque camps of terrorists, which you'll need to sneak through to get passed without potentially harming your packages.

The horror aspect is done well, but it isn't the scariest game. Eerie is the more appropriate word. I'm a huge fan of the horror genre and I wasn't disappointed with the aspects that made it through in this game.

The story also unexpectedly won me over. There are some extremely corny naming conventions at play here, but if you get past that, everything else is top notch. It's a mystery-type story, and you're constantly given or are finding clues about the story's answers before answers are actually divulged. It's extremely fun piecing together these bits, and then seeing how close you were to nailing the plot's twists (I wasn't as successful as I thought, but that was my misinterpretation of said clues!)

Multiplayer is asynchronous, similar to the Souls series and it's message system. During the game you'll unlock the ability to build structures such as bridges, watchtowers, stations to charge your vehicles, and etc. These structures appear in other player's worlds, and they benefit from using it. If a player uses your structure, you get ""likes"" from them, which incentivizes you by restoring your stamina and boosting your overall player rating. It definitely encourages creativity, and you get a sweet, sweet rush of oxytocin whenever a structure you built turns out useful for the community at large.

It's a game that's sound very bad on paper but when I played it, I couldn't stop until I finally beaten it. I was in the middle of persona 4 golden when this game dropped and I was only going to start it up to see what it's about and I end up finishing it. Some how, Kojima managed to make a walking simulator compelling, he's crazy but a genius, if I wasn't a believer after all the metal gears I played, I certainly am now. 

As for the story, it got some of the craziest concept every show on screen, think twilight zone on steroids. What ever Kojima was smoking when writing this game's story, I'm betting it was something VERY strong. The plot can be convoluted at times and some of the concepts are a bit ""out there"" but it's not what you're telling, it's how you tell it. Even though the story is confusing at time it stayed just interesting enough to keep you going.

Story: 8.5/10
Gameplay: 7/10

This was a toughie. The game is something special, and weird, but in a unique way. You aren't a spy, or a trained fighter really, you're just a delivery man. Someone who can deliver packages despite how the world has become, which takes no lack of resolve to manage. The setting of this game is truly special in my mind and I genuinely enjoyed learning more about it. The lore is mysterious, but you figure it out as you go along. The game drops you right into the setting and overwhelms you with confusion, and expects you to figure out the lore by watching the characters.

Honestly I don't want to spoil anything and it's kind of difficult with a game of this nature. The gameplay itself is about you delivering packages, but it is not limited to just that. You can build structures to help you traverse the map better, along with other people's structures appearing in your game to aid you. You can unlock equipment and weapons as you go along, but you are just a delivery guy, it's best to avoid combat. I don't know... The structure building is honestly the most entertaining part of the game for me, minus the story.

One thing to note is the boss fights, and yes there are some. I would not say they are exactly fun. Your characters movements are somewhat realistic, which means movement is clunky, which also means you spend most of the time staring at your character to make sure they don't fall over, and not the bosses behind you. Jumping is hit or miss, you might run into a structure during a boss fight and try to climb only to fail to, you end up being slowed down by the environment and it's just a wholly unpleasant experience.

22,DEATH STRANDING,72700793,english,"(Day 1 Review. Edit below)I would not buy this game in this state. The game is beautiful and all but there are a lot of issues that need to be worked out. Usually will get over 100 fps during gameplay but when in cutscenes zooming in on Sam's face drops the fps to 20. Also I am seeing a lot of polygons being stretched during gameplay and cutscenes. Sam's beard will be 20 feet long stretched and while it is hilarious in some other instances the whole room might just have everything scretched out everywhere not allowing you to see anything that's going on in the scene. Even in gameplay some vertices will just go all over the place. Rocks won't load in making you wonder why Sam is walking in place when you bump in a invisible rock. You can't see how far long wide rivers are because the water isn't loading in right and it looks like gravel instead of water. I couldn't take it anymore after entering the private room and the whole screen was covered with these broken textures. I couldn't press the escape or tab button to close out of the game since the private room doesn't allow you to do that. Had to move the mouse over and guess where the terminal was because I couldn't see and exit the game that way.

Edit: I ended up updating my Nvidia drivers and that fixed the broken textures completely and no more issues in that area. Everything is as it should be. No more invisible rocks and I can finally accurately see how long across a river is. Did experience one minor audio hiccup but it fixed itself pretty quickly. I highly recommend this game to anyone that is a fan of Kojima as there are a lot of Metal Gear Solid Phantom Pain vibes sprinkled everywhere.",1594766845,1595498340,TRUE,0,0,0.495459586,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,20,1,1152,0,239,1596219551,,
23,DEATH STRANDING,72842097,english,"This is a beautiful, deeply atmospheric game with a rich and brilliant story and incredibly engaging gameplay. The gameplay mechanics are innovative and based around exploration, the challenges of terrain traversal and construction rather than combat and acquisition of objects, gear and items. There's also the added dimension of helping other players with your constructions. There is plenty of gear and items - and there is plenty of combat. But gear is absolutely functional - you won't feel the need to hoard it - only to use it, and you'll really feel it if you go out without a ladder or a pcc. The combat is something you try to avoid - a bit like doing a perfect stealth run in MGS5, but you have plenty of weapons both innovative (a sticky gun for stealing cargo remotely) and conventional (assault rifles, shotguns). 

To a greater degree than any other game I've played, the landscape is really almost a character in the game. Finding your way, conquering difficult terrain, hacking your way across snowy mountain passes while monitoring your water and power, trying not to fall and destroy your cargo, is what makes the game amazing. If you're the kind of person who loves to just trek out into an open world and see what they find, this game will very much reward you - and for the first time, it will really introduce you to that landscape as a challenge, something that needs tools and careful consideration. You can't just walk straight up that mountain or cross that waterfall. You need to use tools, bridges, ropes... 

Thankfully, the game builds in plenty of workarounds for things like losing your cargo - if you lose it, it's not a huge deal - other players can find it, pick it up and either deliver it for you or share it for other players to deliver. Similarly you can collect lost cargo and help people by delivering it for them. 

The fact that many of this world's desolate and forbidding locations are haunted, and need to be crossed extremely carefully to avoid truly disturbing enemy encounters, adds a dimension that few post-apocalyptic games have. This is a deeply troubling, mysterious enemy - and the apocalypse itself is something that the games' characters are still working to understand. There is an all pervading sense of mystery, and fear - humanity doesn't know what the hell happened. Against this backdrop, the fact of deliveries, connections, normality, take on a symbolic dimension as much as a practical. The very fact that someone is out there in the world, crossing landscapes and facing dangers to keep society functioning is a powerful emblem for the survivors.

On top of all this - what becomes very significant is the sense of your own connection to other players. Leaving warning signs, ladders, building bridges to cross rivers or chasms, or climbing mountain peaks to create zipline networks - all to help whoever else might come that way in the future, is a really fun part of the gameplay. The game tells you when other players use the things you've built, and it's a good feeling to have helped someone. You amass likes, which improves your capabilities - carrying capacity, stability and so on. 

It needs to be noted also that the fact you can create all of the objects and tools you use in the game means you actually use them. There is no potion hoarding, or 'stash' full of cool stuff you found. You have limited carrying capacity, and you can only take what you need - but all of the items have a vital role - and if you arrive on that high mountain pass and need to descend without smashing your cargo, you'll wish you had that climbing anchor...

This all takes place within a world and a story which are deeply affecting, unusual, and compelling - the nature of this apocalypse has torn a hole in man's understanding of reality, of the connection between life and death - together with the music, this all makes for one of the most brilliant games I have played to date.

tl;dr: An experience that you won't be able to forget easily. Although it has some of the best artistic decisions ever taken, and some brand new ideas, its gameplay always drag around and annoy the player. While THAT is the basic premise of the game, it heavily wounds the storytelling and makes the experience less enjoyable. If you manage to get used to its abysmal controls and gameplay mechanics, you will at least enjoy the story and the scenery.

Death Stranding is... something else. It is the ultimate love/hate experience for me. I can easily say that i disliked a big portion of this game: Gameplay. But no matter what annoying thing the game had thrown at me, i managed to beat it and i'm grateful that i did. I played on Normal and thank god for that. 

What i absolutely enjoyed, is the cinematography of this game. Even when you're not in a cutscene and just... simply walking on vast cliffs and listening to ""Don't Be So Serious by Low Roar"", game never fails to make you feel that you're in a movie. Camera angles, the overall atmosphere, feeling of solidarity and the little semi-online elements that sometimes make you feel like you're not actually alone and can feel safe here and there.

The another thing i very much liked was the semi-online system implemented into the game. Developers tried this system in a few other games as well but this is the first time i'm seeing this used in an actually good manner. Although it is a single player game, thanks to it's community shaped open world it almost feels like a multiplayer game. Player feels that s/he is a part of a big broad community. This is something very hard for a single player game to accomplish. Kudos to the Kojima Productions team especially on this.

Decima Engine is an absolute miracle. Whenever i've had a PS4 and i played Horizon: Zero Dawn (which will be out on PC soon, yay), i knew how unbelievably great this engine is. Guerilla Games did such a tremendously good job while creating this engine and it really shines on PC at 1440p, ultra details. Scenery feels almost photorealistic. Character models, mimics, animations, everything is visually flawless. And it never pushed my system around. Gave constant 60 frames per second on a system with GTX 1070, i5 6600, 16 gigs of ram and while its on an SSD.

So let's get down to the dirty business and talk about what i didn't like about this game and what made me give it an 8 instead of a perfect 10. Because this game could've had a perfect 10 easily. Gameplay is so, so bad. Like, abysmal bad. Terrible. I know that they tried to go with a more ""realistic"" approach while designing the gameplay elements but instead of feeling realistic, it felt annoying. Vehicle controls were so annoying, i had to walk for a good part of the game. I can't get myself to drive around easily without crashing on to a small rock every 10 seconds. And it is a small rock, really. A rock that you righftully expect your 4X4 land cruiser to absolutely go over. But it doesn't happen. It's like, the vehicles in this game have magnets attached to them. Magnets that pull your vehicle to rocks and all kinds of obstacles around. I never enjoyed travelling around in this game.

The first 10 or so hours were great. There were no artificial difficulty enhancers. Mules were as dumb as my character, BTs were easy to avoid and were very thrilling-fun at first. But after around 5 or 6 episodes it started getting annoying. Now i knew how to bypass BTs. I knew how to beat them. They were not thrilling anymore. They were just another CHORE i had to deal with. See, when a gameplay mechanic feels like a chore, that's in my opinion, a failure. They could've added some variety at least to the BT encounters just as they did to MULES. They get new weapons and new strategies as the game develops further. But BTs always stay the same. Except maybe towards the end chapters. 

Combat wasn't as good, gunplay wasn't as good, the GAME aspect of this experience just wasn't as good. It is not a walking simulator, no. Do not believe the angry mob that mockingly calls this game a WALKING SIMULATOR. It is not. Although it is terrible, it still has a good chunk of gameplay in it. You constantly micro manage your strategies, your workload, your deliveries, equipment, route, etc. Gameplay is there, really. It's just not as thrilling when you hit the 20 hours mark. It gets old and boring.

The times i most enjoyed this game were the cutscenes and straight-forward story bits. No packages to deliver, no chores to accomplish, no backtracking, just you and the story carrying along together. I wish there were more of these moments in the game. Because the amount of ""standard deliveries"" is huge and if you try to complete all of them like i did in the first few episodes, you will get a burnout and will rush to end the story. Even the mandatory orders felt like chores. I remember yelling at the game a few times just because it didn't let me progress through the story which i'm very curious about and made me do another mandatory chore. I get the idea behind it but... it is a game after all. It has to be fun.

Death Stranding took me by total surprise, the game starts off initially quite dull and full of the true remarks of the game being a walking simulator, but as you explored more, and played along with its cargo deliveries and then took in more of the story the game wants to tell you, it became more than just a game of walking, the troubles you endure in this game is to show the pain and effort Sam Porter has to go through, and keep this to heart as you play, put yourself in his shoes. 

And so Hideo Kojima really outdid himself on this title, and really set out to do what he wanted, and that was to tell us a story. The game drives home a simple point as you play it, to think twice before you kill someone in any context, and to learn to connect with people.

Ingredients:

1 ox bung
1.4kg lamb's pluck, (heart, lungs and liver)
500g of beef, or lamb trimmings or stewing steak
200g of suet
500g of oatmeal, (coarse)

SEASONING (ADJUST TO TASTE):

2 tbsp of black pepper, ground
1 nutmeg, finely grated
4 tbsp of coriander seeds
4 tbsp of fine sea salt


1
Rinse the whole pluck in cold water. Trim off any large pieces of fat and cut away the windpipe

2
Place in a good sized pot and cover with cold water. The lungs float, so keep submerged with a plate or a lid. Bring to the boil and skim the surface regularly. Gently simmer for 2 hours

3
Lift the meat from the pot with tongs or a slotted spoon, and rinse in cold water to remove any scum. Place into a bowl and leave to cool


4
Strain cooking liquid through a fine sieve and put back on the stove to reduce until you have roughly 500–1l of stock. Leave to cool

5
Whilst the stock reduces, finely dice the cooked heart and lungs. Grate the liver using the coarse side of the grater. Finely dice the trimmings. Mix together in a large bowl, along with the suet, oatmeal and spices

6
Measure how much stock remains from cooking the pluck, and make up to 1l with cold water. When cool, add to the haggis mixture

7
To check the seasoning, pan fry a tablespoon of the mixture for 2–3 minutes and taste. Add any extra salt, pepper or spice if needed

8
Spoon the haggis mixture into the soaked, rinsed ox bung. Be aware the filling swells as it cooks, so pack quite loosely, and keep a little bung at each end

9
When the haggis is the size required, expel any extra air, pinch, tie with string and cut with scissors

10
Tie the new end of the bung, and continue stuffing. Freeze any spare haggises

11
Before cooking, pierce the haggis several times with a needle. Place in a pan of cold water, and bring to the boil. Simmer for 1.5–2 hours. When ready, the internal temperature should read at least 74°C

12
Serve with mashed potatoes and swede. Or neeps and tatties

Calling this game a walking simulator is incredibly diminishing, much in the same way calling Dark Souls an adventure game would be. It's something... different, new, and you certainly do much more than just walking.

That being said, the game very much centers around the idea of making deliveries from place to place - the fun lies in the challenge of getting it done. Could be horrid terrain, could be a groups of vandals who want your cargo, could be merciless terrorists who crave nothing but mayhem, could be something otherworldly and rather ominous - something I find difficult to explain even as I progress through the story.

You are given plenty of tools to achieve your goals, but because some of them are quite perplexing or surprising I am reluctant to mention them... I'd be delving into spoiler territory.


The game at points presents you with serious themes, attempting to suck you into this strange, familiar world, only to suddenly throw a curve-ball and do something silly or goofy. I think one of the first soundtracks the game played for me was titled ""Don't be so serious"" and I think that's exactly how the game is meant to be played. Don't be so serious! Enjoy the wild ride, because a wild ride it is.

A Hideo Kojima experience through and through, with all the good (and bad) that entails.

I absolutely understand why this game isn't for everyone, again, in much the same way I know Dark Souls isn't for everyone. It's very challenging, very different, and bravely attempts to do something games haven't tried before.

Dark Souls stopped treating gamers as babies, and told them to git gud.
Death Stranding attempts to teach gamers that simply traversing the terrain, taking in the sights, planning routes and dealing with the unpredictable can be a fun mechanic in and of itself.

I am enjoying far more than I ever thought I would. Maybe you will to!

(I must reinforce this: Don't buy it if you -absolutely- need combat to be the focus. You'll hate it, for even when conflict eventually visits you, the game discourages you from taking part in it, especially if you want to go lethal. Does it give you that option? Yes. Will it make the game easier? Arguably, it will make the game even more difficult. Trust me. Dealing with the aftermath of killing another human is quite complicated, a chore really.)

[u] this review is spoiler free[/u]

I was nervous and unsure about buying this game when I first heard some people calling it “ just a walking simulator” or “just one big fetch quest” two things that certainly didn’t appeal to me. However after watching a REALLY good review for the PC version which I will link (https://youtu.be/7Q_fj-PO0JI) It convinced me to take the plunge. 

Now I’m not going to go on for ages about ‘what’ this game is because there’s thousands of reviews on here telling you about the premise of the game. Instead I’m going to tell you my experience and how a game that seemed to have almost zero appeal to me (by description) turned out to be one of the best games I’ve ever experienced. 

First off the first 2 hours appears to have mixed opinions from both fans and critics but I loved it ! It sets the world up beautifully and really introduces you to the world and it’s mechanics and characters and this start is needed for your investment in the story. After 2 hours it really opens up into the game you probably expected when you bought it. 


[u]the moment I knew[/u] 

It was about 2 hours in and I was on a delivery, I was scaling a beautiful mountain, I had used all my ropes and ladders so was crawling up and kept tumbling down and getting back up and climbing again.. this was a long trip.. my stamina was low.. my shoes had worn down, my feet was bleeding, I was limping and as I stumbled and tumbled down a section of the mountain for the third time I really felt all Hope was lost and I wouldn’t make my destination. 

Then as I dragged myself up and saw a rope another player had left who had scaled that same mountain I grabbed onto it and dragged myself up. As I scaled and limped across the summit, in the morning sunlight I saw my destination on the horizon and the song “don’t be so serious” by Low Roar started playing and it just felt so real and beautiful it was a moment I rarely had in gaming.. I felt and worked hard for every step of that journey I forgot I was playing a game. I can’t relate to saving the world from demons, I can’t relate to being a superhero and I can’t relate to been through military war.. 

but what I can relate to is going on a journey where the odds are stacked against you, everything is going against you, everything feels like it’s beating you down and wanting to make you give up only to against all odds come through to the other side and reach that ‘destination’ the music really amplified this feeling. 

[u]Story[/u] 

I’m going to keep these sections short as I want you to experience everything first hand but the story was INCREDIBLE it made me feel everything. And honestly the story coupled with the soundtrack is something that will stick with me forever. 

[u]Music[/u] 

Though a few different artists and bands are present in the sound track the vast majority is made up by the band “Low Roar” I would recommend you look them up and give a song or two a listen because if you like their music it will really amplify the enjoyment of the game. 


[u]Graphics[/u] 

What can I say it’s probably the best looking game I’ve played period. There was generally so many moments I was just looking around in actual awe and that’s no exaggeration.. 10/10 almost photographic graphics on the landscapes. 

[u]Summary[/u] 

The game was incredible and will stick with me for many years in my head and is in my top 5 games I’ve ever played easily. Sure.. if you want a 30 hour shooty shooty bang bang game (nothing wrong with that) you might not fully enjoy it.. though I must say in the later stages of the game you do have weapons and use stealth a lot and some of the later stage bosses are visually incredible.. though not dark souls difficulty they didn’t need to be because it was very satisfying. 

So it really isn’t bland I feel like if you can find it in your heart to try something new then don’t hesitate. I came into this game just hoping it was something with an interesting story that I could mildly enjoy and relax playing it while in lockdown. Instead I found a game with an incredible story, an addicting game play loop and a fantastic cast. 


[u]Extra mentions[/u] 

Story took me about 50 hours to complete, though I did do a few side quests so would of been like 40-45 had I not done any side activity. And yes there’s post game content once the credits role with a lot of extra goody’s to keep you going post game, I’m easily going to put 100 plus hours in at this point no worries. 

One other mention is the world connectivity with other players my god it’s fantastic! Building structures and leaving equipment for others on the same hard journeys as you is an addictive feeling and seeing all the ‘likes’ you get and knowing other players appreciated your effort and found what you built useful is a huge part of the game ! Though I won’t spoil too much about it.

[b] Death Stranding [/b] is that latest game from Hideo Kojima, which initially came out with rather mixed reviews. Now we finally get to see it on PC in uncapped FPS 1440p+ glory. The only way I can describe Death Stranding by words is ‘unique’. Everything about it from the story to gameplay is unique, there really is nothing else like Death Stranding. It shows gaming isn’t just about shooting demons it can provoke thoughts and emotions, video games are an art. And Hideo Kojima just made his masterpiece.

I will not say much in detail about the narrative as you should experience it on your own, just my thoughts on how engaging the story actually was. You have a simple goal, and that is to reconnect the cities across America. While crossing through cities different objectives will arise that advance the main story, you come across countless characters some friendly and some not. While it seems like an easy to follow [b] Point A [/b] to [b] Point B [/b] kind of story it quickly adds many different obstacles, revelations to previous questions, and of course more head scratching mysteries. There are personal vendettas, US secrets, and much more to keep you guessing. The confusing nature pushed me to keep on playing, at any turn I could find the answers I needed. It’s an interesting narrative that kept me on the edge of my seat, and prolonging my play session just to see what happens next. Thankfully at the end of the game, all your questions will be answered and then some.
[b] Characters [/b]
Another strong aspect of Death stranding are the characters you meet throughout your journey. Just to name a few Diehard, Deadman, Fragile, and so much more are all real and going through their own struggles. The writing for their dialogue and backstories are really top notch. Their own personal struggles are revealed throughout which makes them feel believable and real. You grow to care for them and their own problems, which further strengthens your emotional ties to them. Even an antagonist such as Higgs which you will meet later on, are interesting and amazingly evil at times. This helps his character feel real with motivations, and not just a placeholder character to halt your progression. And Sam himself is excellently written, you will go through hell and back grow stronger wanting to see him succeed. You’re in for a real emotional trip in Death Stranding.

[h1] Gameplay [/h1]
[b] Main Loop [/b]
The concept of Death Stranding's main gameplay loop has been broken down as a delivery man simulator countless times in past reviews, but is that really a bad thing? On paper it might seem stale, but actually it’s refreshing and new something I didn’t know I needed. You will traverse beautiful vistas, marching through mud, snow, heavy showers and every bit of it’s stunning. You pick up your packages from a terminal, get your goods, plan your equipment and route, then set off to save America. Quickly you will try and test your limits to see how much cargo you can actually transport, keeping its condition well and delivered in a timely manner. There isn’t else to say, it's a unique concept never tried before, but implemented wonderfully here. There is also a multiplayer like element in Death Stranding, you can leave behind packages, bridges, and much more to help your fellow porters. I didn't think this would be as big of an aspect as it truly is, but leaving behind that zipline that got 4,648 likes by other players is rewarding on its own. And the countless times other players' structures helped me is staggering. It really brings the theme of ‘we’re in this together’ to life.
[b] Exploration [/b]
When you’re not completing deliveries you will find yourself just exploring this world. You trek across the unforgiving landscape of post apocalyptic United States. There are many mountains to discover, little caves scattered throughout and new routes to help on your next delivery. Traversing the environment is oddly therapeutic, taking in the beauty and looking through every nook and cranny is as much a part of the game as delivering packages is. You have many tools at your disposal such as ladders and climbing anchors to help you reach the summit of any mountain you see on the horizon.
[b] Combat/Bt encounters [/b]
While doing the main objective, or delivering packages you will come across MULEs and of course the infamous BTs. Firstly, combat is obviously not a focal point here, but the encounters were easily avoidable and spaced out that when they did occur they were a fun change of pace to making deliveries. Many weapons are at your disposal lethal and not, combinations of tools can also lead to fun ways to take care of enemies. Boss fights occur a handful amount of times, all having their own twist and ways to overcome them.. BT encounters are also a surprisingly fun but horrifying obstacle to overcome. Sneaking through holding your breath, fighting back with No. 2, or praying and speeding through with your bike. There are many options to keep every encounter fresh.

[h1] Visuals & Sounds [/h1]
[b] Visuals [/b]
Death Stranding is a visually stunning game, the vistas you will come across are second to none. Everything from footprints, Sam’s suit, BB, etc are incredibly detailed. It also comes with an impressive weather and lighting system. Add all these things together then boom, you get one of the most unique and interesting atmospheres in all of gaming. With the addition of photo mode, which I have a love/hate relationship with because I take so many photos. I took a total of 543 screenshots by the end of my journey, the mountains, characters, weapons are all so visually amazing that I found myself stopping often to admire and screencap. The visuals speak for themselves and elude feelings of hopelessness and dread. 
[b] Sounds [/b]
The sounds here perfectly compliment the vibe and visuals of Death Stranding. Each interaction such as footprints hitting the environment are realistic and help make this an extremely immersive experience. Paired along with the voice acting with such an amazing cast of actors, makes Death Stranding feel like a movie at all times. The lines are read beautifully by each cast member, delivered with emotion and really has scenes leaving a lasting impact. The soundtrack is also handpicked by Kojima to compliment what is happening on screen. There is no better feeling in this game than completing a tough climb over a mountain to have a licensed song play on your blissful walk down the other side. The combination of visuals and sound creates an incredible atmosphere paired with excellent presentation like no other.

6,DEATH STRANDING,73106275,english,"[H1]The toughest journeys begin with a single step...[/H1]

Death Stranding proves several things. Firstly - Hideo Kojima can exist (mostly) outside of the Metal Gear Solid IP. There's still some of the basics that desperately cling to the core mechanics that I swear you could say ""This is a Kojima game"" but he seems to be finding his way out of those. Secondly - He can tell intimate stories at the same time as he paints big grand messages about humanity in general. Most critically - The PC version is the definitive version but even then it misses one or two things that would have made this and perhaps all flavours of Death Stranding absolutely ideal as an experience.

Let's start with the good, because there is an awful lot to love about this game, and there is a lot to understand going in if you're interested in Death Stranding.

[H1]Reconnecting the world through the eyes of the worlds most dangerous delivery man...[/H1]

Death Stranding is one part walking simulator... WAIT. WAIT. DO NOT LEAVE THE REVIEW... by Walking Simulator I do not mean things like Gone Home, where you prod around a house in the hopes of pleasing Ben Kuchera. Here I mean ""Spintires on legs"". You have to get from A to B on feet, and unlike any game before it, that means traversing terrain.

Terrain that changes on a centimetre by centimetre basis. It can be smooth, firm dirt one moment, and then boggy, stamina sapping moss the next. It can be littered with rocks that try to trip you up, it can be flat, it can be steep, it can be a rushing river complete with varying speeds of current that you have to ford. This doesn't change too much even when you have access to vehicles, since the added size means paths you'd easily traverse on foot become inaccessible on vehicle and you switch from picking routes through harsh terrain to having to plan your routes and taking longer, detoured paths through easier terrain to accommodate your larger hauls.

In between making those deliveries and fighting and mastering the terrain, the occasional flashes of MGS genetic ancestry show through when you encounter the primary enemies of the game (BTs) and the secondary enemies (human foes), the game gives you free reign in how you tackle these foes, either opting to speed away from them or stealthing past them or in the later stages, opting to apply stealth takedowns or even just go loud and tackle them directly. The fact the game forces you to act from a position of weakness to begin with is a good choice as it means that when the tools are finally provided, you feel liberated, and you do not feel that shooting is your default option, there's ""always another way"" and you'll often switch up your approach depending on the challenges put in front of you.

[H1]It's not just the gameplay that's rich, the graphics, sound and music are too...[/H1]

Low Roar is an *inspired* choice of backdrop for the music in this game, their extensive use as the soundtrack for this game proves to be borderline addictive, and makes you wish there was a mobile option to generate music on your travels so you could have the music with you all the time, and not just when the game decides you are worthy of it. The sound backdrrop is always on point, with the environment here always offering subtle cues as to what is going on, your suit even giving you the appropriate notifications as for things like Timefall, and Mule/Demens camps being suitably tense when their communications sound like demented, digital howls.

And then there's the graphics...

Hoo boy. At Ultra/1440p the graphics are flat out bonkers. With no 30fps cap as with the Playstation you are treated to a smooth, polished experience where you can be more precise, where there is no judder, no frame hitches, and where the game feels like it was meant to be experienced all along. The scenery is, and always has been flat out gorgeous but the extra smoothness means it just -feels- so much better. There's a few *minor* improvements here and there, the biggest of which is the colour balancing has been adjusted and that lends itself to a better contrast on the PC, but outside of that it's the performance where things are most keenly felt.

[H1]And what of the issues?[/H1]

No in game sound player for ""on the move"" is an issue... sometimes I'd like to listen to Low Roar when I'm hauling stuff. Timefall is punishing on your *unupgraded* structures. If you want anything to live longer than a week or two realtime, make sure it's upgraded. Don't worry too much about ladders and climbing poles whining about the fact they're going to rust to death, you can always put down fresh ones.

Oh yeah, and vehicle physics can sometimes fall apart and be made of jank. So there's that. Whilst the ""on foot physics"" are a thing of beauty, the game doesn't handle wheels quite as gracefully, I've had a few cases of my truck doing... interesting things on account of being in places where the wheels have decided to have hot, heavy intercourse with a large boulder.

I suspect that the game expected you to run the vehicles on mostly flat ground, not try to run them up snowy mountains. Fools. Of course we're going to do that!

[H1]Closing thoughts[/H1]

This is *not* a game for everyone. Even MGS fans should be careful since this is a departure from the standard Kojima fare, you're going to spend most of your time ""Not killing"" and instead trying to pick your way through horrible terrain making sure medication gets to really out of the way places. If the human version of Spintires sounds like your thing, then buy this without hesitation, otherwise, make sure to watch a few youtubes of _actual_ gameplay. The story is very much in the Kojima wheelhouse and you'll know what to expect (no, I'm not spoilering any of it here, go in blind and strap in for one of his wild rides).

Verdict: [b]Essential. If you're in to hauling stuff and Hideo Kojima[/b]

7,DEATH STRANDING,73136704,english,"Up front, I had no performance issues whatsoever. I say this since many negative reviews are about that, but - worked fine for me.

It's unfortunately the game when working as-intended I don't recommend. It is without a doubt beautiful, and technically top-notch, but mechanically and cinematically it falls down as often as the main character.

In the unlikely event you're still reading at this point, these are my main criticisms:

Mechanically, fiddly inventory management and walking simulation are probably amongst the lists of 'do not dos' in most game design textbooks. It almost seems Kojima deliberately picked the two most renowned 'bad' game mechanics, and tried to make them 'good'. The problem then is that whilst he succeeded in highly-polishing them, he didn't revolutionise them; so Death Stranding is still a game with mechanics at it's core that aren't really much fun. Even with a beautifully animated avatar in photo-realistic terrain, spending 15 QTE-filled minutes walking from a) to b) is tedious. None of the stuff layered on-top solves this problem and in many cases doesn't merge well with it; stealth is notably worse than in, for example, MGS5, as a result; there's probably a reason every gadget Big Boss used wasn't carried in a giant container.

In terms of presentation, the game tries (often too) hard to be a movie. I don't really have a problem with product placement per-se, even when said placement is advertising is a leading cause of obesity to sedentary teenagers. What does strike me is how it's almost done in a 'Hey look! We're just like a Hollywood movie!' presentation style; almost as if the placement is an attempt to legitimise games as a mainstream thing 'worthy' of product placement. This runs through the pushing of 'Hey look who this actor is! Look! They're famous!' as characters are introduced, and it ultimately feels like cinematically the game is trying too hard to be good, rather than just *being* good.

This leads to the narrative, which is either the best or the worst bit, depending on how much you like mediocre Netflix mini-series. It's unquestionably quirky, which is not a problem in itself, but sometimes becomes one when the plot tries to take itself seriously. And it does try hard to take itself seriously, due to the cinematic aspirations mentioned above. It also doesn't shy away from cutscenes, but the narrative is too thin to support many of them, so many feel like wasted time that does little to advance the plot. Attempts to engage your emotions are so overt, you can sometimes see what's coming next with more foresight than when a guy in a red Star Trek uniform announces he's a day from retirement. The narratives are (literally) confined to a room - that wonderful idea we have GTA to thank for - so there's no meaningful interaction with characters outside sitting and watching them Do Acting.

This means that extra engagement that games can facilitate leading to real Aerith-death moments is missed. When one of the characters is an eerily-rendered-uncanny-valley-baby, and your main emotional reaction is 'hey, look at the subsurface shader on that!', you know there's not much connection going on. 

For all the criticisms, it's worth again noting the visuals and tech are pretty much top-notch, and there's few issues with the PC port. If you want a tech demo to validate your expensive GPU, certainly look no further. But if I'm to recommend, I feel like i'd need either a great mechanic, or a great story, and I couldn't find it here.",1595462702,1595462702,FALSE,5,0,0.49496147,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,147,9,717,0,717,1595459224,,

This review has been changed to reflect the fact that it is playable for me @32:9 aspect and 3840x1080 resolution

Super Ultra Wide is NOT a new thing :( There has been a lot of tears and people posting about lack of resolution / aspect ratio support with workarounds posted, so you never know the dev's might just pick up on it and do something.

Edit :- After playing another 75hrs I am still happy (I did notice the games performance drop off once half way through thou I suspect that later patch's may help fix this up or I could just turn my game down slightly) Dont forget I am playing on old hardware.

+++ the story is spicy !!! 
+++ Gameplay and mechanics are addicting !!!
+++ Actors did an amazing job on this one (except for conan xD troll)
+++ Art is phenomenal !!!
+++ The world is huge ( especially the second map you get to and spend most of your time...) 
+++ Meaningful journey/Fully Free way of achieving how and when you get from point A to B
+++ The amount of possible ways you can go with this game is absurd!!!
+++ The music is very gucci as well

--- The cars and bikes in this game have a weird way of interacting with some terrain and it is not fun when controls going left make you go right, and boosters just making your life miserable with uncontrollable turns and slips... for me this was a bit frustrating sometimes...


--- Most things in game can be bypassed by brute-forcing around with the vehicles !!! I feel like making them suffer more damage or more impossible to get places would of been a ""fix"" , so the meaningful journey isn't bypassed as easy.

The world is huge, and there are many places to unlock and many quests to be done. I passed the game in 50 hours although I spent a lot of time doing side quests and building facilities so I think that 30 hours is a fine estimate for the game length without any side quests. For beating the whole game - I am sure it will take atleast twice as long.

57,DEATH STRANDING,73105868,english,"Let me start by saying this game is not for everyone. While that may seem obvious to anyone who's played a wide range of games, it's apparently not obvious to everyone. I also know that ""not for everyone"" is used to justify a lot of crappy games, so let's dive right in to the meat of the review. Keep in mind the review will have spoilers.

Death Stranding is a strange game, from concept to story. You play as a delivery man in a divided world after an event known as the ""Death Stranding"" occurred. Now, you'd think playing as a delivery man would be exceedingly boring, but there's a lot more to it.

Your primary goal at any point in the game is always going to be moving cargo from point A to point B, there's no escaping that. You're a delivery man, not a soldier or a spy. However, the cargo may require special care. For example, some cargo can only be carried by hand, which completely shifts the delivery process.

Before you even set out on a delivery, there are things you need to think about: your route, how much weight you're carrying, how you're transporting the cargo, just to name a few. You start out delivering on foot, but as the game progresses you'll unlock upgrades to your equipment, vehicles, and even the ability to build roads (you don't choose the road locations yourself, though). You also unlock fast travel between certain points, but you cannot bring any cargo with you.

Each terrain type is different and provides different challenges, but you'll always want to keep an eye on your stamina. If you're going over terrain that has many steep areas, you'll probably try to move more slowly to avoid falling. If the terrain is wet, you have to be careful not to slip.

I won't get into the specifics of delivering much more, lest this review turn into a guide, but you get the idea: delivering isn't as easy as going from A to B. This is [b]not[/b] a walking simulator, despite what the trolls may claim.

Equipment can be crafted at certain locations, including one piece of equipment that's essentially a 3D printer you use to create structures. You can make bridges, generators (to recharge your vehicles and your own battery), watch towers, and more. Equipment and structures decay over time, but structures can be upgraded, to slow the rate of decay, and even repaired. Naturally, upgrading and repairing incurs a resource cost.

Structures you build are shared online among a few people, if you're playing online to begin with. This means others may use those structures, as well as upgrade and help maintain them. They can also delete your structures from their game, but only you can destroy your structures from your game. Resources donated to build roads are also shared, though the specifics of how that works seem to be a mystery.

The story is way over-the-top, with some fourth wall breaks and comedic moments, but also philosophical musings and critiques of society. In other words, typical Kojima. There are also some plot twists; some you can probably see coming, others not so much.
One of the best things about the story is that every single story thread is given a conclusion. I had questions while I played the game, but every single one was answered by the game itself. This isn't one of those pieces of media that prompts the fans to ask questions it has no answers for so it can pretend it's ""deep"" and spark debate among fans to see which ""theory"" best fits the incomplete story. This game's story is complete and was thought out from start to finish.

The main characters' names are all puns, as is common in some works, but don't let that scare you off. They have depth to them beyond what their names might indicate.

The game, like the story, is complete. No partitioning pieces to sell off as DLC, no lootboxes, no microtransactions, nothing. You buy it and you get the full experience, end of story.
Disclaimer: There were a few colors for minor items that you could only get if you'd preordered the game, but I don't consider those to be significant.

From a technical standpoint, this is a very good port. Some people are reporting issues that the devs are working to fix, but for most players the game runs perfectly, as evidenced by its score.

Now for the parts of the game that some people might have issues with.
[list]
[*]The game and story take a while to really open up. Even then, the game focuses primarily on getting past enemies unseen, to protect your cargo. There's a lot of action in the game, but it's in very specific areas and parts of the story.
[*]Your character barely speaks even when people ask him questions directly. Personally, I find this incredibly annoying.
[*]The soundtrack can be a bit... odd, at times.
[*]Some product placement, which some people say ""breaks immersion"". I don't mind it because I know it probably had to be done to secure enough funding for the game, and it's not like there's no product placement in other games.
[*]Because structures are shared online, this may reduce the difficulty of the overall game in certain areas. Although this is the point of the game, some people don't like this. To avoid this, you can play offline or just dismantle the structures and build your own.
[*]There is no NG+.
[*]There's a certain part at the end where you'll just alt+tab out for about a minute at a time because it functions as a sort of unskippable cutscene. This is my main complaint about the game, which should tell you a lot given that it only comes at the end and you only have to suffer through it once.

GAMEPLAY:
Everyone always says how tired they are of game clones and repetitive titles and want something new, this is as close as you can get to a completely brand new genre. You already know what you are getting when you look at gameplay, yes, it is a ""walking simulator"". This does not mean it is easy or boring. In most open world games getting from A to B is fun for the first couple hours and slowly becomes a chore as you try to get to the next mission. In this game getting from A to B IS the mission, and I loved every second of it. Figuring out how you're going to get over a steep cliff or through a BT infested zone requires thought and effort. You won't be able to hit forward and walk with no issue, you're going to have to stay focused. The addition of players building up the world with you is done in such a unique way too. The closest example is Dark Souls, leaving messages to help each other, but in this you are truly helping thousands of people simply by leaving a ladder in place or making a shelter. It's crazy how you will never actually see another player but you will feel much more connected to people than any other game I've ever played. The landscapes are incredible. The physics are incredible. The soundtrack, and how they use it, is incredible. The main thing here is if you look at gameplay and think ""This is boring"" it will probably be boring for you, and that's fine. It isn't for everyone, but you if you make something everyone will like, no one will truly love it.
STORY:
This is my second Kojima game. The first was MGS:V, and like most people who started with that (and tried to understand the rest of the story before) it was pretty damn confusing. The story here feels much more natural. It can be strange but this is a strange world. You will form genuine connections with the characters, especially BB, and become invested in the story. Kojima had something in mind when making this and there are messages that can be pulled back to our world. The product placement does feel funny and might pull you out a little bit but I didn't really mind it that much. 

Overall this is a solid 9/10 for me. It isn't for everyone, the story can be weird sometimes, and getting somewhere can be frustrating (in a difficulty way, not an unfair way). These are very light complaints compared to everything else being so solid. Even if you hate the idea of this game, or Kojima, you should try and respect that someone is actually doing something different in an industry filled with loot boxes and gambling mechanics.",1595439998,1595439998,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,272,5,235,0,167,1595738513,,

73,DEATH STRANDING,72796191,english,"Weird, majestic, and a little disturbing.  The PC port runs fabulously, and it's hard to know how to describe the gameplay.  Fundamentally it's a game about getting around, but I suspect I've only scratched the surface of it.  The beginning is really front-loaded with exposition / cutscenes, but after a few hours you finally get to play more than watch and it feels like way more than just a 'walking simulator'.

I really like the purely cooperative nature of interacting with other people, it's strangely fun to think about useful places to put stuff not just for yourself, but for others.

EDIT ON FINISHING:
I don't have too much more to add here, except that the second (and major) area of the game really expands on the mechanics to firmly pull things out of the 'walking' simulator genre.  I thought the gameplay wore out its welcome right about at the point where I was able to just ride the plot train to the ending, which was perfect.

It's really hard to get across whether anyone is going to love or hate this game, but I for one am really glad I took a try at it.",1594918429,1595438222,TRUE,3,0,0.507042229,1,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,958,47,3673,0,516,1595429776,,
74,DEATH STRANDING,73119006,english,"""Death Stranding"" is a unique game. I'm now 10 hours in. My impressions so far are as following:

1. The landscapes are beautifully done. Same is true for the sound and the music. And both is important for creating the special atmosphere ingame and to transport the story.

2. The ""body balance"" simulation - active while walking, climbing or crossing rivers - is creative and interesting and well done. But it also means that each miss-step can have its cost for health and the carried goods. You have to be all the time alerted while traveling and that makes it more intense.

3. The interface and all controls are made specifically only for consoles. I hate both outright and I'm tired of halfbacked PC ports and its my only real problem with this game. Not really optimized for a PC game.  The interface is unintuitive and often crowded and I'm very disappointed that this famous Dev cannot achieve a better interface design that fits PC's more naturally.

4. What I really love in this game is the visual style. Its full of very small real life details and shows that the Dev is a real master of esthetics. It helps to connect more deeply with the world and the wellmade characters. And thats the only reason why I bought several of this Devs former games too.

5. The story itself (as far as I've seen it in 10 hours) is interesting. That said, when I want to read a book I buy one. Most ingame texts are just blabla for me and a waist of my time. Its a shame I can never end this game so I don't know what all the fuzz ingame is about in the end.

6. I play the game on 3440x1440 with a NVIDIA GTX 2070/Intel i5 3,4 GHz. I had most of the time between 70-85 fps, thats really good performace wise. But sometimes sudden lagging can happen. I had one CTD ingame so far, reason unknown.

7. The Fights are underwhelming and mediocre and most often fighting is just a mess. Fighting is certainly not a strenght of this game, rather a weakness... Paired with the control problems on PC it can get quite frustrating quickly and it does not feel natural at all. The potential is not realized at all.

8. Other things: The Motorcycle is a joke. Its design is hilarious and the driving and reach  sucks outright. What a disappointment, its so bad. And the advertisment for this shitty MONSTERdrinks ingame breaks any immersion outright and shows that a company paid a lots for ingame ads. An absolute nogo for such an expensive game.

Conclusion: 
As in all the former games of this famous Dev that I own it seems that console players are the only real target audience, not PC players. For consoles this game is probably great. Its a shame and a waist that this Dev cannot create games made and really optimized for PC controls. The movement can be tricky and annoying with mouse and keyboard controls, specially in restricted spaces and fights. For me its the only reason for a clear thumb down. 

It means again I will never ever end this high prized game - as it happened with the former games from this Dev too - so I will never experience all the great content I payed for - again. And it also means I will never ever again buy a game from this Dev. I love his unique esthetics and his highly creative and highly detailed worlds; but I'm really tired of it to see a lots of promising gameplay potential in his games - but never beeing actually able to play it to the end because of bad ports of controls and interfaces. 

My patience with this kind of unfinished console ports is definite exhausted.

I knew it. Death stranding is sequel to dead space franchise. It seems Issac Clarke was successful in trying to defeat the brethren moon but earth was in very bad shape so earth's gravity absorbed corpses of bretheren moon to fix itself but it came with a cost. Humans got powers of beach when earth merged with brethren moon and it was forever changed like they show in the game and everything is destroyed. Humanity eventually rebuilds itself from scratch and forgot about the moon bretheren. But the power humans gained from brethren moon remained. Those power are influenced by the remains of brethren moons who are part of earh and humanity now. Thats why [spoiler] extinction events [/spoiler] happens because its the mission of brethren moons to consume everything but since they died their soul remained and formed the beach and since they are now part of humanity, humans have beaches too. In short, [spoiler] extinction events [/spoiler] occur because of brethren moons. In the game many characters say make us whole again just like dead space. To understand death stranding you need to play dead space 1, dead space 2 and dead space 3.

Story:
The story is just great. It's epic and full of emotions. 
DS has found a great way to show you the story: wtf-moment -> infos about it ->wtf-moment -> infos about it -> and so on. Many parts of the DS-Lore are including real theories ( I can't explain more to stay spoiler free)

Graphics:

Traversing harsh landscape // Plotting a course, picking up packages, arranging to make yourself the most stable, dodging BT's, dodging timefalls, all while using tools that you yourself put down or that another player has before hand!

HUD and Environment // Sleek and stylish digital HUD which just flows so fantastically. It can be overwhelming at first, but once you get over the hurdle of mass information that's displayed to you, it's a very nice look. Environment is beautiful as well.

6,DEATH STRANDING,73113537,english,"This game is like what you get when Hideo Kojima spilt his secret sauce all over his ideas notebook, slid it between two cheeks of bread, and realised you don't even need a burger for it to taste good. This game isn't a nothingburger, it's an ideasburger.

I thought the game was good; I enjoyed the majority of it. Still, I have a few gripes.

Kojima plays with the tools available in the Decima engine, particularly its filmic camera system. DS blurs the line between cinema and video game; it uses many of the tools and tropes employed in cinema, while also exploring things that can pretty much only occur in a computer-generated environment. This is done so well that the majority of times it broke immersion were due to poor delivery on the part of the actors, and the sometimes-clunky, overburdened monologues.

The game's story further expounds Kojima's concern around hostility between cultures, and the use of nuclear armaments. Death Stranding charts the progression of an 'everyman' character tasked only to do his job, delivering packages, but under increasingly hostile conditions and an increasingly bleak outlook. Kojima extols forming connections, and 'raging against the dying of the light' as resistance, or an antidote, to a climate of hostility and conflict which leads, ultimately, towards entropy. The player is praised highly for performing a task well, and the disposition of other characters towards Sam changes as you succeed more and more. This became excessive and repetitive by the later stages of the game, but is still appreciated.

Much of the game's story is highly symbolic, and much of what you encounter is loaded with multiple meanings, intentionally so. In some cases, the links are tenuous, and in frantically seeking to explain or justify itself, the story exposition can come off kind of preachy, pretentious, or both. This is exemplified more strongly in some characters than others, in part due to the performance of the lines they deliver.

I was super hyped for this game's initial release, but stayed away after holding off on the PS4 release when the PC version was announced, sometime last year. Reviews were hit and miss, and I was disappointed. But then I realised games journalism is mainly done by hacks now, and decided to risk my siddy dollars. Money well spent. Glad I got to experience it.

[b][i] PROS:[/i][/b]
[list]
[*][b]Stunning visuals.[/b] High level of fidelity with great lighting in the majority of scenes. Rugged landscape informed by real-world Icelandic terrain. 
[*][b]Fantastic animations.[/b] You can really see the mocap at work. Great transitions between animations. Everything feels seamless, you really have to look close to spot any flaws. Facial microexpressions in cutscenes really elevate some of the performances.
[*][b]Cinematic cutscenes.[/b] Much of the story exposition is done through cutscenes, and here the line is blurred between cinema and video game.
[*][b]Satisfying combat.[/b] Scales with difficulty, but still feels possible in very hard mode.
[*][b]Open-world environment[/b], but doesn't become the 'big, empty' that most games fall victim to.  Has enough points of interest to keep you occupied, terrain obstacles to overcome, and some routes not important to the main story give you a lot of breathing room if you feel like going for a hike and taking it all in.
[*][b]Effective, well-thought-out traversal mechanics.[/b] The game does a good job of equipping you to interpret the terrain and plan your route around it.
[*][b]Meaningful progression[/b] - it feels earned, and rapidly and greatly expands the choices available to you, without invalidating stuff that came before.
[*][b]A main gameplay loop that doesn't try to act like it's not a series of fetch quests.[/b]

[b][i] CONS:[/i][/b]
[list]
[*][b]Generic side-plots:[/b] the majority of minor characters are shallow, with some poignant, but often melodramatic, lore shoehorned in, usually delivered via rambling mail messages.
[*][b]Meaningless side-quests in abundance.[/b] I can't think of an open-world game that doesn't commit this sin, except maybe some of the Witcher series.
[*][b]Many cutscenes between basic interactions.[/b] All skippable, but segmented so that you will find yourself having to hit skip repeatedly. An hour of my life spend skipping repetitive, generic responses.

16,DEATH STRANDING,73109896,english,"//story spoiler free//

In Death Stranding, gameplay and story synchronise completely. 

The theme of connection is reinforced through the story beats, your gameplay actions, and online interactions; and because of this cohesion, Death Stranding is one of the most immersive games I've played. 
(note that I'm still not finished, and I don't think I'm even close)

What I've immediately noticed with Death Stranding's gameplay is my thought processes when navigating the game world, it felt familiar. The calm, methodical, and constant problem solving as you constantly alter your choice in path is exactly the same feeling I get when hiking or rock climbing! (two hobbies I enjoy). 

This calm and deliberate thought process is directly contrasted when you are faced with escaping, or fighting, a BT (Beached Thing). 

Moving through BT territory is incredibly tense. Your Odradek (the shoulder thing) will pulsate faster the closer you are to a BT, stopping for a moment will reveal the BT's visually; prior to this they are invisible. The bridge baby you carry helps you see the BTs for that brief moment. 

When you are caught by a BT, panic immediately kicks in. The ground in your immediate vicinity turns to oil, land masses crack open, the BT manifests, and everything begins to sink. You have one goal.

GET. OUT.

At this stage your previously calm pathfinding becomes a rapid assessment of whatever sinking landmass is the next step toward safety. And it looks GORGEOUS the entire time.

One thing I particularly enjoy is the online functionality, again I'll state that this aspect of Death Stranding further reinforces the theme of connection. Among other options; you can build bridges, place ladders, ropes, signs, and contribute resources to larger structures like repairing a road. These objects may show up in other players' worlds, and theirs in yours, once you have connected that area to the Chiral network. If you don't like something that has shown up in your world, you can remove it. 

These objects/icons leave me carefully considering the route I'll take for an objective. Oftentimes I'll note a well-signed path on my map and choose to take an alternate route. This may be more challenging initially but what I find is, if the path I take is rewarding, I'll add a couple of signs to give other players alternate and interesting options. It brings a smile to my face when I've been helped by someone's object or when I get notifications (likes) that my objects have been used by other players.

Death Stranding is very unique and is an excellent example of how well-crafted video games can deliver a more immersive story experience than any other media. How you move, the music, visual style, sombre tones, character and online interaction, and funny gameplay options (like slamming a Monster Energy or 4 then pissing off the edge of a cliff), makes Death Stranding feel so uniquely human.

The combat is fine, a bit too much grenade throwing on the special enemies for the longest time and then Bola action against the humans.

32,DEATH STRANDING,73103161,english,"Hideo Kojima is probably the biggest hit-or-miss developer I can think of still working today, except maybe Suda 51. Kojima does what he wants with a video game he makes, player enjoyment or expectation be damned, which can often lead to many people being turned off by his games, or at least certain sections of them (the B&B unit from MGSIV has never sat entirely right with me). Death Stranding is no different, considering that the game takes a loooooooong time to get started, enough that you'll be past the refund point before you even start getting out into the world and making deliveries. There's also way too much exposition in the early stages, and you don't even get anything to fight the game's main enemies with until about 6 hours in. Not only that, the main gameplay can be compared to that of a series of fetch quests.

So, why do I recommend this game?

Well, while Death Stranding is a game that not a lot of people will like, and it requires one to have a certain mindset to go in, the experience can be very, very engaging. Being someone who likes games like Elite Dangerous and STALKER, the idea of being a post-apocalyptic mailman is something that I actually rather like, and I feel a lot of others would too. There's something engaging about carting supplies 3 kilometers on foot through rough terrain, where you can put on a podcast and drink in the beautifully destroyed scenery of post-Stranding America while managing your load, navigating mountains, and eventually, enter into tense situations that require you to think and plan ahead instead of brute-forcing your way through, simply because of the limited tools at your disposal. Even when you have said tools and weapons, hauling ass is often the best option. 

All in all, Death Stranding is a game that I recommend, but I would totally understand if you don't like it. Aside from normal Kojima weirdness and jank (Die-Hardman actually being a name someone un-ironically thought of and implemented into a AAA game is hilarious to me), it has a gameplay loop that won't be engaging to some. I'd say wait for a sale, even though I bought the game full price and would probably do so again, despite its flaws. If you try this game, just be aware of what you're getting into.

This game has a vast trove of deep lore to explore. Everything feels purposeful. Even as the most seemingly absurd of settings, the world and the events in it feel like they have a past, a story, a thread of internal consistency that turns them from fantastical oddities into their own sort of rationality.

42,DEATH STRANDING,73091386,english,"Hideo Kojima had set out to do something different that was far removed from his Metal Gear days at Konami.
I can honestly say that this game is a breath of fresh air in terms of game-play, story, and atmosphere. 

Like many before myself had stated; This game is not for everyone. This game does not reward a button push
with some instant gratification similar to that of Call of Duty or Fortnite. Death Stranding in all of it's frustrating glory is
unique and invites intrigue and even self-reflection in a world where connection to others is more important than ever. 
It's a cinematic gaming experience that could be akin to that of 2001: A Space Odyssey or Star Trek: The Motion Picture (Let me explain) which present very provocative ideas, but sometimes to execution of which is not perfect. 

At first, the game-play can be very overwhelming as you take control as Sam ""Porter"" bridges for the first time. You traverse very treacherous landscapes and as you make your first delivery - have to be extremely careful as to how you walk and carry your load. If you become overloaded Sam will move slower and less stable and you'd be more likely to fall over and damage your cargo. Over time as you upgrade equipment, finish deliveries, and level up - you'll be able to carry more as well as be more effective in carrying said cargo to it's destination. This, sadly, takes a lot of time to accomplish and does drag down the game in terms of pacing to almost near halt. Your first encounter with the paranormal beings known as BT's or Beached Things isn't any better. You have no true way to combat them and your best bet is to find the fastest safest route around or through them before Timefall erodes your cargo. As you progress - you will acquire weapons and tools to help you navigate through BT territory and even others can assist during this time. 
It's not perfect, but once the game play opens up - it gets considerably more fun.

The story is what you can expect from a Kojima produced game. All of it's convoluted-ness and intrigue is there, while lacking in most of the humor he's known for, Kojima does bring in it in terms of emotion and depth. You play as Sam Porter Bridges - a contracted porter working his way across the USA in order to reconnect those who have been separated due to the Death Stranding. Along the way - you meet a merry band of characters who are just as odd and unique as a Kojima written character can be who will assist Sam along the way.  The story pacing, as well, can grind to a near halt in areas and some of it does feel like filler, but for the most part - The story has heart, intrigue, and depth that you'd only find in a Kojima game.

All in all despite my gripes with the game itself - I enjoyed myself as I was able to get deep into the game as it opened up to other players assisting you, and the story starts picking up momentum. While I did find myself frustrated to the point of never playing again from time to time, I found myself enthralled enough to enjoy the games to it's very emotional and rewarding in. In a nutshell - it was worth all the hard work and frustration. In a sense, you go through what Sam goes through. I found myself very satisfied in the end. I will play again.

Ridiculous vehicle physics just like Euro/Murica Truck Simulator. OK.
Un-destructable vegetation just like Truck Simulator. OK.

Very bad: Cut scenes everywhere.

Activating terminal: cut scene
Make delivery: cut scene
Recycle items: cut scene
Making items: cut scene
Exiting terminal: cut scene
Get on vehicles: cut scene
Get off vehicles: cut scene
Encounter BTs: cut scene
Get out of BT zone: cut scene
Open PDA: cut scene
Building structures: cut scene

Cut scenes everywhere and I think they took at least 1/3 the time I played. This is very bad in my opinion and I think Japanese developers love to do this bullshit since PlayStation 1 and they never learn to do real time interactions just those in GTA and many other western games.

And graphics detail need more improvement on PC.

The North part of the map needs more tweak in gameplay. But thanks to all the player who make contribution to all the things, it's acceptable.

===What I like===

Kojima's music taste.
The general environment and atmosphere.
The BT concept.
The idea of connecting people, which I strongly felt during the COVID-19 pandemic isolation.
The way players take part in building a better world in this game's world, and how players interacting with each others.
Constructing buildings, which make almost every delivery much easier. The way you change the in-game environment leads to better or worse result you get.
""Like"". I'm a fan of hitting likes on almost every social network platform.

So there I was, with 10 bags, arms turning purple, taking breaks in the stairs. I lost balance, I dropped shit, people gave me words of encouragement on the way up... every week.  This game reminds me of that, cuz there's no way I'm making 2 trips.

61,DEATH STRANDING,73095104,english,"From the moment Death Stranding was announced at E3 2016 I, like many others, was both confused and intrigued as to what the game actually was. For the almost 4 years following I was always excited to see what the game would become. When reviews for the game came out I watched IGN's review only to be disappointed by how it described the game. I didn't own a PS4 and had no knowledge of a PC port so I ended up forgetting about the game completely. 

In early February of this year while listening to a Spotify playlist of video game soundtracks the song 'Don't Be So Serious' caught my ear. On a whim I decided to listen to the entire album for Death Stranding on Spotify. One hour and forty five minutes later I had preordered my copy of Death Stranding on Steam and began the long wait for the game's release. Between early February and the time of writing this review(mid July 2020), as anyone not living under a rock would know, alot has happened in the world. Regardless of anyone's political stance it should be easy to agree that the world, especially the US, is in a state turmoil right now. Through out all of that time I had been listening to both Death Stranding's album and soundtrack. Its in this atmosphere that I played Death Stranding for the first time.

[b] If you are willing to purchase this game, stop reading reviews and buy it. If you still need convincing or just want to listen to some random person's analysis, read on. I will remain as spoiler free as possible. [/b]

It is important to preface any discussion about Death Stranding by saying the tried and true: 'this game is not for everyone'. It isn't. To help you figure out if you would enjoy this game let me help you picture a scene that  I experienced:

[i] You've been walking for ages now. You plod one foot in front of the other, carefully scanning the snow ahead of you to ensure that you wont slip and damage your cargo, or yourself. All you can hear is the deafening roar of wind rushing through the snowy peaks and your own shivers. The wind begins to pick up and you stumble to one side, the weight of your cargo on your back weighing you down excruciatingly. You know if you damage this cargo too much you'll have to turn back and start all over again. As you look up you let out a groan, no longer able to see more then a couple feet in front of you through the snowstorm. You pull up your map and see that you are so close to the end of this miserable mountain range so you take a swig from your trusted Monster Energy® flask, put your head down, and force yourself forward. After painfully slow step after agonizingly slow step you realize that you are actually heading down. Finally, you must be so close. The view ahead of you clears and you see a beautiful lush valley stretched out before you. You missed the color green. As you hurry down the slope and trod along the rocky tundra towards a structure in the distance booming orchestral synths and calming vocals fade in. You relax, you made it. You turn in your cargo and get ready for your next delivery. [/i]

If the scenario I just described gets you as aroused as it does me, get this game and stop reading this review. The core gameplay loop provides that experience in spades. Especially if you play on the hardest difficulty, which I recommend.

Now, over 580 words into this, lets start my actual review.

You may have noticed that in the scenario I just put forward I used the first person when, in reality, the game is third person almost entirely. That brings me to my first point I want to talk about. I have always been attracted to first person games since I played Skyrim. Ever since I wandered from Riverwood to Whiterun, then to Bleak Falls Barrow I have always been enamored with games that made me feel immersed in their world. Previous to playing Death Stranding I had believed that to be truly immersive as it could be a game needed to be in the first person. Death Stranding proved me wrong. I have never felt more immersed in a game's world. Considering as much of the time in this game is spent walking from one point to the next alot of pressure was put on the sound design and environment design teams to keep that travel engaging, and it is. The ambient sounds in this game combined with the astounding landscapes in this game actually made me want to use the games included photo mode(which is very good). I cant say much for spoiler reasons but the sights you will see and places you walk through in this game are truly awe inspiring, and the sound rises to meet it. The game really makes you feel like [strike] spiderman [/strike] you are there.

Speaking of walking through places now would be a good moment to talk about the level design. Level design is not something that is brought up often in most open world games but in Death Stranding it is done so well that I would feel amiss not touching on it. Much of the moment to moment decisionmaking in this game is based around deciding what route to take to your destination and how to do it. Looking back on some of the paths I took it is becomes obvious that there are certain routes that were designed as the primary way to approach a destination. However, these routes were so well crafted and hidden that they made me feel as if I was truly making my own path to the destination, while in reality I was going exactly where the game designers wanted me to do. Especially in an open world game, I have never see level design done this well and this subtle.

Earlier in my scenario I mentioned the music. Its incredible. I don't much care for the genre of music that Death Stranding uses however every single song on the 'songs from the game' album as well as the soundtrack is incredible. And when the songs fade in as you walk through desolate America it truly does fit the game perfectly and really works well with the themes of the game.

Lets talk about the themes of this game and its story. If anyone is reading this who has already played the game you are most likely chuckling to yourself. The story in this game is complex. Very complex. There are many twists and turns that rely on you truly paying attention to the cutscenes and dialogue to grasp. This is not the type of game where you can skip cutcenenes and still get the gist of the story from the mission instructions. I mentioned the atmosphere that I played this game in because it connects significantly to the themes of this game. This is the closest I will come to spoilers to I will leave my description of the themes of this game under a spoiler warning. While it doesn't spoil any plot points, some may want to discover the themes of this game themselves. [spoiler] The major themes of this game include human connection, isolation, and depression. Its obvious to see how these themes tie into the time I played this game. These themes are woven into the story and gameplay in ingenious ways, but those are to spoilery... [/spoiler] It is also important to mention that the story is slow paced and takes its time building the plot. It isnt poorly paced, it just takes time for the story to really open up and start making sense.

Finally. Game made me cry at the end. It takes alot for a game to make me cry, not tear up, cry. 

If after all of this you think that the game might be for you, then get it. It is fully worth the price of admission. Death Stranding weaves a complex and deep story that was a wonder to experience along with its fantastic gameplay systems and genre-defying gameplay. For me at least, Death Stranding will go down as one of my favorite pieces of media ever. And if you are the type of person who looks at the gameplay and gets horny or starts drooling at the mentioning of a slow paced sci-fi story it may just be a favorite for you as well.

On a real note, I cannot recommend this game enough. Im sure it's not for everyone, but if enjoy story driven games this will definitely be for you, going into this game I heard the many ""walking sim"" comments about it and even after some spoiler free gameplay it looked to be so but even with that I was still into getting it. Now don't get me wrong. This pretty much is a walking sim, but that's not all that it is, the world and story building that has been done in this game is amazing, thought there are some issues with pacing at times with cutscenes and whatnot, it's still worth the payoff in the end in my opinion. Took me about 60 hours to beat the main story. I did do a fair bit of side mission and road building but this is still a very long game. 

As for the gameplay, there are unlocks riddled throughout the whole ""campaign"" that make you feel like your constantly progressing, though for mostly all of the upgrades you do have to put in work, if your smart with package delivery you can unlock them along the way.

MY ONLY ADVICE IF YOU ARE CONSIDERING GETTING THIS GAME,

If you have seen some spoiler free gameplay of the traversal and is looks interesting to you GET IT.

If you get the game and are struggling in the beginning, just know that there is a sizable learning curve to the mechanics of the game.

Please, please just make it thorough the first 7-10 hours of gameplay, around chapter 3 the game ""evolves"" and you start unlocking some very useful things that will assist you on your journey.

You guys obviously produced a marvelous game truly meant for todays generation of computing. I love the graphics and attention to detail. This game is going to be one of my favorite for sure. Although I'm just wondering, am I going to have buy a whole new mouse? Let me rephrase, one of the most important aspects of the game, is traveling. And while traveling you may want to mark your point. Well, I can't do this. As my mouse is not registering the keybind. Or the game isnt recognizing the mouse. So, not being able to correctly navigate in a game where thats half of the process of playing can be kind of difficult. And most may think, its not that big of deal, just change the keybind. Well, there is no keybind friends. If you need to navigate on the map somewhere, unfortunately you wont know the trail to take, just the general direction from switching into GPS mode. My mouse is corsair and this function has been compatible in many other games.

Im starting to hear ""Hey Sam"" even when im not playing because of how many times they would interrupt you while you play.

Played this on the PS4 and loved it. The PC version is even better. Wouldn't suggest a second playthrough though because everyone just loves to annoy the ever living crap out of you while making deliveries at the start (Which lasts for 6 hrs).

Literally probably my favorite game and first Kojima game. In a way the game literally makes no sense but then it does. Its a strange satisfying and its annoying to hear people say its a walking simulator when people play 1000s of hours of games with farming and building fatories as the main aspect lol. 

Pros:
-game looks and sounds beautiful
-feels like a movie and a game had a child
-Soo much OCD goodness in setting up routes and theres actually progression in it
-story is fucking sweet
-Norman

Cons:
-literally will waste hours moving supplies to build roads
-anything before chapter 3 is a waste of time in respects to making any additional deliveries
- deliveries are a little generic in terms of dialogue and you rarely see the npcs you deliver to outside of their holograms which makes it feel really fallout 76 at times.
-You wont see flat ground until maybe chapter 4 
-driving over terrain is a hot mess

41,DEATH STRANDING,73079157,english,"To development team of Kojima Production:

Thanks for your hard-working on Death Stranding and the PC edition; however, there is one problem I found is deserved to be fixed by you. I don't know whether you will read this comment, but I would like to spend time typing because I already played more than 50 hours and enjoy this game. Now, here is the problem:

The maximum amount of the chiral brandwidth is so low that it is not enough to build both the zipline and other structures. I tried to get more chiral brandwidth as much as I can by delivering the goods and getting the S rank grade so the star's rank will increase to the five stars. However, only 30-35k is not enough to build any structures when you finish creating the zipline net that connected all stations of the UCA. I found many users built other structures such as the generators, bridges, shelters, and so on, which helps me a lot to proceed with the story or finish the standard orders. However, It is clear that those people who help me a lot will not be ABLE to enjoy the fun and the convenience of using zipline across America. They help me and others, and I think they deserve to have that fun, and I, too, have the right to build the generator and other structures to help others and be able to across America by using the zipline at the same time.

I think you limited the brandwidth to 35k for maximum because you don't want the server to save too many structures, and it may crash the game because the system will share the arrangements made by others in each player's world. However, I think the key to solving this problem is to limit the number of structures that will be shared. Generally speaking, only 1-3 structures is okay to be shared because the players are so many, so you don't need to worry about whether the online buildings are too few.

And to increase the bandwidth's maximum, I think you can let players get bonus brandwidth by complete the standard orders after the player receives five stars in each cargo station. By completing the orders, the player will earn 10 to 100 bonus brandwidth to build more structures depends on the amount of the cargo and the difficulties of delivering. This will make players play longer and have more fun, and the rank of this game will increase too.

The lack of the amount of the brandwidth is a problem that already existed in the last year when the Death Stranding of the PlayStation edition released, at that time, the only way to build more zipline is to looking at other's zipline and try to make use of their zipline to save your own brandwidth, and give up to built any other structures to avoid ""wasting"" the brandwidth. I have already played the Death Stranding on PS4 and I finish the story and built my own network of the zipline. Not able to create the generators and the shelters is the thing makes me sad. I sweared that I will use cheat engine to achieve the dream of infinity brandwidth, but I think it is good to not use cheat engine but asking you to solved this problem. Anyway, we need more brandwidth, and we like Death Stranding.

Great story
Compelling characters 
Weapons are cool toward the end

---Negatives---
Game mechanics are flawed (Camera is a pain, the game pauses for 3-4 seconds EVERY SINGLE TIME a BT area pops up to make it MORE DRAMATIC)
Depending on the criteria, which I still do not know, you have to either hit ESC or click the Right Mouse button to skip a small cinematic which happens EVERY SINGLE TIME you pick up/deposit deliveries, take a shower, do a fragile jump, change something you're carrying, depositing building supplies to build ANYTHING. If I were to sit there and allow the cinematic to run, the 41 hours it took me to beat this game would easily be 55 - 60 hours I feel considering I built tons of roads, devices, depots, etc etc etc. 
Why is no one allowed to carry EXTRA AMMO? Why the hell do I have to go back to a supply depot to refill weapons? 
Why is the truck unlocked WAY into the game? Is it necessary to hobble the players and force them to steal mule trucks? You also cannot repair them which is great too. 

All in all, I liked the game but I was annoyed through most of it with hours upon hours of unnecessary cinematics, unskippable scenes and more.

[*]racing games: you drive around in circles
[*]survival games like minecraft: you mine resources to build tools to mine better resources to build better tools to ... (you get the idea)
[*]Jump ’n’ Runs: u jump over stuff so u dont fall into stuff[/list]

it's not so much about what you do but how you do it!

and how you do it is just fun. After a short period of familiarization, the controls are really good and are only a challenge at the beginning. Afterwards, a lot of tools, weapons, vehicles and other constructions come into play to compensate for the ever increasing difficulties. 

the landscapes are beautiful and the soundtrack atmospheric and hypnotic. this is the perfect game to escape everyday life and immerse yourself in a decelerated world full of miracles and mysteries for a few hours.

To call this game ONLY as a walking simulator would be a gross misjudgment of the title as a whole, and many who take this opinion have only dealt with the title superficially to their disadvantage. The beginning of Death Stranding can be tedious, but that was exactly the intention. Only through hardship does the triumph feel real. Only through hardship can we experience the transformation from a simple errand boy to a high-tech logist as a satisfactory climb!

Also if you enjoy helping random strangers out while having zero actual contact with them, this'll work for you too.

That said:

-The story isn't great, it's got a lot of plot holes and things that are just never explained even slightly; beyond the normal strangeness you would expect for a Kojima game. The actual performances by the actors are good, it's just the writing doesn't support them what so ever.

-Combat's not great and kinda feels like an after thought that they tacked on to try and break up the pacing a little bit. It's not that the controls are terrible or anything, it's more that there's very little reason to ever fight anyone aside from if a delivery requires you to. ( Maybe that's the point? I dunno. )

-If you do end up playing this, make sure you set the animation that plays when you enter a BT area to ""First Time Only"" otherwise it'll get annoying REALLY quickly. ( Also you can skip virtually all dialog and animations with either Tab or clicking through them. )

All in all, I think if you're the sort of person that is very completion oriented you'll definitely get a lot of play time out of this. Or if you're the sort of person that enjoys trying to optimize your quest routes, you'll probably enjoy it as well. For the average person, probably wait until this goes on sale for like $20-$30 bucks.

and will play it many times over. But.. can i recomend it for the price tag? No..
this game is very thought through.. nice caracters and quite a scary yet interesting story. 
beautiful graphics and quite cool mechanics.. but thats where it ends..
the gameplay is not fun at all after 10+ hours.. why?
well, you run from Point A to B... and there is bearly no danger, the Raiders/human enemies  as i call them. are always at the same spots.. shown at the map. you just walk round it instead of through.
th BTs are always scary and sometimes quite hard.. but i dont encunter then often.
The ground is plain flat... its a game about traversal... you need to go up a hill? well its already 4 different ladders and 4 ropes there from other people, at ALL TIMES... you dont need to bring youre own equipment, even then 9 out of 10 places can be walkable without putting out a single ladder/rope, and ropes only works if you want to climb down.. so dont expect to use it to get up. 

the terain is way to easy. i would say the starter area is way way harder, then the rest of the game.
 and when you carry stuff, it never takes you from 1 side of the map to the other, you always get a quest that brings you to the closest base of where you take the quest. so even though the terrain is very flat with some smal roks you just Run over with ease, you dont really have to walk that far. the only danger is that you run to much and stumble, easy to fix by holding both youre hands on the backpack that only drains a bit more of youre stamina.

it gets very repetive very fast. i played 30 hours and so far only unlocked a gun that shoots my poop (yea no joke, youre ammo is poop and pee). sometimes youre blood. 
and ive unlocked exo skeleton for youre legs..
so striving for these runs makes it feel very poinless and not rewarding at all.
 feels like if you play GTA and need to walk from 1 building to another.. thats how easy it is.
the world is also very empty. no ""wow"" experiences anywhere.. there is a huge waterfall in the walkthrough, but thats it nothing else but some rocks, gras, and snow. no forrests, or lakes etc.. exactly as bland missions/map as metal gear solid was.

82,DEATH STRANDING,73070254,english,"[h1]Most unique AAA-game I have played.[/h1]

Not too long time ago before Death Stranding PC release I finished Red Dead Redemption 2 and I found found hard to recommend that game to everyone. In Death Stranding's case it's even harder.

As you can see in the Steam Store page, the most popular user-defined tag for this game is ""Walking simulator"". But that's only a half-truth. Heck, I don't even play ""Walking simulator"" genre games (or the games that I have played don't feel like one). If you ask from me, the way I would describe DS would be with tags like ""Inventory management"" and ""connection/ connected genre"". Inventory management-tag is on 8th spot on user defined tags for DS. However, as the head of Kojima Productions Hideo Kojima himself has stated, Death Stranding is partly a whole new game genre calling it himself ""strand-genre"". 

So what you do in this genre? Long story short you don't see other players running in the map, BUT you and around 40 other players are connected together and things you build/ leave on to the overall map will appear on others map. If someone build a bridge or repaired part of the motorway it is done in your map too once you have connected that part of the area to your faction's network by bringing delivery packages in your backpack.
Yes, as you can see in the store page screenshots this game is 95% about delivering cargo from point A to point B. While on the paper that sounds extremely boring.
But Kojima Productions have tried to do many things in order to make the cargo delivery fun/ engaging-gameplay:
+ BT's behaviour is mysterious
+ System filled gameplay
There are many different gadgets, weapons and couple of vehicles each with own advantages and disadvantages. While playing the game you get small stat upgrades to your player character, 90% of ""getting good"" in this game comes from learning to understand game's mechanics and ability to adjust your gameplay style to required one.

+ Visual presentation
This game looks visually amazing, pretty sure you can see that from the Store page pictures yourself.

+ Music
Seriously, it feels like Low Roar-band had prepared it's whole life to collaborate with Hideo Kojima all the way from 2011.

+ Writing
Hideo Kojima's Metal Gear Solid-franchise has always been filled with interesting writing for plot and characters that are totally out of ordinary and despite Kojima leaving Konami and MGS-franchise behind DS is still well written and thoughts provoking. Especially world building-writing is extremely up-to-date in 2020 with global pandemic and politically divided USA.

+ Moving to different locations with cargo is not just pressing W-key
While I played DS the closest game that came into my memory was when I played Zelda: Breath On The Wild in Hard-mode. In Z:BOTW Hard-mode you are most likely going to be wrecked by enemies so sneaking past them by flanking from side climbing the mountain was solid strategy. In DS this same philosophy is good strategy too but instead of just moving your character and camera when needed you also need to take care of your balance with cargo and keep an eye out for BT-monsters, environmental dangers and items that rust in your backpack.

DS is not a game without problems, nothing too serious ones if you ask me but I recommend to acknowledge them before plausible purchase of the game:

- Mission variety is VERY small
Like I mentioned at the start of this review, it's 95% about cargo delivery. It's hard to say what else I might have wished but maybe an optional task of rescuing a person from danger could have welcome etc.

- Why credits roll twice in the last two hours of the game?
In other words once you have seen credits once in final moments of the game you still have at least 30 minutes story to see.

Death Stranding is a game that cannot be recommended to be everyone. Not because it's a hard or bad game if you ask me, but because the things you do in it will not ""click"" into many players.

The game runs wonderfully. I can have every setting maxed with discord running in the background, and it not just consistently but [i]constantly[/i] hits and even passes 60fps (RTX 2060 Super, mileage may vary). The game world is beautiful, and the art and design direction plays perfectly into the game's bizarre story.

The gameplay is surprisingly fun, I keep coming back to it even though it's mostly just walking. This game makes walking [i]enjoyable[/i]. There are many mechanics that go into it, such as balance, momentum, and the way the terrain affects your travel. Some guides say if you just always hold both balance buttons, you'll never have to deal with most of the traversal challenges. And while this is true, you shouldn't constantly do this. It defeats much of the purpose of the game's mechanics.

The music is rarely heard, but when you [i]do[/i] hear it, it invokes many emotions. The lyrics pace well with the environment you're traveling through at the time. Many complain that there's no music player in the overworld, and while that would perhaps be nice, I can certainly see why it's not a feature. The atmosphere benefits from both the presence and absence of music.

The enemies are perhaps my least favorite part of the game, though that's not to say I don't enjoy them. For the bandits, you can avoid the marked areas of their territory easily enough with the map. The BTs, however, have no territory markings, save for those that others put down. This makes any timefall that happens suspenseful, even when you aren't likely to have to start sneaking.

Finally, the online aspect of the game is one of its strongest parts. The way your structures help others as well as yourself helps foster the sense of connection that the game's themes revolve around, as do the player placed signs along the way. The game can and will still feel lonely, but you never feel like you're doing everything alone. The signs of other people working as you are towards a common goal are everywhere.

First off: I have 37 hours in the game so far, and I am far from even the end of the story.

This game has ""some grind"". I despise grinding, I always did. In Death Stranding I don't even feel it. What you do helps yourself, and helps other players as well! It actually feels worth grinding. The actual first game I ever enjoyed grinding in.

Combat: Not too much, most can be avoided, but if You are the type You can find a ton of it. And it's actually worth not skipping the fights, as they are your greatest source of resources, and you'll want a lot of those if you want to make your file easier.

Quality:
The actors performance is top notch.
There are a few soundtracks, but they rarely kick in.
Graphics/aesthetics wise the game is ""realistic""(?). The elements in the environments are well in unison, but are also distinct enough from each other so that they don't break immersion, while You can still find anything/everything easily.
World building is story wise is amazing. There is a lot of data (readable) scattered around, that you will gain just by playing, so if you care about that then worth reading.

Thank you developers.
Thanks you Kojima.

If I could describe the game in one word is ""[b]ATMOSPHERIC[/b]"".
The game concept is as simple as it looks, delivering from point A to B, but with a few complexities here and there like inventory management, taking items that will come useful on your way, sorting your cargo in specific ways (back, arms, hips). Planning your routes, delivering different cargo for different destinations on one go, stuff like that is what it makes it engaging and entertaining. The combat system is pretty simple as well, the game encourages not to kill, so most of it is incapacitating with melee and there are fun, hilarious, and creatives ways to do so, (if you've played MGS games before you'll know) although it is not that fully integrated to the core of the game, but it does a pretty great job. 

There are simple mechanics in the game that you start to appreciate a lot the further you go like the online asynchronous features, after almost dying, having a vehicle stop working or having most of your cargo get ruined from timefall (rain), etc., you could find such structure that could fix your said problem and it was all because of that person who made that structure and therefore helped you on your journey, that for me was the biggest feeling of gratitude that you wouldn't find elsewhere. 
The items that you get as you progress helps a LOT on your journey. Unlocking each reward item as you progress is a sigh of relief, a bit of hope to make you through the tough terrains, the BTs, MULEs, and weather, all of the danger, so you can make it to the west to complete your mission of reconnecting America while you build structures for others to use and also people who helps you, and that makes the game extremely ""[b]REWARDING[/b]"". 
So, you make all this journey for a reason which is the story.
The story can be described as ""[b]convoluted[/b]"", definitely. It is a Kojima game so it will be very convoluted like the MGS storyline. From the beginning to the end of the story I can easily say it is very complex, hard to follow, and with a few cringy dialogues but honestly they weren't that bad as people say, but they are definitely corny. MGS games had very few of those dialogues as well, but the [b]emotional and major plot point scenes[/b] were what it made those games special. And man... This one has MANY of those, great scenes and performances absolutely. Most of the big revealing moments story-wise are dumped almost at the end, most won't like that but I liked it the way, there were many cutscenes before and throughout the game that asked the questions so at the end everything would be answered. However, as you progress you would get documents that would answer some, and give you more info about the world and science behind everything which I liked a lot. 
There was a part on the snowy part of the game on par with the story that I thought it dragged a bit, it was three orders in a row, go here go there for a sense of progressing that was done poorly. But, I digress, I'm playing it again on PC because I think it deserves an other playthrough, it was a great original experience that most won't even have.

I played it once on the PS4 from start to finish and wanted to keep on playing, but I thought it was better to wait for the PC version to experience it on its max potential, so I'm playing it again right now. In conclusion, the [b]ridiculously good OST and songs from the bands[/b] were combined [b]perfectly[/b] with the beautiful scenery and all the things I mentioned above. The game is a big atmospheric trip with a strangely addictive gameplay loop that was executed nicely and very risky to do. From the moment you look at the main menu and start the game, and see the opening credits and prologue, you can sense the tone of the whole game. While it is not a perfect game and certainly not for everyone, but could be for you and you don't even know. The pros in this game excels the cons absolutely.

[list]
[*]Traversal feels great.  Watching gameplay I was worried it'd have the ""running up the side of a mountain in Skyrim and frantically trying to jump until I manage to get past this rock"" problem, but that hasn't been an issue.

[*]Movement overall feels great and is meaningfully affected by how much you're carrying and weight distribution.  The movements and animations generally have a certain fluidity to them that is easy to compare to MGSV animations.

[*]The game doesn't waste your time.  This is a huge one for me.  The animations aren't painfully slow & drawn out, transition cutscenes can be quickly skipped, setting up ladders and tethers for traversal is very quick and fluid - it all feels good and doesn't slow you down.  I especially like how, while you can micromanage your carried cargo to distribute the weight and make traversal easier, you can just as easily press a single button to auto-sort your cargo to distribute the weight.  Everything feels snappy and responsive and navigating menus doesn't make me want to pull my hair out.  Hell yeah!

[*]Holy shit these keybinds.  A lot of console-first games that get PC ports later on end up having [i]godawful[/i] keyboard controls that have you constantly repositioning on the keyboard.  This game does not have that problem at all.  It's hard to put into words, but it's basically the opposite experience of playing RDR2 with a keyboard.  It's all just really intuitive.

They were very necessary though... theatrically it summarizes who, when, why, where, and how questions that many of you are left wondering for those trapped in the mindset: ""it's a delivery simulator."" Those plot line questions have interesting explanations behind them... Kojima wastes no time narrating during these cinematics about the story-line world set in front of you. I thought Del Toro's appearance was comical but his character has been the most interesting one so far... but, hey, I am not going to reveal the answers revealed but let me tell you one thing here there is a deep and captivating story behind what you about to experience that isn't understood in the early game play/teaser footage... poor marketing but it's the truth. I want to mention that I feel the story as it has been laid out has been an original experience. I can't quite think of a game similar to this one.. .and wouldn't be surprised if they scripted a TV show for it. 

Mechanics: 
- They were more interesting than I had realized. I have to confess all the negative simulator comments almost discouraged me from playing... the early missions play very similar to what the haters describe but they serve as tutorials nothing more... but when you start to encounter heavy load missions, complex terrain, stamina management, weather systems, BT (the monsters), BB meter, and raiders... you realize the game isn't as simple as ""Hey, go to point A to B and drop off a box."" You have to plot, prepare, and make calculated decisions... Think of the delivery mechanic of the game as the game's movie motif"" it places you in the center of the story in the most interesting way possible. I found some of the most enjoyable scenes in the game for me was resting on a mountain top with loads of junk sitting on my back and the soundtrack playing in the background... really sets the mood and places you within the story like it should. The food/water system is really basic, but it exists, and it's there. 

Music/Visuals:
Absolutely great thus far ... I am not sure if the music sequences are played at random or in linear storytelling fashion but when you hear the music it really captivates you in the well designed topography. When I jumped over rocks, small water streams, hearing my footsteps against the ground, and my character suffering the pains of travel only to hear Low Roar - I'll Keep Coming play in the background and I was like blown away.. Strongly encourage you all reading the review to download the soundtrack... Gives me an Oblivion/Stranger things vibe at times... what a unique touch in my opinion. 

Community:
This is the most curious part of the game so far and I don't think I quite fully understand it but it really does have its moments. When you become involved in your missions and begin to ""feel"" the struggle and there's a community sign you run into giving you that stamina buff it's like the best godsend out there... or when you discover a left over ladder and/or bridge when you most need it.. because the game can sometimes be taxing and I can only imagine what is left to see further on... so discovering these left over structures encourages to push on with the delivery... You can build community markers/structures that other players not only benefit from but can ""like"" in the process and in doing so gives you buffs. It feels like a shared struggle experience although you never see them.. but if you get lonely just tap #5 all day.. 

Cons:
Yes they exist ...despite you playing an awesome 'moviegame' there are some cons worth mentioning... The menu system is long, and convoluted. Every mission requires you to sit through the score count. You can bypass this but after a few times it does become irritating. The vehicle mechanics don't feel smooth at all and I am really concerned how the bigger vehicles will feel. When you play without the vehicles you feel like your character belongs in the world. He is responsive to all the conditions around and reacts to your weight distribution. This touch is lost when you enter the vehicles.. I even wonder if they considered not adding vehicles at all at some point. They are clunky when they hit rocks, and terrible for coming down hill... but again I haven't tried anything outside the motorcycle. The map plotter is annoying to use and really needs a lot of work... unless I missed it being a noob I wish greater features could be added such as notes and better topography like features. What I mean by my last sentence is I wish I could see what the terrain ahead of me looks like a bit  better than the flat view so I plot better routes. And I do believe the return period should be longer than 2 hours for new players because the cut scenes will eat all the game time.. not a fair exchange. 

Is this game for you? 
- If you enjoy the MSG series you will find a lot you like here **creatively speaking**. It doesn't have that action pack punch that MSG serves but if you want to enter and be involved in a whole other world than this game can be a great turn of pace for you... 
- However... if the story, cinematics, atmosphere, and music etc ... isn't enough for you... you might be bored between delivery points.. but it's hard to even consider that but all gamers are different right? If you're a COD player this game might bore you to death for instance... but if you want to EXPERIENCE the world and be absorbed by it than this solemn game has a lot to offer you.

Is it worth $60?
MSG games were always worth their open price to me and I had no regrets... and I thoroughly enjoyed the game.. nothing wrong with waiting for a discount or steam sale... but I definitely feel I bought a complete product and I am satisfied with my purchase. 

to conclude ...

93,DEATH STRANDING,73001577,english,"The Earth is a solemn yet serene landscape. Time has beaten it's trees and structures to dust. Even so, the past just won't let go - just like the last scattered humans on Earth who press on against hope, in a world enshrouded by death. 

This is the world of death stranding, a game I've been curiously enthralled by despite all of my negative expectations. A walking sim, made by a game director I've never liked, set in a confusing world. Exciting, right? And yet I find myself totally engrossed in an atmospheric wonder, with surprisingly nuanced mechanics, and a desire to master the game's asynchronous multiplayer components.

I'm consistently surprised by the nuance of the game's mechanics. The game may be slow paced, but it does force you to constantly be making decisions. Just traversing the stoicly obliterated terrain requires calculation by the player. There's always too much cargo to carry, and useful tools will take up space. Plus more weight means slower and more difficult traversal, so it's always interesting deciding how to divy things up, looking at the map and wondering how many ladders you will need, if you will need hematic grenades, or if the terrain is too rough to max out your weight. It starts off very easy, but little things that seem irrelevant at the beginning will become more hazardous later as increased hazards and restrictions raise the stakes. And once you have an array of tools to pick from, choosing what you actually need becomes a more complex task. The game doesn't do a good job of explaining the mechanics. Almost every important bit of knowledge I have has come from a buried submenu called ""tips"" rather than exposed through a tutorial. I went in thinking this would be a game with no combat, and my attempts at stealth led me to be frustrated. But once I learned that you could fight the mules and BT's, the game became far more interesting. I've seen other reviews claim that vehicles make the game too easy. I think they must have not gotten very far, because enemy BT's annihilate vehicles and mules quickly begin to use their own vehicles. Much of the terrain is more difficult to traverse by vehicle so you'll often have to ditch the vehicles by the nearest road and finish your journey on foot. 

The game heavily pushes a singular theme in a way that connects everything. You may find it overly contrived, or you may find the themes of isolation and internet culture surprisingly pointed. For me, it mostly just builds a very consistent and compelling atmosphere. Not just in the atmosphere of trekking through whispering mountain passes and a brilliant soundtrack that constantly leaves you with somber undertones. Almost every aspect of the world is some form of allegory of the consequences of digital society. Kojima sometimes goes out of his way to turn simple things into complicated things just to make the analogies more on point. The mules are a perfect example. They aren't simple bandits, they are actually addicted to making deliveries, which is the true reason they want to steal your cargo. This makes no sense until you realize that it's an allegory for people living fake internet lives. While playing, you may be forced to ask yourself, does your interactions with your friends make you a Porter, or a mule? Are you connecting with your internet society, or are you isolating yourself? Is it possible to connect to people on the internet at all? It's all particularly relevant during the pandemic.

And to go along with this thematic bombardment is an asynchronous multiplayer system - basically once you ""connect"" a region to the network, you will start to see structures built by other players appear in that region, and structures you've built can appear in other player's games. Although you never actually see another player, they can influence your world, and you can influence theirs. They can leave behind helpful signs or bridges, and if you help other players they can give you likes (likes are essentially the XP progression of this game). The way the world is gradually populated by these things makes it feel a bit less desolate, and makes you feel like you're part of a community, but it's a distant type of community, where your only interactions are indirect and coincidental. It ties in really well with the core theme of the game and gives you an extra thing to strive for. It's hard to deny the feeling of accomplishment when something you leave behind generates a lot of likes, the game tracks all of this and you can go back into your logs and see which things you laid down helped the most people and see how many people you helped.

All those completely bonkers trailers (and supposedly disconnected from each other) that were launching before the game and presenting characters, are actually all part of the game and make sense in its story.
A story that I guess was written focusing on the characters first by the way it's presented. Some reviewers commented that it's a really weird way to present the story, but I did end up really liking it. The super strong and interesting characters pull their weight to help the flow of it all. 
It's not all perfect though. I really liked the point the story was making (hits even harder in the pandemics time) as it's a simple, but needed message for everyone. But I felt it way heavy handed for me. I don't usually like heavy handed stories as the subtext just turns into the superficial text with no meaning behind it to leave something to think about.

The gameplay, yes in a really bad reductive way can be described as a walking simulator. but it really is much more complex and interesting than that. It's a game that can make the prospect of a walk through a mountain super stressful.

P.S. Don't think too much about the discourse around the game itself. I myself have seen mostly negative reviews before playing this game and I was really positively surprised to find out I enjoyed this game as much as I did. And I don't like walking simulators nor grindy errand boy type of games. This game is way different than what I believed it to be. It's a journey.

3,DEATH STRANDING,73026526,english,"This game isn't for everyone. If you're looking for a game where it has lots of action, you're some kind of super hero that can tank everything and the story handed to with a book Stories for Dummies, then this isn't for you.

If you're looking for a game that has a very rich story which constant twists and turns and having to connect dots to figure things out and a bit slow paced gameplay, this game is for you. It's made by Hideo Kojima after all.

The game starts off slow, but not annoyingly slow. If you've played Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain, it's almost identical to that (but actually finished and not rushed *cough cough Konami*). Instead of ""missions"" (Like mission 1,2,3 etc) you have ""deliveries"" (Delivery 1,2,3, etc), after doing some of the main ""missions"" (deliveries) some of the story unfolds. And after a while the [main story] deliveries are story related themselves. 

You might become annoyed at first at the lack of story telling, but once you just start to say to yourself ""When is the story going to play out more?"" it does just that. It drags you back in. The story gradually picks up, pieces start to connect, then twists and turns happen making even more sense that your current theory you thought you had right. The story plays out beautifully. 

The gameplay itself involves, as you most likely know, a lot of walking. There's very few times you're forced into combat, but the game does a good job of hinting towards it to prepare yourself. Any other encounter you can sneak by, or just run if you must. The combat is decent enough, plays just like MGS:V for the most part.

A big part of the gameplay is movement. It's annoyingly realistic. Land on some mud wrong, your foot is slipping you have to catch yourself. Jumping on rocks? Rock has a good chance of crumbling depending on the type of rock, making you lose your balance. Running in the mud during rain? You have a good chance of some foot slippage. Overall, when moving, move as you would in real life, or you will slip and even topple over a lot. There is equipment to help with that however.

Death Stranding is a game that, at launch, I thought I would hate. It's my first game from acclaimed developer, Hideo Kojima, so I didn't have any of the baked-in enthusiasm that (probably) most people had. I always thought it looked interesting, but I was never truly [i] sold [/i].

From the very first trailer that I saw, I thought it may be a cool, trippy, action game that I could pick up at some point. As I saw more trailers, my anticipation grew more and more. That is, until I learned what the core gameplay loop would be. 

[b] delivering packages [/b]

A walking simulator?!?! Or at least, that's what all of the early previews and reviews led me to believe. So... I passed. I didn't buy the game on PS4 when it launched, because all of what I had heard about the game killed any ounce of hype I had (that's on me). What i did buy, on the other hand, is the idea that the game was an over-hyped, 'arsty fartsy' flop. That notion couldn't be more wrong. 

Death Stranding is the second game in two months that taught me that I [b] need [/b] to experience a game for myself. See, the first game that did this to me, was [i] The Last of Us Part II [/i]. Now while this may take away any credibility i may have with some people, I love that game. Like, a lot. But it wasn't always that way. I expected to hate that game, but that was based on what i heard about it leading up to release. [b] Sound familiar? [/b]

Let me get some basics out of the way.

The music in this game is phenomenal. Both the original soundtrack and the music made by various artists for the game are breathtaking and beautiful. Fits the world so well. The lore and world building is out of this world good. The gameplay, for me, ranged from calming exploration of the gorgeous open world while delivering packages, to edge of my seat intensity when BTs showed up. To my surprise, I didn't get bored at all in my 37 hours it took me to beat it. The story is so original and unseen in games that I've personally played. Characters are well fleshed-out with stellar acting across the board. Character models are also excellent with a few npcs being obvious exceptions. 

Now, for the highly opinionated part.

Death Stranding is, without a doubt, one of the most impactful, moving, intelligent, and dare i say, fun games I've played in recent memory. 

It's a game that so clearly had a vision, and did not compromise on that vision. A game that has the fingerprints of devs who loved what they were working on all over it. Hideo Kojima knew exactly what kind of story he wanted to tell, so he did it, without watering it down or making it 'easily accessible'. (Again, I've never played a Kojima game before this so I had no allegiance to him) Sure, the story can be jarring and [i] confusing as hell [/i] at some parts, but that's also what I love about it. This game doesn't hold your hand. It doesn't care if you want more of the same, It's too busy committing to being what it is.

Now, I won't dive into the nitty gritty of mechanics and story beats etc. But what I will say is that I love this game. Not only because i genuinely enjoy playing and experiencing it, but because it's the kind of game I want to see more of. [b] Games that aren't afraid to be what they are. [/b] Games that might be a commercial flop (not sure if this was). Games that may divide a fanbase. Games that get poorly reviewed because people don't like it, not because it was a bad game. I'm fine with these things, as long as one thing can be said about the game. It didn't compromise. Death Stranding, I feel, did not compromise.

[b] Death Stranding is original, fresh, and my kind of game. [/b]",1595279289,1595279289,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,42,6,2264,0,2256,1596054731,,
39,DEATH STRANDING,73019478,english,"Apart from a terrible story and far too many cut scenes, it is a very awesome game. LIKE!

It offers an absolutely unique Gameplay idea.
Running, driving, ""flying"", building helpful devices, there are many ways to deliver a package - through a storm - climbing over snowy mountain slopes, with your own ladders and ropes. 
Sneaking, fighting, shooting through enemy areas, trying to steal theire stolen Goods - always keeping an eye on the good condition of the delivery and your own equipment.
Add to that breathtaking graphics, a fitting soundtrack, great atmosphere and! social interaction - the ladder of another player, exactly in the right place on a steep slope, without having your own - just feels so cool - to find someone else's vehicle in the middle of nowhere after your own runs out of juice - great ! 
Things like this (and others) made me enjoy the game, enough that I can easily see over the few minor annoying things like - endless cut scenes everywhere, unnecessary and repetitive info popups and questionable product placement.

The only thing I really find a pity about this game is the storyline. I like the basic idea, reuniting the country and overcoming the stranded death, i think it fits (at least the reunification thing) - the intro made me buy the game -  but from there it somehow goes downhill for me.

Probably it's just not my cup of tea, and maybe i am not getting what Mr. Kojima tryes to deliver here... i know the story pleases others... but for me this element of the game fails on most of the line.
There is some really cool stuff going on , Cliff - LIKE!, the concept of stranded death itself , the idea having an BB - creepy, but the bottom line is that I find the way the story is transported far too often, annoying, awkward or boring.
For me, it somehow ruins the good atmosphere that the game creates so easily. i.a. also through a good soundtrack.
If the developers had invested this time in even more gameplay elements, for me it wouldn't be a shame either ;)

Should that put you off? I´d say No. From my point of view, experiencing the gameplay mechanics, the great atmosphere and the rewarding delivery system more than makes up for it. Also the feeling of a walking simulator never really occurred to me in 70 hours of play;)

I have not played into the game too long, but I am enthralled already by the immersion of the basic gameplay. The goal is simple: deliver packages. Your journeys at first are long and hard fought: traversing rough terrain and windy mountain alleys only to find yourself surrounded by the terrifying and ever present mysterious and mostly invisible enemies, the BTs. Soon enough, your arsenal of methods with which to carry your cartoonishly large cargo grows, and so does the variety of routes to take. There has already been one part of the game in which I decided to take a plethora of ladder and rope out with me, to create a mountain pathway in order to avoid a daunting forest haunted with searching BTs. 

This brings me to my next point: the pathways you create using your tools become available to players in their worlds. Much like Dark Souls, you can leave signs all over the place, attempting to tell another player during their playthrough to take an easier route that you recommend. As mentioned, your tools that you use become available to other players- and they are able to use the same rope you used to scale down a steep cliff face, for example. This gives you the ability to form paths for other players that in thoughtfulness: create an easier way to get to their destinations in order to deliver important goods and continue on perhaps unscathed. In return for your deliveries and your shared tools, you get ""Likes"" from both NPCs and other players alike this drives you further to help others through these methods: including taking cargo deposited by other players to the destinations which they, for various reasons, could not reach. For example, maybe a player found themselves in trouble with the terrorist thieves in the game, the MULEs, and had to drop some heavier pieces of cargo into a mail station for safe keeping.. that heavy cargo can show up in your own shared mailbox for you to either finish the job, or hand it off to another player using the same method.

This game is all about helping others and establishing connections with other characters in the game, and other players too. 

I can tell a short tale about what had happened to me, for example. I found a bike at an outpost that was left there by another player, and it happened to spawn in my world. After building a generator, I could charge the bike's battery and travel around the immediate vicinity- picking up dropped and lost pieces of cargo. Some of the cargo was meant for my own final drop off location: the first city in the game. I traveled a couple of miles up to a large mountain, bidding the precious bike my inevitable farewell as I began to scale the mountain side with my massive cargo strapped to my back and my limbs. I threw down climbing rope periodically in order to make the journey easier on other players making the same trek that i had been, and finally, upon descending the other side of the mountain (which was easier), I came upon an area soaking in scary BT activity. My little BT detector had awoken and began to flash in the direction of the closest terrifying and invisible enemy. I used a ladder to get myself a bit higher up in order to skirt around the hotbed, and escaped eventually. I was able to get the cargo delivered, and get a ton of likes for the routes I had made in harder to reach places (albeit safer due to the lack of enemies there). It seems like he most challenging climbs are the safest!

Death Stranding is an odd game, but for those who love a good story and like to get immersed, I believe it will sate an appetite that you have no clue that you had. 

The soundtrack is top notch and the mechanics for showing off music in order to break the quiet serenity of travelling in the game are unique and work well. 

The story is confusing and vague, but very very well done and addicting to get into.

I would like to mention that the sheer amount of suspense/horror that is built in the opening 30 minutes is second to none from recent memory.

83,DEATH STRANDING,72708010,english,"Seven hours in and this is already one of the most memorable games I've ever played. Very impressive work.

EDIT: I figured I would give a longer review for Death Stranding since I had been deeply anticipating it ever since the first trailer and then waited half a year after it finally released just for it to come to PC. Even though I have no experience with Hideo Kojima’s games, I knew from the first trailer that this was going to be a very special game and immediately realized the genius of Kojima, so I unashamedly jumped aboard the hype train.

To start off I would say that the gameplay is not for everyone (Some understandably call it a delivery simulator) but what the game lacks in gameplay for some people, it completely makes up for in story. The story is one of the most intriguing and memorable stories I've ever explored and it’s freshness and originality in approaching contemporary and future dilemmas of the human race was very pleasing. I will say I personally enjoyed the gameplay itself, but like I said, I know for sure it won’t please everyone. The gameplay is definitely unique and kept me very interested and immersed in it’s relation and integration with story development, but after finishing the game, I don’t have much interest in continuing the gameplay in free roam without a story to connect to it, so there’s that. Ultimately, the gameplay was enjoyable for me not in the traditional sense, but mainly in a kind of religious and philosophical sense of things like isolation and bearing the burden of the cargo through adversity, and how these concepts relate to the game’s storyline as well as the real life takeaway Kojima wanted for us in the contemporary world. The highly detailed environment and the occasional spontaneous song that pops up when wandering did an amazing job at facilitating the cinematic (And for me, religious/philosophical) immersion of the gameplay itself.

A couple critiques of the gameplay is that the main boss fights as well as the mini boss fights were very underwhelming for me, and even though I played the game on hard, it still wasn’t difficult. The bosses were very intimidating in form but in mechanics were about as threatening as their plastic toy replicas on the shelf in the safe rooms. The BT mini bosses can be run away from without even leaving a scratch on you, this made it hard to take the BT’s seriously and were more so just annoying.

My main critique for the story is that I feel like it happened too fast, like maybe this storyline should have been spread out over a trilogy with many more characters. I just feel like there could've been so much more depth explored in the characters and the lore behind the ""Death Stranding"", but this is only a minor critique and should be considered more of a compliment to the intense impact that the story and characters had on me. Also, the mid game storyline (After you reach Lake Knot City) was a little stale for me, but really picked up again after I got to Heartman’s chapter.

Overall, as expected from the first time I saw the initial trailers, Death Stranding was an incredible experience that I really loved and it without a doubt takes a spot in my top 5 most memorable games ever played.

Keep on keeping on.",1594779063,1595214186,TRUE,3,0,0.527027071,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,129,5,3133,0,418,1595202108,,
84,DEATH STRANDING,72980627,english,"I just wrapped up the last 2 boss-fights of Death stranding, and the ending as well, and my mind is just.. racing for a better word, replaying it again and again in my mind as I try to piece it together with the rest of the experiences I've had since-- July 14th, and it just.. blows my mind.. I'm just.. so much aware of things, like how politics had devolved(from its original intent) to such small things as physical contact have become less of a part in my life, how few ""knots"" I truly have in my life.. I'm actually considering moving back to my parents place and going back to school.
There's just, so many emotions to unravel from playing this game to its finish, I won't say its tear-jerking, but its just, so eye opening, things you took for granted because you were so focused on yourself, your situation, your advancements in the physical world, there's so much emotional stuff that is underdeveloped.
People keep saying that Kojima is a Meme Tier God, and he's only famous because he's connected to the Metal Gear Series, but honestly.. Deaths Stranding is just.. SO good.. both from a gameplay perspective and from the emotional sensations it provides.

But yeah, emotional rant and fanboying aside, the game has Cons and Pros
[b]Cons:[/b] 
[u]Tedious,[/u] this game will drag on if you want to get all the fun trinkets to play with, earning 4 stars with all the contacts the game offers, can take you well over 40-50 hours if you're doing it inefficiently like I was, and I was still missing 1/4th of the level 2-3 stuff that got offered to me.
[U]Scattered: [/u] the game's content is divided into 3 zones, so to speak, the starting area, leading up to south port knot, south of the mountain range, and north of the mountain range (There's also the end game area, but its kinda small so counts more as its own separate dungeon) and you'll spot a familiar pattern in the starting zone that teach you ""Oh so there's packages to be delivered to people near them as well as to other place"" and believing that to be the normal case I proceeded on my merry way, but OH BOY I was wrong. once you get to the Northern Mountain range you can find delivery items from one end of the mountain range to the other, and that is NOT a fun trip, so consider wisely if those 120 Likes from delivering it 10km is worth it
[u]Weird:[/u] Kojima has a weird sense of both storytelling and settings, so expect to be surprised or challenged in your average day to day believes, but in Death's Stranding, the world has change as has their understanding of norms, expect close ups and weird gestures everywhere, also there's way too much Naked Norman Reedus for my liking, but hey, someone is bound to like it.

[b]Pros:[/b] 
[u]Great content:[/u] if you like playing the mail-man this game is just perfect for you, there's plenty of logitical challenges to overcome such as managing your weight, energy, path taken, obstacles to overcome (human and natural) the gunplay feels a bit underwhelming but consider that you're mostly going to be sneaking around to try and deliver packages you can understand why there's little focus on things like Scopes, weapon utility and such, (Ammo not counting) each weapon has a use and that's about it, (My favorite part is using the Sticky Gun on a piece of cargo behind humanoid enemies to knock them out)
[u]A Kojima Experience:[/u] anyone familiar with the latter parts of the Metal Gear Series will instantly find themselves in the bizarre world of Kojima and will most likely appriciate it a bit more because of so, I can't wait for the next Kojima title to be announced.",1595213964,1595213964,TRUE,2,0,0.541984737,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,519,13,3107,0,3107,1595206274,,

Simple but fresh mechanics turn inventory management and fetch quests into drawn out minigams that are surprisingly entertaining even 60 hours in. Excellently cast and acted by parties involved. Killer soundtrack. Directing on par with the best Metal Gear games regarding pacing, cinematography, plot delivery, etc. Futhermore this game fixes many of the issues from PS4, such as unskippable cutscenes that have been repeated.

The game stumbles a little at the climax (narrative and plot wise) and is definitely the weakest part of the game. There's also some clunky UI issues. These complaints are relatively minor in the grand scheme.

With that said, not everyone will like this game. It is not action driven. The game is surreal and contemplative with vast amounts of time with seemingly nothing happening, giving you time to ruminate on the themes of the game. The vast majority of your time is spent doing mundane tasks that you may find interesting if you can appreciate similar tasks in real life, such as being able to appreciate long walks while daydreaming and thinking about nothing. Or if you hike/climb and see every single move forward as monumental progress; repeatedly putting one foot in front of the other.

I love Death Stranding. It's a hard game to describe to folks who aren't already invested in Kojima's brilliant madness, so I find it easier to tell people what it isn't. Death Stranding is not an action game, not a stealth game, not an open world game, not a shooter, and not a walking simulator.

In Death Stranding the enemy is the terrain. Your weapons are boots, ladders, ropes, and powered exoskeletons. The challenge comes from choosing the right tools and route to get the job done. Executing your plan is mostly a relaxing experience, spiced up by encounters with the MULEs and BTs. It's a slow-paced experience, and if that isn't your thing, you better give Death Stranding a pass.

14,DEATH STRANDING,72976794,english,"What this game is: 
A deep story telling story by a Japanese creator who clearly created a deep, scary, uncertain story you must uncover, both about the far past, and uncertain future.  Some aspects like final fantasy, other ways totally original.

What this game is not: 
A shooter scifi adventure.  A typical adventure game or RPG.  A simple story you get right away.

The start of the game:
May seem slow at first. Basically you are dropping off items to places. The first map area will have 5 main locations that unlock as you connect them to the network. 

Take some time to do the main story missions as well as the secondary back and forth ones. This gets you up in connection and levels. But you don't have to spend to much time doing everyone, as they will repeat on secondary.  I spent time to over level 20 and released I needed to stop and go to the port ship to go to the new area (you cant take any delivery items with you, it is a new start region. You can take other peopes deposited items return them to base. DOnt go crazy putting out stations, once you move on to chapter 3, you wont use them, until a later return. 

Eventually at the start you start usign your blood to fight BT's in your way.

Basically anytime you take a new delivery of any type from a terminal, the BT areas respawn and will be there again.  When close on your bike , and BB goes crazy get off the bike. Crouch, stop moving let it show you them, then use the hema grenade to kill them and break strands. Then ride through. PS those enemies in camps are easy to pummle with fists, dont even bother thinking they are tough. 

(FOR THE BIKE you make a charger near the West distribution bike to charge and get it. you also put it on the circle ramp when you go to rest so it repairs)

The game gets more exciting as you progress.

25,DEATH STRANDING,72975372,english,"Early into the game review. 

I love the ambition of this game.  The meta cooperation with other players, sheer beauty of the game and the acting are great.  However, it immediately becomes a sneak crawler.  

First there is almost an hour of cinematics with minor tutorial play mixed in before you really get into the game.  Yeah, you can skip it, but that defeats the purpose.  I can see it being worth it until, when the game starts to take off, it bogs down quick.

Most of the early quests have you going from outpost to outpost.  Predictably the BTs are in between and you will have to sneak by them.  If you mess up, you go through a long ordeal of sluggish muck crawling away from a Gaian-esque spirit porpoise channeling its inner Cthulhu.  Then once you get away, you get to run back and grab any gear you drop, fix it and begin again.  It's a huge time sink through the BT zones and it's not much fun to do over and over. 

So far, and yes I have not gone that far into the game, the BT zones are unavoidable.  So between the long trips, trying to not fall over, avoiding BTs, endlessly repairing gear, and trying to soothe a crying Kuato stuck to your chest, the game really becomes quickly repetitive and tedious. 

A reverse trike shows up soon enough, but it's all but worthless as most routes you need to go inevitably have unavoidable BT zones and/or horrendous to impassible terrain.  

I am going to give it a college try, but so far, I give it a thumbs up for creativity, but a thumbs down for lack of truly engaging gameplay. 

I am man enough to admit that I may have not gotten the gist of the game yet or misunderstood the target audience of the game, so maybe my view will change with additional playing.

Two helpful tips I found:  You cannot use the device manager to update your graphics card, you must DL geforce and update your Nvidia card to use the Decima engine.  Then I would recommend turning on FXAA and enhancing the anti-aliasing x8.

Two: I hated the Metal gear games.  For this game, get through the first two hours, smoke a bowl and buckle up.  The game requires a bit of investment and uses time as a mechanic to either slow you down (not resting at every distribution center) or generate a sense of accomplishment.

The game is an extremely unique experience with a okay music (nothing I'd seek out on my own) that fits the moments and the attention to detail (foley, physics, easter eggs) really does provide a cool enviornment to game in.

38,DEATH STRANDING,72974333,english,"[h1]NOT the uber-artsy, unapproachable high concept game you think it is- Just one of the good ones[/h1]

Okay, first, to address the burning question: [b]Is this game a walking simulator?[/b]

NOT by the typical use of the word players use to define games. I'm not the biggest fan of [i]those[/i] walking simulators [i](not because I think they're an inherently bad genre, I can enjoy a good one- it's because The Chinese Room indirectly damaged a lot of them in design inspiration IMO)[/i] as they usually are, but Death Stranding is a [b]literal[/b] walking simulator, as I'm sure you've heard; It's a game about getting from A to B, usually with craptons of cargo on your back.


[b]I think a lot of gamers[/b] [i](and, to be frank, game designers)[/i] [b]have been weighed down with the dogma that ""Travel is boring"" for years now.[/b] It's astonishing that we have an entire genre (platformers) and a subgenre (open-world games) both of which are massively popular for their style of movement and freedom of movement respectively, and yet the idea that Skyrim's [i]""click on location you've visited and PREPARE TO LOAD""[/i] system being the pinnacle of travel in videogames is still held as true by a surprising number of people.


This is despite games like Dying Light, Breath of the Wild, and yes, Death Stranding proving that you can make travel in games more complicated than just holding forward, implement such ideas into a variety of genres, and make such ""skip travel"" systems much less important and in some cases almost entirely redundant. We figured out how to make ""How do I get from here, to here"" interesting in 1982's Donkey Kong, so let's stop pretending other games that are also about that are inherently bad ideas.



There's also the argument that this game is ""work"". It doesn't take much longer to beat than the average AAA game and it [i]certainly[/i] isn't grindy in the slightest with resources being plentiful and no time when the game mandates you do sidequests before you can advance the story, but sure, package delivery sounds mundane. It also ISN'T the kind of game designed to get your blood pumping very often.

However, Death Stranding absolutely succeeds at putting players into a [b]flow state.[/b] That's often referred to in layman's terms as ""The Zone"", and everyone's experienced it- When you're doing something and you stop actively thinking about it, but you're still performing that task really well? Pretty much every good game ever made is designed to put you into one, and it's why people have played Euro Truck Simulator for hours upon hours. It's why a game that isn't explicitly ""fun"" can still FEEL like it's hitting the same nerves you associate with ""fun"", which is usually a confusing experience for [strike]practically all game journalists[/strike] laymen who don't understand why.



And Death Stranding, despite the unusual formula, hits all of the notes I wanted. It has low tension bits where you can just take in the atmosphere, it has high tension bits where everything feels like it's going wrong at once, but most points are inbetween, where I can relax, but still need to keep my eyes on the road- And it's a damn good feeling when a game nails that, whether it be juggling ammo capacities in a shooter, forming a plan in a stealth game, or moving along in Death Stranding with my cargo. [b]My point is Death Stranding is not an anomaly or even THAT experimental, it fundamentally follows the same design principles all decent games do, and IMO it follows them well.[/b]


How? Well, cargo has conditions you need to bear in mind (eg. ""don't submerge in water"", ""fragile"" ""only carry by hand""), you have different vehicles to potentially transport it, different equipment to deal with obstacles along the way, different weapons to deal with different enemies along the way, having to determine what route out of several options to take in the first place, ecetera.

All this stuff is how the game creates its fun, as just walking to your location is not going to cut it after a point, and you're going to have to start driving like a speed demon, or beating the crap out of terrorists with your bare hands, or going guns blazing against a tentacle monster, or quietly stealthing through a snowfield holding your breath to hide from invisible threats, if you want your cargo to get delivered safely. I dare say, it's pretty fun.




Whew, okay, that's done. Aside from that, I think I'll highlight some of the things the game does WRONG, so those who won't enjoy it can find something else to pick up.

[h1]Downsides to consider[/h1]

Firstly, [b]the game has a slow start.[/b] Kojima loves his cutscenes, but it's also a bit more than that- The game gives you new equipment for every new location you visit, which is fine, but that means it takes several hours for the game to really get going, because a HUGE part of the aforementioned flow state I mentioned is having [i]choice[/i] in your approach to situations, which you don't really get enough of in the first zone of the game. Including cutscenes, it will probably take ~4-5 hours to get out of that phase, though it seems like for those who are especially slow-going it can take up to 10.



Second, [b]the game's story IS clunky, mostly early on.[/b] If I had to sum up the problem as quickly as possible, aside from usual ""take it or leave it"" storytelling tropes in Japanese media (lots of exposition, explaining the same concepts over and over, loads of sad backstories in flashback), [b]most times, characters are talking TO you, not WITH you.[/b] One of the most blatant examples of this is after you get the Weather Station online, when one character calls you up to tell you that ""The weather report could be handy for plotting routes"", and then IMMEDIATELY afterwards another guy calls you up to tell you that weather report could be handy for plotting routes. Even a saint's going to be skipping dialogue [i]that[/i] repetitive.


The story is ultimately good, and it IMO wraps up fantastically at the ending, but like the first point, you need to be willing to see it through. And, yes, Tommie Earl Jenkins does play a character named [i]Die-Hardman[/i], look, the sooner you make peace with that, the better.



Third, [b]if you're the kind of player who hates things like sorting through menus, making plans, or thinking about your inventory and what to bring or discard, this also probably isn't for you.[/b] [i]Death Stranding's focus isn't on moment-to-moment gameplay, it's on the decisions that lead to moment-to-moment problems[/i] , so if your reaction to running out of boot durability in the wilderness with no replacements handy isn't [i]""Oh, my mistakes have lead to an issue I'm going to have to adapt to, lemme think about how to handle this""[/i] and is more like [i]""What, my boots broke?! This is bullshit""[/i] that's also probably a count against you being likely to enjoy this game.


Performance/stability wise, it was okay. I encountered some mild stuttering (mostly in the intro cutscene and a couple of times for a few seconds throughout the rest of my playthrough) but the gameplay proper was usually buttery smooth (my rig's above average, your mileage may vary). The game itself looks gorgeous, obviously. I did encounter a select few nasty bugs, with one cutscene starting with the audio and visuals out of sync, and donating to Share Lockers sometimes causing the game to softlock, but everything else has been extremely stable. A mostly good port with some minor blemishes.



If this game's concept or weird presentation (or both) interests you and the stuff mentioned above doesn't sound like too much of a turnoff, this is a good one to invest your time into and worthy of the pricetag.",1595202019,1595202163,TRUE,1,0,0.523809552,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,258,88,3920,0,3138,1595289152,,

Main story is the best story I've ever experienced, I think everyone should experience that. Characters are really good designed you can build a bond (or maybe actually ""a strand"" ? :)) with them, get close to them. Soundtrack is well chosen, fills the game well. Optimization is kinda nice - my specs: ryzen 7 2700 + gtx 970 - and I got it worked on the highest graphic settings in 1080p in 40-80fps.
BUT I wouldn't recommend this game to others right now, in this state. Game has got a lot of bugs and shortcomings. Riding a motorcycle is completly f*cking broken, hitting small rock will immediately stop your vehicle, but around 5-10 seconds later after just holding the gas pedal your motorbike will go off at the speed of light.

Initially Death Stranding was published on Playstation 4, so most of the users have played it on controller. I don't know what went wrong, but using a controller on PC is broken aswell. Sometimes things are happens automatically (eg. after throwing one granade, Sam have thrown automatically two more after the first ¿?) Sometimes the game does not respond to buttos being pressed (eg. sprinting). And of course sometimes buttons respond with delay. (eg. I'm trying to sprint - game doesn't respond, so I'm pressing the analog once more and Sam starts sprinting and stops immediately ¿?). And last but not least you can NOT turn down the music volume, so if you have hearing damage you'll be forced to turn down the volume of all sounds (especially dialogues which are sometimes hard to hear). Well actually you won't be forced to do that - you can damage your already damaged hearing even more :)",1594861540,1595201960,FALSE,9,1,0.619057357,1,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,246,17,4514,152,2686,1601671791,,

WHAT DOES DEATH STRANDING FEEL LIKE TO PLAY?
If you ever played an RPG & you carry to much stuff/weight.  And you can barely walk.  This is Death Stranding.  In the beginning of the game it's not like this but an hour in. Watch out it's time for slow mo walking.  And what makes it worse is you walk for 15 minutes toward you destination just to hit an invisible wall.  So now you follow this invisible wall.  But it'll go right into the ocean.  So you turn around go another 15 to 20 minutes in another direction.  And what this another invisible wall.  This is the whole game of Death Stranding.  Keep following invisible walls round & round until you find that one little opening. No enemies or combat.  Just looking for the opening in a invisible wall.  Sounds like fun huh?  The only good thing about this game is the story.  The reason your here is because of that the story & actors. 
 Which is just the cut scenes.  Which I could just watch on Youtube.  The gameplay couldn't be anymore boring.  Like the game description says it's a walking simulation.  But what they don't tell you is how slow you'll be walking.  On the trailer they show you riding this awesome motorcycle.  But that's just the first minute of the game.  And that's it.

43,DEATH STRANDING,72974032,english,"Put in easily 100+ hours on the PS4, re-bought on PC to get a taste of that sweet 60+ FPS.  It's a beautiful game that is hindered by it's game mechanics that some will find boring or to slow.  This is why a disclaimer is a must for those not knowing what to expect.  It's a methodical, slow burning, highly satisfying, journey that takes you on a wild ride with Kojima at the helm throwing you nothing but more questions than answers.  A lot of those questions can be answered through journal entries and emails as well as some plot hints given throughout the story progression, you just need to pay attention and my goodness, is it worth it.  In the end it all comes together for the most part, if at least somewhat depending on your interpretation of everything that was given to you along the way.  

Aside from story, the gameplay itself is a tad bit frustrating in certain situations.  Unable to fully brake on the bike which ends up sliding past your intended stopping point for no reason, Sam getting confused and walking one way when your pointing the stick in the other direction.  Mainly some vehicle mishaps but other than that, the game plays like a dream.  The progression and equipment upgrades found through the world are fantastic.  Each piece of new equipment has it's uses for each type of terrain you come across, new structures to build with ziplines and shelters from the timefall are just a few.   If you want a relaxing break from the world that is now I suggest you take a dip into the fantasy that is Kojimas Death Stranding.  You will find no high intensity action sequences in this game.  This is ment to engage the gamer in a sense of longing for a world that has come and gone, leaving them with the lonely world and her sometimes harsh environments and traversing them no matter the challenge.  Coming out on top with said deliveries in tact is a reward of its own volition.  This is a game for a select few, do your research and know what you're getting into before diving into this game.  It is an experience more so than anything.  The soundtrack by itself is almost worth the money, fits every occasion and really brings some weight or lightheartedness depending on the situation.

So why did I change my mind about this game? Well it seems during the course of my play that the online environment has stabilized somewhat, there are still some issues, occasional crashes and such, but they're much rarer than when I first reviewed the game. I'm still annoyed by it, as I know that everytime I go to use one of the social features I risk crashing my game, but it's better than it was before. So now I can actually talk positively about the gameplay instead.

It's a walking simulator, and I mean that in the best way. If the idea of doing fetch quest after fetch quest interrupted by some occasional (And very easy) action sequences immediately turns you off then don't bother buying this game. If you're looking for something different, something relaxing, then maybe this game is right for you. The game has a way of making you feel like you're really making progress. It does what all those indie job simulator type games tried and failed to do. I like the game, and if you're looking to move away from the AAA gaming paradigm then this game is definitely worth a look.

{ORIGINAL REVIEW}

I'd really love to give this game a good review but I just can't. What's the point of making a game about connecting people, when half the time using any of the online features such as donating equipment or entrusting cargo causes the game to crash?
I know people will tell me to wait for a patch, but consider that this game was already delayed, so it's not like it was rushed out and should need a day 1 patch. There is zero excuse.

I highly recommend it to anyone who is open to Kojima's weird style and surprisingly engaging delivery gameplay.

Edit after beating: I honestly didn't expect the storytelling to be so fully realized or well done. It's absolutely crazy but by the end, if you're paying attention, all the weird stuff actually makes sense in one way or another. The key thing though is that the game really pushes its narrative through the gameplay in super powerful ways that I didn't know it would. I expected the story to mostly be done through cinematics, but was surprised that the most important part of the story in the end actually was what you built through the game along with the others playing and how you feel traversing it through the end moments. And in particular when you realize how much you have to lean on other player's contributions. It makes the cinematics super powerful because you really feel all the work you put into the game in a way I've never seen done before. It makes you way more involved in the themes of the story because you really put in the work, and the emotional payoffs are huge because of it.

This is the most emotional I've gotten from playing a game since MGS4, which took four games worth of plot and really drove it home with great fan service moments and cinematic presentation that was unparalleled at the time. Death Stranding managed to do it without relying on fan service or nostalgia for past games (although there is some of that, especially with one awesome call back to MGS4), and when the different parts of the story and themes come together to a climax... it's just some of the most intense moments I've had in gaming one after another for the last four or five hours.

Think the world of Mad Max-lite with Scifi components with the gameplay of The Postman.
The story is enjoyable but with it's Kojima eccentricities. The characters are caricatures of someone trying to be deep and thought provoking, their dialogue is every bad anime translation of a wise overly verbose bad guy ever.
The combat is severely lacking, it plays like an Indie Dev's alpha foray into Third Person Shooters. There's a solid foundation of what it could be, but it's as if it was never tested.
Non-Critical SPOILER BELOW
There comes a point where you get lethal weapons for the first time and it really reveals how combat was tacked on at the last moment for the game. As if Kojima, six months before release, said ""fine, we'll put in some shooting"" You're forced to track down someone who is more powerful than you with unlimited ammo and grenades who also has 5 baddies with him. On ""Very Hard"" it takes an entire clip to down one baddie, not a complaint. You can trip them with a shotgun blast as well so that you can switch to grenades... which is where the issues start. You swap weapons and it takes for freaking ever to pack away your gun, swap it with grenades, unpack the grenades, equip the grenades, aim the grenades, and then throw it. And this animation is all done FOR you.  Couple this with being outgunned and a hideous third person camera for shooting (you'll block your own view most of the time. There's an indicator when your shot will be blocked but it's not readily apparent when the obstacle is close because your own body will be covering the indicator) and combat is just flat out janky and best avoided in the game... except you cant avoid this one.

This is the best game I've played so far in 2019-2020. The story is super good, character development is amazing,gameplay is different but definitely amazing. Yes its a pretty pricey game-usually PC games are way cheaper. But i definitely did not regret spending on this game. This game hasn't got boring at all since i started (I did play a bit on PS4 a while back).
HOW IS THE GAMEPLAY:
It's basically delivering cargo and other stuff from place to place along some super harsh environment from rocky mountains, rivers ,snowy mountains etc, while at the same time dealing with human enemies trying to steal your cargo and ghostly alien like creatures tryna kill you. You need to learn how to maintain your cargo,manage time and use your resources carefully. Your main goal is to connect America which was destroyed due to some incident.
STORY:
It's a Hideo Kojima game, its definitely amazing. A very cool concept, spectacular voice acting and an amazing cast.
APART FROM STORY:
There are side missions that are pretty good. And this game is kinda like Dark Souls where you leave clues for other players but here you can leave clues as well as build structures,place ladders and climbing ropes to make others journey easier and also donate weapons and equipment
 
**Combat is decent nothing great but still fun if you wanna mess around with the human enemies but the other ghost enemies things are pretty tense and kinda fun(trying not to spoil much).
SOUNDTRACK:
Its very good :)

OVERALL:
Its a different game but i found it very fun,its super slow paced but not in an annoying manner. Its definitely not for everyone , so if you wanna try it out maybe get it on a sale, I personally did not regret spending the full price on the game.",1594987090,1595183318,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,64,13,2106,0,845,1598776680,,
19,DEATH STRANDING,72962493,english,"This is my second play through, I bought and played through it on PS4 last year.

First of all, if you're not sure if this game is for you, don't worry about the memes about walking sims, you only have to ask yourself one thing: 

DO YOU LIKE KOJIMA GAMES SUCH AS METAL GEAR? If you love MG5, then you will probably love this game. The Kojima easter eggs, quirks, doing crazy random things with gear or vehicles you never thought would be programmed into a game is there exactly like you'd expect from a modern Kojima game. If you understand what I'm trying to say here, just buy the game. If you need more convincing, read on...

Not that I should have to say this, but this game has 15 chapters of content. Only the first ~2.5 chapters do you not have vehicles and other modes of transport other than walking/running. I don't want to spoil the insane amount of customization of gameplay, new vehicles, gear, weapons, replayability so I'll try to create a broader argument for this amazing game.

The point of the previous comment is to say that if you like immersive experiences, this game is by far in the top 1% of games in that regard. The game puts you in the shoes of a guy trying to find his place in the world, and at the same time ""bridge"" together the former USA. The world is mostly uninhabitable in the setting of the game and this lends to the reason you, yes, literally have to get places and much of the game is going from A to B. That does not make it boring or content-less. That is where the mechanics of the game and the experiences you will have shine. You will not find empty spaces with no purpose in this game, when much of the mechanics of the game revolve around getting over the terrain etc... There are easter eggs, different/challenging terrain, different enemies, and ways to get around/through all of the above.

But here's the thing, you can literally have gun fights, fist fights, drive motorcycles, raid a camp of baddies and steal their rides, ride zip lines, climb mountains, hover board, build structures, build yourself mechanical suit parts, sit in an onsen, deliver pizza... all in this ""walking simulator""... And I guess that's my point. Anyone calling it that is being purposefully obtuse to a literal endless trove of gameplay. 

The game isn't necessarily hard, either, although you can change the difficulty and make it more challenging.

The parallel multiplayer system is absolutely groundbreaking and innovative. It makes playing this game so much more than what you see at face value. To build a road or a bridge and get likes from other players, which in turn makes your character ""level up"" and better at various parts of the game feels amazing. It also feels good to just give people likes. You will never be happier than when you're on top of a mountain and find a perfectly placed ladder or rope when you're out of gear on a long trip.

The visuals and sound design are top notch. The celeb cameos are awesome. The insane amount of little easter eggs and quirks are awesome. The game is awesome and new. The gaming world needs more new things and I don't think anyone should be arguing against that point.",1595183301,1595183301,TRUE,3,0,0.55427593,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,358,7,2208,0,1457,1595912616,,

38,DEATH STRANDING,72959757,english,"Metal Gear Solid was the first and last Hideo Kojima game I played (I was still in grade school) I was never a huge fan of any of the games, therefore I was initially skeptical about picking this up when it launched for PS4 back in November. However, after I saw the Half-Life X Death Stranding crossover (Thank you for bringing this to PC) I gained curiosity for it again plus I'm a huge fan of Norman Reedus from the film [i]The Boondock Saints[/i]

There aren't many games I feel I need to write a review for, but Death Stranding is an exception. This isn't just a game - it's an experience that moved me like a artwork masterpiece. The game makes me feel like I'm in Iceland or Alaska which happen to be two places I've always wanted to visit. The cutscenes are amazing, and the gameplay graphics are surreal. The attention to detail is some of the best I've ever seen, not just the visuals but the audio as well. The soundtrack is beautiful, and the voice acting in this game is superb; the entire cast did a phenomenal job. 

""[b]Death Stranding Is Not For Everyone[/b]"" this is an understatement. People will say it's a boring walking simulator. It's unfortunate there are so many mindless reviewers out there, especially since many video game companies just keep feeding players the same garbage over and over again, and no one is bold enough to try to create anything new or innovative.  

We as human beings have become slaves to instant gratification. This game is extremely relevant through these trying times. I played this game during the prolonged quarantine of COVID-19.

40,DEATH STRANDING,72958385,english,"One of the most interesting games I have ever played. Mechanics wise, it is not that different from other open world games. However, what Kojima has done is truly something interesting in the sense he turns what usually is a boring and monotonous task of delivering stuff from A to B, into an actually interesting and enjoyable experience. The integration with online features where other players' building structures showing up in your game to aid you in quite unique and it honestly made the game even better. It's a nice feeling seeing other people that have gone ahead of you, laying down bridges, rest stops and vehicles for other players. It truly makes you feel like you are part of the chiral network and was a big motivator for me personally to connect each region to the network.

Story wise, I would say this was one of the best stories I have seen in video games in a while. Witcher 3 and Detroit Become Human are the only others that come to mind with an equal story. Starting the game you are like wtf is going on there is no way I will be able to understand any of this even after the game ends. But Kojima slowly feeds you all the information you are missing and slowly over the course of the game it all starts to make sense. There were a few times I had to pause mid game and was like ""Wait a minute, I get it now"". Kojima left the whole story right in front of you the whole time, you just have to play to uncover the info. You also get large amounts of lore and back story through delivering packages that come in through ""interviews"" where you can read in your spare time. I like this because it gives those who persevere and grind out packages another reward if they are invested in the story, while at the same time not forcing it down your throat. It is only there for you to read if you want to read it.

Overall I think this is a great game but I only recommend it for certain types of people. If you are the kind of person who can't keep an attention span for more than 5 minutes and need constant stimulus, this is not the game for you. This game is an experience, not something you run and gun through. There is a lot of time where it will be just you and BB, walking through the world while music is playing. This game gives you the chance to understand there is something greater than yourself: helping others and developing relationships.

Its a unique masterpiece.

Its not for everyone, but when you hit a certain chapter the game opens up with more action and more nerve wrecking moments. how will i survive this?

61,DEATH STRANDING,72954110,english,"Absolutely one of the best games I've ever played. The game gives you such an incentive to keep performing the tasks that you're doing, which in turn feeds into the player's motivation to keep going further and further. If you're tired of other games giving you nothing more than ""go here do this"" then consider this as something that performs that formula but shakes it up so that the journey and gameplay loop is different. The story is great, and definitely no-where near as confusing as people make it out to be; it's a standard sci-fi story that I haven't seen before, and I enjoy it. If I had to give the game some negative criticism, I think there are some things that could be fixed in later patches. Specifically, I think it's silly you don't get to use your music player while you're out and about in the game, maybe that'll occur later or on NG+ but I'm not sure. Another issue could be menu management; if you like things like the Resident Evil 4 inventory system and organizing things gives you joy then you will have fun with this, but it *CAN* be a little tedious to have to constantly open a menu to perform tasks (think Metal Gear Solid 3 Standard Edition when you had to swap camo constantly). The vehicle movement in the first section of the game was pretty nice, but man hitting the second section of the game has made the bike physics sometimes go all over the place. Sometimes you'll ""jump"" with the bike and just float up a good 30 feet even though you were hardly going fast at all, but it's ultimately not taken away from the experience of the game at all. I've been having minor glitches with my Xbox One wireless controller in that on occasion the game will behave like I just rapidly hit X or the Start button over and over again, but I'm not sure what's going on there (could just be the transmitter getting interference rather than the game). Lastly, this is probably my biggest complaint, even though some people will just scoff it off as my fault— in the game you can trust your cargo to other people to deliver it for you, so you have a backup if you can't finish a delivery, and when you're returning missing/dropped cargo to a client while also carrying someone ELSE'S lost cargo, the game will finish the selection for Client 1's delivery, then transition into the Entrust menu for the other client's lost cargo. This is EXTREMELY annoying because I've accidentally missed the highlight on the menu title and just skipped through so fast that I've entrusted cargo I didn't want to. I think they really need to take this out of the game and just have the Entrust Cargo menu as it's own separate terminal option (which it already is, but stop transitioning to it after making a delivery). I know it sounds stupid but I've lost a lot of stuff accidentally by doing that. Either way, those are really my only complaints. This game is one of the best I've ever played, and it keeps me engaged. Compare this to other games like Mad Max where you literally have to go to places, look around, take objectives which are ""go here do this, drive back;"" Death Stranding manages to turn that experience into an entertaining one, and I don't think a game has ever done such a good job.

Oh, it also has a bonus walking simulator game in a desolate, empty-open world. I like the part where people has to work together in making highways and other amenities -- which fills the said empty open-world. It's fulfilling, so to speak.

The driving physics are pretty funny, I mean, you can't walk straight with 100 kg cargo on your back but you can jump high with a trike while carrying the same cargo and won't tumble down if you can land with the right attitude.
One-hit non-lethal combat is simple and satisfying. However, the forced lethal combats are annoying.

The most satisfying part in the game is when you get notified that something you have built helped someone else, I guess in terms of gameplay, the game is successful in sending the message about ""connection"" to the players.

I think what people need to understand is that there ARE games that are not fully action-packed, adrenaline-driven, and visually-stimulating. This (IGN) review is primarily based on the subjective point of view where this guy is expecting something like guns and combats (as in metal gears solid) in Death Stranding; however, it is not STRANDING if you can just run it down and kill everyone. The protagonist is not a superhero. He is just a delivery man in a near-future setting. To feel the oppressiveness and the weight of the world requires players to sit down and really contemplate about these tough decisions or even philosophical questions. We all like different games, but just to give a game 6.8 because it does not match someone's personal taste can be misleading.

Optimization is on point, PC controls feels natural, the sound design is top tier and so is the visual design. I have never seen a more beautiful map, it just sells the idea that it could be a real place really well. Of course, the game has it's bugs, but after 35 hours i have not encountered anything serious, the most annoying thing are the floaty vehicle controls. The story is great but some cutscenes feel a little cheesy, that's Kojima's trademark though. The game isn't for anyone, it's not non-stop action like a lot of games are these days (nothing wrong with that though), but i'd lie if i said that some moments in DS aren't intense as hell.

6,DEATH STRANDING,72941028,english,"I was sceptical to this game which has been described what sounds like a cutscene storm on top of a walking simulator. I really dislike cutscenes in games, and usually just skip right through them if possible. I have precious little time for playing games, and when I do I want to play and not watch a poorly written movie, just interrupted with some linear gameplay. These kind of games tend to be popular though, so I guess I am just not a mainstream gamer.

However, I was pleasantly surprised to find myself intrigued by the bizarre story unfolding. There's a ton of lore in here, and it is all presented in an interesting way where the characters all have a strong personality that keeps me invested.

And the game needs an interesting story, because it does focus on it a lot. During the first hour or so, do not expect to do much except just watching cutscenes. But it gradually takes off the support wheels and let you take more and more control, so the world is opened for you and you can do what you want in it.

The game mechanics are very basic. Walk from A to B to deliver your cargo that you keep on your back. The bigger the cargo, the more you struggle keeping balance. Navigate through the gorgeous landscapes and keep pressing forward through all kinds of obstacles, ranging from easy ones like scattered stones and rivers to more challenging ones like vertical cliffs and ravines. You can use ropes, ladders and other equipment to solve how to get past a difficult area.

But the real challenge is the presence of some supernatural entities, that manifests during rain. There are also bandits who want to get hold of your cargo. So, as the game progresses, you find that there are a lot more to it than simply walking about.

But make no mistake, there will be a lot of walking around. At the moment I am not very deep into the story, but I am already not starting to feel my patience is getting stretched a bit. The most annoying thing that happens is you need to walk for a long time to get to some pre-determined even that will give you a real challenge. If you fail, then all the walking to get there has been in vain.

First of all the game is a fresh breath, as the AAA games typically tend to be quite stale without any new ideas. Most game studios throw themselves on popular genres like fortnite to cash out more with less risk, but in the process just flooding the market with similar games. So, kudos to the game designer here for taking a chance on what he believe in.

I am enjoying it so far, more than I thought I would. Can easily recommend to anyone who want to try something new and strange, with more depth and polish than the typical indie game studio can afford.

36,DEATH STRANDING,72685796,english,"Death Stranding is a game that is like no other. It has graphics that rival RDR2, a story that rivals even the best-written TV shows or movies, and a soundtrack rivaled by no other. The gameplay is the only aspect that others may seem boring, but after an hour or so of gameplay, I wanted more. I was like the [spoiler] MULES [/spoiler], delivering any main quest package I could. 

The graphics make this game feel like you are watching a movie. The reflections in the water, the level of detail in the grass and snow, the amazing sunsets, it's incredible. 

The story is awesome, with all the little details, and well-written characters.

The music always compliments the scene in a perfect way. Every song is only played once, making every time they are heard even more special. 

The gameplay might push some away at first, and I totally see that. It doesn't change much, aside from [spoiler] action, driving, and some stealth[/spoiler]. But, its mostly just walking or running through a highly detailed and beautiful area. It makes you feel zen. 

This is where the graphics, music, and semi-calming gameplay all come together. As you feel so alone, and perfectly timed song starts to play. It gives you the motivation to either continue going or finish the trip right then and there. 

When I went into this game, I knew what I was getting into. But I did not know I would enjoy it this much. This is a game that needed to be made, and love it or hate it needs to be played. Kojima proved he could do this without a big studio. This game is one of the few games I want to play, and keep playing. I really would not change it in any way. 

And as I finish writing this, all I can think to myself is, ""Why didn't I play on PlayStation?""

This is a very different game.
I was made aware that this was made fun of as a 'walking simulator', and so far it has been an absolute surprise and a joy to play. Lot's of problem solving and decisions to make on how you make your trek across the land.
Currently playing this with mouse and keyboard, I had though perhaps it would be better with a controller but so far this is one of the best PC ports I have ever tried; the controls are quite intuitive and definitely not hacked together.
Combat is few and far between, it really puts the player in their role that violence is a last resort. As a person who actually has naturally gotten less interest in pure shooting violence games, this one really gives me something to enjoy while still being a AAA title.
Absolute work of art, story is interesting (and oddly relevent despite having been created pre-covid. The story tries to explain to you this sci-fi concept of social distancing and quarantine as if it was not a current reality. Very odd and relatable)
Visually stunning, works with ultrawides but not up to 5120 x 1440, you will have to play in 3440 x 1440. This seems perfectly acceptable. 
So far very happy with this game, I don't usually finish story oriented games, and this one has kept me involved the whole time.

48,DEATH STRANDING,72916401,english,"I feel I have only just started this game. I've heard people have finished it in under ten hours, but I have been doing a lot of side quests to unlock gear, and building stuff for my fellow porters, so I just got to chapter 4. Still a lot ahead of me. It's so incredibly weird and fantastic, so imaginative, I am savoring it all.

The whole 'walking simulator' thing doesn't do it justice. It really is so much more than that. A sense of meaning and accomplishment by arrival, the tension and adrenaline of a misplaced boot, planning routes using a map like a true explorer, the weight of the pack, all contribute to a sense of journey. This game does the best job I have seen anywhere to create an actual sense of scale, and the related awe one feels in a haunting landscape both green volcanic and of howling desolation. All to a movie-like soundtrack, and talented actors really nailing their parts.

The player helps others play, and brings some much needed relief to the suffering denizens of a disconnected and ravaged world at the same time. You will interact with other, real people from all over the world, and no one will be the wiser, a user name on a well-placed bridge to boost likes to. It is an empty world full of souls, some dead, some VR avatars, some footsteps just passed by a moment before, but the help is there, like the right amount of materials placed in a box by someone else next to a much-needed road. Sam rarely meets anyone in the flesh, but everyone is connected, real or imagined. The bittersweet and beautiful ache of loneliness echoes over the landscape. NPCs, grieving, upset, tears falling easily, or bitter and shut down, numb from all of this world's experience hide in their bunkers. The villians are terribly broken and evil. Main characters tell their captivating tales. Tears come very easy in this devastated place, even for hardcore warrior types like Sam, all he has to do is connect to BB to feel it. 

There are metaphors, social statements, political statements, such as a kind of hope for an idealized America that comes off as a global sentiment for success, one in which people care about each other, and hope for one another's successes and survival. Of course, the crushing tragedies that got people to this place is part of the story, as some are of a mind that life is futile, that only despair and torment as oily death remains for death's sweet sake.

Death Stranding is a pinnacle of the art, a masterpiece. It outsmarts all the ruts gaming has gotten itself into. All the murder-hoboing and toxicity, all the shaming, bullying and entitlement, all the isolation, distraction and disconnection, all the depression and avoidance of work that gaming has an internal struggle with is addressed elegantly and with grace. As a porter, you work tirelessly to make the world better. Sam is like atlas carrying the weight of a dying world. He speaks rarely, but with weight and by deed.  His comments often make me smile. There is a good bit of ridiculousness here to remind us not to take ourselves too damn seriously as we attempt to hide our packages from tormented and malevolent ghosts. It unfolds like a lotus and continues to unfold. And of course, at the top of the meaning structure, is our inbred avoidance/obsession with death. I can't go into too much more without spoilers, but I whole-heartedly recommend the experience of this game. 

Lonely, quiet Sam Porter Bridges, essential worker of the apocalypse, braving all dangers to connect the huddled remnants cringing from almost total extinction, to you sir I raise my glass. The deeper you are, the deeper it goes like a night's reflection on the calm ocean. Such is the eternal abyss, where death is a single strand among an infinite number of raindrops that capture us in our unknowing to shine with brave grief and heart-felt awe, or tumble awkwardly and numb into darkness with a feeling of never having experienced anything at all.

A problem I have is that the cities themselves feel largely empty and void of life. Why is this not addressed? To show what I mean, in the first scenes where you meet ""Mother"" and Die-Heart Man tries to convince you to take the job, you're inside the facility of the ""President of the United States"". Yet, there's zero signs of life from other NPCs, such as scientists / soldiers or other VIPs that would be around such an important figure. It's just you, Die Heart Man, in an empty building, in an empty world.

It's OK for the wilderness to be empty and not have people, but when you're in civilization, there should've been people. The game feels so boring otherwise, you're going from one ghost town. to another. No way for you to say ""No"" to people. No way for consequences to be felt, because Kojima didn't bother putting any frikin NPCs in the game. It's like cmon. Big let down.

Death Stranding has the best moss and that should be the only thing that matters. All jokes aside, the only real negative of it is the story pacing but it was not enough to sour my experience. Story is still worth experiencing despite it's blemishes.

First of all, if you like deep and meaningful experiences, this is it. If you're playing games solely to have mindless fun, look somewhere else. If you have a short attention span and zero patience, the game is not for you. In fact, I found that the most frustrating parts of the game was when I was trying to rush through it. When I actually slowed down to take it all in, things just clicked, I was hooked. The game punishes impatient players. For example, running down steep mountains resulting in Norman Reedus tumbling and dropping all his package which leads them to get damaged or destroyed. Another example being when trying to cross a river without checking how deep it is. Patience is the name of the game. 

The online aspect is my favourite thing about the game. Strangers can leave equipment for you or structures you can use. It really hammers home the theme that we are stronger together. 

This is coming from someone who played all the MGS games. I had EXTREMELY low expectations for the game due to the negative feedback from the gaming community but I was proven wrong after playing the PC port for the first time.

The primary thing you do in the game is run trade-packs from point A to B, while seeing beautiful landscapes and experiencing a wonderful story. There's scary/suspenseful moments due to a neat mechanic. There's also a cool mechanic where you and other players have an effect on each other's worlds. The soundtrack is also incredible, and at the points where the music kicks in it really has an impact.

This isn't an action packed game where you're constantly in combat. It's something relaxing to play at times and stressful at other times (fun stressful, if that makes sense). The game really pulls you into the world with the story. I can't stress that enough.

There is a LOT of reading, and I mean a LOT. (Basically, the length of my review minus the TLDR is the length of most of the reading material). The game obviously has voice dialog but you get in-game mail which is not voiced and is pretty wordy or sometimes repeats some of the same material you've already read from someone else's mail but with extra information. I will say however that the game does a good job of highlighting text so you can just read that highlighted portion and you'll get the gist of it.

TLDR:
Gameplay: Lot's of walking, there's also vehicles. But you'll still have to walk a lot. You run trade-packs from one point to another.
Pros: Fantastic story, beautiful landscapes, incredible soundtrack, lots of suspenseful moments.
Cons: Tons and tons of reading (there's also voice dialog obviously), you may not like the game if you'll get bored doing cargo runs all the time.",1595134206,1595134206,TRUE,1,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,91,10,1422,0,960,1595707470,,

85,DEATH STRANDING,72927351,english,"When Death Stranding was first revealed back in 2016 during the E3 Press Conference, I was intrigued to say the least. Once I saw that it was produced by Sony Interactive Entertainment as well, I was fearful that the game would be a PlayStation Exclusive. Not that I don't have a PlayStation, I just prefer playing on PC, and the annoyance of having to obtain the hard copy and install it on my console seemed, at the time, not worth it. However once Kojima Productions announced it was coming to Steam, I was ecstatic. Simply because I have been a fan of Hideo Kojima with series such as Metal Gear, and the cast line up of characters informed me of just how much of a treat this game would be.

Death Stranding is a game, all of it's own. There are not many like it, and I can see a potential revolutionary gameplay ideology that will influence games in the future. This game does a lot of things right, and some wrong, although I would claim that the validity of the positives far outweigh the validity of the negatives. Simply put, the cons of my experience was not game breaking, nor did it ruin the experience.

The story of Death Stranding is an absolute mystery to the player once you start the game. You have no context, no backstory, or character developing moments within the first 30 minutes of the game. 

You play as Sam Porter Bridges, played by Norman Reedus, and he is a courier of sorts. Not of just envelopes, or mail, but of valuable items, items that later become very useful as you continue throughout the game. You first see Sam on a motorcycle, driving throughout the countryside while the credits roll, portraying all of the cast members without the names of the characters in which they play. This was all intentional, seeing as you learn each of these characters as your progress throughout the story. As Sam is driving along, he ends up clearing this cliff and running into a woman, leading him to crash and his bike to fall off the cliff. So, stranded without a vehicle, a storm comes along with an inverted rainbow in the sky. As you take control of Sam, and collect his cargo, you learn the mechanics of traversal. Such as balancing using both of your arms, climbing, jumping, running, all of these actions which lead you to a cave to wait out the storm. During your time spent in the cave, you come across the women Sam hit while clearing the canyon on his bike, a woman named Fragile, played by Lea Seydoux. A character that seems to have a supernatural feeling about her, although you can't pinpoint why, and what she is capable of. Then, during your conversation with Fragile, you come across the hidden enemies. The Beached Things, or BT's for short. These terrifying opponent's are invisible to the eye, leaving tar filled handprints all over the ground. Now, although it's a newly introduced part of the story, without any context, you can assume they are dangerous simply because of how Sam reacts, crouching down, moving slowly, steadying his breathing, and covering his mouth, all while watching these handprints move closer and closer to him. Eventually the storm clears, the rainbow disappears, and the BT's are no longer around. You make the connection rather quickly, that the storms precede the BT's, which is an important game mechanic used later by the player. 

After Sam and Fragile's encounter with the BT's, there is a small introductory period of them both, learning that Sam has Aphenphosmphobia, or the fear of being touched, all the while learning that Fragile had been caught out in the middle of the Timefall, the storms that precede BT's and age everything it touches, and severely damaged and aged her own body from neck to toe. This is all a mystery to the player from the beginning, as to the reasonings why Sam has his phobia, and Fragile is scarred, something you learn more about as you progress through the storyline.

Then, after Fragile disappears, and Sam loads up his gear onto his back, you go on a small journey to a local city to deliver your packages all while listening to the soundtrack of the band, LOW ROAR. This feature pops up frequently while on your longer missions, music will be played on the journey, and at the end of the mission you can save the song to be played at any other moment.

That is the first 15-30 minutes of Death Stranding, absolutely confusing, but ridiculously intriguing, so much so to keep the player interested throughout the 20+ hour storyline.

Additionally the cast of this game is absolutely stellar, with performances from Norman Reedus, Lea Seydoux, Mads Mikkelsen, Guillermo Del Toro, Troy Baker, and others to keep the review list short. All of the performances by the individual actors are enticing, and moving. Sure there are moments where dialogue seems stretched and inauthentic as most games do. That said, the moments where you chuckle at the cheesiness or the downright confusion, it was all for a reason chosen by Hideo Kojima. Whether that be to portray his characters in a certain light, or flesh out details about how they would act if the Death Stranding hadn't occurred in the first place.

This game is very polarizing, and although it's polarizing, I haven't met many people who have hated the game as a whole, at least not enough to not recommend it. However, I believe as do a few others, the people who will enjoy this game are the people who will choose to buy it, to play it, understand it, and finish it all on their own. That was a choice I had made, paying the full $60 retail price, and I would not take back that money compared to the enjoyment I had from the story and the gameplay.

Death Stranding isn't for everyone but for those who are interested in playing a game that requires time and thought into things such as route planning, as well as patience, will thoroughly enjoy this game, in my opinion of course. The time spent playing this game, even if you do not enjoy some of the mechanics that surround it, the storyline as a whole is an absolute marvel of ingenuity in my estimation. There is nothing like Death Stranding, and I would love to see what Hideo can do from here with this style of game.

Now, would I recommend this game at a full price of $60. I'm inclined to say yes, no doubt, however my review isn't to sway you into purchasing this game, but to give insight into how someone might interpret the game after it has been completed. If you're interested, and are willing to spend the money for a game unlike any other while accepting some of it's inadequacies and flaws but enjoying it's tender moments, go for it! It's worth the buy, and a blast to play.

Anyways, have a good day y'all, and God Bless!",1595128378,1595128378,TRUE,2,0,0.523809552,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,574,13,1619,0,1619,1595070854,,

87,DEATH STRANDING,72927157,english,"Death Stranding is really good. Unlike many games these days, the core game-play loop is not combat. There is some combat, but that's not the focus of the game. Some people call it a walking simulator, which isn't wrong, but it forms the wrong associations. ""Walking simulators"" I've played before have all really just been a nice tour of a landscape, maybe with puzzles. They did not include the actually interesting mechanic of walking. Death Stranding does. It feels like hiking up and down a mountain, where suddenly you need to pay a bit of attention to where you step and how you want to approach it. It has captured the essence of hiking and trekking places in a way that nothing else has. Other games have captured the striking beauty of natural landscapes, but not the interesting and somewhat meditative process of traversing them. This gets thrown into overdrive when baddies arrive, and you're forced to figure out how to get around them, or get through an area fast. Do you want to abandon part of your load to move faster? Do you want to try to circumnavigate the area?

The story is standard Hideo Kojima so far, which is to say it's totally batshit and unintelligible, but the emotional beats and arc goes well. The unintelligible aspect of it doesn't make it bad, it makes it mysterious and eldritch imho.

Tl;Dr, I highly recommend it. It's very different from games I've played before and there's nothing I can easily compare it to. It's groundbreaking and interesting and definitely pushing the boundaries of what AAA games can be and how the experience of gaming can be different.

It allows you to explore. The story is engaging. The characters are believable and relatable. The combat can be a bit clunky if you end up in an area with a lot of small obstacles. The BTs can lock you in place for too long due to terrain. But in general the combat is fun, especially against cargo thieves. The block and dodge mechanics work well alongside striking. I moved the default fighting button away from V though as it was a bit awkward to use in combat. 

The graphics are beyond top notch. This is what I expect from Cyberpunk 2077 on a PC, not a game made for PS4. I am truly impressed.

19,DEATH STRANDING,72920904,english,"PC Port is quite good, performance is fine, no major glitches in 30+ hours of game.

Game itself has some big flaws. It's slow paced to the point of exhaustion. Tutorials are intrusive, given via dialogue and go all the way to the late game. It's a bit too easy (I played at normal difficulty). Every ""quest"" is a fetch quest and Devs didn't do much to spice things up. Story is basically told thru exposition.

However, a lot of the criticism is undeserved. All the claims that the gameplay is bad or that it's too difficult to control are absolutely ridicule. Movement and controls are fluid and easy. Vehicles drive well. Sam is easy to balance, and running around is not difficult at all. The common ""it's a walking simulator"" line really does not sound true after a while. For the first hour maybe I could agree, but as soon as the first combat and shooting sections kick in, it becomes very clear that this is not the case. There is a lot more to the game than just walking from A to B. The number of things the game allows you to manage, for example, is abysmal. I don't think I have ever played a game where so much attention was put to each and every little possible detail.

And, to compensate all the bad things, the game also has some very bright and interesting moments in the story and mechanics. Many scenes are beautiful, tense and interesting. Characters are intriguing. The world itself is so well build that walking around into it makes it feel alive. Never have I seen a game where the main character interacts so beautifully - and precisely with his surroundings. There are A LOT of different ways to tackle deliveries, and details in how you manage things make A LOT of difference, so even if you are always doing about the same thing, it doesn't get all that repetitive. The lack of thought put in quests is very much mitigated by the incredible amount of complications brought up by the environment itself. You have to consider EVERYTHING: time, weather, wind, terrain, temperature, paths, obstacles and so on.

Overall, I think it's a great game with some bad, bad flaws. If you are the patient type and are not looking for a action game, but for a unique DEEP management and simulation experience where action is secondary, it's easy to recommend Death Stranding.

27,DEATH STRANDING,72719594,english,"I haven't obviously finished this game yet, and I'll edit this review once I do, but here's what I can tell you so far:

All my high expectations have been surpassed! This is the Kojima's game that surpasses Metal Gear (even if they are not comparable genre wise). As a matter of fact, there's no genre that can define Death Stranding! It's a one-in-a-lifetime experience with contemplative, artistic and philosophical moments alternating with a powerful blend of stealth, survival horror, and adventure! 
The intensity of those gameplay segments  and interactive cutscenes is sometimes mitigated by the typical humorous insertions that only Kojima can conceive! From funny comments, amusing reactions, fourth-wall breaking scenes, to quirky or even kinky sequences!
Photo mode even allows you to create and immortalise your own hilarious or serious memories with some very cool editing options: poses, facial expressions (for both Sam and BB), filters, effects, and more! And you can even do that during the cutscenes to some extent!

This is the first game ever where I'm feeling more in control of the overall experience rather than the main character. It's a continuous flow of video poetry where every single second within the narrative counts passionately! It's more than just a game or cinematic experience. It's a ludic, visual, and touching immersion into the deepest philosophical meaning of connections. Completely unrepeatable! And brilliantly emphasised by the asynchronous multiplayer.

Watching this streamed on Twitch/YouTube or passively observing someone else playing it won't do any justice to it. It strictly requires to be felt and experienced to be judged. I also personally disagree with those saying that the first three hours of DS may feel tedious to become more lively later in the game. I actually felt entertainment and joy straightaway since the narrator said his first word, but I can't deny that the more your inventory grows the richer your experience will become.

I also COMPLETELY DISAGREE WITH THE WALKING SIMULATOR MEME! At no point during this game you're simulating any of your typical walks, unless of course you meet sinister creatures, futuristic terrorists or other obstacles during your everyday walks and you need to avoid/fight them whilst managing your inventory tactically! Also, you don't even walk. Precisely, during your connection quests you jog, drive, ride, skate, etc. instead!

Suggestion for players: make sure that DLSS is on, and that the latest graphic drivers have been downloaded. No, Denuvo anti-piracy system is not causing any problem whatsoever, unlike what was assumed by some nonsensical rumors.

PROS:
+ Jaw-dropping details!
+ Kojima's genius and humour are back!
+ Induces a natural urge to explore its immense beauty!
+ Unique and genre-defying gameplay mechanics and meta-games.
+ The asynchronous multiplayer feels organic and brilliant.
+ Decently satisfying combat system.
+ Photo mode is indescribably fun!
+ You interact with a non-stop flow of video poetry.
+ Mesmerising direction and fantastic acting performances!
+ Touching and mind-bending philosophy.
+ Memorable soundtrack.

CONS:
- The interface may feel intimidating at first.
- This title more than any other should become cross-play at some point.
- Combat may be repetitive
- We should be able to change the colour of the writing for the ""Tomorrow is in your hands"" frame in photo mode.
- The story ends, unfortunately!

The game made me wanna quit at times but I definitely was never going to lower it. It was worth playing on very hard I felt like you only get the whole experience playing it on that. It made it felt even more rewarding too, you can definitely go through the whole game without fighting except for the parts where you have no choice but to, there are many of those parts in the game.

The game is very long and beautiful visually with well written dialogue and a heartwarming story. The game at times made me upset with its crazy challenges it threw my way and definitely simulated the way it would feel to walk those miles in real life. At many points in the game I wanted to quit probably cause i played on hard but I kept going and it paid off.

The vehicles are a huge shortcut, you can kinda get away with it even when you're not supposed to but a lot of the time the game stops you in tracks.

At times of peace walking there comes a roller coaster of emotions, this game made me tear up at times, frustrated at times but most of the time calm. I didn't lose interest I just wanted to keep going, the game kept me engaged at all times even it rips your progress away. When you have to start from zero you just pick up and go again.

Overall a great game, a different experience that everyone should at least try, maybe not on very hard cause it does get very frustrating.

2)The weirdness , the eerieness and sheer tensed moments of these invisible creatures hunting for you whil you're delivering packages is what keeps me gripped, and will keep you too.
3)This game is genre-defying. Yep. You can't put this in any category that right, and this is the best part. You are experiencing something which is new and new sought before. 
4)I'm sure most of us all have played a lot of other next gen games. This is the epitome.
5)It's always fun to play a game which has new meanings and explores things that we never had thought of, that is what Mr. Hideo Kohima has done here brilliantly.
6)KOJIMA IS AWESOME. PERIOD.
7)NORMAN REEDUS IS DROOL-WORTHY
8)If these points still aren't enough. Dunno how many will.

Finally, yes this game is sometimes a bit clumsy and monotonous, but I assure you that you'll find interest if you try a bit to understand what's going on as the game answers your curiosities as it unfolds itself.

Death Stranding has guns... Death Stranding has gadgets... Death Stranding has an online feature that allows the sharing of tools, structures and items to make the trek across America easier for you and your fellow online Porters. Weapons and equipment, as typical with a Kojima game, are earned slowly over time. OSP! On-Site Procurement baby!

In a nutshell, if you boil down Death Stranding to it's elements, it is the natural evolution of Kojima gameplay. A thread started with the Metal Gear Portable games (bite sized missions, semi-open world) that was perfected with Metal Gear Solid 5 and now distilled into a totally different concept, but that core Metal Gear gameplay is there with a twist... you're really not going to want to kill anybody, stealth is more important as is non-lethal means of disabling opponents. Or you get the Big Badda Boom. Big Badda Boom is bad. 

Kojima's trademark humor is also back; urination; trippy babies; quirky easter eggs that reward the player for exploration and odd distractions like being able to play in the mirror and take a dump.

Like with Kojima's Metal Gear series, he has a story and message to tell... but what critics that complain seem to not appreciate is that you have a sandbox, where you can ignore missions and do zany things, engage in combat, torment and torture foes just like MGS. 

The package delivery is a barrier that many won't overcome, but if you do - you get a massive open playground where you can put ziplines anywhere, try to climb the highest mountain and slowly help to reconnect America whether she deserves it or not. [Sam is of the opinion not...]

You will encounter a myriad of pop culture references, a few nods to his former franchise at Konami, and get to experience some of Kojima's music, toy and automobile fetishes he believes you should know about.

I played this game on PS4 to completion, and still returned back to it time and time again to revisit earlier regions from the game, build and repair structures and help out other Porters by delivering their lost packages. I am hoping on PC, Death Stranding sees the same level of community cooperation that was present on the PS4... it is there when the game really shines.

Take for example the mid-way point. You will go into treacherous ice-capped mountains and hiking it is a chore and then some. Hell, the character you play, Sam Porter Bridges*, will even utter a ""Damn it!"" or other profanity and complain about the hike as well. In each region you can build structures like zip-lines and bridges, to make the trek easier, but you are capped how many items you can place. The struggle is real but... through support of the online porters, like yourself if you get the game, a network of zip-lines, bridges and watchtowers will emerge to compliment and support your own structural investments, allowing in many regions for you to travel from base to base through the air by zip-line which is absolutely exhilarating  as you ascend to mountain crests and descend through valleys.

There are vehicles. Some truly goosebump generating moments and until you get an arsenal of the right weapons, sketchy lunatics and scary monsters you'll have to avoid until you reach ""Snake"" status. 

So what are you waiting for Porters? The PS4 community is fine so don't need me there anymore...

63,DEATH STRANDING,72913786,english,"Straight up, this game will not be for everybody. 

Death Stranding is a slow-burn title, which will have you walking across a disconnected, but gorgeous America, in aim to bring the country together again. Kojima took quite the gamble with Death Stranding, as a chunk of players could easily see this game as too slow to get into, as there's no other title out there that can compare to this. As it is, Death Stranding is a completely unique action game, with social elements to allow players to work together to rebuild highways, bridges, watchtowers and so much more. There is no feeling like it when you are rewarded with likes from something you have built, knowing it has aided another player on their journey.

The tasks are quite repetitive, as you'll be travelling from point A to B for most of the game, but that's what you're signing up for when you buy this. With quite a simplistic melee system, combat is never really a problem, whether that be fighting some mules or a boss, combat has never come across as a challenge for me. However, Kojima delivers a truly breathtaking world, with a storyline you'll be grasping at straws to understand, but its all part of the fun watching it all unfold and slowly understanding the lore behind the game. I've loved my time with the game so far and cannot wait to see what else is in store with future Kojima Productions titles.

I saw some reviews, some gameplay, but it just did not entice me. Fast forward to now, when I saw that this was being released on steam I was excited for a few reasons. The first being that a Sony exclusive was making its way to the PC, And I see hoping that with future releases like horizon Zero dawn. I'm hoping the trend continues with games like God of War, Spiderman, uncharted, etc. I also thought to myself that Bing on PC would be the best version of this game. I've enjoyed previous Kojima games like Metal Gear Solid, and of course the silent Hills, So I thought I should support Sony bringing their games to PC and give this a try. Of course that was after I read a review for the PC version which I believe was dead on And I quote “this is a brilliant game, if it would just shut up ”. The story so far is amazing, and it completely pulls you in To the life of your character. What I take from that review is because the whole open world part of just exploring and working your way from one location to the next is brilliant. The graphics are phenomenal, the soundtrack is great, and the performance is hands down. I thought to myself if I did not like it, at least I could get a refund through steam, my first play session Lasted about five hours, but felt like 2 hours.

90,DEATH STRANDING,72908789,english,"This game... is pretty awesome.

But maybe only if you are into weird sci-fi stories, traversing icelandic landscapes, sneaking around what can only be described as pure death and sometimes being completely freaked out by what's happening around you.

As a sci-fi lover of anything weird this game has some of the best story and lore I have played in a long time.
At some point I was so immersed in the story that I was just talking to myself about the whole SNAFU and my GF got freaked out and asked if everything was okay.
I was okay, the main character had some shit to process tho.

As an outdoorsman this game has some shockingly horrific imagery of the dystopia you find yourself in. But also has some of the best scenery out there (if you like the green/rocky parts of iceland).
Being completely free to pick your own route, placing ladders and ropes for yourself AND others gives this game a unique gameplay.

As a lover of doing everything sneaky when given the opportunity, this game just adds another level. Yes you can sneak around, but what if you can't even see the enemy? Just scary shit right there.

My only negative point for this game is the BB's. You straight up have an aborted fetus strapped to your chest!
While to me this is only a bit mixed and just adds more to get freaked out about.
This can be a VERY sensitive subject for other potential players. So far it seems to play a pretty important role but I wish there was an option to replace it with a brain in a jar and have some cut scenes and stories edited differently.

""If you were a spy on a mission, you would have failed, but you're not, so be proud of these tracks, they're proof you existed."" 

I've never played such a brilliant piece of art, it made me cry, laugh and smile way more than anything before. 
The game creates such connection between the player and the characters hundred times deeper than any other movie or game. You'll be given a duty, how you act across the path is up to you, creating bonds and not only with in-game characters, but also with random players you'll come across on your journey, and trust me when I say that I've lost the count on how many times those players that I've never seen, but only their traces, saved my life and pushed me up, specially during boss fights, so for those 1.418 players, my deepest thanks to all of you <3

If you want a different game, still a brilliant one, give Death stranding a chance. 
I would give Death stranding a solid and naked 9/10.
Death stranding felt almost perfect, but as you may know perfection is not a thing we human beings can accomplish, it gets even harder when it is based on the individual point of view of every person, but I think a 9 is a pretty fair number for such a masterpiece.

Go steal your dad's credit card and buy Death stranding, enjoy the game, take it easy, explore the remains of America and last but non less, you may find out a bit of yourself, when the game gives you the choices, the easy way or the hard way, with all his consequences.

Thanks for your time, take care <3.",1595084161,1595084161,TRUE,171,15,0.776319921,6,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,126,29,5443,470,3405,1601073378,,

49,DEATH STRANDING,72898634,english,"DEATH STRANDING is an action/adventure game from Hideo Kojima that pushes the limits on modern day AAA titles. Without even mentioning the superb story and cast, the gameplay and mechanics are newly innovated and something that I've never seen anything like before. 

The main gameplay stems from the idea that you are a porter in a world that needs deliverymen now more than ever, so yes holding and delivering cargo are big parts of this game, but are in no way the only things to focus on. The game makes your objective of delivering cargo challenging by putting you in rough environments and forcing you to adapt to your terrain as you walk, while also having to deal with different enemies that can have negative consequences to your world if you interact with them in certain ways. It's hard to get into specifics of these mechanics without giving away spoilers, but I would highly recommend experiencing this game first-hand without being spoiled previously to playing. 

The world and story of DEATH STRANDING are incredible and unique. I played the game on PS4 when it originally released and completed it with platinum trophy for context of this review. The story and lore kept making me want to find out more and more to what happened to the world and the characters you interact with. This game, like many others, has lots of readable material that can give you more information and insight to the lore of the game. The thing that stands out for DS is that it is insanely well done and interesting. This is one of the only games, if not the only one, where I actually read every piece of in-game text it gave me. The story is pretty complex, and it starts you out without really knowing much, but the more you play and learn about the game and characters the more invested you get. The characters and the world feel alive, almost like they really do exist. This game made me laugh, cry, shout, and feel a full range of emotions.

Look, I can't say enough good things about this game. I've yet to mention the score and soundtrack which both perfectly represent the game and are amazing on their own. Even now, just thinking about the game I have goosebumps. DEATH STRANDING is easily on my personal top-5 games of all time list, and honestly is probably number one. On a personal note, I find it pretty difficult to express myself sometimes, and if you look at the reviews on my profile none of them are nearly as extensive as this one, so that alone should tell you all you need to know about this game. If you are on the fence about this game, or are looking for a new single player game to sink a lot of time into, please give this game a try. At the very least watch a playthrough on YouTube.

66,DEATH STRANDING,72894093,english,"This is a very fresh and interesting game for those who like it - be warned, it is very much story driven and gameplay is of a slower pace than many other games, with a focus on planning and exploration. You may see it as a walking simulator, and I won't disagree with you, but you should bare in mind that means walking is not as simple as pushing W or a analog stick forward, there is more nuance to movement in this game than most others out there.

I would like to write about the various mechanics and things but honestly there is so much I don't think I can do it justice. To summarise, you are primarily going from one point to another, and you have to figure what equipment you need and the route you need to take. You have 3 main obstacles. The landscape itself (ie. mountains, rocky outcrops, weather), BTs (ghostly like creatures which you cannot ordinarily see, and have limited equipment to deal with) and MULES (humans hostile to those who carry parcels amusingly enough... likewise limited equipment to deal with them).

The game starts out very simple, Sam is very vulnerable and does not have much to help him. As the game progresses you gain access to alsorts of gear, such as the ability to build bridges, guns that can help you fight MULES or BTs, exoskeletons to name a few things I've unlocked so far. Alot of the fun in this game apart from the traversing new areas is unlocking new things to help you. It should also be noted due to the nature of the game's multiplayer, although singleplayer and you will never meet another player, objects players build can appear in your world. So for example making a return trip you may find a vehicle a player has left, or a bridge they made to cross a river that you would of had to navigate over yourself.

It's hard to really do the game justice with a review for me, I think if any of this sounds remotely interesting you should at least try it and see if you like it. As I said at the beginning of the review, I think this game has a niche audience, so I don't think it's for everyone.

93,DEATH STRANDING,72886426,english,"So after finishing the game and doing a few premium delivery side order on Very Hard difficulty (How it meant to be played IMO) , what do I feel about this game. To me Death Stranding is a very interesting conceptual piece but sadly the writing is not that good although the delivery of it is amazing. [spoiler] pun not intended [/spoiler] Now is this game a masterpiece or a boring pretentious drivel from Kojima, the answer is both to me. There are some very psuedo-philosophy and basic Spiritualism in the game narrative that i found very jarring to listen. But the last few chapter is well presented in that aspect. Presentation is what this game narrative excels at not writing. It's definitely well acted by Norman Reedus and the other cast even though sometimes he sound death inside in some particular scene but that's just Sam character in the early chapters. I definitely like his character progression although not very memorable it serves the narrative pretty well. [spoiler] Kinda bothered though how all the game questions answered in the last few chapters which is just basically the Bridges member info dumping you everything and the true meaning of the game. Definitely would prefer a much more slow ease of the whole lore and all [/spoiler] The logs and messages that you get as you play is an interesting read and some have a ""political message"" but very contained to it's own narration and doesn't really gives much extra to the main narrative.

Now lets talk about the Gameplay, it is exactly as the box describe you bring stuff from A to Point B. But, of course with an interesting depth to it all, you can just yes technically just take the boring route of safe chasm and roads which makes the whole thing monotonous, but you can also do it like i do turning the game into a Map Based puzzle game where i find the most fastest route and arguably the most fun to do. The online components of it actually serve the narrative pretty well and i quite like the seamlessness of it, although it does make the game quite easy because of all the zip lines and generator present in my particular server. The gameplay is not for everyone is true this game is the definition of a slow burner the first few hours are and is objectively boring slog cause it's basically a drawn out on rail tutorial. After that whole long prologue, the game open up and you have a slew of gadgets and weapon that can even turn you running around and jumping everything using an exo skeleton and hauling refrigerator stacked goods.

Since this is a port of course you have to talk about how well does it run in PC, much like MGS V port this game runs flawlessly even with my none RTX Graphic Card on very high. The game barely have any hickups at all although there are some frame dips and I also crash two times out of the 40 Hours i spent playing as of writing. The game runs and looks better than on the PS4 Pro who would have thunk?

The game is an amazing ride, a breath of fresh air on open world games. It is far from perfect but for what it is and I damn fing enjoyed it.",1595065492,1595066879,TRUE,3,0,0.542168677,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,283,22,2661,0,2628,1599728935,,
94,DEATH STRANDING,72798836,english,"pros:
.) amazing nature graphics. seriously astonishing
.) fantastic soundtrack, although you will barely ever hear it
.) interesting mechanics while hiking/delivering packages. it's surprisingly fun to just wander around and take in the beautiful environment
.) building bridges, placing generators or ladders for other players is really cool. often you will benefit from other players going the extra mile to make your life a little easier. it feels quite rewarding to give back to the community by helping them too

cons:
.) combat blows. melee is the worst thing since moldy bread.
.) you barely get to hear the soundtrack
.) invisible enemies sound horror inducing on paper but translate poorly into this game. it takes away 100% of the fun of charting a route only to learn that it's not only difficult to navigate but also littered with invisible enemies that will ruin your packages and annoy you. it's not horror, it's not fear inducing, it's just very very annoying.
.) the human models are beyond uncanny. don't get me wrong, it's really interesting how much work was put into it and they look almost perfect, but something is just so off about them.
.) character names are the silliest thing ever. actually feels like a very young child thought them up. impossible to take anyone called ""die-hard-man"" serious.
.) way too much redundant, terrible dialogue. you will frequently hear the same explanations from up to four different npcs following each other immediately. I REALLY understood that unlocking new areas will allow me to craft new gear the first time, thank you. (by far not the only example, sadly)
.) product placement. this might sound like a small thing but it's not only immersion breaking but also extremely stupid. almost every person on the planet has died but by some kind of miracle the monster energy factories survived and somehow managed to not only distribute pristine cans throughout the planet but also create water flasks that turn toxic rain into monster energy. not even a joke, this is a mechanic. every sip you take to replenish stamina reminds you that you're drinking monster energy. many cutscenes have carefully picked camera angles to show monster energy cans. it's just really stupid.
.) arbitrarily chosen ""skip"" functionality in scenes. sometimes a scene can be skipped only to see the exact same cutscene a minute later, this time it's unskippable though.
.) annoying pins from other players. idk if you can turn that off, I haven't bothered to check. it's nothing gamebreaking, it's just annoying to see dozens of smiley-emote-pins littered around the map while you're trying to escape from a soul-eating, invisible, umbilical-cord-tethered angel monster.
.) weird nature sometimes. it's established quite early that the exact route you have to take has been traveled by a convoy of heavy machinery, armored vehicles and infantry. yet sometimes there is no possible path with a small bike, forcing you to go on foot. I don't mind going on foot sometimes but I do mind this to not make any sense whatsoever

from what I could tell so far, the story was interesting enough and extremely out-there. very daring and pretty cool actually. sadly I don't feel like continuing since the rest is just kind of ""egh"".

if you REALLY want to try it out, wait for a sale. I'd kinda prefer to refund it.

EDIT: apparently the frustration in the earlier stages of the game are intentional and it gets much better later on. apparently it's done so you feel the frustration and get to experience as things get easier with practice. I will likely get myself back into it to see if this is true.
if it is, I would probably still not recommend it because I absolutely hate this concept. things should get easier by you becoming better at the game and forcing frustration to only alleviate it later on is like punching you in the gut really hard because ""it will feel real nice once the pain subsides""

0,DEATH STRANDING,72884948,english,"I had watched a lot of content creators talking about how they disliked this game on PS4 launch and so I avoided it. After playing it for myself on the PC release, I am enjoying it. The asynchronous multiplayer is something I find very interesting and I like looking for creations from players that I recognize throughout my journey. 

The mechanics of the gameplay I have experienced so far (the traveling, structure creation and maintenance, and cargo management) feel great. There are a few weird spots where you feel like you should be climbing on a rock or you want to move a rope you are climbing on and the game takes a second to understand what you're doing, but it never gets to the point of ""bugginess."" I have not experienced much of the combat, but it seems that the game lets you play to avoid combat if you want to and that is my plan for the time being. 

I am finding the story interesting, and it drives me to want to play more of the main story missions. I haven't progressed enough to see the end of the game but with it being a Kojima game, my expectations are that it is going to be an elusive story with lots of extra reading required. 

This seems to be an amazing port as well. My game has run smoothly without any issues at all. For the issues that I have read from other users, Steam and the Death Stranding folks are issuing patches regularly, including beta patches, to address small issues on hardware such as Ultra Wide displays and controller inputs.

Bottom line: This game has already been on sale on PS4, and it will be on sale on Steam at some point in the future. I wanted to play this game right now and I wanted it on my PC, so I bought it at full price and I'm happy with my purchase.

1,DEATH STRANDING,72770113,english,"Well after playing more, I will say the best part of this game is to help other players deliver / build. The whole game encourages you to do this.

Yes it sounds silly at first, but now I understand why I feel satisfied even though this game's task structure is simple..
I will give my kudo to Hideo Kojima for this.
I think if you have warm heart and like to help other people in real life, you will probably like this game.

------

I will be honest: this game's story telling is not as good as some other (good) games. If you are looking for something like TLOU1 or GTA5 (or MGS), you may be disappointed.

But [b]to me[/b] it is fun to play (mostly because of the details in the game, and the different style and design of the game compared to others)

I think I will recommend this game to:
- the ones who like Hideo Kojima's works
- the ones who like Japanese-made games
- the ones who like cryptic stories
- the ones who like in-game jokes and references
- the ones who like finding details in game
- the ones who like relaxing in game
- the ones who just want to try something different
- [b]the ones who have warm hearts[/b]

Basically this game has:
- Hideo Kojima's style and feeling
- Nice scenery and good taste of music (traditional)
- Superb internationalization & localization
- Looks boring but somewhat fun (and satisfied) gameplay
- A cryptic but still interesting settings

Note about gameplay: A lot of people feel this game's boring when they watch others playing, but somehow people who played it feel it still fun enough. My take on this is that this game's delivery missions and tasks are all built around [b]""helping people"", ""making connection with people""[/b]. All the interactions are from this single type of activities. [b]It's kinda like the real world -- it is not quite satisfied (and fun) to just watch someone helping others all the time, but you will feel satisfied and meaningful if you do the helping by yourself.[/b]
The point of this game is that you ""play"" it, not trying to get something from it (and you shouldn't rely on games to ""educate"" someone anyways).

Also, this game is not like Call of Duty, which you can just rush to the target and make quick kills. It's quite slow-paced. I think it is really good for relaxing.
(But for all the character animations, it grasps the pace, looks natural, but is not making too long to annoy players)

--------

Personally, I treat this game as a ""donation"" to Hideo Kojima. I actually bought 3 copies (1 PC, 2 PS4 in US and Japan) and have played PS4 version before. It's not the best game I have played (even not as good as the previous Kojima's works), but I don't really care that much -- This is the first game Kojima was kicked out of [strike]KONAMI[/strike]KONASHIT. I understand how hard it is to make a game in such a situation ([b]in Japan[/b]). I even think he knows he cannot create another MGS from nothing, so he just chose a simple concept and polished that. If it was me as a game designer in such a situation I would probably do the same thing.

Love it so far (~33 hours in) but it's definitely not a game for a broader range of people.

If you've played Hideo Kojimas's earlier games such as the Metal Gear series you kind of know what kind of complexity the story and gameplay will offer. And also at the same time what kind of humor and easter eggs are involved.

Graphics:
Awesome! Great attention to smaller details. The facial animations can sometimes seem a bit stiff but the whole game is beautifully made.

Story:
Complex but good, although maybe a bit far out there for many people.

Gameplay:
Ok, how the hell do you say this in a good way? You deliver packages. And it's somehow fun and engaging.
And also you hide from ghosts.
No but seriously, the gameplay loop seems pretty lame the first hours but it grows steadily and you unlock loads of accessories and stuff along the way, and it's done in a smooth fashion to blend nicely with the story.
You should not buy this and expect an action game. There is action and excitement, but the major gameplay and feeling is more about travelling and managing to get where you want with as little problems as possible along the way.

Controls:
I've only played with a controller so far and it felt natural from the first moment.
It's smooth but a some actions require many steps to pull off.

Issues:
I have only one issue. The Xbox One controller (and many other controllers according to forums) gives off unintended inputs. Quite annoying if it happens at a bad moment.
You can combat this by unplug/replug the controller while in game and not touch the KB/M after that. Seems to be something interfering between them.

Other:
The game goes a long way for you to to get the ""feelings"" of the moment. Love it.

Online:
it puts a big emphasis on helping each other out online, which is a pretty neat feauture. Although I'm one of those who often plays Single Player and offline, I really enjoy the MP-aspect here.
You never actually see the other players but you can help each other by delivering packages and using the items placed in the world. You can also remove these from your own world if you don't want them there but they actually make you feel connected to your fellow delivery comrades and the game also keeps telling you when people use your stuff, so you feel you're helping others too.
The game can be cruel, so it always feels nice to give and receive some help but so far I've never seen any kind of exploiting or something that ruins the game. The online aspect is very well made.

I bought it for the full price.

But thats not the only thing, the encounters with BTs are nerve wracking Hideo did a great job making those encounters excellent leaving you with a feeling of acomplishment that you survived.

it might be repetitive and times but its not repetitive just for being repetitive is more grindy then repetitive, also it keeps it fresh with every new ""location"" that you find theres no copy and paste actors all of them have original lines and all of them have a story to tell.

The world building of death stranding is something that no other game has you talk to so many people and all of them have their specific views on the Death Stranding.

If you are tired of the same fps game or you are looking for an experience you will remember for a long time, dont think about it and buy it. if you are just looking for a game that you dont want to put too much thought into and just ""turn your brain off and play"" you wont like this game. the messages that it gives are great and this is a game that i hope it shows more game designers to take risks and to not limit their creativity.

The story here is unlike any other game ive played and though the Gameplay may not always be for everyone the story is a masterpiece. I can easily say that this game is a 9/10 for the story and soundtrack alone, the visuals really bring it all together though.

This game also creates a community between the players unlike any other game. Any of the items you place in the world can used by others that are connected to your character. The game also tells you when others utilize them. The one issue with this system is that you cant directly connect to your friends, which hopefully is added at somepoint.

The main issue that stops this game from being a 10/10 for me is the overall physics system. Most of the time it works well but when it comes to vehicles, i cannot overstate how much i hate them. The way that vehicles interact with the environment make it feel like they where an afterthought or at least under-developed. 

It would seem that a majority of the day one issues and crashes have been ironed out as well, on day one i really only had 2 crashes and after the first patch i have not crashed once.

I have to say at that time it did look boring. But i decided to start watching a playthrough to see the real meat and potatoes of the game. Needless to say the beginning of the game made me stop watching the playthrough because the story and music hooked me. 
     Flash forward to release day on pc i started watching PC reviews because PC ports are usually botched or poorly optimized. I mean i love Red Dead but it does not render very well. At least on my average pc (ryzen 5 2600, 16gb ddr4 ram, amd rx580 8gb vram) But i have to say this game set to very high does run at 60fps at 1920x1080 and i have been enjoying it immensely. 
     Yes, you are delivering packages. But it is more than walking around. You have to manage the weight, you have to pick your route, you have to decide if you can take a side delivery, and plan for finding lost cargo. There is a huge crafting factor where you can build buildings and rodes, steal trucks from mules, find a trike in the middle of nowhere, there is stealth and hiding when you get into an area of BT's, and much more. I will be honest though, that stuff starts around 10 hours in so there is a little bit of grinding at the first but if you enjoy Kojima storytelling you will enjoy this game.
     Again i can't believe how competent this port is and i have to commend 505 for doing such a good job. I have had no glitches, no pop in problems and its just refreshing that we (pc players) got a competent port.

The feeling of building useful structures in remote locations so that another player's game will not be so fraught is unlike anything I have experienced in a game before. You suffer and you work and the benefits are the likes from other postmen.
The game continually rewards you for helping others. People are kind, complimentary and supportive. This makes you feel valued for completing what appear to be menial delivery tasks.

The story I have yet to comprehend but it is classic Kojima in it's melodrama, philosophical subtext and outright ridiculousness.

I never thought that I'd ever play any simulator in my life as the genre never interested me. However, Death Stranding had a deep story that kept me engaged, characters who I wanted to see succeed, and a world I wanted to explore.

To my surprise, I found delivering cargo quite entertaining in many moments of the game. Sure, carrying fragile cargo and being limited to walking might suck, but the game doesn't force you to do that often and allows the player to have some action, be it with the BTs, MULEs (essentially bandits), or Cliff's encounters. Boss fights weren't too difficult but showed some amazing artistic design.

Graphics were amazing, animation looked fantastic (all thanks to the motion capture), and the lighting felt right. 

Overall, a great game to play if you love a deep story and an added bonus if you love the actors who star in it!",1595018986,1595018986,TRUE,1,0,0.504132271,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,76,9,2522,0,2522,1595018389,,

On a visual perspective, it's just amazing to see the different areas that you get to explore, how detailed the environment is and this could be because I ran this with DLSS enabled but it's quite a spectacle to behold. 

Overall if you want a game that is going to challenge you both in thought and gameplay, then this game is for you.

69,DEATH STRANDING,72859006,english,"I will update this review as I continue through the game.

I don’t generally write reviews on Steam, but this game has been exceptional so far in almost every regard and I feel it is worth the effort.  Many traditional forms of entertainment I feel are now stifled of creativity; cookie cut-out movies and movies are pumped out with absolutely no thread of originality in any of them. Death Stranding has the courage to be different and it is courage which will polarise people. There is criticism of this game online; some have described it as a ‘walking simulator’. I would argue that these people, whilst entitled to their opinion, fundamentally miss the point of this game. 

Death Stranding follows the character Sam as he helps to rebuild a broken nation by delivering vital supplies between outposts and cities. Herein lies a huge difference in how Death Stranding approaches the concept of ‘difficulty’; whereas there are mountains of games that pile on harder monsters with increasingly bigger health bars, or vast arrays of enemies that must be shot to death (interestingly, nobody claims that the Battlefield series is a ‘gun simulator’ because of this), Death Stranding places the very challenge of the game in the environment itself. The environment is tough; traversing this game is incredibly difficult for a whole host of reasons that I won’t list here. Other players can gradually make improvements to the environment in order to make it more accessible eg. by building bridges. In this way, Death Stranding achieves something which is quite rare in the gaming community – it promotes altruism. Your efforts to bring the various communities of a broken nation together also helps other players, as they in turn help you. Despite the bleak overtones of Death Stranding, the ability to literally ‘build bridges’ and come together gave me a sense of hope and purposefulness whilst playing this game - a poignant message in 2020. 

The difficulty placed in the environment makes challenging deliveries and progression (for example, access to the motorbike) all the more rewarding. Elsewhere, the game is absolutely stunning and the environment is beautiful. I love being on delivery and seeing a massive ridge ahead of me and thinking ‘how am I going to traverse that?’ or seeing a fast flowing river and thinking ‘how will I be able ford this?’. The vivacity of the environment interplays with the gameplay very well. The soundtrack is superb as well; when a song starts playing and you’re on delivery the game becomes almost meditative. It’s a fantastic experience. There are also some quirky features (eg. if you take a pee outside, a mushroom grows) which are a really nice touch.  

When I saw this become available on Steam, I’m not going to lie I gasped at the price tag. My expectations were extremely high because of that price tag. Let me say this – there is no video game that has ever been made, that is like this. I’m engrossed in every second of it so far. I can’t recommend this enough to anyone and everyone.

83,DEATH STRANDING,72856395,english,"To call this game tedious would be doing it a disservice, but it's a REALLY slow burn, at least for me. The game seems to relish in putting just [i]one[/i] more obstacle in your way throughout your journey, be it the package-eroding timefall, rough and steep terrain, delivery-crazed MULEs hellbent on taking your lunch money (and your cargo), and spooky ghosts that are only deterred by the bodily fluids of a man crazed enough to throw them around inside grenades. At times, Death Stranding is a metaphorical (and occasionally literal) uphill battle that takes me from an otherwise peaceful walking/jogging session to a tense, curse-riddled crawl while delivering 2-3x Sam's body weight. And yet, somehow, I still come out the other side feeling accomplished, if just a little. 

In my opinion, learning to finesse your way around the terrain, utilizing other players' signs and left-behind equipment, and generally taking a moment to plan and think ahead is an absolute necessity if you plan to enjoy Death Stranding- sprinting at a breakneck pace from one goal to the next is a surefire way to have a bad time. A lot of the fun for me in Death Stranding has admittedly been self-generated: I don't find much fun in being cornered in a timefall-drenched forest by BTs (those spooky ghosts) with little-to-no equipment to get me out, but I did find fun in planning, screwing up, and screaming my way out of the situation by the skin of my teeth. It's difficult to get a good feel for good tactics from the beginning, but with practice I've found my footing and have really started enjoying the game. 

A word of warning, however- as narrative-based as Death Stranding is, the first hour(s) are absolutely saturated in jargon, iffy character motivation, and generally awkward (arguably cringe-worthy) writing. There's a story buried inside Death Stranding, but it feels like peeling back a particularly strong onion, crying included (but that's just an allergic reaction).

At some points it feels more like the demo that the frostbite engine or AMD people would give you to showcase their graphics.  Everything is BEAUTIFUL, but the physics and gameplay are just off.  Furthermore, there is very little to let you know how the intricate gamplay actually works.  There are menus with 100s of hints (which is impossible to navigate productively) but none really tell you anything.  Its a shame someone spent all that time writing stuff but didnt actually tell us anything.   I want to know how my objects affect the multiverse.  I want to know which signs are getting hits.  Telling me Mr. XYZ liked ""my sign"" isnt really helpful.

Summary of issues
-The vehicle physics is waaay off.  
        *Its hard to use any jumps because you never know where you will land
        +cars/bikes get stuck too easily and there is no way to rock them out
-Button layout and menu progress is annoying and unnecessary 
     *you have to go through like 5 menus to get to the save game
      *layouts are not intuitive and one wrong click can undo all the 15 checkboxes you had to spend 5 mins setting up for 
          cargo management
-Combat feels like they started to add it but then got rushed and said ""F"" it lets just go with what we got. 
     *There is one combat key, ""V"" which is impossible to hit using normal awsd movement.  yes. i know i can remap it
     *the mouse left and right click are used for balance AND using weapons so you cant really manage both at once which is FRUSTRATING.
-Delivery of loads.
    *This i think is the most shameful thing they have done.  Every time you deliver a load you get a message from the client.  THis is just a random message. THey end up repeating after 2 or three runs and they, much of the time, say things that are totally out of context with the reality of the game.  If i just dropped off a load 2 seconds ago- Dont tell me how great it is to see me again like i have been gone forever.   This is one of the main parts of the game and since they thought it was acceptable to get rid of all the other normal game aspects- they needed to nail this. I were Kojima, I would be embarrassed by this.  It really seems lazy.



THere are many more little things that will start to bother you when you play this game.  WIth the absence of pretty much any action you will find little else to do but get annoyed at the things that dont work.    This would have served better as a movie than a videogame.  Its a shame,  with a little more combat and a couple of refinements this could have been an AWESOME game.

- Encountered the same bug multiple times now: Infinite loading between area switches/cutscenes. Restarting the game did nothing, restarting the PC helped so far in the end.

- Using a controller reduces my framerate considerably compared to not having one connected. Considering a controller is nearly mandatory that's a bug that should be fixed asap.

- Got serious frame skipping from time to time, no clue if it's related to Denuvo but I wouldn't be surprised.

- Music is playing too rarely and there is no way to change the frequency or even play the ingame songs like you would expect from a game with such a great soundtrack.

- Controlls with mouse + keyboard are horrible, but I guess that was to be expected.

- Button assignment for the controller can't be changed. It's 2020 Kojima! Layout is mostly fine, but I would really like to switch the scan button for example - but not possible in this PC game.

With an all star cast of Norman Reedus, Mads Mikkelson and Guillermo del Toro (Unfortunately just his body and not his beautiful voice) you go on a post apocalyptic journey following the role of a Australia Post delivery driver fighting through Paranormal weather that includes Rain (Time Fall) that accelerates the rate of aging of anything it touches  and ""Bridged Things"" (BT'S). A paranormal enemy that causes events known as ""Void Outs"" which are essentially explosions with the power of a small atomic bomb. They arrived during the event known as the ""Death Stranding"" and arrived from the ""Beach"". A place where death meets life.

Your overall goal in this post apocalyptic age is to ""Reconnect society through strands via the Chiral network"". An advanced internet like network that uses the beach and Chiral energy to transmit data and messages with 0 latency and hopefully rebuild the USA into the United Cities of America with a side hussle of delivering packages 

If you were confused reading that BASIC summary and thrown off by it then you've probably never played a Hideo Kojima game lmao. (Dw, I'm just as confused as you are) but it shouldn't throw you off from buying this game. 

It's just a beautiful world with photo realistic environments and facial animations, quite  relaxing gameplay features but not slow enough to become boring and also dense controls and features but not overly complicated where you need to feel like a rocket scientist to understand how to play.

In short.... It's a Hideo Kojima game. Just buy it to experience it.

5,DEATH STRANDING,72833785,english,"I am literally stranded in this game.. I have walked so much in just 7 hours, that my hand fingers hurt..
I don't know what to do next very clearly, or where to go.. That's as stranded as I would wanna get..!

Let me start by saying this will not appeal to the people who crave action like in Witcher 3, Dying Light, Assassins Creed, Batman type RPG Games. This is not an Action RPG (ARPG). It is a WALKING SIMULATION (First time I heard of this term though). Beautiful world, beautiful graphics, slow & tiring gameplay for me atleast..

I had presumed it would have some action at some point of time, but the action in this game is not about fighting hordes of enemies & using your abilities to traverse worlds like Cirilla Fiona Elen Riannon (better known as Ciri by Geralt et al).. The action in this game is to flee from dire & life threatening situations.
That's what a PORTER will do.. he will not carry a gun / sword / arcane magic / dragonfire etc.. He is a Porter.. not a Tele-Porter (even he wouldn't have them either.. well except arcane magic, but.. yeah.. you get the point)

I was not aware of what this game would actually end up like and am not enjoying this game as much as I wanted to, but now i am playing this game with no presumptions & just trying to enjoy it the way Hideo Kojima meant it to be (like i have a choice now, i already paid full money for it & now i cannot refund it, but that is my bad..)

All in all, do not expect action packed Ragnarok fights etc. Most of the time you will be walking or riding on a bike, making deliveries & trying to escape whatever is trying to kill you. Hope you are able to Re-build America..!

I will try to find your LADDER in the game... You try to find mine...

10,DEATH STRANDING,72828223,english,"Hideo Kojima's Death Stranding is one of the most interesting and fun games I have played in 2020 and I wholeheartedly recommend this to you who is considering on purchasing it.

Story wise without going in-depth, the game has a pretty well written story that while complex I found pretty intriguing and has an excellent soundtrack that goes with it.

Gameplay wise you will mostly be delivering packages while trying maintaining their condition throughout your travels, the more mint your packages is, the higher rating you will attain, quite like MGSV's system of grading your performance after missions.

The process of transporting your cargo is not as boring as mainstream reviewers tend to exaggerate, as you progress the story you get more equipment to help you better transport your cargo and you can even create ziplines to help not only you, but other players traverse the world easier, making deliveries smoother for everybody.

This game has alot of emphasis on helping each other out, both story and online wise, and it feels really fun and fulfilling to build and contribute to the dozens of buildings players have created.

Objects you place around the world, I.E postboxes (to store cargo), ladders, generators can be seen by other players playing as well, provided they have unlocked the specific object during their playtime, and can be utilized by them, objects can also be ""liked"" in order to show appreciation, you can ""like"" as many times as you want within a set period of seconds if you would like to show how much you appreciated that player's contribution, as you progress and unlock different materials, you can obtain these materials from various means in order to craft various tools you can use or repairing degraded buildings placed by players.

Cargo you or another player has lost will show up in each other's world, allowing you to help them deliver it to its intended destination should you wish to, this also allows you to also gain likes from delivering cargo and at the same time help a fellow player out, if you are not able to deliver it either, you can always drop it off at a postbox or safe area for another player to help you, help him get the job done.

Should you have too much equipment or materials, you can always donate it to a shared inventory space where other players can take and utilize the equipment you donated, you can also gain likes from doing this.

Though combat isn't a frequent thing unless you actively seek it, you will slowly get more options to tackle dangerous scenarios as you progress the story, from lethal to non-lethal weaponry, combat is extremely fun and relaxing, it will be very familiar to those who have played MGSV, the game very slowly opens up to giving you your first ""gun"" and you will understand why if you play, I do not wish to spoil anything for you.

Speaking of MGSV, for people who have played it, many elements of Death Stranding borrows from MGSV, like the Map, UI and even the way controls feel (Keyboard+Mouse).

This is a game I highly recommend anybody to try, I had so much fun playing it and I feel that you would too!",1594971529,1594980153,TRUE,3,0,0.545454562,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,120,13,4432,0,2639,1595496582,,

53,DEATH STRANDING,72825905,english,WTH Hideo. This Kojima fellow took an awesome game engine and made a crazy mess of a story with unintuitive menus and illogical and impossible physics. If I was any one of these big name producers and or actors in the game I would have raised serious questions. I can't believe they pulled Lindsay Wagner into this. Her bionic hearing should have alerted her to the BS when reading the story and script. Another really dumb thing that people don't mention is one foot step for Porter Bridges somehow is 1 mile on your map. You walk for 12-15mins and you almost halfway across the USA? Every part of this game is either crazy or illogical. The vehicles are crap. There is only 1 RL motorcycle like the one in the game and that is a dud. No one would ever make a truck like the one in the game. That is total fail for off road. You have weapons made from you own poop and pee lol. Its like a satire joke of the video game world and Kojima is laughing all the way to the bank. He probably said to his inner circle.

57,DEATH STRANDING,72825380,english,"Short Review: The Mandalorian but you're delivering packages instead of bounties in a horror setting.
Long Review:
The Good:
This game gives you a lot of freedom to solve a simple problem of getting something to where it needs to be. 
The atmosphere is fantastic. The base game play feels very smooth and rewarding. Combat feels like a jumbled mess early on until you know how to prepare for it and it felt like a big accomplishment getting the rhythm down for dealing with the human enemies as well as the ghosts. I have not had any major technical issues besides some server connection problems that have already been ironed out and can run the game at 144 fps at 1080. Vehicles and equipment feels like something important you need to take care of when you're just starting out on low resources. 
The Bad: 
The cut scenes kind of drag on at the start and the story feels a little flat till you know more about the setting, but the gameplay is what sold me. 
The Amazing:
Finding important or key areas to place certain structures can result in little communities or meeting areas forming around it where you can leave messages for the other players passing through.

This is not a quick action game you pick up and play through at break-neck pace. The game heavily rewards preparation and steadiness instead of break-neck speed (Except on the missions that require it but you're given some warning).

Death Stranding is the latest addition to Kojima's famous arsenal and is another masterpiece crafted with love and - whatever drugs Kojima is usually on. That said DS is definitely a game you should pick up. You play as Theoden King of Rohan's lookalike, who has retired to become a UPS Delivery person. Money has now been rendered useless and your performance is evaluated by how many Facebook Likes you received for each successful delivery. DS includes your typical everyday things like time shifting rainstorms, invisible skinwalker hel*beasts, lots of strange floating dudes, interdimensional magic space fetuses you strap to your chest and plug into with an HDMI cable, nuclear exploding corpses, etc. You make deliveries throughout Post Apocalyptic USA while eating bugs and trying not to lose your balance and getting a damage claim. UPS has also issued you a magic canteen that synthesizes Monster Energy Drink for you whenever it comes into contact with water... Yeah that's legit lol. The scenery is absolutely gorgeous and the soundtrack is fantastic. The characters and writing are all unique and memorable and the world Kojima has smoked - built is one that you'll keep coming back to. If that's not enough, you have full ""science"" team who enthusiastically monitors and collects your bathwater/bodily excretions and provide you with magic poop grenades (your own) to fight off the invisible monsters.  Definitely recommend the full Kojima experience. I give it 10 interdimensional magic space fetuses out of 10. Would throw poop grenades at my enemies again.

Not to mention ghost zombies swallowing you whole and throwing your ass down a ravine where you end up having to pelt the fuckers with grenades. Nothings gets the adrenaline going like having a semi peaceful hike where the only worry is keeping your spine from slipping a disk. Then out of nowhere you get pinged by an enemy scanner. Next thing you know some dudes pull up in an SUV ready to snatch that amazon prime order off your back. You find yourself ditching the cargo in a hole just so you can go rambo, choke out 3 dudes with a paracord then beat the living shit out of the last few because fuck stealth. 

So far the games been far from a walking simulator. Unless its simulating post apocalyptic Detroit, then Sure.

I've sunk alittle over 16 hours into the game since it dropped on PC and i cant fuckin stop. I dropped Tarkov and Cod for this game and so far I haven't wanted to stop. 

And apparently you get your hands on an assault rifle at some point so there's that.

I say give this game a go. It dosent suffer from the kojima ""over convoluted story"" syndrome. It seems like allot at first but it explains enough of it fairly well.

the first hour and a half was beautiful.
but i barely have played the game yet because the majority of the intro is cut scenes.
and then once i actually did get into the game I couldnt be bothered to play it because whenever music plays in the game they put an ""info popup"" for the song almost basically in the center of your screen which stays there for the entire duration of the song. and its completely jarring to have it there because you are forced to have it almost smack dab in the middle of your field of vison instead of having it off to the side or even a corner. 
It distracts from the ambience and the atmosphere of the game and it completey breaks the immersion and ruins the hard work of the developers.

Untill an option is made to turn off these stupid music watermarks or atleast move them to the corner of the screen I cant recommend this game because you wont be able to enjoy it as intended.

13,DEATH STRANDING,72817147,english,"So then, This game. This controversial game. I am currently playing through it on pc however I have extended experience with the game on Ps4 pro and well what can I say. 

I guess I better start by saying the usual - This isn't your next Metal Gear. This isn't your next Zone of Enders. What this is however, Is it's own thing and this thing is catering to a specific type of person. Gamer or not if you aren't of the mindset and life experience to appreciate the higher/deeper experience/Story this game provides then you will bounce off it hard and probably walk away hating the game - and you know what - That's fine this isn't for you and whilst I am a Kojima fan I wouldn't say this is his strongest work. Continue on to expand on what I mean.

The story is nonsensical at times with quite alot of frustratingly unanswered questions left open, whether on purpose, language/translation, or just the writing. However, if you can relate (like serious spoilers) [spoiler] to Cliff as a father, or to Sam as a child or in the shoes of any of the side (and superbly written) characters  [/spoiler] then I feel you will get it. Long short without spoilers - Family, friends and relationships are addressed here as well as Human needs, wants and values at our core. However the main story, can leave you half full.

Gameplay again, I will say it first up when the combat against human enemies happens whilst mostly non lethal is quite enjoyable and impactful. Classic Kojima feels. However I cant say the same for the BTs, the other enemies in the game. I hate and always have hated the encounters. They at times feel as though they were added in such frequency and number to pad the game out at times despite the huge amount of content and deliveries to do. Yes you can craft weapons and such to combat them, however I'm at the point where mashing the shakeoff button works wonders and I can continue on my travels.

So is it another life experience thing then?, do the BTs represent people/relationships trying to slow us down, drag us down and stop us from succeeding so we become as they are?. *ponders*

The rest of the gameplay is a nice loop of rewards and deliveries. Helping other players, being helped etc. However this is optional as is most stuff, however building infrastructure ultimately helps you in the end as much as everyone else.

Graphics - Im blessed with the ability to play at 60+ at 4k everything on max without DLSS. I had to use Nvidia inspector to change the Anisotropic filtering to 16x to get sharpness and clarity on ingame textures. I also forced a better form of AA in the inspector too. Your needs and wants will vary but for the most part the game is gorgeous with enough options to keep fiddlers and gamers happy. 

Also the environments. Holy balls. I havn't been to Iceland/New Zealand/Ireland but I certainly feel like I have now.

Audio - Voice acting is great. What do you expect from proper actors?! :). The music, regardless of how people feel about the game I feel as though most people will agree that the music - Licensed and environmental by Ludvig Forssell is as close to perfect for this kind of game with these themes as you can get. If you're a human with emotions and relate to the characters you will get destroyed late game so get ready for some deep breaths and some tears. Legit.

If any of the above sounds good to you, then you may have a good time. However do realise this is a different type of ""game"". Please do yourself a favour and watch gameplay videos on Youtube for a better understanding and to get a feel of what you'll be in for and if you come back, Welcome.

A dawn we're bound to
Watch that star die

Every single day
I'll wait, and soon
We're stranded on the beach
In our dream
We part too soon
But in our lies
There's a truth to find
The end is new
A tomorrow we must reach for

Despite the great performances by the actors, the best character in this game is the world.  Its a dynamic world that can be structured by the whims of you and other players. some of these include:
- Placing a ladder to climb a cliff, or cross a river.
- Placing a climbing rope to safely decent steep slopes or cliffs.
- Building a shelter near dangerous areas
- Contributing resources to building a road system
- Leaving a vehicle at the edges of difficult terrain for other players to use after crossing through it.
- Marking upcoming dangers or paths with signs
- Simply walking in the same path repeatedly will make a path.

All of these things can show up in other players worlds, and other players structures/additions will show up in yours which can lead to moments where you're incredible grateful to some unknown stranger for easing your route, and moments where you're notified that 100s of other players have used one of your ladders and really liked it!

I dig it, but it isn't a varied experience with random events and NPC's with full schedules and lives living in the world, because they're not able to do so, so don't go thinking this is a Skyrim type open world, it's much more linear and to the point, but since it's focused on the main plot and not a bunch of side quests and little differences that can occur, the story really comes together nicely and feels more fleshed out than any specific elder scrolls plot I've had the joy of playing through. There's combat and threats between each goal, and there's a lot of back and fourth if you're like me and want 5 stars with each ""city"" and individual hold, but I would actually suggest most people just play straight through and just make enough deliveries to get crucial equipment upgrades for mountain deliveries.

Keep on keeping on!

At first glance this is much like a cinematic cut-scene game. However as you dive deeper into Sam's story you begin to realize this is not a game, it is a piece of ART. The emotions I have felt while ""walking"" dug deep into who I have become on this life long journey.
 Have I become a lost soul digging and moving along with the tide when the world is falling apart? or am I truly a soul looking for a reason to stay on this forsaken Earth. 
Death Stranding is a game that sits above AAA standards and try's something new. 
Something different
Something daring
Something that people don't try to understand. 
Something personal.
Death Stranding receives my utmost support, 12 hours in I still am yet to get tired of ""walking"".

95,DEATH STRANDING,72807399,english,"Beautiful game.. mostly peaceful if you learn to avoid the hostiles. A rare trait if you ask me.. and something that is commendable. For me, this game works best in small doses.. I quickly grew tired of it on prolonged sessions, but maybe that's because I'm used to more action driven games.. I just commended it for being peaceful is played right remember? So I think it is a breath of fresh air.

Some things worthy of note though.. you need to read a lot. Not necessarily a bad thing.. but if you're not, you'll probably miss out on a lot of things.. things that will help explain the game for you. On the other hand, the game quickly throws jargon on you, without explaining any of it.. and to me, that breaks the game a bit. Since you'd have to dig up information for it. I'm guessing that less patient people will walk away because of it.. I blame the more recent games for this, that literally spoon feed people with information that would make absolutely no sense in a more serious situation. Imagine meeting a person whom explains everything when you meet them? ;) (they do exists)

Anyway, give it a bit of time, and put some effort into it.. it will grow on many people I think. I won't say most.. because I know most simply don't have that patience. I think that goes for critics as well.. but I won't dive in to that. (as a general rule.. if critics hate it.. it is probably worth checking out.. especially movies)

The graphics looks really good, but in this case I'd expect no less.. one word of warning.. If you have nVidia studio drivers.. you probably want to exchange that with the latest game drivers. Those contain fixes for the game made by nVidia. Maybe the Studio version will too.. but those are not updated as regularly as the game drivers. The reason is that the geometry (and I won't be too technical here) contain something that can be referred to as ""corrupted"" vertices. What this means is that you get polygons stretching out all over the place. I have a good guess what is going on here.. but I won't get into it. Just use the game drivers instead, and all should be fine.

I recommend this game... it is slow... not very scary (in fact I find the ""monsters"" uninteresting, boring, and I try to avoid them as much as possible) but for me that's a good thing.. I'm not too interested in scare games. I've so far enjoyed the rest of the game. I could have waited to give my impressions until I had finished it.. but given my play in small doses approach... it would be too long.

On it's first release I only watched it' walktrough, but now I can enjoy it myself.Even though I know how the story goes it doesn't alter a bit of the enjoyment it gives when I play it. I loved everything about this game, the story, the characters, voiceover, graphics, soundtrack, gameplay, beautiful sceneries, and the ending. The gameplay is great in my opinion, it has a relaxed, but also tense atmosphere in different points, the way it conects other players even though this game is singleplyer has a nice touch to the game. For me this gameplay is very fitting, Il ike to go and explore and deliver packages from point to point, I even spend some time to deliver packages from other players just to be able to see more progress on my character and through the world. Another great thing about this game is the heavenly soundtrack that is used, it is really emotional and when you pass through a tough expedition it is nice to hear a song to relieve some of the tension that you went. The story is well writen and well played by the actors. At first it might be a bit confusing and migth not catch you up, but it gets better and better as it goes by. Having great actors playing the characters of the story is another plus for me, I mean seeing 2 of my favorites actor Norman Reedus and Mads. This game has some really good graphics and one thing that surprised me is the low requirements that it has for them, I mean I thought that I would need to lower the settings to get the game running, but I can easily play it with no problems at high settings, so I can enjoy the game as it was meant. 
I waited to write the review because I wanted to test it first, and all I can say is that it gave me a great impression about it: the mechanics (center balancing, weather conditions) work good, giving a bit of a challenge when controling your character. The keyboard input and controls are easy to use and well thinked, I played a bit with the photo mode and helps you get some great screenshots using it. 
At the end all I can say is that this game has been ported to Pc very well, it is fun to play it and keeps you hooked to it more and more as you progress through it. Keep on keeping on!

13,DEATH STRANDING,72804851,english,"Writing this review with a bit of hindsight since I played the PS4 release to completion before.

Death Stranding is undeniably the most unique feeling game I've played in probably the past decade. It experiments with lots of ideas but the core of the gameplay is delivering stuff from point A to B and figuring out the most optimal way to do it. It's backed up by an interesting definitely-Hideo-Kojima story to say the least and it's really immersive. There's a lot of depth to the game's world and lore if you actually go and look up about it, and while some things may definitely seem random at first, there's an explanation for everything and I think it did a pretty good job wrapping things up by the end.

Also one really unique thing about it is that helping other players is a big deal. Most stuff you do are rewarded with Likes and there's loads of ways to play the game. You can go all out and focus on building the best roads if you wish and there's no defined order for doing stuff, save for maybe the early game (which lasts quite a while) and the main story progressing missions. I don't think any other game's really tried this kind of overall system before where you can complete other people's orders for them and where your and others' actions affect gameplay on the overworld. It's probably the closest thing to a singleplayer MMO one can get, and it does it in a subtle non-intrusive way for the most part (if the constant sign spam annoys you, you can turn off the multiplayer features you don't like, as well).

That being said I think the weakest points of the game are probably some of the boss battles and the combat system isn't really well suited for handling lots of weapons and cargo at the same time. The AI could also be a bit more challenging, but so far on the PC version there is a new ""Very Hard"" difficulty level and it's definitely been tougher than playing the game on Normal before. Still I wouldn't play the game for the combat or if you're looking for anything similar to MGS. Death Stranding is mostly a chill game about looking at nice scenery and thinking about the best way to deliver thing X, while enjoying a cinematic story. It DOES take skill plotting the optimal routes though and it requires a fair amount of thinking and micromanagement, especially if you want to commit to say, building a zipline network through mountains. Myself I ended up liking the gameplay quite a bit, so far to do most of of the optional deliveries as well, and I think the overall control scheme for managing your balance and weight is pretty smart once you get used to it.

Also the PC version is well optimized and looks fantastic. Likely one of the best looking games I've ever played. Even my 3 year old desktop with a Ryzen 5 1600 3.2 Ghz and a Nvidia 1070 GTX could run it at 2560x1440 at nearly max settings no problem (I only dropped shadow resolution to medium). There's lots of graphics options to tweak as well.

I have about 150 hours in the PS4 release with the platinum trophy. I adore this game. It's so weird and so beautiful. It is what Kojima can do when that leach, Konami, isn't involved.

I hear a lot of people call this game a mail-man simulator; this is analogous to calling Batman an orphan -- it might be true, but there's so much more to be said.

This game has wonderful stealth sections that offer some unique strategizing opportunities. There are some really interesting combat sections with surprisingly fluid controls. 

There is legitimate strategy to carrying items. I won't give things away, but how high or where you carry things affects how successful you'll be.

The story is absolutely gripping and thought provoking. I won't go into it, but you absolutely should.

I'll update this later with some port-specific information, but 3 hours in I'm having no issues on a Ryzen 5 3600 and AMD RX580. Ultra-wide is gorgeous. I didn't know what I was missing!

37,DEATH STRANDING,72801281,english,"I'm in love with Death Stranding. The story (so far, I'm 24hrs in), subtext and sociopolitical commentary is phenomenal. 

As I follow the history of the game-world through the interviews and data that's discoverable during play, I find myself immersed in this broken and torn up world. It's an interesting experience to play as Sam, a singular guy doing his best at making deliveries and connecting people in a world that puts extensive pressure on the people living in it.

Gameplay... Sure it isn't for everyone. I understand why many people find it 'boring' because it's less of a game and more of an experiential journey. Personally, I find it fantastic. At it's core, it is without a doubt a walking simulator with inventory management. However, combined with the world you find yourself exploring, it becomes a brilliant and cathartic experience as you struggle to traverse the world and overcome the obstacles the world throws in our direction. Whether that be terrain, lack of materials, harsh weather or the fear of death. The resilience of our protagonist, Sam and the constant reminder to ""keep on keeping on"" just adds to the feeling that I get from this game, it feels good to help and do your part.

The core goal of the game is to deliver cargo, connecting people and society back together. Though this is mostly a singleplayer experience, the interaction with other players further adds to the 'togetherness' feeling that's required to help create a better future. Doing that by building utilities, bridges and roads is awesome. Another player is requesting a bridge to cross a ravine? Well, we've got the resources at hand, or maybe in a nearby postbox so let's help out. That bridge will be useful for you, but for so many other players as well. Instead of seeing it as some passing by co-op interaction, it's a way that people (in the form of players and NPC's) come together to improve the broken world they live in and you can feel good knowing you're sharing and doing what you can to help.

As a game, it's not much and anyone that thinks they're in for an awesome pure 'gaming' experience may find themselves disappointed. If you're willing to slow down, travel long and arduous journeys on foot, taking in a vast world by reading into the context that's provided through data entries, you may appreciate the experience that Death Stranding offers. 

If you're on the fence on whether or not to buy, first consider whether you will enjoy the gameplay. If you're still interested, I'd say if you can suspend your disbelief and immerse yourself as Sam in this tough world, you'll thoroughly enjoy yourself.

I recommend you all to play this game at your own pace and don't rush it. Enjoy the view and understand it's little mechanics of gameplay.

A sign they wrote that encourages you to smile, a storage box blasting Khalid across an empty field, a power station that saves your butt when you're ready to turn back and give up.

That their Sam is just around the bend ahead of you and maybe if you hurry, you could catch a glimpse of him and trade notes about the monsters chasing everyone.

8,DEATH STRANDING,72785790,english,"Describing the game and actually playing it are 2 different things. On paper it sounds like a boring delivery sim with a weird plot. But the game is really good with making every small issue into a minigame. Crossing a river? in any other game you just hold up on the joystick, but here its an entire issue you need to solve. First you scan the river; is it deep? Looks like it. Now you have some options to consider: i could drop a ladder over it and balance across. I can make it a big project and build a bridge over it so future deliveries are easier. I could just jump in and paddle my way to the other side, but upset my bb. Maybe i go down the river and try to find a spot where its not as deep. 

This is how pretty much every decision will go.

Not to mention you will have bad guys on the lookout to steal your stuff, weird ink monster ghosts who wanna drown you in ink and then put you up against a dolphin squid boss fight (yes im serious), or just plain old rain except its called timefall and touching rain rapidly ages anything including your cargo.

This game is incredible in making every trip an ordeal. Everything you usually ignore in other games you have to pay attention to. Random rocks in the path are something you have to actually pay attention to, jumping steep cliffs wont break your legs, but they will screw up your packages or trip you up making you drop everything. 

You have to know what path you wanna travel and how the weather will be, is it gonna rain? maybe take a detour. 
Maybe the delivery is large and heavy, consider taking a motorcycle with you or string some carriers behind you. Or just be an absolute chad and carry the entire thing on your back.

I dont know who i can recommend this game to, but i really enjoyed my time so far. Its such a personal experience and is so different to modern AAA titles that i dont know if i enjoy it for being unique or for because its genuinely fun.

[h1] SUMMARY[/h1]
So far I have not really found much to complain about with this game. I did not expect to like this game given what I had heard, but man am I glad I gave it a try. Now I am hooked. This game is amazing for so many reasons. A lot of things that I would have normally put as a con for other games actually work in this games favor. The game feels really slow at first which seems like it should be a con, but after progressing in the game a bit, the clunky movement and mechanics in the beginning only feed into the satisfaction of getting a new tool, improving your stats, or creating a path. Basically the game starts out really shitty and annoying and you build up quality of life improvements over the course of the game giving you a satisfying feeling of progression. I look forward to exploring the world further and seeing the rest of the story. I've been playing about 15 hours and I feel like I have barely scratched the surface of all this game has to offer.",1594903121,1594903247,TRUE,2,0,0.506172836,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,328,2,3365,0,909,1597566263,,

35,DEATH STRANDING,72752133,english,"Here are my thoughts about this game.

Death Stranding is definitely not everyone's cup of tea, because it's a slow burning game, but it is at its best for the walking simulator genre and Hideo Kojima know how to make this genre so damn good and intresting than any other walking simulator game out there and especially if you love Kojima's story telling. Below i will give you my thoughts on the pros and cons!

Pros:
-Game is really an eye candy

-The world is great

-Gamplay is good

-Story is great

-Enemy AI are good and boss fights are fun

-All of the actors did a great job playing their characters

Cons:
-Audio Settings! Why can I not adjust the volume of music, ambience etc.? Not that it's a big issues or anything, but it would be a nice touch if they would include this option in an update later on.

-I was expecting the controls with Mouse & Keyboard to be better than using a controller, but i find it pretty frustrating to play with them even after I changed all the keybinds to my liking. I use a DS4 controler after 2 hours of playing with M&K and I actually don't mind it. I find it even more enjoyable using a controller even though I don't usually play with it unless they are fighting games and non-shooter games. I guess this game is just made to be played with a controller.

I'm recommending this game if you guys like great story and especially if you guys are a big fan of Hideo Kojima's past games!",1594846312,1594895446,TRUE,2,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,39,15,1723,129,931,1601988674,,

41,DEATH STRANDING,72778708,english,"I can tell you that only 22 hours in and i have fallen in love with this game. The fact people have described it as a walking sim or just playing as a postman put me off but god damn it Kojima you've done it again. The game itself is so difficult to explain as it does require a lot of patience, a lot of walking, but then there is horror elements as well as pretty amazing stealth and combat and the atmosphere, o god the atmosphere just brings it all together. As you'd expect with Kojima there is a deep deep compelling story that keeps you driving on full of mystery, symbolism and at every turn leaves you wanting more answers. The game might not be for everyone but if it is for you, do not miss out on this experience. Ive honestly not played a game that has sucked me in and held me like this for over a decade. So many tiny details i can't mention without ruining any of the story, everything has been thought of. There is a pretty shameless monster energy plug but honestly who gives a fudge if it got this amazing game paid for!!!

I should also mention the graphics are out of this world specially on higher end PC's and for a day one port i have literally encountered no bugs. The only social side of it works like a dream and was such a fantastic idea, even if you prefer to be offline during games i would recommend having it on , you don't have anyone coming in your game just evidence of them around the world.

One final thing the talent in this game is heavenly all the voice acting is perfect, the animations, perfect. I have never been a kojima fan boy but i see now why they exist. I also love to throw in negatives with the positives but the only negative thing i can say about this game is it does require patience for the first chap especially, which isn't so much as a criticism its just a warning if you know for a fact you don't like being methodical.

95,DEATH STRANDING,72772080,english,"To preface: This game is not even close to being for everybody. If you are looking for an action or combat oriented experience, this is not the game for you.

Kojima was not at all kidding when he said Death Stranding was a walking simulator. However, it is quite possibly the only walking simulator that actually simulates walking. If you're still confused about what exactly you do in this game, as I was, you deliver packages on your back in a surreal sci-fi post-apocalypse. For reasons explained by the lore, that I shall not get into for spoiler purposes, the last remnants of humanity are isolated inside of fortified cities, and are unable to leave. Because they are unable to leave, and because planes and drones no longer work, they rely on so-called porters to deliver goods from settlement to settlement by hand. You play as one of these porters.

Almost everything in the game is in some way focused on delivering packages. The story and your character's part in it are a little more grandiose than simply delivering packages, but that is still the foundation upon which everything else is built. A standard mission consists of picking up an order at a settlement, arranging the goods on your back and on your suit in the most organized way so that you don't tip over from the weight, plotting a course to the place you have to walk to, and then walking there. This may sound very basic and boring, but the game does a surprisingly good job at making traversal a challenge that is just as interesting and engaging as combat.

The terrain is incredibly rough, and you will need the help of various tools to get to where you're going without damaging the goods. There are also two types of enemies that can get in your path: crazed bandit types who will try to steal your packages, and invisible enemies that can completely ruin cargo, and need to be stealthed around using a sort of marco polo mechanic, where the mechanical doo-hicky on your shoulder points to where the enemies are. The invisible enemies only come out in the rain, which damages your cargo due to story reasons; so it creates an interesting dynamic of trying to escape them as soon as possible to get out of the rain, while also not rushing through it and getting caught by them. 

On top of all this, there is a pseudo-multiplayer mechanic. You can place useful structures in the world to be used by yourself and other players, and you can use things placed by other people. You will also find various lost bits of cargo in the world that you can deliver for bonuses. Some of these lost packages will be randomly generated by the game, and some of them will be left behind by other real players. It's also possible to leave packages at safehouses for other players to finish the delivery, and you can pick up things left by other players and finish their deliveries too.

Overall, a strange and somewhat divisive premise has lead to what is, in my opinion, an extremely unique and engaging game. This is not even touching upon the story, which has that signature Kojima charm of being completely incomprehensible but also very symbolic and chock full of social commentary. My only major glaring complaint is that there is a baffling Monster Energy Drink product placement. Whenever you rest in a room, there are lovingly rendered cans of Monster on your nightstand. Your canteen in the game also magically converts water into Monster Energy Drink. I wish I was kidding. This is completely shameless, and honestly subtracts quite a bit from the game's artistry, but it's not a big enough deal to warrant getting fussy over.",1594882409,1594882409,TRUE,1355,51,0.960224211,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,141,13,1926,0,560,1596096649,,

You don't just walk anywhere you want, you gotta look carefully on what kind of terrain you are walking on, how many items you are carrying, how those items/cargo placed on you, they all impact how you walk! There's also a lot of route planing, thinking and cargo/equipment management involved with each delivery.  At the beginning of each delivery, you gotta think what kind of tools you wanna bring with you.  There's also combat and stealth on top of the character balance management with horror atmosphere.  

This is not all.  The mechanic of building the world with other players and helping each other on the journey is what makes this game unique and standout.  Often times, after I climb up a steep mountain, I would drop down a rope so others can have an easier way to get up here.  Every time someone uses the tools I left behind, knowing that I could help is really heart warming.  And there's way more than just little ropes and ladders.  You can even build big projects like bridges, and other players can even help you build it together!  It makes this solo delivery experience not lonely at all.  Cuz I know that doesn't matter how harsh the environment is, we are in it together to reconnect humanity.

77,DEATH STRANDING,72764022,english,"I played this game on PS4, so I can attest to how this game plays and what it entails.

This game definitely has a slow start. The tutorial pretty much ends around the end of chapter 3, then you'll get to have a lot more fun with it.

It's pretty much a hiking simulator, with Kojima elements added to it: Like shooting, horror, convuluted fucking story. I still recommend this game if you want to go about a chill time just walking for hours on end.

The story is confusing, and kind of dumb at times, but the characters can really deliver once you actually get into it... Near the end of the game. With how the lore of this game's world is, you don't actually get to interact with other characters much, until the end where it piles on an insane amount of story. After I actually did the last action, it took me 2 god damn hours to get to the final scene. Kojima really likes putting in movies in his game

The soundtrack is amazing, that's pretty much all I can say about it.

The gameplay is hit or miss. You like it, or you don't. That being said, if you don't like the initial gameplay, you might like it further into the game. Unfortuantely, the gameplay only REALLY gets good 10-15 hours in. So if you play that much and don't like it, then you still gotta play more to see. With steam's 2 hour refund policy, you might not get to enjoy anything if the gameplay doesn't get you right off the bat. The gameplay is nice for me, and gets even better further into the game, so I recommend it based on that.

The bugs for this game? I haven't really seen any. I've seen other users have bugs that cause them to not be able to enjoy the game, but from what I've played so far I've encountered nothing. So that's also a hit or miss.

I run the game at a native 1440P resolution @60FPS. I limited my FPS by choice since I stream to my living room TV via Steam Link which tops out at 60hz and even through the stream it's been solid. Although I don't get to experience the game at the full 1440p since I use the Steam Link, I do get a really great 1080p supersampling effect on my 4K TV. I played before installing the latest Nvidia driver so things might even run better for me now. I wish I could take advantage of the HDR but since I'm playing through the Steam Link I can't.

I play the game with a PS4 controller and I've really enjoyed how smooth the game feels on the controller. The only thing I'm a little upset at is that I can't set the BB to talk through my PS4 controller speaker. Maybe this will be added in the future or someone will figure out how to do it but for now I'll live with it. If I run into any issues I'll make sure to update but so far the game is smooth and beautiful.

The game is the definition of a fetch quest, set over a visually stunning environment.

The game has been ported well, with native widescreen support, without lettorboxing, and makes use of NVIDIA's DLSS feature, though no support for RTX or HDR currently, despite the game being perfectly suited for both features.

The graphics are great, sound is amazing, gameplay is great, each time i feel it getting repetitive a new mechanic is introduced, the story is by far the best part and this game constantly has me on my toes and wanting to learn more about this strange world. Your character ""sam"" is kind of a sour puss but learning more about him and playing as him is very fun and exciting. Overall this game is a 10/10 for me, I have yet to feel a bored aspect of it and i'm over 7 hours and haven't even scratched the surface of this massive game. There is so much that doesn't make sense but so much to learn.
Like I said in the beginning, I hated this game before I played it but I wanted to give it a chance so I took all those feelings of hate and just an over all bad attitude towards this game and tossed them out the window when I pressed the play button, going into this game not wanting to hate it is the ideal mindset to have when playing this because this game is not for everyone.

You will like this game if: you have strong feelings to wanting to learn lore and information about a new world, like fantasy books, love open world games, want a game different from any other game you ever played, a graphical enthusiast, open to new mechanics of gameplay.
You will hate this game if: You need constant action, do not like story driven games, hate learning about the game world, skip every cut scene to get to the game play, if you cannot shoot something in the first few hours of playing the game (took me 5 hours to get a bola gun, non lethal), hate side quests, are not a patient person.
if you do buy this game please do what I did and go into this game with a willingness to like this game, not the ""ill just refund it if i dont like the first 10 minutes attitude""

It has an addictive gameplay loop.

The story/lore is deep, interesting, and wholly unique. It's one of the few games where I don't skip the cutscenes because of how enthralled I am in the world and story.

The performances from the actors is phenomenal. 

The art style reminds me a lot of the works of Junji Ito/Lovecraft.

All in all I highly recommend this game to anyone who is interested/a fan of Kojima.

This game is longwinded, like much of Kojima's work, but in my opinion it's about on par with MGS4 in terms of gameplay-to-exposition ratio, and has all the eccentricities you'd expect from Kojima, for some (understandably) that's a turn off, but I've come to love that writing style, sometime since I first played MGS. The more important comparison between DS and MGS4, in my opinion, though, is that it doesn't feel as forced, or fatigued as it did in MGS4. He's allowed himself to express a new theme, untethered from what must have come to feel like an extremely oppressive canon. 

Ultimately, it is, as everyone has said, a walking simulator, but for whatever reason, I actually enjoy this one, and I haven't really gotten immersed into a walking sim since Firewatch, when it launched.

81,DEATH STRANDING,72753335,english,"Over the past year or so while waiting for Death Stranding to be released for PC, I'd read basically nothing but negative reviews about how boring the game is and how ""Kojima bought into his own hype"" and so on. I don't know what that quote is supposed to mean as he pretty much just makes the kind of game he's always made so I don't think hype really enters the picture.

Although I read enough reviews to kind of get the gist of what the game was about, I never watched gameplay videos or anything so didn't know what to expect pretty much at all. The first hour or so was FAIRLY BORING but it picks up quickly as more and more mechanics and ""things to do"" are introduced in the early game.

The plot is very ""Kojima"", ie: nonsensical and sometimes cringeworthy. Character names like ""Die-Hardman"" just make me roll my eyes but some Engrish can be forgiven in a game that is otherwise very original and deep (gameplay-wise). I came away from my first 6 hours thinking this would have made one of the best sci-fi films ever produced if it were properly edited, but as a game it's fairly lackluster.

A lot of the plot elements are quite unique and original (on the surface... they do of course draw inspiration from numerous books and films that Kojima is a fan of) which makes the game pretty refreshing. That said after viewing something like 8 LONG cutscenes of pretty irrelevant dialogue in the first couple of hours, I found myself skipping the dialogue which is usually one of the parts of a game I enjoy the most. Not a good sign for someone like me who really gets into lore.

That said, I think that all of Kojima's games are a necessity for people who enjoy the more artistic aspect of game development. To me he's akin to directors like Wong Kar-Wai and Ingmar Bergman... most average people hate their films but they're so important to the history of cinema that it'd be a very different world without them.

After playing the PS4 version, I can say I most enjoyed the teamwork mechanics such as the use of structures and signs for warnings. With how stamina and item management are so crucial, it's nice to find a bunker someone placed along the route to take a rest and regain your bearings. The ""likes"" system is addicting (as social media invented it to be) and it heavily encourages players to place structures and warnings in ideal locations to receive likes for character progression.

As for the port, the game runs smoothly for the most part and having so many options for resolution is appreciated. I'm glad HDR is also present in the port.

So don't forget to take your climbing anchors, ladder, PCC, and go explore the beauty of Hideo Kojima's masterpiece of a brand new world with a company of our lovely grumpy Sam Porter and BB.

Highly recommended 10/10.

28,DEATH STRANDING,72747436,english,"This game is ABSOLUTELY STUNNING!

If you are on the edge of buying the game, here is my input:

Hideo Kojima is a fantastic story teller. I was roped into the game as soon as I played the first few seconds of the game. From the amount I have played when writing this review it hasn't been crazy action packed but there have been so many really great moments of stress, relief, anxiety and calm. It makes you appreciate all the little things as well as planning every detail for your next venture. It has a feel that is relaxing, similar to Stardew Valley (Relaxing and can be played for hours), and one simple misstep could change that whole thing into pure panic.

Pros:
-Story Telling
-Cinematics 
-Graphics
-Smooth gameplay 
-UI
-Music
-Capturing Feelings (If you are really into the game)


Cons/Neutral:
-Not as action packed as other games (Which in this case makes perfect sense)
-You can't assume what's going to happen (Sorry if you like to guess everything before it happens)
-Small UI bugs that would make management a tad easier

As of right now it is very hard to write any cons and the ones that are in the list aren't even that bad at all! I have loved this game so far and can't wait to see what lies in store. 

This game is for the patient. If you like to rush into everything then this game might not be for you. Delivering cargo on foot is priority one, and if you can't enjoy the scenery and take a nice stroll then you will have a rough time. Stealth is your best friend. There is a lot I wish I could explain but I can't simply cause it would spoil the game. Just know that if you don't like stealth you are going to get into some nasty situations. 

Conclusion? 

If you are still unsure, you are more than welcome to wait for it to go on sale. It has been out for a while on PS4 so maybe there will be a good sale sometime in the future. If you have the money and you are willing to spend: Give it an hour & a half. Really be interested in seeing where this story and adventure goes. I couldn't sleep very well knowing that there were so many questions I wanted answers to. If you are looking up gameplay and you are watching as many videos as you can to figure out the story then what are you doing?! You are already hooked and curious where the story goes, so why not play it and carve your own path through the story!

Just don't forget to do a good deed to your other peeps and make sure to give and take support where it's needed.

42,DEATH STRANDING,72746124,english,"Let me preface this review by saying I played through this game within 3 days of launch on PS4.

Death Stranding got a lot of hate when it released, some reasonable, some unreasonable but moreso the latter. People gathered the general opinion that a lot of critics had, saying that the game was terribly made, un-fun and a walking simulator, but all of that is wrong, and I'll get into that.

Story - When you think Kojima you think wild stories with wacky humor and insane twists, and this game is him turned up to 1000. This game was designed to connect people and the story itself does a fantastic job conveying that as well. You spend a lot of time traveling from place to place delivering things to people in need to form KNOTS, those KNOTS connect you from city to city across this games version of a post-apocolyptic America, a wasteland housing BT's (otherwordly creatures trying to kill you or anyone they come across), psychodic package snatchers, as well as terrorists trying to harness the power of BT's for their own gain. Your main purpose of connecting these cities while dealing with all those foes is to rebuild America (along with other things that are addressed later in the game), sounds kind of cheesy but the story absolutely nails it and then some.
I'm a big boy, I don't cry at many games I swear it, but man, there were points in this story that made me cry, and not in the sense of ""oh hey lets build up a character that people like and then kill them randomly and destroy someones emotions"" like a lot of games. None of that exists here, it's the story behind some of the characters that genuinely gets to you, like MAMA's character development, anyone that has played this game will tell you MAMA's background was so sad and insanely well written. If you want a story that keeps you entertained, makes you sad when it tries to be sad, makes you laugh when it tries to be funny, and actually destroys your mind when it wants to, this is the game for that, and I love it. Also, this game is long and well worth it's pricetag in cutscenes alone.

Graphics - Hooooly, this game is gorgeous and on PC it shines no matter if you're at default or max, but don't expect options up the ass like in most PC games, although the options that matter are here, and DLSS absolutely shines in this game.  I can't think of a game that does a wasteland so well that it's lively, if that makes sense. You could be walking or driving a vehicle and just stop moving with your jaw dropped at some of the views in this game, or you could be walking through an overgrown open field and feel genuinely at peace (until you get clapped by giant whale BT anyways). This game is beautiful and words can't give it enough credit, it runs like a dream as well.

Gameplay - Here we get to the meat of the complaints, the walking. Honestly if you play your cards right there isn't too much of it, aside from a few mandatory areas and the first few hours of this game. You obtain a bike within the first 3 hours of this game and it changes it completely. You gain the ability to choose whether you want to walk, ride a bike, or drive this games equivalent to an SUV, it makes the traveling a breeze and much faster. I feel like most reviewers didn't even make it a quarter way through the game because they almost never reference the fact that bikes and SUV's are almost always available to you to make this game less walking intensive, along with any player made structures that appear in your world that assist in your travels, or you could assist other players with placement of ladders, ropes and other items of your own. There's a lot of combat in this game as well but not in the general sense, a lot of it is avoidable, like with BT's, you can sneak by them, or if you're a madman you can let them succ you and fight their dad, both are fun and intense and it's done really well. When it comes to the walking itself, it's honestly not bad, and I'm the type of person that can't walk more than 10 feet outside my home without having a mental breakdown wondering where my mouse went and why it's not in my hands. It has it's own uniqueness and fun factor to it, and it can make you tilted when you trip on a ditch causing all your packages to fall down a mountain, so it'll give you a good laugh too, after you get over it that is. All in all you get a bike and if you're as versed in getting up mountains as I am with my horse in Skyrim you don't need to worry too much about walking.

Music - My god, this game absolutely caresses your ears at all times with its beautiful soundtrack, it's so fitting that it seems like the composer and all the groups who made the music for this game were all conjoined twins with Kojima at one point. You could be driving your bike and a song comes on that just makes the entire trip so much more beautiful and enjoyable, or you could genuinely be happy just listening to the soundtrack of this game on YouTube and that says a lot. PS. for some reason a fair bit of the music from this game isn't on the Official soundtrack, like Ludens from Bring me the Horizon, a song from CHVRCHES, and the other groups, I'm assuming it has to do with legal publishing reasons? Not sure, but either way the main soundtrack to this game slaps harder than my dad when I forgot to mow the lawn when I was 14.

Characters - Here's where the game absolutely crushes anything else without even trying. The actors/actresses performances in this game blow you away, Mads Mikkelsen especially, my god any part of the story with him in it were crazy good. Every character in this game is amplified by their Actor in such a way that it just sucks you in and makes you attached to them, no matter how much you love or hate them, you can't say they weren't incredibly voiced. I genuinely believe this game had better acting than most movies that the Oscars have nominated in recent years thanks to the talented actors that probably took up more money in hiring than I'll make in a decade. Best performances in this game compared to any other game I've ever played and it adds so much to the emotions you feel and how involved you get with it.

All in all, I love this game and it was very misrepresented by media outlets that couldn't make it past the first 3 hours where the game picks up speed (and gives you a bike). This game lets you see cooperation and change in a way that can genuinely alter your way of thinking of one another and the things we can do if we work together along with how important that in itself is. If you're like me and don't know if you'd like it due to the fact you heard bad things, play mainly shooters or other genres, I suggest you give it a chance, I did and it's one of, if not my favorite game.

This is my first genuine review so sorry if I didn't make solid points but I did my best, any feedback you have leave a comment and I'll answer any questions about this game I can or correct my review if I made something too confusing.

Sam,
This is Die-Hardman. You're coming up on the ""reviews"" section of the Death Stranding. You can use this to show appreciation or distaste for the experience you had. You're on Valve's network, the largest platform of its kind in America. So keep in mind that whatever you put there will be seen by lots of others, and the connection that your review makes can bring them closer or drive them away. *Static*

I came into this game with little to no expectations and I have to see I am very impressed so far. I find myself stopping frequently just to enjoy the scenery and music that accompanies it. This game is at its core focused on deliveries. The focus behind the deliveries is what brings a real purpose to all that time spent walking. The game is what I expect from someone like Hideo Kojima. What I mean by that is that it's abnormal, to say the least. In a climate of what feels like the same types of games over and over, this game shines through as an example of a developer who wanted to tell a story in a unique way without following a standard format. The style is very reminiscent of his older works in MGS. So, fans of that franchise will notice his touches everywhere. When you come into this game you have to arrive with zero expectations to get the most out of it.

Watching gameplay of this game does not do it justice, its an incredibly different experience to play it vs watch it. I totally understand how someone could watch gameplay and think it looks stupid - but actually playing it yourself is a different matter in my opinion. That said, there are going to be some people who play it and still just really don't mesh with it - this is fine too! But I do think it's worth trying. The first few hours can be especially ""frustrating"" (even though I personally enjoy them), but it's necessary tbh, and the game makes more sense once you hit chapter 3.

I played through this on the PS4 with low expectations and this game blew my mind. Very unique experience, and I think it was easily worth my $60. The story is interesting and entertaining, if a bit redundant and/or cringy at times. But I still enjoyed it. Some may say that it's a ""story focused game"" but I personally found the gameplay to be far more rewarding. The way the themes of the story and the gameplay work together to impart a message left a profound impact on me.

Do note, to run at 60fps you will need a gtx 1060/70+. I have a 970 and it runs ~60fps, but it goes from 45-60 depending on the scene.

60,DEATH STRANDING,72738931,english,"Death Stranding is a very divided game, you will either hate it or love it. I personally have played it numerous times on PS4 since launch and was very excited to see a PC launch due to the high end gaming rig I own. If you own an RTX card, DLSS 2.0 really shines in Death Stranding. 

Death Stranding tells a story about one man, Sam, who along with other porters is working to help keep a divided America connected through the delivery of parcels. Sometimes it is a collectible figurine for the Luden's Fan and other times it could be sperm and eggs to help with human reproduction. After you make your delivery in the intro mission, you soon learn that there is more to Sam than being a simple delivery man in a disconnected world. 

The story is full of many twists and turn, true to the typical Kojima fashion, and can become a bit convoluted at times. I recommend a second playthrough to really start piecing more of the story together or even watching some clips online, it is interesting playing the game again with a fresh perspective. 

The game can start off slow but really starts to shine about 3-4 hours in, this is if you follow main story progression and do not try to get Wind Farm to 5 stars as quickly as possible so you never have to visit again. 

If you are on the fence on purchasing Death Stranding, with a $60 USD price tag, I would recommend watching some reviews on the game. The one review I have come across that really shows the game and what Kojima was going for, without pandering to Kojima fandom, is from Girlfriend Reviews. I recommend checking out the review and seeing for yourself if wondering a post-apocalypse America and trying to unite it is something you can enjoy.

62,DEATH STRANDING,72742655,english,"After wasting 8 hours on this garbage, The Evil Within has been bumped to second place for the worst game I've ever played. Hideo Kojima is no genius; in fact, after my experience with MGSV and then this game, I'm convinced his head is so far up his own ass he's getting high on his own farts like the people that drive hybrids in South Park. Someone needs to tell him ""no"" and stop enabling his bullsh*t.

The main gameplay element, ferrying packages while traversing a world designed to prevent you from going straight from point A to point B, is infuriating. I wasn't able to place a single ladder or anchor point because it was ""outside permitted construction area."" What? Climbing is often broken, with Sam stumbling and falling for no reason, even while standing still. Think vehicles will make things easier? Not a chance, because they get stuck on everything. A small rock that Sam can easily step over will bring a vehicle to a dead stop, but it can climb steep 45 degree slopes without tipping backwards with the weight of the packages. I guess center of gravity only applies to Sam.

The characters, and their performances, are just terrible. Fragile is fragile, but not that fragile. What a clever play on words, almost missed the subtlety there. Die-Hardman is hard to kill, did you get it? If you didn't, well, they're going to explain why, so don't worry if the subtlety is too difficult for you to grasp. There isn't a single character I didn't almost immediately dislike. All the acting talent in this game is utterly wasted by bottom-of-the-barrel direction.

The storytelling is lazy and self-indulgent. The constant expositional dialogue is abysmal. Hey, Sam, this is your mother, here's her first name in case you forgot, but the first thing she says to you is ""I know you hate me"" so I guess we're saying all this for the player's sake. Yep, I get it, Sam doesn't like being touched, you don't have to bring up and explain aphenphosmphobia in every conversation. Or Higgs explaining the Higgs boson, which is just so, so subtle I would have missed it. What I wouldn't mind being explained is the ridiculous number of terms and acronyms. DOOMS? Q-pid? They just chuck things at you and hope you'll stick around long enough to have them explained. Guess I'll never know, because I'm out.

It feels like it has been a long wait for this game since I watched a bit of it on the playstation. Glad I picked it up and glad that I will be sinking some long hours into this game.

I have ran into a few bugs since it is day one. Mostly getting stuck in some corners of rocks, but mostly when I try to drop cargo into a postal box someone puts down it goes into a endless connecting online loop. I waited a few minutes the times its happened but ended up having to Alt+F4 it.

64,DEATH STRANDING,72680135,english,"Does Truck Simulator but mostly on foot, in the apocalypse, with intricate cargo management, a healthy dose of bizarre storytelling and a sprinkle of third person shooter combat sound appealing to you?
You'll probably enjoy this.

Okay, maybe the actual gameplay isn't that similar to Truck Simulator but boil it down to the very core gameplay, and they're the same game. You deliver cargo from one location to another. That's it. First and foremost this is a game about delivering packages, mostly on foot.

Understanding this and knowing what to expect going in is the key to enjoying Death Stranding. Most of the negative reviews are going to come from people who are disappointed with what the game is. People who feel that the developers set themselves up for failure with cryptic trailers that showed little to no gameplay, leaving us to speculate from the breadcrumbs they left us. 

Because of this, setting the right expectations is important. This game isn't going to be for everyone.

This is a different kind of game. It's going to take patience to get anywhere. Combat and any action is only secondary to the bulk of the game, a ploy to spice up the gameplay at times. So if you're looking for an action adventure game this isn't it. There are bossfights and general moments of combat or suspense, but 90% of the gameplay is traversing the expansive and beautiful environments of the world of Death Stranding, as well as creating structures to aid in that traversal. If you play online, these structures also bleed into other players' worlds where they can give you likes should they find them helpful.

That's not to say the game is exempt from any criticism. Even if you know what you're getting into when you boot up the game, a lot of the complaints people have are valid. The pacing could be better, the story relies on heavy exposition and the game takes a while to really open up, to name a few.

Still, if you find the game's premise intriguing, I wholeheartedly recommend it regardless of any shortcomings it may otherwise have. 

Death Stranding has these Zen-like moments where it's just you, your cargo (and the supernatural baby you've got strapped to your body) trekking up the mountains, you're cresting a hill overlooking the town below as an eerily fitting song from Low Roar starts playing... Those moments are absolutely wonderful and exactly the reason why I love the game so much. The slow pace and the struggle to get anywhere pays off time after time.

This is very much a game that you need to play for yourself before you can fully judge it. Of course you're free to say that this isn't for you, or that it sounds boring. A lot of people are probably going to feel that way.

Just know that, in my opinion, moments like the one I just mentioned don't translate well into video format. And that they are the reason this was my GOTY of 2019. The difference between experiencing them through another person, and being totally absorbed in the moment when playing it yourself is like night and day.

Playing this game is a truly unique experience, and in a video game landscape where AAA developers are getting more and more flak for sticking to the same old formulas, Death Stranding is a breath of fresh air that I felt was sorely needed.


To finish off, here's the tip every newcomer should always be given before playing:
Focus on the story quests to begin with. Don't spend hours doing every little sidequest right away or you'll wear yourself out before the game gives you tools to make your life easier. The game opens up a few hours in. After that you're free to do whatever quests you please.

One of the characters will give you a ""tip"" that you can finish up the area you're in before proceeding. Ignore this, you can return to any area in the game more or less whenever you want.

16,DEATH STRANDING,72695792,english,"I've played and finished this game on console but decided to double-dip.

Death Stranding is a beautifully atmospheric, third-person action adventure in which your main task is to deliver cargo in as good condition as possible to isolated bunkers across a post-apocalyptic USA, interestingly stylized after Iceland's landscapes mixed in with sci-fi and supernatural elements.

From the mossy landscape to Sam's suit and the ridiculously tall stack of boxes he can carry on his back, the look of DS's world and art style is strangely memorable and identifiable, despite appearing very desolate and naturalistic much of the time. Rain (""Timefall"") makes everything age faster, plus there are BTs (short for ""Beached Things"", they're ghost-like beings from another dimension) roaming the wild, so people are afraid to even go outside. This gives couriers -- or porters, as they're also called in-game -- great importance in this universe.

It's a world that's become largely uninhabited, and with the exception of rare wandering fellow NPC porters and MULEs (human enemies) which will try to steal your cargo if you come too close to one of their encampments, you'll spend most of the time all by yourself. MGSV -- Kojima's previous and first attempt at directing an open world game -- often was criticized for its environments feeling rather ""empty"" and dull for how big they were. But in the case of Death Stranding, the world feels more dense and detailed and even the slight changes in terrain can affect the moment-to-moment gameplay because of how the movement works. Plus, that sense of loneliness not only fits but also enhances the setting and theme quite nicely. In that sense, Death Stranding has a more well-realized and coherent vision than MGSV.

On your journey, there will be some relief offered by signs and structures shared by other players online, but I'd go as far as to argue that further increases the feeling of solitude and melancholy peacefulness; there's never a ""true"" interaction with another person, only what they've left behind, even if their contributions can be extremely helpful.

The little action and combat there is feels pretty average and serviceable at best, to be honest. While I haven't thoroughly tested the new 'Very Hard' difficulty yet, most boss fights weren't exciting even on 'Hard'; they're just slow in their reactions and animations and they act like damage sponges more than anything.
Instead, DS is first and foremost a game about planning routes, resource management and traversal by vehicle or on-foot with a variety of tools to help the player overcome obstacles in the environment, with a couple of interesting ideas for stealth.

I'm not too interested in analyzing the narrative/plot in a game (also given the fact that most cutscenes and dialogue are easily and quickly skippable in DS, that might be one of the reasons why it clicks with me more than most other narrative-driven games), but nevertheless, there's this short quote from a review which sums up my personal feelings really well:

(Completed this game on the PS4)

During these times, I believe you will be able to draw many similarities between the world of Death Stranding and ours.

You have probably already heard people throw around terms like “walking simulator”, “zero-gameplay” and my personal favorite - “pretentious” regarding this game. In the end, who am I to say that these people are wrong? Death Stranding is certainly one of the most divisive titles of 2019, and when you consider the immense popularity of Hideo Kojima, paired with the revered but cancelled ‘Silent Hills’ game that preceded it, it’s not hard to see why this game was bound to receive both massive praise, and bitter hatred. [b]I am not implying this game bears any resemblance to silent hills; it does not.[/b]

I am not going to spoil anything in this review, so I will not talk about what happens in the game. Besides, I do not feel my experience with the story will reflect what you will experience yourself. What I will say, however, is that Death Stranding was one of the most graphically impressive games I had ever played on the PS4, and seeing this game running on my PC in all it’s glory managed to blow me away again (Or maybe that’s just the exhaust from my PC). The soundtrack is phenomenal and does a great job of connecting the player emotionally to what is unfolding around them. The voice acting is obviously top-notch, and the characters themselves are brought to life with fantastic motion capturing. 

What I cannot deny, however, is the complexity of the story. If there are two words I would use to describe it, it would be “multi-layered”, and like an onion, you must peel back these layers if you are to appreciate the detail and virtuosity in the storytelling at play here. In saying that, I don’t agree with the premise that those who don’t like the game are “too stupid” or don’t appreciate Kojima’s message, I’ve met plenty of other people that loved the story, but hated the game. If you find yourself playing through the game and not understanding a thing, do not feel bad, I think most of us at certain points were wondering what the hell was going on.

Which brings me to my final point – the gameplay. It is frustrating, but not all bad. For the most part, the controls work intuitively enough that you do not quite feel like throwing your controller/keyboard at the screen. I thoroughly enjoyed exploring the landscape and finding the collectibles scattered throughout, and I enjoyed completing the “side-quests”. However, vehicle handling and balance are both equally frustrating, and the combat feels clunky and unrefined.

TL;DR – The game is not for everyone. In the beginning, learning the mechanics will be frustrating, and some design decisions will leave you scratching your head. That aside, the storytelling is captivating, the characters are life-like and relatable, and the visuals are outstanding.",1594822473,1594822520,TRUE,2,0,0.545454562,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,230,42,4145,425,62,1602052820,,

I.. can't even. walking simulator with zombies and fighting off evil seperatist 'nazis'?  what is this 2011?

75,DEATH STRANDING,72729978,english,"Special, but great. (I already played the PS4 version, I just wanted to have the game on Steam)
Some people call this game a walking simulator, and eventho this is what you do most of the time, it is way more then this. Kojimas storytelling and writing is amazing, the voiceacting is great, the cutscenes are are huge part of the game and are amazing and transition into Gameplay well. Eventho some might call the gameplay boring and annoying, I think it's pretty good, since exploring this wonderfully depressing world is great. The world is great, because together with the ""monsters"" and the events happening on it it gives you this feeling of unease, and also the landscapes really just look beautiful. The soundtrack is really good and the way it works with the world kinda reminds me of silent hill. The online feature is useful and a good idea, but I personally don't like playing with it because it kind of ruins the immersion for me. The monsters in this game are really good mostly because most of them lack any special particularities. A gigantic full black monster, even without any real features or just a straight up insisible monster is way more terrifieng then any skeleton or ghoul could ever be and they work really well with the lost depressing world.
I would say that this game is kinda like an interactive movie. 
Should you buy it? Well, if you don't have high patience this game might be boring for you. 
But if you like Kojimas writing, can tolarate some repetative gameplay and like amazing stories in video games, you really should buy this game.

4,DEATH STRANDING,72725524,english,"This game is possibly the hardest game to review, because on paper this game sounds really boring and tedious. But I can assure you, there is something ominously attractive about this game. Not only is it absolutely stunning in terms of visual quality, it also runs incredibly well with mediocre computer hardware. The story (So far) is thrilling, enigmatic and leaves you wanting to delve even deeper into the rich story and excellent cinematography. 

As for the gameplay, it is described as a ""Walking Simulator"" which is simultaneously accurate and dead wrong. You would be surprised how many factors go into ""just walking from point A to point B"", such as.... How many ladders should I bring (Each taking up valuable cargo space)? Will I need to cross through hostile territory? Will I need to cross rivers or large ravines? If I need to go through hostile territory would it be safer to take one large haul and risk not being able to outrun my enemies or should I take 2 separate deliveries which can allow me to run faster and possibly escape losing all my loot? All these and many many more.

The variety of situations you can land yourself in this game are seemingly endless and each decision you make can vastly affect the outcome of your deliveries. This is supported by the games (sometimes overwhelming) incredibly versatile and complex menu systems. Each piece of cargo can be carefully stored in different ways on your body, allowing for maximum efficiency when it comes to carrying large stacks of cargo at once. This also includes the use of vehicles, tools and weapons to take the approach that you want to take. 

All this and I haven't even mentioned that this game has online elements! There is no direct interaction between players, but instead the game utilises a system that allows for player's ladders, postage boxes, climbing ropes and even BRIDGES to carry across each others worlds. If there is a large river in a particular section of the map that is commonly crossed, you can guarantee that the community has collaborated to aid in the construction of a bridge that can allow players to safely cross. You don't see other peoples creations until you reach a specific building in that sector of the map, so the first time you enter an area you are made to adapt using only the tools in your disposal but once you reach the building, you can make use of the player created objects. This makes for easier trips when you have to go back and forth and really brings a sense of collaboration to the game.

Overall, I would highly recommend getting this game. Not only is it amazing from a gameplay perspective, but the story is one hell of a ride that not many other games can give you.

[h1]It doesn't even launch and doesn't even display an error message that would explain why[/h1]

For such a premium priced game, the support for it is a joke.

The devs keep redirecting annoyed users from Steam forums to their website, probably to keep things behind closed doors as an attempt to cover up that they messed up. This would have been fine if they weren't ignoring people who need help. Customer support responses are as generic and as unhelpful as everywhere else and users who run into issues are left to their own devices. Every single response is literally identical - a redirect to the ""Can You Run It?"" website and a request for a dxdiag file, then silence. Wrote 6 messages to them after sending them the dxdiag file and waited for 12 hours - no response whatsoever. Absolute garbage.

One hypothesis among users is that the game doesn't support SSE-architecture processors (which are a standard in household computers), instead requiring AVX processors (usually found in laboratories and professional rigs intended for creative and scientific purposes). However, some users say that they are able to launch DS on SSE processors, and some say that despite having AVX processors, they still can't launch the game, so it might be dubious. This makes things even worse, as the game goes from [i]not-launching-due-to-a-pinpointed-but-hidden-reason[/i] to [i]not-launching-for-no-apparent-reason.[/i]

There are other issues which I couldn't run into due to the above reasons, like graphical glitches involving messy textures and weird physics which also didn't get addressed by 505 Games.

If this doesn't get addressed in the following 48 hours, I am refunding the game and I [b]highly recommend others who have the same issues to do the same[/b]. Developers won't do anything if we don't put pressure on them. Taking away ""their"" money from them is going to hurt.

22,DEATH STRANDING,72723442,english,"To preface this review, Death Stranding was my GOTY for 2019. I put about 80 hours into the PS4 version of the game, a good majority of that time being spent reading the in-game lore notes. I absolutely adore this game. I am, however, incredibly biased, and am prone to overlooking moments of frustration I had while playing it simply because I found the overall package to be a net positive in every department. The question is, will you, potential reader, have the same amount of enjoyment as I did?

To get it out of the way and give you the short answer, no. But that's because I'm an obsessive weirdo. That doesn't mean you shouldn't give the game a chance though. While the initial 4-5 hours of the game are daunting, the gameplay builds upon itself, giving you more tools to work with, making the task of delivering packages easier with every mission you complete. If you allow yourself to engage with the mechanics, you'll find yourself carrying three times the load you should be allowed to, and still delivering well within the allotted time needed for a timed mission. Planning out routes, and executing them all while avoiding terrorists and tar ghosts is exhilarating despite the core gameplay boiling down to UPS routes. Topping it all off, there's a great sense of community, where helping each other out is mutually beneficial to all parties involved. Building structures helps you in the short run, but will have lasting impacts on the world helping other's out in the long run. Helping finish other porters' delivery routes nets them some bonuses as well as helps yourself as well. To go into every single thing that your actions affect for others would take too long, and ruin many of the genuine surprises, so take my word for it that even casually playing is helpful for just about everyone. 

To abruptly come to an end, I have to just reiterate that there's hardly a game like it out there, and is absolutely worth your time.",1594806758,1594806758,TRUE,5,0,0.541666687,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,1918,2,1169,12,427,1601857161,,

It's dark outside. raining. you can't remember what day it is or if anything matters anymore. ""Anything You Need"" by Low Roar comes on as you climb your way up the mountain. All of your problems go away. It's 3AM and you're 16 again, staring at a screen burning your eyes. Death Stranding is not a game. It's an experience. It's staying up late Friday nights and watching Saturday morning cartoons in your pajamas. It's the day you got home and put in COD MW2 for the first time. This experience will not be for everyone, but it is fantastic for me. If you enjoy the thought of drifting away into long useless gameplay of not doing much of anything, and wondering where all the time went, then Death Stranding is for you. I haven't felt this way since the first Mass Effect. Reviews online do not do this game justice. The textures are a bit muddy and my framerate doesn't hit 144fps like I wanted it to, but for some reason I don't care.  I turned off my framerate monitoring software, picked up a controller, and loved every minute of the seven hours i've put into this game so far. This is without a doubt one of the greatest games I have ever played. When my friends aren't online for COD MW I will be playing this without a doubt. Thanks for making this grown man cry from the release of my pain for a few short hours.

70,DEATH STRANDING,72718888,english,"Played and beat the game on PS4 already, double dipped on the PC release. Overall a solid port, with some flaws. Both unique to this new port, as well as baked into the game itself. I highly recommend the game, but one should probably watch gameplay and look into what the game is, as a lot of the game's unique charm can either be incredibly appealing or a huge turnoff depending on the person.

The Good:
-Good mix of lows and highs in action. Walking around and delivering cargo is a very relaxing experience, until raiders and ghosts start giving you trouble.
-Good progression on gear. As you have longer stretches of terrain and higher mountains to deal with, you unlock gear to deal with it at a pretty good rate.
-Good story. Has some of the dumbness Kojima plots are notorious for, but the characters are overall very good, the story is very internally consistent, and it's interesting to see it unfold. For the most part. It's no Metal Gear Solid 3, but it does a great job all the same.
-Very impressive visuals, for the most part. More on that in a bit.
-Incredible soundtrack by Low Roar, CHVRCHES, and Ludvig Forssell. Might cause issues for Youtubers and streamers due to licensed music, but at least it sounds really, really good.
-Nice implementation of asymmetric multiplayer, in that other player's structures can help you out in a pinch, and vice-versa.

The Bad:
-Very, very slow start. Most of the criticism I see are from people who couldn't get past the first couple hours. And I can't really blame them, the game starts on a MASSIVE plot dump, and the gameplay doesn't really pick up until after.
-PC port needs work. It's really good, but far from perfect. Seeing people complain of bugs, and even on my high end PC I got stutters and frame drops. Seeing reports of crashes, particularly around the WInd Farm. The Graphics settings are also somewhat unclear (Medium, Default, Ultra High? What does Default setting even do?). A really good start, as far as console ports go, but it needs work.

The ""Hard-to-explain"":
-The walking, and delivery aspects of the game. It's very unique, and has a surprising amount of depth to it. But it's very much a ""you'll either love it or hate it"" sort of thing. I for one loved it, but it's hard to say if anyone else will unless they try it for themselves.
-The grind. Another ""love it or hate it"" aspect integral to the game. A lot of progression is tied to getting Likes, raising your ranking with various outposts by doing deliveries, and grinding up loads of crafting materials by, again, delivering parcels from the overworld. There's also a lot of back and forth, particularly when you try to build a highway. Take the game slow, and you'll have a great time. But if you want nonstop combat and ghost attacks, you'll likely be disappointed.
-Dialogue, and Kojima's penchant for overwriting scenes. Particularly at the start of the game, where characters will beat you over the head with things the player already knows. It gets better, and the characters become a lot more interesting later, but again, the start of the game is where most of the bad parts of the game are abundant.",1594798909,1594799023,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,494,41,1372,0,104,1596340355,,

The first 8 hours is not a slog. This game is a primarily story driven game, and the term ""walking simulator"" is not completely accurate because the movement is a lot more nuanced than you think. You have to balance yourself and scan the path for smooth terrain and plot your route. It is way more involved than just walking. You will have to be stealthy and avoid enemies and decide whether or not to carry extra packages or not.

Helping players is also extremely gratifying. The fact that you can put a rope down a mountain to help other players out from climbing something that took you 15 minutes is so satisfying. This game is all about bringing people together through struggle.

80,DEATH STRANDING,72717924,english,"[h1] A far from perfect game, but if you're in the right mood, the game will take you for quite the ride.  [/h1]

[h1] What I think of the gameplay [/h1]

The story is beautiful and will definitely pull on your heart strings multiple times, but the gameplay loop can be a bit mundane at times.  Many tend to think of this game as a walking simulator, and although I agree that the the times of silence you have between missions can be a bit tedious, they can also be very atmospheric, and can be appreciated at times.  All of the intricate gameplay systems that are in place can add a lot of enjoyment to the game, such as finding vehicles, or setting up transportation across the map, such as building roads or using ziplines to get around the map.  The fun that exists within the game world doesn't immediately present itself, but if you're willing to put in the work, it can be quite the riveting experience.

[h1] What I think of the story [/h1]

I think Death Stranding has the most beautiful and cohesive Kojima story to date.  It's much more difficult to quantify how good the story beats are compared to the gameplay, but if I'm going to be honest, this game had me in tears many times when I played it back on PS4.  This game does an amazing job at giving its small cast of characters very unique personalities, and each of them gets their own time to shine in various quirky ways.  The story can be very confusing to say the least, but if you pay attention to details well, they explain what is happening in the world very clearly.  The mystery behind the Death Stranding itself was a not so stunning revelation, but learning the true intentions behind certain characters and why they act is one of the main appeals of this game's characters to me.

[h1] What I think of the PC port [/h1]

The port itself is less than stellar from a technical standpoint.  It is optimized relatively well, and you can still get a more than acceptable framerate at 1080p, max settings, even with a dated PC like mine, but there are some issues.  Mainly, cutscenes are locked at 60 FPS, and can dip lower, which is very disappointing.  I have a high refresh rate monitor, and it's jarring going from cuttingly smooth gameplay to suddenly seeing the framerate halved at random.  Some of the texture quality can suffer as well, and there is some pop-in, which didn't exist in the PS4 version, and cannot be solved by changing graphics settings on PC.

On a side note, some users have complained about not being able to change sound levels in-game, but for me personally, it's no bother, but still something to keep in mind for those with sensitive ears.

[b] Overall, Death Stranding is an amazing experience, but it's not something that I would personally recommend to someone who isn't already familiar with Kojima's work.  The game is so radically different than anything released to date, and because of that fact, I think that there is some serious intrinsic quality to the game, and it's worth at least trying out if you're tired of the majority of modern triple A releases.

PROS:
-Runs really nice on my super high-end-gaming-rig - 60-75 fps.
-Avatar animations are extremely fluid.
-Music background and songs are well tuned to set the mood - the songs are great.

CONS:
-Graphics - though thee landscapes are well done - ACO, Witcher (other AAA games) beat this game hands-down detailed wise - no ray-tracing - no night/day, painted ground - for a 2020 release RTX cards want to eat superb graphics and in my opinion this game does not deliver it or even close,
-Menus - The are SO confusing - ex: accept a job - takes you to a fabrication menu and no clue how to get out of it to get to a menu where you actually start a mission. (I finally figured it out but it was frustrating as hell). Then you run into other menus that take you to other menus that you loose the objective of the very first menu - totally TOTALLY bad design.
-Story: so far all  I have been doing is running from point A to B to C etc - not even an auto-run option either. You are alone with a baby in a enclosure strapped to your chest who starts crying a lot. 
-Gameplay: This is more of a interactive movie as there are a lot of long cut scenes, then you get to run from point A to B, rinse and repeat.

However, I'm pleasantly surprised to find out that no, it's not a walking simulator, and there's a lot to the game.

You do walk a lot though. That's the base gameplay. Pick up a package, take it somewhere else. What makes it interesting is everything that can go wrong on the way there. The terrain may be more difficult than you expected, and what looked like a straightforward route on the map is blocked by a cliff face you have to figure out how to ascend. You may run into package stealing jerks called MULES or those weird umbilical cord ghost things from the trailers (BTs), who are both dealt with in a very Kojima way - MGS style stealth or overwhelming (nonlethal) violence. I've walked, ran, and fought a lot at this point, and ~12 hours in the game remains interesting.

Oh, right, it's also a Kojima game. If you don't like cutscenes, weird setting specific terminology that's never exactly explained, and exploration of contemporary issues, then you won't like the story side of the game.

13,DEATH STRANDING,72708471,english,"This is a criminally underrated and misunderstood game. When it came out, many called it a ""walking simulator"" and acted as though it had no real depth or complexity. In reality, this couldn't be further from the truth -- strategically planning your routes and trying to safely and smartly navigate the harsh terrain is actually incredibly engaging, fun and rewarding. It may be a ""walking simulator,"" but it's easily the most tactical and mechanically deep walking sim ever made. The game offers a ton of different tools and gadgets you can use to keep the game fresh, and has an incredibly unique multiplayer system where the items you place also show up for other players. You can build and contribute to other player's bridges and highways; the entire game is essentially a collaborative effort to turn a ruined world back into civilization. If this wasn't good enough, the game also has really intense horror stealth segments with the BTs, and more conventional stealth straight out of Metal Gear with the Mule outposts.

The story itself isn't perfect, but it [i]is[/i] incredibly unique, ambitious, and prophetic. Since the outbreak of COVID, a world where people rely entirely on UPS and are afraid to go outside suddenly makes a lot more sense. This game has a lot to say about isolation, social media, society, and video games in general. While most video games are about combat and competition, Death Stranding is about connecting with others, contributing to a community, and working together towards a common goal. This is not a game about making yourself stronger; it's a game about improving the world around you. The sheer ambition of the story [i]does[/i] cause some issues overall though, as the narrative sometimes suffers from weird convoluted logic and plot holes. If you can bear with the absurdity, you'll find a lot to enjoy, and a lot to think about.

Overall, if you're interested in the core concept, this is a fantastic port and the game is absolutely worth full price.

For real tho, I've been losing interest in gaming over the past year, partly maybe because new games released are often times reincarnations of old classics that have been evolving the monotone way. HOWEVER, I have not for a long time had a game that has hooked me so much instantly. I played like 9 hours straight after buying it so rip my sleep schedule.

Look, it sounds really boring and I believe it can be boring for certain people. It's basically a glorified walking simulator with a story behind it. But there is a lot more behind that boring concept, trust me. It's not worth explaining it because it's rather complex and a lot more fun when you experience it yourself.

In short terms: You are a courier who brings stuff from A to B to C and back in a post-apocalyptic world with dangers. You have to balance out your load, think when and where to store it and plan your routes over different terrain depending on the amount of stuff your fat ass is hauling.

I've only gotten a few hours in so I prolly have just scratched the surface. There are minor annoyances like my mouse cursor keeps clipping in even tho I have a controller connected or not being able to play the epic soundtrack on command. HOWEVER I think the last bit is done on purpose I'm sure and I'm not gonna hold it against it.

That being said. The whole setting and scenery is epic. The terrain flows beautifully into each other and as a hiking enthusiast the whole planning and hauling is actually just epic. There is different terrain, so far having seen beaches, grassy landscapes, rocky mountains and a DENSE forest. You can indirectly interact with other players and do so many little things that make you appreciate it a whole lot more. The first hour into the game feels like a damn movie it's so epic. You may be walking the same route 10 times or 20 times but you always get to discover new ways to go over the terrain and leave behind a ladder for the next player or yourself. And as you progress you discover new landscapes so it shouldn't get boring.

This comes from someone who isn't biased. I didn't really follow the Death Stranding and only recently realized it gets released on PC soon. It's also the first Hideo Kojima game I've played. 

This review has gotten quite long I'm afraid but I hope I could bring across my first views of the game in the first 9 hours I've played. I will probably look at this again when I finished the game to see if I was as right as I explained it. 
The game was certainly quite expensive (at least for my standards) so you gotta decide yourself if it's worth buying it. If you're not sure first watch a ""before you buy"" or something although I kind of don't suggest that as for this game, in my opinion, watching gameplay and actually playing it are two COMPLETELY different worlds.

26,DEATH STRANDING,72709434,english,"I have around 150 hours on the PS4 version and platinumed it, so you could say that I enjoy the game very much. 

Death Stranding is unlike any game out there. It's a thought provoking scifi world that brings fresh ideas and themes to the table, with a gameplay loop that's extremely satisfying and relaxing. This is one of those games where the more you put into it, the more satisfaction you'll receive. 

The story gripped me from start to finish. It's hard to comprehend how any individual could come up with this game's setting and scenarios it puts you through, how the world and it's story unravels around you. While there are some moments that I felt the writing could've been improved that's about the extent of my complaints with the game. 

The PC port is phenomenal, I expected nothing less from KojiPro after the masterful port that is MGSV. It runs at a constant 60 fps on ultra at 1440p. 

The further you get into Death Stranding the more tools are at your disposal. The start of the game can be very clunky and tedious, but it's done so on purpose so that you appreciate and enjoy how far you've come when you reach the later stages of the game. You are constantly rewarded, constantly given feedback about everything you do. Giving you that satisfaction and being shown and told how well of a job you're doing, by both the characters and real players. 

The online functionality of this game really took me by surprise regarding my enjoyment of it. I became utterly addicted to creating the roads for the players I shared the same world with, reveling in the amount of Likes players gave me. Something about the melancholic world and tone that harmoniously compliments the online infrastructure of DS. For me at least, it helped me appreciate others, strangers. It helped me feel kindness towards strangers. Similar to the message system of Dark Souls, players can leave messages saying a number of things. Most of what I see are motivational messages left by others to keep pushing forward, it's a unique feeling. 

Music and the use of your soundtrack is one of my favorite elements of gaming. If implemented correctly, the right music at the right time can heighten your sense of emotion. Death Stranding understands that completely. Key parts of the story or environment when triggered will start to play a song, mostly from the band Low Roar. Their music fits the world and message of the game so perfectly it almost seems they were created side by side. The original soundtrack is composed beautifully, as expected from masterclass composer Ludvig Forssell who also created MGSV's score. 

There are many moments in Death Stranding that filled me with awe and a sense of serenity I never thought existed in gaming. Death Stranding is one of my favorite games ever created, and in my opinion one of the best scifi worlds filled with such rich lore ever created. It left me in tears, and in love with the story that KojiPro has told. Most importantly, it has helped me appreciate and show kindness towards complete strangers in a world where it's far too easy to forget that you're not the only one living in it.",1594781491,1594781491,TRUE,660,29,0.928349733,25,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,312,36,5270,4,506,1601946902,,

54,DEATH STRANDING,72700660,english,"Let me start with the TL;DR - After beating this game on PS4, I put down the controller, walked over to my computer, and - immediately - purchased this game on steam. 

TL;DR over. So, why purchase this for the computer if I've already beaten it? Was it for the wide screen support? The photomode? No, fuck that shit, those things don't really matter. 

I purchased it because, even if I never complete it on the computer, it is well worth supporting because this game is one of the few original and perfectly executed IPs to come out in recent memory. It's not a recycled CoD/HALO/Counterstrike game. It's an entirely new and unique world, built from the ground up, and fully worthy of AAA status....more so than some of the more recent entries in the aforementioned universes.

In other words: it's innovative and not derivative.

Word of caution, if you've heard anything about the game, most of it will probably be true. There is no multiplayer in the traditional sense - it's more like echoes of online players. It is also mainly a logistics game in the sense you are trying to figure out how to move cargo from point X to point Y while not damaging it/reducing the damage sustained. There are Third person shooter mechanics, but there is also a larger emphasis on clever routing/stealth and a potentially game ending mechanic if you go in guns blazing, and it manages to be suspenseful without an overemphasis on violence. Again, it is the worldbuilding that makes this game exceptional, not any one particular mechanic. 

So be aware of all of that before picking it up. It's a unique experience, but it depends on one allowing oneself to be subsumed into the game.
If you can do that, you will be well rewarded.

Also, the soundtrack is BELLISSIMO

Yes, this game may not be everyone's taste or those who expect this to be MGS, but honestly this is something new and it lives up to the Kojima legacy.
I love playing games with rich story, playing interactive-movies like Beyond Two Souls & Detroit Become Human, and no one would doubt these games have the best directed cutscenes. Death Stranding pushes it to the next level with the use of different camera positioning and panning, perhaps part of the reason is that Kojima san was so wise to have Oscar winning director Guillermo del Toro onboard, who directed my favorite movie Pacific Rim.
Actors definitely play an important role, who could have ask more from actual movie actors like Norman Reedus, Mads Mikkelsen and Léa Seydoux etc??
DS is the ultimate movie-game experience package to date, well balanced around 40% movie & 60% game.
Game is well optimized on day 1, without the help of DLSS2.0 game runs at average 70fps on a 1080Ti @ 3440*1440.
Many people in the game discussion section complaining about the game runs at weird 21:9 resolution, 3360*1440/2500*1080, I mean that little black border on both sides is not that obvious at all, at least way less annoying than the one on a 16:9 resolution.
Full price (SGD$79.9) may not be ideal in some regions around the globe, but Kojima Production has delivered a fine port to PC players, tailor made specific PC options and exclusive contents, I am very satisfy with what I have paid.
DS certainly has the best graphics among others, perhaps Kojima Production should add a benchmark option in the future, like Horizon Zero Dawn did.
Kojima Production (not 505 Games) should also be praised for the decision to have the game available on several storefronts, however with recent news of Sony investment into Epic, there is uncertainty with future PS exclusive games and I hope that my fellow Steam community will send Sony a strong message with me.

The story is jumping all over the place but I assume that's intentional and you're not suppose to understand anything that is happening. It's keeping me curious and engaged with the story, plus there is something surreal about delivering cargo from point A to point B. The music is fantastic as well, and I also like the fact that you're assisting other players and vice versa by constructing things. Just a neat feature, kind of like Dark Souls in a way, where players could leave messages to other players. That feature is also in the game as well. You can construct signs to warn or guide other players. Even the little things like being able to take a shower, use the toilet, customize color schemes, etc. All these things I have found to be somewhat comfortable and sometimes I feel like I'm not really playing a video game at all, but I don't mean that in a bad way. I mean that, it sometimes feels like I'm just a delivery man doing his thing. The game doesn't feel stressful, well it can be at times with the cargo weight limit and loadout, but the game gives the player the option to manage their loadout and the game also rewards you for how good of a delivery you make, which encourages people to do a better job. I enjoy the aspect of the game as well. Feels rewarding when the game gives the player a fair reward for a job well done, and as you level up you'll gain access to higher stats and equipment. 

I'm only on chapter two, but I really wasn't expecting to enjoy the game as much as I am right now.

It is a thoroughly unusual experience about the things you can do to make the experience of other players better, and the satisfaction that comes with it. And the combat gets better too : ) 

Having played this on the PS4, I can say that the PC port is a step up in terms of performance, running at well in excess of 100 FPS at max settings on my mid-range hardware. The graphics are good, especially the downright life-like character models, but it isn't as much of a step up from the console version as it could have been.

The gameplay isn't as in your face as other games and a lot more about traversing interesting environments and following a weird but interesting story. Minute details are here where fast travelling for example makes sense in the lore. It's these sorts of details that I absolutely love in games. 

The combat is surprisingly fun as well, you have multiple options of how to go around a situation some riskier than others. The multiplayer component to the game is super cool as well as you're helping out other porters on your journey with bridges or generators to recharge your vehicles. You can ""like"" other peoples tags on the floor and their builds which gives you a boost to stamina or a boost to your BB's happiness.

There are so many cool things in this game it's difficult to talk about as it's something that should just be experienced. I really recommend picking this up and giving it a go. Be patient for the first few hours, it's very heavy on the story at the beginning and might not make much sense however everything in the cutscenes down to the weird random crying or the odd mechanic with the rain all makes sense overtime and are actually super interesting and unique mechanics.

Granted, there have been a lot of people expressing frustration about some graphical or FPS issues. I, myself have not had any of these issues so maybe I got lucky or something idk.

I'm only in the beginning of Chapter 2, so I can't speak for any deeper mechanics like gunplay and vehicles that come later, but the basic concept of moving along the terrain and keeping balance, holding your breath and sneaking past enemies, etc exceeds my expectations.

With that out of the way this game is something quite unique. Its mesmerizing in a way that isnt boring. Yes, the walking simulator analogies are somewhat accurate in a literal sense but at the same time theres something quite satisfying about it. It will be MANY hours in before you get into any proper combat and the journey to that point can be a bit dull but once youre there the encounters open up the mundane traversal that is the early gameplay. Eventually the traversal does indeed become challenging and an integral part of the gameplay and vehicles and weapons become a thing. The asymetrical multiplayer is quite interesting as your creations appear in the worlds of others and theirs in yours but this is no dark souls. The messages that you can leave for other players are quite frankly pretty stupid and serve no real world purpose. It is fun to leave ladders & ropes to nowhere to troll other players but even thet loses its appeal after all the back tracking.
If you want a game to just relax with and enjoy a somewhat convoluted story without worrying about real in depth gameplay then jump right in. If youre looking for good stealth or action then avoid this title.

19,DEATH STRANDING,72703372,english,"I get that the main gameplay is not for everyone. But to say it's boring and it's just walking is an understatement, unexpectedly (to me anyways) this game has stealth and combat which was a pleasant surprise.

Even then the walking itself requires you to think of how you walk and how you control Sam. It's intuitive and I like it, the ground and environment where you are walking makes a lot of difference in how easy it is to get somewhere, so planning and careful walking pays off in the long run.

You can help other players with various structures and tools, and they can help you in turn. This makes it really nice to see something someone else built that helps you on your journey. I love this aspect of collaboration.

I usually don't like fetch quests, but for some reason Death Stranding makes them feel more meaningful, and fun. That's because it's fun to traverse the world in general.

The soundtrack and sound design is really good as well, but honestly I'm not super well versed on this front so I can't really say more.

On top of all that, this game is gorgeous. On the highest settings with DLSS on 1440p I hit 90+ frames for the most part. I think this is the best looking, best peforming game I have played using my RTX card so far. I'm of the opinion every game should support DLSS 2.0 it's simply that good.

At the moment I'm on chapter 2, been taking my time traversing the world and delivering packages. It's been a blast, can't wait to play more. I might change up my review later on in the game if I feel like it.

25,DEATH STRANDING,72703076,english,"After years of asking, we got Death Stranding at last, 8 months after it originally released. This is a monumental occasion, as this is the first true Playstation exclusive to get a PC port, and it won't be the last. So, did Playstation's first outing on PC and Kojima's latest game leave a good first impression? Well the answer, is yes.

Death Stranding...is weird. This game is a dark post apocalyptic courier simulator set decades after a doomsday event caused the afterlife to connect with our world. As a result, undead monsters known as BTs now roam the earth, causing implosions known as voidouts in their wake. The whole world has become isolated as a result, and couriers like your character Sam Porter (played by Norman Reedus) help keep it going with essential and personal deliveries. Kinda reminds you how the world is now huh?

Now let's get this out of the way: You probably heard by trolls a lot to tease Playstation fanboys that it's a ""walking simulator."" Well...it is true. The game is a walking simulator...But in a good way! What I mean is, this game has one of the most advanced locomotion systems I've ever seen in a video game. It factors in weight, wind, irregularities in the ground, and other outside factors that could mess with your balance, so as you travel you need to maintain your load to make sure you don't drop it. If that wasn't trouble enough, you got BTs to worry about, your own food and drink, and hostile factions who would rather stay sovereign trying to steal your shipment. As you take deliveries making people happy along the way, you will try to get them to rejoin the United Cities of America, rebuilding our shattered nation one package at a time.

But the big thing about Death Stranding, is what Kojima calls the ""Social Stranding."" Despite the game not having multiplayer, everyone who plays it is connected in some way. You can build structures, roads, leave tools, vehicles, supply caches, and other helpful items around the world in convenient locations to help other players playing like you are. This creates an empathy loop as the whole theme of the game is uniting together to help each other. You will be rewarded for your generousity by other players as well, so remember, united we stand, divided we fall.

Performance wise, it's better than it ever was on PS4 Pro. The game is at 60 FPS and beyond, runs great, looks great, and is solid all around. The only issue, is the fact it has Denuvo, which has it's own problems so if you wanna learn why this DRM is AIDS, Overlord Gaming has a great series on the subject on why PC gamers hate Denuvo.

All and all, this is a great game. It's a nice calming postal walking sim that feels so satisfying everytime you make a delivery making someone happy, or other players happy. Definitely get it, especially if it pushes Sony to release more of their 1st party exclusives over.",1594770556,1594770556,TRUE,1,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,284,44,3443,0,142,1596591088,,

Main thing off the bat.....is it fun? Well it depends on what kinda mood your in and your tolerance for what I'll call ""completing"" the game. 
For me, yesterday was the start of my 3 week vacation. Preloaded, got it all ready and went to bed. 10am unpacked it and played for about 5 hours which I will break down now. The first hour was great if your into mysteries and trying to piece things together. After the first long cutscene.....well I kinda was like, ""eh I'm over it I just want to bang this one out as soon as I can, get my monies worth and roll on"".........then I cracked my first beer. WOW that shit changed everything. Suddenly I was enthralled with the story, Stillmother? What's that? Why is Mads Mickelson in flashbacks? Why does Die Heartman wear that mask....then I cracked the second and third beer. My Girl friend came into the room and started watching....the BTs started to drag me into the black goo, who are these mules? Why does this baby warn me when these BTs are near? I started to pick up more and more loose cargo, then I could pick up lost cargo from other players and started to deliver it. 2 beers later and my title is elite handler. It's great. I would say this game is similar to watching a movie on a walk. It's got enough to keep you engaged but what makes it fun is watching out so you don't walk off a curb into traffic. It's got a strange balance to it. Yes for the most part you picking things up, putting them down. But something about it is fun. 

Graphically (4k very high settings) it's good. I'd still put RDR 2 or FFXV ahead of it graphically (as far as how well it does terrain). Sam has only what I can call a ""Doll"" like skin to him for some reason. But other then that it's definitely a nice looking game. Nothing ground breaking or hard to run. It gets done what it has to, to get its point and art style across. 

Gameplay.....yeah get used to holding the trigger buttons. The more cargo the more top heavy you become. Staying upright it part of the fun and honestly it's very forgiving. There has been plenty of times I should have gone face first but hitting a rock or something set me upright. But for what you do?......ooooh a piece of candy....oooh a piece of candy.....ooooh a piece of candy. Packages are all over the place and picking them up and delivering them is part of the fun. 

In conclusion, is this like metal gear? Yes, without the guns. The objective is metal gear is ""go here, get this, go other there"" but with some shooting and sneaking in between. This is just like that without the heavy action. There is action when the BTs show up and drag you away for the first time but after your 3rd go around it's sorta the same. Untill you poop in a bottle and throw it at the enemies (not even a joke, that's 1 of the grandes you can get)

48,DEATH STRANDING,72683591,english,"First of all, I HIGHLY recommend playing with keyboard/mouse controls rather than a controller. I played over 270 hours of this game on PS4 so I can say with confidence that a controller is not the greatest experience. ""Walking Simulator"" isn't quite an accurate tag, there is a lot more upkeep for ensuring your deliveries go smoothly than that description would make you think, and it's for that reason that you'd probably do better with KB/M controls.

Like I said, I played nearly 300 hours of this on the PS4. I love the game, but it's not perfect. Don't go into it expecting to come out a different person or anything. It's a hell of an experience, story-wise and gameplay-wise, but expecting anything beyond a unique set of game mechanics and a thoughtful story (which can feel vague and stretched thin, but does satisfyingly come together in the end) you're going to be disappointed. It also doesn't take anywhere near 300 hours to complete, I just took the time to try and perfect every delivery I could. I really like the game's aesthetic and content a lot.

Here are some things I liked and disliked about the game:
Likes:
- The game world is beautiful, and it looks even better on PC. The photo mode is great for getting screenshots.
- The soundtrack is great, both the original tracks and licensed tracks by Low Roar (and a few others). The songs pop in during story-related deliveries and it's a very nice mood setter.
- The 'strand' system, or whatever they call the multiplayer aspect, is really satisfying. Getting to see other people's structures makes the environment feel less barren and more collaborative. It's also gratifying to see how others interact with your structures. Don't forget to share likes!
- The story isn't ""deep"", I'd call it thoughtful. IMO, it's not trying to get your to feel one way or the other, it's more like sharing thoughts aloud, bringing you along for a ride but not being too overt with it's themes. (When I started playing the game in November 2019 a lot of the themes and issues weren't so relevant so you'll probably feel differently /shrug)
-  There's always something new to experience as you make progress. New equipment, new structures, new enemies, it's refreshing but not overwhelming.

Dislikes: 
- Characters repeat themselves too often, and when discussing a seemingly vague concept at times the effect is amplified.
- (Using a controller on PS4) The physics are a bit wonky. You'll learn how to work within the bounds of the game engine eventually, but don't expect Sam to move in predictable ways on complicated terrain. Pro Tip: Just hold a wheelie while riding a trike through rough terrain, steering is sacrificed a bit but holy hell does it improve the ride.
- The difficulty selection is almost 100% exclusively an enemy health bar size selection. AFAIK there are no extra rewards from playing on the higher difficulties (PS4 only had 3 diff's) so save yourself the effort for your first run.
- Some of the equipment in the game is borderline useless. When new things unlock, craft them once and then donate/recycle them if you don't like them, you'll develop our own methods for dealing with issues.
- The weather system is annoying because you have to rely on it for certain deliveries (some packages require being kept cold or being kept warm). Just put those orders off at first, or post up at a hot spring and tab out to watch youtube, idk.

Is it a masterpiece? Eh... no. I love it a lot, like a lot a lot, but it's not at all a perfect game. It's polished as hell, I never experienced any objective 'bugs' beyond some of the engine/physics quirks. The story is fairly well paced with and it DOES in fact have a satisfying conclusion. I think it's greatest value is that it will like affect the games industry in more ways than one. I think we'll start seeing more actors in games, like how Giancarlo Esposito is in FARCRY 6. I think the 'strand system' of multiplayer will be accepted and iterated upon by other games in unique ways. All in all, I'd highly recommend the game and give it an 8/10.

---

Death Stranding is a really hard game to recommend off-the-cuff. That being said, it is nothing short of a masterpiece of design and storytelling. The gameplay is absurdly unique and acts as less of a focus, but more of a framing around the story and the journey. The story is amazingly well-written and better-than-a-movie quality. tl;dr: This is a must-buy.

Call it a walking simulator if you want, but the whole ""99% boredom, 1% sheer terror"" meme spawned from EVE Online applies here too-- you're going to be walking around comfy, gorgeous landscapes a lot, seeking out packages and delivering them. Then, every once in a while, either a chance encounter or a bit of story is going to come along and slap you down to the ground, then leave you with some more base gameplay loop to process everything. The pacing is perfect in this regard. 

Early on in the PS4 release, I saw a lot of angry comparisons against MGSV, as if the bad reviews expected Solid Snake to be on the screen fighting spooky ghost babies. [b]MGSV and DS are polar opposites.[/b] While MGSV had a story that was effectively background noise (yeah, sorry MGS fans) vs its amazing gameplay, DS has gameplay that uses itself as the background noise to let you sit and process the story and encounters. 

In short: the game is giving you a chance to think about and figure out what the fuck just happened. You're going to need it.

2,DEATH STRANDING,72699392,english,"So this is my first review ever. So many people called this a walking simulator and while it basically is one... There's something so relaxing and fun about walking everywhere figuring out ways to get around the terrain planning out a route with what to bring such as Ladders, Rope and building bridges and other buildings so other players can use. There's no actual multiplayer but there is at the same time. I really like getting notifications about how people liked a bridge i built or a ladder i dropped in a difficult area. I was getting chased by The BT's and i was in a tough spot up on a hill with no way out, just to do a scan and find a rope that a player left with a sign. That was such a big moment for me that i ended up loving the game at that point. I started loving the game for the fact that i was helping other players and not my self. Knowing i can build certain stuff in certain areas to make it easier for other players to have a easier time. The game looks beautiful and runs great, i haven't had any crashes. The Port to PC is one of the better ones i've played. The game is very relaxing and just a chill beautiful game to play while having some suspense to deal with and building. Honestly very surprised for the game i would def say that if you're on the fence about trying it then go in with a open mind. Also go in with the idea of helping other players in there gameplay and not just that this is a single player game where it only effects you. You effect other players and there interaction with the world.

Delivering items around the world with the help of other players who are connected to you via the strand system is the main objective to help rebuild and reconnect the world. I can't say too much about the game without spoiling it so here's a short review.

Visuals, audio, gameplay, input, feedback and overall quality exceed anything you will expect from a game. Replayability is perfect if you enjoy the delivering side of things but if not then it may not be for you.

Story fits the games theme so its expected. [spoiler] If you have played Peace Walker, Ground Zeroes, The Phantom Pain, Playable Teaser and Survive then you may get a bigger picture of what it may have been about since all of these games are connected. [/spoiler]

Without going into spoilers, when you begin playing this game, you will be confused. Very confused. I think that's evident from the trailers. However, everything will be explained to you by the end. This game demands your full attention and you need to be prepared to give it that, or else you're going to miss out on major things.

The game is paced beautifully, truly a mastercrafted experience. Just when you get to the very tip of ""this is taking too long"" something interesting happens to ground you right back down into the story. There was never a moment in this game that I felt like delivering the packages was boring. Carefully maneuvering the BTs, fending off Mules, it all plays perfectly in balance with one another. 

Give this game a chance, don't just play an hour of it and say you already know you hate it. This game wants your time, and attention. And it deserves your time and attention. Trust the game. I promise, if you love a good story, by the end of this game, you will get one of the best stories you've ever been told.


Now, let's get into the day one experience so far. 

----------------------------------------

Only a few minor complaints with the game. 1, we need more audio adjustment options. In some scenes the music completely drowns dialogue, having just one master volume slider is not gonna cut it for a lot of people. 

2, severe stuttering issues in some cutscenes. This will probably be fixed with a patch, however currently at the time of writing this review, it is an issue, so be weary of that. 

3, I have not experienced any crashing myself, however other users have reported that it happens. I will update this if the game does end up crashing on me at some point. 

4, more specific graphics options would be a nice addition. This is less of a complaint and more of a quality of life request. You have very limited graphical options, while the game still runs perfectly for me on it's highest settings, there are some setting I wish had a ""very high"" or ""ultra"" option, like character models, etc. That being said though the game still looks incredible.

There are lots of breathtaking cinematics. Kojima is really hitting high marks on this one, Ridley Scott's cinematographer could have filmed this. Stunning vistas of post apocalyptic Norway, called America in this game, for some reason.

This game takes a page from The Postman movie and shows us how it is to get the mail moving to connect Americans again.

Lots to love here. 

The only downside I can find is that I cannot seem to customize Norman Reedus. I just want to clean him up, that's all. Fix that oily head of hair. Shave those weird random patches of beard. Use an exfoliant and astringent and finally make that face glow instead of looking like somebody rubbed butter on his cheeks. You can put him in the shower or drown him in water, but his hair is impervious to cleaning. And he is just perpetually dirty. 

But, I did do something wicked and delicious in this game. A first time in a game, maybe. I had Norman shower. And once we were good and clean, I took a healthy poop. I would never defile myself like that in real life. But yeah, clean Norman is walking around with mud on his turd cutter.

11,DEATH STRANDING,72693505,english,"I've played and platinumed this game already but i decided to buy it again because of the unlocked framrate, bonus goodies and well, because i'm a die hard Kojima fan and i wish to support him and Koji Prod. I've made an extensive review on the ps4 version a while ago but it's too long to just copy and paste here, so i'll make a shorter review.

First off, before i hear another ""walking simulator"" or ""amazon delivery"" joke, yeah you're gonna be doing that for the entire game. It's about traveling West to reconnect people together and America itself on a network. If right away the thought of walking alot, carrying cargo and making sure it's in mint condition doesn't interest you then consider watching gameplay and other reviews to see how you feel towards it, cause it might not be for you just like it wasn't for a lot of people. 

This game really is a hit or miss for most people, either you're into that psychological horror and walking over long stretches of deserted wasteland, snowy mountains and rocky areas or you're not. I personally find myself enjoying it a lot and there's a good balance of tranquility, adrenaline rush and fear. You'll find yourself strolling near a big waterfall and the next minute you're sneaking past BTs trying to not get caught.

In reality i'm not very good at describing the game, not because i didn't enjoyed it, far from that, i adored this game and it's up there in my all time favourites, but because it's hard to put into words what this game made me feel. The entire time i was just in this state of mind that made me feel like it was only my and the game. There wasn't anything in between. I felt so hooked, so into it. I always wanted to build more roads, build more bridges, help the community, i felt like i was helping and that's what made me feel so compelled. I was able to put myself in the main characters boots. It felt like people were relying on me. 

The horror in this game is simply genius. There's no word to describe it, you have to experience it for yourself. The first few encounters will put you in genuine fear and powerless state because you don't know what's happening, you don't know what they are and what they can do.

In all honesty this game just made me feel so many emotions but left me speechless at other times, i just couldn't believe what was unfolding before my eyes. People may find it cliché or boring but to me it was special. It was something only Kojima is able to do with his games. I don't think my review is something you should base yourself on for deciding on buying the game, it's mostly me, a big kojima fanboy, sharing my experience with the game.

And Norman Reedus is perfect for this role. It's basically his lovable introverted Daryl character that he does so well, and it suits the gameplay spot on. 

About graphics, they are generally nice and very well done. The scenery is very befitting of the gameplay, you really feel like you are in this huge desolate wasteland.. However Im not super fond of the blurry TAA effect on everything (but this seems to be the standard in most AAA games nowadays, I guess most players like this blurriness for some reason that I do not understand. A Reshade sharpening filter can fix some of it, but a lack of real native antialiasing outside of just TAA makes some angles really jaggy (like for example railings and fences), especially if you try to use sharpening to get rid of the blur. The performance is also extremely good, in fact I hit 60fps constantly on the highest of settings. Which makes me want to wish I could select higher res textures or effects: my gpu and cpu are not utilized much and already Im on the highest possible settings getting constant stable 60 fps. Could do with even better more crisp graphics. And unfortunately Nvidia DSR seems to be unsupported, trying to select resolution higher than my monitors native 1920x1080 results in an ""invalid graphics setting"" dialog box and the game revertig back to 1920x1080.

34,DEATH STRANDING,72692181,english,"In terms of a console to PC port using a first party Sony engine built for games such as Horizon Zero Dawn, the port runs extremely well despite a lack of settings to be had in terms of optimizing visuals, as well as a 60 FPS lock on all cutscenes, but none of them are a deal breaker for one of the most unique walking sims around from one of the most influential game directors in gaming history.

Of course, if you're looking for a lot of action and MGS level stealth and action, it's not necessarily there. It's a unique, tiresome and sometimes excruciating experience, where the gameplay hook is more focused on the monotonous idea of simply being a post-apocalyptic delivery man, played by The Walking Dead/The Boondock Saints' Norman Reedus. Most of the satisfaction that comes from the game is coming in with the right expectation knowing that you're in for a long haul in terms of story, my first playthrough on PS4 took me roughly 60+ hours to complete my first time through, and that's before getting into the story (which is a mixed bag).

The story is honestly endearing in a Kojima sort of way. Sure, you can expect the out of place Monster energy drinks sitting around to keep your stamina up while you trek across the UCA (United Cities of America) and basically being postman Norman Jesus. While pretentious (I mean in a Kojima pretentious way, you know what I mean MGS fans), the story does have quite a few interesting gameplay moments, and despite what I said about there being little to no combat in the game, it does exist in small portions (I would say about 10-20% of the game) so they aren't a huge portion of the gameplay, and acknowledging the combat sections in general, I would say it's VERY MGS-lite. Fewer weapons (most of them are nonlethal and aren't acquired until 25-30+ hours in the game) and much simpler CQC/Hand-to-hand mechanics that make the combat just... exist in the game. While fitting with the game's universe and story, the combat is a cakewalk, and as stated earlier, does not take up a major portion of the game.

Finally, I have to give kudos once AGAIN to 505 Games and Kojima Productions work on this PC port. At 1440p on my RTX 2070 Super/i5-9600K, I was able to push a consistent 100-166 FPS with nVidia's DLS 2.0 technology, which gives individual rendered pixels a more refined resolution to create an upscaled resolution type look, in my case, checkerboarded 4K and it runs beautifully, despite Denuvo anti-tamper DRM existing within the game as of launch. The licensed music/original score composed by Ludwig Forsell is phenomenal, with perfect music setting each and every scene in the game. The acting in the game is absolutely superb, with Tommie Earl Jenkins and Mads Mikkelsen especially bringing in some of the best mocap performances in modern video games, where yet again, the DECIMA engine truly shines.

To conclude, this game is definitely not for everyone. If you set your expectations right and expect the 80/20 delivery/combat gameplay, along with a fair share of cheesy dialogue, there's a single ambitious vision created by one of the most acclaimed video game directors in video game history. DEATH STRANDING is more of a relaxing but stressful interactive movie with lots of inventory management mechanics. If this review managed to interest you in any specific area, I would say pick this game up once it goes on sale. Hideo Kojima and the rest of the KOJIMA PRODUCTIONS crew deserve at least some love for the ambition shown at hand in terms of pushing graphical fidelity, along with telling an interesting enough story within a dense and extremely lonely, but interesting open world, this is an experience you must try for yourself.",1594754471,1594754471,TRUE,1,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,654,37,789,0,140,1597595843,,

the problem as been solved. Steam was running in compatibility mode windows 8 for a reason i do not understand. by checking the properties and disabling compatibilty mode for the game and steam and doing a full reboot of steam (not just closing and reopening the app) the game now launch. 

the review is now a recommended as my experience on ps4 was great however i will have to see for myself as the community tab is riddled with bug reports and issue. however my issues seems to have been with the steam launcher rather than the game directly.

thanks for the help

old review :

the game won't launch and doesn't recognise that my version of windows 10 meets the required specifications. fully updates windows 10 in case i was mistaken and i still do not have the correct version. Updated my drivers as you never know and the game still won't launch.

This game is certainly not for everyone, but it was perfect for me.

As for the quality of the PC port, there's a few minor nitpicks but nothing major. For example, the cutscenes are weirdly locked to 60fps, which causes them to stutter more than normal gameplay. Mouse/keyboard support is surprisingly pretty decent for this game, even if the control scheme is a little strange. I find the mouse/keyboard setup easier to play with now that I've gotten used to it than with controller. The PC port also has exclusive Half-Life and Portal content.

You don't communicate with anyone outside of the characters you talk to, but at the same time, you'll be assisted by those who are playing along side you. The little details are amazing as well, as when i need to get up and walk away, you can literally have sam sleep, and it plays calming music while you are encouraged to step away, not having to fear if anything bad will happen. It's the little things that make that all worth while. There is scary moments, but nothing that'll turn off players who dislike being scared.

I know a decent bit about game design, and on paper this game should be terrible, however, I am not exaggerating when I say Death Stranding is my favorite game of all time. You play Sam Porter Bridges, who is tasked with reconnecting a destroyed United States of America after a global extinction event known as the Death Stranding.

THIS GAME IS NOT FOR EVERYONE! For all intents and purposes, Death Stranding is a glorified walking simulator. Think Euro Truck Simulator on foot. The writing in this game is also not particularly good, Kojima is not very good at writing characters and it really shows here, additionally, it's extremely self-indulgent. HOWEVER, the world of this game and the atmosphere is just incredible, and I absolutely love it. At the time of writing I have over 200 hours on the PS4 version of the game and I'm working on getting my Platinum for it. I plan to 100% this game on PC as well. Many of the negative reviews on game sites are correct, the first hour of the game is a massive exposition dump, the middle 30 or so hours are just walking and tiny little bits of story and the final FOUR HOURS is another massive exposition dump.

I want to stress that this is not for everyone, but some will love it intensely, there's very little middle ground.

Bottom line: it's not for everyone, but if you can find joy in repetition and monotony, this game can be a lot of fun.",1594743067,1594743067,TRUE,2,0,0.496134043,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,258,28,8842,12,30,1601520363,,

This game has more than a few meanings within it which I wont spoil, a lot of them wont be right out visible, some may say it is just a walking postal simulation, but it is not and I suggest to everyone who wants to give it a try to just do it. Dont listen to the nay-sayers because Death Stranding in itself is an expierence only you can make. 
I love how the game has integrated a multiplayer that doesnt force you to interact with people, but it makes it a thousand times easier to go online and build together, even if you seem to be alone.
