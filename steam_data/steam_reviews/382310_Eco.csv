I just happened to buy only days before the 0.9 update hit, and version 0.8.3.3 (the last one before 0.9) ran very well on my Linux box.

Version 0.9 however has issues with the map not displaying properly (at least on my AMD RX580), various plants not being rendered, as well as the character holding the tools upside down (the display coordinates seem flipped or rotated). Also, before the update, I played a few sessions over several (maybe 7-10) hour stretches without issues, while I have yet to play a session of more than two hours in 0.9.0.2/.3 without hang-up, the game is running out of memory on a 32GiB system....

On the other hand, much of the political and ecological stuff, statistics etc. (the things that really set this game apart from being a 'mere' minecraft clone) that used to require an external browser, is now integrated into the client, which I consider a huge improvement.


All in all, I'd say I'm happy with my purchase, and I'm confident these issues will get fixed eventually, albeit maybe lagging behind the Windows client.

Some of the jobs, particularly the ones that will always be around, are however tedious and physical; mining is a big one. Regular mining is actually fine, to a degree; you smack a block, it breaks into four pieces, you can carry up to twenty and tuck it into your cart you brought along until it's full. Not an issue. Shovel-mining, however, has you pick up one block at a time before tucking it into your cart, which even fills up your cart more then stone. You need to get a hundred blocks of both clay AND sand to get enough brick to make a house. One at a time.

Eco is a co-operative open-world sandbox craft/survival/building game with en ""end of the world"" event you are all working to stop, with some features that make it stand out from the dozens of similar games on the market right now.

1. Ecosystem - The game world has living ecosystem that responds to change. Hunt all the wolves to extinction? Rabbit population explodes etc
2. Land - Each player can claim land, once claimed only your (or those you give permission) can interact with you land, so there is no griefing (or so little its not worth mentioning).
3. Economy - Ever played Eve Online? Its like that.  Production chains for items get VERY long and complex, everything has to be made by a series of specialists via a series of tasks from basic resources.  To begin with you ""sell"" and buy to other via personal credit, later on if you work as a team you can develop a central currency.  For example: You, a farmer grow wheat in bulk, you sell this to the miller, who makes it into flour and wheat germ.  You use the money to buy a plough so you can farm more.  The miller sells the flour to a baker, who combines it with fruits and vegetables and meat (from a hunter) to make food they sell in thier shop.   The wheat Germ is processed into oil, which is bought by a cook to use in recipies and by the general populace as fuel for thier lanterns.
4. Nutrition - The game uses a fairly unique method to tie all this together.  Calories & Nutrition.  Calories are your energy, every action will have a calorie cost, swing a mining pick, pay 20 calories, make seeds at a farming workstation, pay calories.  Calories are gained by eating food, better food means more calories, for less weight and inventory space.  Your XP gain is passive, but the rate is increased dramatically if your diet is balanced, ideally 25% Fat, Protein, Carbs and Vitamins.
5. Politics - Eco has a pretty advanced political simulation that underpins it. You can hold elections, elected officals can make laws and levy taxes, they can zone for types of businesses or industries etc.

Overall Eco is the most compelling game I have played in a long long time.  It combines so many things, so smoothly and has a huge amount of depth.  Want to have a super tight-knit group of people working closely to save the world? No worries! Want to join a MASSIVE world with 300+ players all running aggressively competing businesses and fight for land and market share through the power of economics, diplomacy and politics? No worries!

Its still in Beta, so bugs are a thing, but they are all minor.  The game is updated regularly and there are hundreds of updates in the works adding new content moving forward, from boats and trains to livestock. Eco is a superb game, and so interesting in terms of the economics/politics/ecosystem I would consider it an brillant game for children to learn more about such things. 10/10",1601024994,1601024994,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True,76561198006833209,247,3,4641,2038,3249,1602013557,,

He found my goat early in the game and prances it around in front of me at will. My parents, her parents, my wife, daughter (she just avoids him) have much less trouble with him.

44,76469962,english,"The TLDR: Great idea, Wait until its finished or on sale, as there are problems that need to be solved. Also friends needed. Or a community.
To explain why i'm not recommending this game, let me tackle their about game section and list off my gripes using their list.
Tragedy of the commons: It does it alright i guess. For those who don't know, the tragedy of the commons is a lesson about greed, where basically, herders had some land set aside in their village where they could graze their animals free of charge, they abused it by sending large amounts of their animals over, used it up really fast, and then had to deal with the full burden of feeding their herd instead of being able to send some off to graze somewhere free of charge, and basically shot themselves in the foot. It does this really well where greedy players can really harm the system everyone is operating in and everyone needs to help manage others.

Simulation: The simulation aspect doesn't really feel like its simulating actual animals and their behavior towards people, rather than just having stuff walk around and only really react when you get too close. Carnivores (Added in update 9) feel flat, they occasionally ""Hunt"" other animals but there doesn't seem to be any timer to it to simulate hunger, and they are really kinda derpy. Had one stuck in my workshop for several days, had no issue with it. Brush up against one in the wild and it will instantly try attacking you, but instantly forgets about you if you start hauling a cart or move far enough away. The herbivores are just kinda there as well. Herd animals like bison don't seem to stay together, and overall the animals don't feel like animals, which is bad for a game touting its ""Simulation"" as a major aspect of the game. Also, from what i've read in the disscusions page, it also has a bad habit of generating plants over a biome's carrying capacity, causing mass die off and even extinction for species thus hampering the players as unless they collect seeds for the plants in the first few days, they're gone for good with no way to get them back.
Backed by science: I haven't touched the graphs and such, but i am able to see ""Oh, this is where most of our world's pollution is being produced"" and other than being able to be used for arguments in the government aspect, its alright. i guess.
Player Run Government: Useless on small servers, seems likely to be easily corruptible via a large group of friends. I'm not going to say much more as the current server i play on is too small to really justify a full fledged government with all the elected offices and such.

Learn And Specialize: Since they talk about food first, let's tackle that. It makes no sense. Why can i eat around 20 salad bowls (Only salad bowls, literally nothing else) and not have any penalty to my nutrition? Why is it even improving my Nutrition multiplier? Also the building is annoying as it seems to work well one moment, become utterly useless the next, and roof building is a nightmare. Hey want a sloped roof? Start at the top of the slope, and work down. Also you need to set it in such a way that you don't have the roof spazz out between sloped tiles, and cap tiles. This is Tier 1 building materials, and is slightly solved with tier 2 materials having the ability to put down formed slopes rather than having to force the slope to happen, but why? Why cant i just choose a roof slope right away and never think about this again? Why do i have to do this weird building method to force the roof caps to convert to slopes so i can have a sloped stone roof?
Onto the specializations and levels. You have to wait a number of actual real world days to get enough XP to unlock a specialization point, and you can spend it to go into any number of things, which is where the first problems start.
1. Why can i not respec? I'd like to be able to remove a star that i accidently put in to a job i dont want, but i can't, forcing me to either do that job, or wait on my butt for actual real days to pass before i can get the job i want. Do something like ""Hey if they have less than 2 levels in a specialty, they can remove it and take a different one, and they are limited to doing this once a real day""
2. Some specialties are just plain useless, or seem useless as they don't tell me what they do/ are used for in the specialization page itself. Paper milling, which produces paper, which is used for, and i quote directly from the game ""Paper to carry the written word. Or used to stuff in bookshelves."" One would think this would be integral to many things most of all the Government, using paper as ""Fuel"" for the bureaucracy and doing anything large, but its only use is in crafting a single piece of furniture. The bookshelf. Or Advanced cooking, which unlocks great recipes that you can consume for better nutrition or you could just use earlier recipes to do the same thing, with less resources for a slightly lesser effect.
3. Being more clear on what perks do as some perks have an issue where they state something that is unhelpful. I have the Logging specialization, and at level 3, i took a perk that upgrades the tiers of related tools by 1. What the hell does that mean? Are stone axes treated like iron, and iron as a modern axe, for the purposes of how many chops it takes to fell a tree? In its calorie consumption? Do they just last longer? Some demistyfing of these ""Problem perks"" could help. I Hasten to point out, not all perks are so unhelpfully vauge, as in Carpentry, there was at level 3 a choice to Increase speed of a worktable if its the only one of its type in the room, Or to increase it's speed by 20% if its a duplicate

A Community Driven Economy: Just have everyone swap over to a single person's store credit and have them remain active financially, and you have basically done the job of a Mint. Early game economy is afflicted with a problem a degree. I'm a mason, so i want stone, anyone can mine stone, but they have to mine it, haul it to my shop and sell it. Issue here becomes if i'm not selling anything they want, they aren't going to bring items and sell to me, and if mining isn't their one of their specialties, why mine in the first place when you could be doing something else, harvesting resources and what not. its especially bad if you are focused on creation of furniture as rooms have a soft cap of how much an XP mod they give, capping at +5 per room with diminishing returns at tier 1 building materials, meaning that people only want a limited amount of furniture, meaning once you're done with the inital buying up to fill the house, they probably aint going to be buying furniture until you have something new. Also the shops are annoying to navigate, and i was told they used to have a search function when browsing other people's shops and looking for something specific. Also, if i sell a bunch of stuff at Tim's store, and then want something from Jerry's store, i have to then sell whatever he wants to him to get credit, and oh did i mention that the way to solve this is to make a standard currency which is a huge resource investment and requires an actual economy going somewhat before hand with people having shops and such? 

This game isn't all bad, They have focused on making moddable, ontop of the fact that they have a an ingame encyclopedia (Could use work to make it easier to find stuff, as whilst writing this and rechecking some things, i found out theres a page with all the different worktables in there with the recipes they have
Going to end the list here, its getting to damn long. Its a great game, that is fun to set up system of building then improving then building/replacing and more improving. It just feels like it needs more polish, as well as the fact that the meteor is THE thing to deal with and once it is dealt with, no real reason to stick around. Perhaps once a few updates have passed then i will recommend this, but until then, wait until its on sale or updated.",1600937190,1600937190,False,6,0,0.568062305450439453,0,True,False,True,76561198116915892,151,9,6682,335,6440,1601739187,,
45,76458573,english,"In a few short words, this game is one giant grind fest.   I mean every possible way you could make progress slow and grindy, the developers have thought of it.  It is like they are super geniuses of grindy mechanics and have woven this brilliant tapestry with many layers fabricated from pure grind.   Its not any one thing, but a bunch of mechanics woven together.  It is truly epic.

Let me put it this way.  In minecraft you chop down a tree and get some blocks of wood.  1 wood turns into 4 planks which in turn turns into 4 sticks.  So from 1 wood, you get 16 sticks.  This game takes the opposite approach.  Let me give you an example.  You would think an iron ingot would not be too hard to acquire, but you would be dead wrong.

First off there is a large tech tree of items you need for privilege of actually making said ingot, but lets talk about resources assuming you have all these machines made just so you can make an iron ingot and upgrade from stone tools.  First you need iron ore to turn into crushed iron ore.  You need 12 iron ore, to make a single crushed iron ore.  You then need to wash this crushed ore to turn it into cleaned (concentrated) ore.  It takes 5 crushed ore to make one cleaned ore.  So now we are up to 60 ore needed so far.  But then to smelt it, you need 2 cleaned ore, now you are up to 120 ore needed.  Now to be fair, this yields 3 ingots which is 40 ore per ingot, which is quite ridiculous.  Now to make that iron axe or whatever tool you want, you need 5 ingots.

Doing the math, now lets see, you need 200 ore for ONE very basic iron tool.  Also, you will need to repair it with multiple iron ingots.

This is just one example of grind, resource grinds.  

Then there is the fact that the play can't carry very many items.  Things like dirt you can only carry ONE of.  Wood and iron ore, you can carry 20 of.  You also can't carry more than one type of these bulk items.  IE: You have some dirt, you can't pick up a rock.  Or you have some rocks, but you can't pick up any wood.

There is a cart, which you can drag around which you can store multiple types of things in.  Its not too hard to get, but even that is super limited because the cart can't go up hill.  You need to build roads and ramps if you want to go up hill.   This game doesn't have any real flat terrain.  Everything is either up hill or down hill with the exception of small patches of ground that are on the same level.

So we now have one kind of logistical grind, the in ability to transport and carry items you need LOTS of.

Now you want to use a cart, you will need ramps.  Early ramps are made out of dirt.  You need to fill some stockpiles full of dirt to craft ramps.  Normally you can put 20 rocks/wood/ore or whatever in each slot in a stock pile.  But dirt, for some reason can only have 5 per slot.  You need a lot of dirt to make a lot of ramps.  More grind for no good reason.

Lets not forget to talk about trees.  I have been playing this game for 17 hours are the time of this review and not a single tree has re-grown.  Yes I have planted them into the ground.  The reason is that they do not grow for like 4 REAL days.  Not game days, but 4 actual server up-time real-world days.  I have been playing single player so with 17 hours of play time, not a full game day has passed yet, let alone 4 of them.  

Then there are skills you need to unlock.  I am not talking about talent points which enable you to use the skills, but I am talking about the ability to unlock a skill so that you have the privilege of spending a talent point.  It has some crazy tech research tree you need to do for every skill, which generally includes a lot of resources, adding to the grind.

Oh, to make matters even worse, many machines need to be in a room, like an anvil, or a kiln, or whatever.  These things do not work outside.  This means you need to build a house which uses a HUGE amount of resources considering how many logs need to be chopped then turned into hewen logs which then are turned into walls, floors and ceilings.  You also can't pack these machines into a single house unless its huge because they also have some kind of space requirement which is much bigger than the actual model.  So you may place a few machines in your house and they all stop working because some mystical machine volume of space was violated.

Then there is your xp rate which gives you talent points so you can like mine stuff or grow food.  This is based on a balanced diet and how big and how nice your house is.  You earn this xp every real-world game day.

Anyway, I hope I have given you a taste on the truly insane grind of this game.  If there was a nobel prize for making grindy games, I am sure the devs would have easily won.

There is so much more grind I didn't even touch on.  Its a shame because the world is very nice to look at, and the premise of the game is really cool.  The game design has been poisoned by tapestry of grind.  Maybe one day the devs will pull their heads out from their asses, and will re-work the game design.  Currently, only hard-core players need to apply.  This game will never be a main-stream game and will always cater to a very tiny market of players.

Right now however, this game should be called grindcraft, and I like to grind but this game in it's current form plays like an MMORPG, a full time job, plus overtime assuming you don't use console commands to spawn in resources, and of course once you start doing that it tends to becomes something you do over and over negating the gameplay experience entirely which in it's current form is too much grind and not enough creation.

sorry to hear you're having issues with Eco.

Eco should actually not prompt several times for UAC. A single time for firewall is enough. Please feel free to e-mail us at support@strangeloopgames.com, and we'll look into your issue :)

Stuff not being saved at all over hours is also very uncommon and a sign of missing permissions to save files. Together with the many UAC prompts you get the suspicion is high that you use a very restrictive permission set on your PC - for which Eco cannot account on it's own. There might be user intervention required.

sorry to hear you have been griefed.

I know this is a bad experience for most people and we try our best to restrict that via game mechanics (claiming property) and the possibility to create laws, but i'm aware this sometimes isn't enough.

Did you try to play on one of the bigger, administrated community servers or possibly White-Tiger that is a well-administrated official server?

Typically those servers have clear rules and admins that enforce AND follow them.

-Great Concept.
-Forces you to work together and trade with other people.
-Mostly bug free.
-Building stuff. (Hope to see even more variation in the future)
-Some nice new toys, especially the Iron Rock Drill to locate your ores.

Cons:
-Still really unoptimized. My fps drops to below 30 whenever I go near an area with lots of buildings. I have a RTX 2080ti, I have turned most settings to medium/low and it still runs like garbage. Also, when I check windows task manager no resource is being used above 50% and I still get 15-30fps. There's something seriously wrong with ECO's coding.
-Grindy as hell.
-Professions scaling is unbalanced.
-Most servers have latency issues.
-The UI need some work, especially needs a slider to adjust the delay for the tooltip pop-up.

It's more of an oligarchy simulator, where knowledge (and thus property since skill scrolls give land claims) is now gated behind wealth, efficiency is gated by expensive upgrades etc. The point of the game (creating a civilization and strive together towards a common goal) is basically lost in the hunt for accumulating wealth and consolidating power, land, skills and efficiency, and if you aren't ahead from day one you can only dream of ever being so. 

Also, the fact that they allow buy orders in stores is further cementing the status quo. Everyone scrambles to make scraps and the oligarchs put buy orders as low as they wish and wait for the most desperate person to sell the clothes of their backs to the lowest bidder.

all of our channels got rules to follow - our official servers, our discord, our steam forums. When you visit those channels, you are accepting these rules.

You unfortunately were unable to follow these and got warned and subsequently banned due to not stopping the warned behaviour on the official server you were playing on. Ultimately you broke the rules that are there to ensure the best experience for the whole of the official server community that largely consists of a very broad mix of players with different playstyles, ideas and experience.

The same applies to your discord ban. You knew the rules and insisted on insulting staff members despite having been warned there as well. We can't accept that - for the wellbeing of the whole community that is helpful and follows the rules set up to protect it. It's always in your own hands to follow the rules or decide to not take part on a channel where you don't like the rules. But it's not our fault if you fail to follow the rules.

I also want to mention that i am the only dev dealing with bans on any of the channels, so please keep your criticism directed to me and not my colleagues that have nothing to do with it :)

Update 9.0 is a very big patch with countless changes in the backend that enable us to improve Performance better and to do faster release cycles in the future, unfortunately this takes a lot of time for a small team like ours. We cannot provide you a release date, as we do not have set one yet. 9.0 is currently in closed testing and the community that is currently testing has a lot of suggestions that we want to review and bugs we want to fix before release.

The estimated end of Early Access is late 2021, as noted on the Steam page, i'm sorry if this is not fast enough for you, but Eco is in a very playable state and a game that is likely never going to be in a ""finished"" state, as it is planned to be expanded as long as people have interest with new features and changes to old ones. We will have a ""Version 1.0"", but that is when we have reached the amount of content we feel is fine for this version and an equal amount of polishing.

the configuration for world size cannot be done in singleplayer, as singleplayer worlds use a 32-Bit server to save on memory for people with weaker PCs. Bigger worlds require more memory than a 32-Bit server can handle, hence in order to change the world size you will need to start a 64-Bit server manually, changing the configuration files.

In such cases we expect the user to know what he is doing, as changing the world size is not recommended for singleplayer and will change the game experience massiveley into a direction Eco is not meant to be played. (Bigger World = Less Threat for Ecology)

33,75722438,english,"Oh how I want to like this game. But I can't. Let me tell you why...

...first of all : the game itself is really good! It has decent graphics, there's a ton of stuff to do and you can build whatever you come up with (as long as you keep an eye on not destroying the enviroment too much). 
There's a tech tree with lots of stuff to learn, an RPG like skill system, survival mechanics, vehicles, industry, farming, hunting...it's basicly everything you could want from this genre.

That being said it's not meant for ""smaller"" groups of players, let alone for solo play. Yes you can have a dedicated server and yes you can make adjustments to the game's rules to some extend (greatly reducing the grind). But many mechanics, like goverment, laws, taxes, guilds and so on, don't make ANY sense with up to 8 players. You need far more than that. And if you're like me, playing with a ""small"" group, you'll miss out on all of these features. This leaves you with well...another ""minecraft clone with benefits"" I guess? If that's your thing, good for you! Otherwise, maybe don't waste too much of your time here.

Don't get me wrong, the game IS good. As long as you're willing to play on a highly populated server and therefore sticking to that server admins rules. For some this might be a good thing, for me it's not. At. All. 
I see where the devteam is coming from and what their goal with Eco might be, but all in all it does not seem to work out for me. Maybe it'll work out for you just fine.

I would love to give this a ""mixed"" rating, but Steam doesn't have that, so I'd give it a Metacritic of around 6/10. Maybe get it on a sale, the two hour refund policy won't let you see what this has to offer. And as long as you can bring quite a lot of friends, this could be really good.

The Mac client has disappeared, not just in what steam downloads, but it is no longer listed as supported on the store page (yay?), but it's far too late for me to get a refund. I suggest steering clear of the project at this point. The listing of Mac support should have been removed from the store page a long time ago, giving those of us with remaining hope it would work some day some time to get a refund. Sorry if this sucks to hear, but it really is that straight-forward; if you can't support it fully, don't say you do. This is literally the ONLY on-going bad experience I've had with Early Access on Steam; all other negative experiences were turned around by developer responses or changes made to the project. And never once was I called a liar / asked to have a private conversation about the issue.

It should be pretty clear I knew what I was talking about, based on the complete removal of Mac support.

EDIT 6: 

Okay, so the Mac client has re-appeared and is no longer an empty steam container.

It still has no single-player option for the Mac.

Leaving the old comment from Dennis below, and not recommending because it was creepy AF for him to add me as a friend to ""talk about"" a negative review.  I called out the lack of transparency on that (and an issue on my part), and their update was to basically call me a liar.

So, no. I don't recommend this game.  If the devs want to know what I want? Remove MacOS as a listed supported OS until you ACTUALLY SUPPORT IT. Save people from feeling ripped off.

I even spent a bunch of money on virtualization software to try the Windows version - which works for a lot of games, even PUBG - but this game can't handle it.",1543788153,1598986638,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,1,True,False,True,76561197963334243,306,16,65,0,65,1551022171,1544575544.0,"Hello there,
unfortunately this is not true. The game does have a singleplayer option.

In order to play singleplayer: Click ""New Game"", press the right arrow until you are at the screen ""New World"" and create one there.

After that you can go on with your singleplayer world by clicking ""Continue"" or by selecting the world in ""Load"".

Did you probably overlook those options? If you have any suggestions how we could make players more easily aware of them, feel free to send me a message at dennis@strangeloopgames.com.

//EDIT:
Hello tsalaroth, this is in response to your edits: I sent you a friend request, if you accept it we can try to find a solution to your problem or get it reported on our bugtracker. You can also send a e-mail to my aforementioned address if you wish.

I'm sorry to hear that comments are disabled for your review. I can assure you that we did not disable them intentionally and I honestly can't find any way to enable them. As far as I know developers can't enable or disable comments at all, but it seems like steam changed something in april that requires all reviewers to explicitly allow comments on their reviews when they create them, otherwise they are disabled by default. Probably you can enable them yourself when you edit your review?

It's definately not our intention to prevent communication, so I'm very happy in assisting you getting the comments enabled for this review, just contact me as mentioned.

62,62695884,english,"Amazing strategy , crafting, eco system game. The graphics are on point, the concept is pretty solid. Adding game implemented ways to orient new players would be highly advantageous. Having some type of greeting / info board where new players join a new server to quickly check out what the laws are, read the world strategy, and overall help new comers feel more on the same page with the players. More of a walk through or way to reference tutorial guides would be extremely beneficially for new players to orient themselves along with understanding the game faster as there is a lot to learn. 
Definitely worth checking out if you have some time, as it can be tedious in single player and wildly confusing on a rando multiplayer server.


updated: Having economy structures / functioning eco universe examples for new server owners might be a good idea? Ways to host your own server a lot easier.

The core of the game is a real-time economy skill progression game designed to make it hard for one player to play the game solo. If you're into solo games, I hope you're in for a challenge. That being said, the premise of the game is basically ""Destroy the meteor without destroying the planet yourself"" where you gain skills and technologies that make gathering resources more efficient, but also (Mostly) pollute more. The more you pollute, the worse off the planet is.

My personal opinion of the game is that it's too slow paced at normal speeds, but increasing the skill gain will make it much more enjoyable. Pick something you enjoy in the game and specialize in it, don't spread yourself too thin. If you fill a role in the server, you can feel where the community needs you and it feels good to help them out. I highly recommend playing on a 4x skill gain server that's just getting started if you're new (And can find one).

i'm sorry to hear that the progression speed doesn't fit your playstyle.

Did you know that Eco is very configurable? You can make plants grow faster, increase the speed for skill gain and in Update 9.0 you can also set a multiplier for resource costs and crafting time.

87,74360096,english,"I really don't understand the premise of this game. Like, sure, it works. The crafting systems are neatly tied together in different tiers and stages and the movement feels like it does in real life. We as humans are small and weak and have to struggle against the various environments we are faced against and this game projects this in a sensible way with limited movement through bushes and other kinds of foliage. There are several flaws and strengths about this game that are worth discussing but my problem with this game does now originate from what the developers intended. It comes from what the community produced.

It really is different from person to person what you intend to pursuit at putting down hours and hours of commitment. Some people drive themselves forward with a desire of achieving mastery. Others wants to share their creative work and processes with others to see things from different perspectives. When I got into this game I kind of expected a bit of both worlds but what I met were expectations that were impossible to achieve. You see, when releasing something I think you have to come up with something that will draw the consumer in. Make them get introduced in the systems you created and make them care about this world you just let the player into. Eco does not do this but pulls out a wildcard on us. Takes a different approach. I respect when a creative individual or a team does this. It's risky and you have to be capable to gamble a bit to put your ambitions down into a presentable state for the consumer. For the gamer.

And in core this game does actually succeeds in doing this! But because you place down such a big burden onto the player,  just to get into the game, it makes  feel forced and awkward, and when introduced to the larger scale systems I felt like this was out of my league. But as walking simulators can be considered art as games, this be judged the same way.
This game is about working. And I just don't like it.

Now, I understand the whole philosophy behind how a human needs to be under some kind of burden or pressure in order  to feel mentally well. Why would anyone replace these aspects about real life with a game? Life is amazing and I feel like this game just becomes a waste of time with systems that feels tedious and out-drawn without any real reason. And I don't even intend to make a case why I think this game is bad on it's own. Unless you get together a tight group of selfless individuals getting to a point where this game feels involving and meaningful just isn't going to happen. We as humans are so blinded by personal gain in real life and these behaviours mirrors onto this game. If you don't see the scale of this game you will be disappointed in the end.

This is a case of a game unworthy of humanity and without proper vision this lacks of a both shared and individual sense of accomplishment. It works for some people. Not everyone will get it.

People always say games are a waste of time. If they are fun they are not. This game is not fun and please listen to my advise.

Make better use of your time. Avoid this title.

As you play you find you need materials that you cannot craft. You bring a friend to the world and now he creates those materials you need, you continue until you both find another material you both cannot craft. This cycle continues over and over until eventually you have turned this already thriving world in to a collaborative city.

16,73571166,english,"If you enjoy cooperation you'll definitely enjoy this game.
So far I have started two worlds with two buddies, at a leisurely pace without the meteor threatening doom, to get used to the available features.
This game is all about building up and living in your own society. In our case this just includes three people, which definitely isn't enough to really get into all the mechanics that are offered by the game, but enough to have some fun and build up some neat little settlements. A note here: The world size when you create a session from within the game is tiny, even for such a small group. I definitely recommend creating a larger world with the ""Eco Server"" tool (part of the official game, available through the Steam tools section, look online for tutorials)
There is a hunger system, but this is not your typical survival game. You will never starve to death (as far as I can tell), only lose the ability to perform labor (cut down trees, pull carts, dig, etc.) and if your diet is too one-sided you will gain less experience. Falling from great heights or staying under water for too long will not hurt you either. I actually find this quite pleasant, as those things would somewhat distract from the society-building aspect of the game.
Basic game loop: Gather resources, build things, use things to gather different or more resources, build better or more things.
You have your skill specializations which are somewhat relaxed in a three player session, but it's still much more efficient for one guy to be a lumberjack, another a miner, etc.
All your actions have consequences on the environment. There will be debris where you cut down trees, which you will have to manually remove if you want to build something on there, or move through it with reasonable speed. The ground gets trampled beneath you. If you pick up all the berries in your area you'll have to travel further to gather them or let them re-grow (which takes quite some time). Same for cutting down trees. In later stages your crafting will produce toxic byproducts which you'll have to keep contained or they'll poison the environment and seep into the ground water.
There are numerous map overlays to show your impact, and a myriad other things like heatmaps of animal population or soil quality.
Apart from the gathering, crafting and environmental impact there is also a whole economy simulation built in. You can sell your products to other players and post contracts asking anyone willing to perform tasks or craft things in return for money (by default each player has his own currency). The game automatically tracks statistics and exchange rates.
Then there is also a political simulation. You can hold elections, discussions, and pass laws. Right now the systems for this are not as fine-grained as I would like them (though a whole lot is already possible) but the developers are currently working on a huge update.
We haven't made much use of these economy and politics systems in our sessions yet because they're a bit overkill, but from what we tried I think that they could be extremely enjoyable (and even more interesting) on a large server (which we plan to join anyway after doing some more tinkering on our own).

For example, played on a server with one really dedicated dude/dudette producing most of the early/mid game materials. Not a big D.

our discord and wiki is indeed solely community driven, official support is given via support@strangeloopgames.com. In case you are the person who i can only guess you are when searching through the discord channels: No, there is no optimization configuration options. You can play with the rate in network.eco when you got network related issues, though.

The server is running totally fine up to 50 people if you got the recommended server hardware (that is high frequency cpus, e.g. desktop hardware - which is common in the EU for game servers). We do have improvements coming with 9.0 where we migrated the server to .NET Core 3 though and further improvements in the future are planned. It's not single-threaded either and world generation actually uses all CPUs to the maximum in order to get the world done fast, cause there it is no problem to do so.

In total, it's far away from ""not working"". Otherwise our officials wouldn't work after releases when they reach 70 players at the same time.

while the game is indeed made with multiplayer in mind, a small group of five works fine and a public server with 20 active people is totally sufficient, most servers have a bigger count of active players. (Active players are not equal to players at the same time, though)

Eco is also very configurable and allows you to change a lot to fit your liking, including for singleplayer when our defaults are not fun to you.

If you'd like to tell me why you think Eco requires such a big (obviously exaggerated) amount of players in detail, feel free to add me on Steam or send an e-mail to dennis@strangeloopgames.com. We can also help you finding good configuration values for your use case.

I know that this game isn't really meant to be played alone or single player, but it would still be nice to have the ability to tweak different settings to make playing solo a little more challenging or fun, besides just doing creative.
I know you can use admin commands and/or modify different files in the game to change pretty much anything you want, but it would be nice to have a bunch of different settings that effect different things in the game when setting up a new world, with a list of all of the different things you can modify. Then having a description of what each setting is for, how it effects the game, and having a slider or a input box with the current value and giving the option to change it. Kind of like Ark, Conan, etc., so that you can have more control over how the world flows when playing in it.
Besides that (which is more just a personal gripe), ECO is an amazing game that does a lot of different things not many other games have tried before. I can't wait to see what other things might come from this in the future, as it's already evolved a great deal from when I first started playing, when it got released on Steam.

*It's a very cooperative game where the more people you have the easier it would be (Laws will be required)

It's a nice looking game with a lot of thought based around how you affect nature, laws to make it easier to control a server. It's grindy. You can choose if you want the meteor in your game. The game is in developement.

i'm sorry you had a bad experience, but i can guarantee you that this is not the standard.

If you feel like trying Eco again, try out one of the official servers, probably even wait for White-Tiger to restart (extremely collaborative server) or choose one of the established and well-known community servers that use unique concepts to create unique gameplay.

In general, every playthrough and every server is very different so trying a different one will net a different experience as well.

sorry to hear you didn't like the game.

We've got improvements coming to building and moving speed in Update 9.0. (Bit faster movement, especially in plant areas and AoE building)

You can also adjust the speed of the gameplay by adjusting the configurations for difficulty, and in 9.0 for resource costs and crafting time. (Or by playing on servers with adjusted settings, respectively) In general Eco is balanced around playing multiplayer with at least a group of people, gameplay shouldn't be slow there at all.

If you have friends that can afford this (imo) overpriced game. Than this is worth your time and money. This is very much a game you play with friends, this absolutely is NOT a single player game. This game is intended to be played with a large group of friends.

HOWEVER this game is not for people looking for a quick experience, this game takes time to progress in. In a full 24 hours of play we managed to just barely make it out of the stone age. Iron and other resources are extremely hard to get. There are no efficient ways to get anything done early on. There aren't even advanced mining operational equipment that is in the game. About 12 of the 24 hours me and my friends got through were spent mining for resources. For reference 1 iron ingot takes 20 iron chunks (you get 4 per block) to repair a fully broken iron tool takes 8 or 9 iron ingots. To unlock mechanics takes 20 iron ingot and copper ingots.

65,72545738,english,"It has some interesting concepts such as the way the economy works, the laws, and requiring people to specialize.  Unfortunately, there is just too much tedium for me to enjoy the game in its current state.  The gameplay does not evolve much from the first few hours you are playing.  You'll start the game chopping down trees and hauling them away in small wagons.  You'll end the game chopping down trees the exact same way with a slightly better axe and hauling them away in slightly larger wagons (or vehicles).

This same formula is used for nearly every skill in the game.  Miners will pick rocks slightly more efficiently.  Gatherers get small percentage increases to their yields, and crafters will earn progressively larger discounts to their crafted items.  This is a problem because since the skills you gain are gated via real world days, you're forced to continue doing the same types of tasks over and over which is not particularly compelling.  

The game desperately needs to switch up the gameplay to be more interesting beyond the first day or two of a fresh server, including new challenges and things to threaten the players (and the planet).  Since players cannot die and the environmental impacts of your choices on the planet are currently minimal, you never really feel like your changes are making a significant impact in the game.  Certainly, you'll see little settlements pop up all over the world (and get promptly abandoned as people get bored and never log on again), but the actual environmental impacts are virtually non-existent.

Cautiously optimistic for the future after more years of development, but I cannot recommend this game at the present time unless you are a fan of the tedious parts of Minecraft and are okay with crafting the same 5 items on repeat for everyone on the server or enjoy mining thousands of blocks of stone at a time since it's the only thing you're good at.",1594536181,1594536181,False,31,2,0.686649620532989502,0,True,False,True,76561197997217672,228,17,5097,0,5066,1595312840,,

is the game good? yeah? maybe?
is the game fun? kinda.

the game has a ton of interlocking mechanics, and would prolly function better as an mmorpg than a server based game like it currently is. the law system is awesome, crazy to think of what can be done with it. The goal of the game is to stop a meteor from destroying the world, you have a time limit of 30 days. The idea is to work together with other people because if you dont then things cost more. each person can specialize in a skill, allowing them to make things cheaper, work faster, or get benefits. Everything feels time gated, everything. you wanna collect iron ore? gotta spend a shit ton of time getting it. wanna craft something? gotta wait 2 hours for it to complete. it's like the only thing the devs use to prevent someone from working alone.

I am of the mindset that ""time gates"" are the WORST type of roadblock you can use in any game. Any game that uses the mechanic reminds me of mobile phone games that use time to get you coming back, the game would be so much better with other types of roadblocks, let better tools mine better material, let iron pickaxe get through geneiss but stone cant. Or, make recipes more complicated for people not skilled in that specialty, for non-glassmakers, make the recipe for framed glass be 2 glass, 2 steel, 1 iron, and 2 sand or something, make it unique.

almost all ""unique benefits"" for specialties are the same, level 3 for any crafting based skill (smelting, glassmaking, hewing) will give the choice between doubling the speed of a machine by itself or a 20% increase in speed when in the same room with a duplicate machine. After mastering 1 crafting skill you know what the benefits are for all crafting skills no mystery.

This game is a great base, it could be something really special, but it just needs to avoid using time as a gate. at this point i do not recommend it. It is on patch 8.3.3 (iirc), it can be a great game i feel, but just needs to push a little further, and grab a bit more variety, the game is super in depth and just barely falls short of recommendation because of the flaws i mentioned.

the game does create backups every 30 minutes by default and keeps daily and weekly backups. Also there are no such critical issues in the game - if a mod causes problems, it's not the fault of the game.

80,72264757,english,"On its face, Eco is a Minecraft-like environmentally driven simulation.  The (optional) goal is to stop an impending disaster, all the while remembering that your choices will have future impacts.

While educational, this is a simulation game.  I can't put enough emphasis on this being a team based experience.  You can play it by yourself, but if you choose to do that you're going to want to tune the settings, or turn off the meteor.  This is because the game is built around specialisation.

Unlike other games, the skill system in Eco leans heavily on diversity.  If you want to a miner, you can be a miner.  If you want to be a farmer, or a hunter-gatherer, you can do that.  But due to the slow rate of 'stars' (the skill unlocking 'currency'), you won't get many.  (The more you play the more you get.)  For a single-player experience this will hamper progression.  If you're playing with 1-2 other people, it's not as big of a problem, and the larger the number the more specialists you can have.  (The option remains to just tune the settings to get stars faster, so you can run a one-person colony.)  Bear in mind that the larger your player count, the more you'll have to negotiate.

The in-game currency system is interesting.  It uses player-based I-owe-you (IOU) systems if you choose to utilise them.  The other option is working as a collective, and leaving the free market problems out of your experience.  It really depends on the mindset of your fellow inhabitants, so you either need to embrace a common ethos to start, or be prepared for things to get interesting quickly.

I'd recommend this for people who like the idea of Minecraft, but find it doesn't really build into a community experience.  This game requires a community ethos, and whether or not you delve into the free market model, or stick with a community approach, everyone will have something to do.

If you're looking for something fast, quick, or session-based where you and your friends can get to building, or mucking around, you're probably looking for something like Minecraft, Factorio, or Satisfactory.  If you're looking for a game where choices matter and you create as many problems as you solve, Eco is worth a look.",1594168588,1594168588,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True,76561197993978679,2230,17,1688,0,1673,1594210518,,

the last major Update has indeed been a while back (last year though), but the last Update has been in February. We are currently overhauling a lot of the backend to provide for faster release cycles (bi-monthly major, and monthly updates) and for effective performance fixes.

We had to make a choice if we release Update 9.0 when it was feature complete without any notable improvements to performance and the release cycle or take a lot more time with the Update and do it right. We decided for the latter, assuming this will be the best for the game.

For this we invited a lot of community members to test Update 9.0 with us and that is ongoing since March this year. We want to get as many of our legacy problems fixed to provide for a better player experience in the future and as long as our Playtesters are still experiencing non-minor issues, we want to get those straight.

Eco is first and foremost a multiplayer game and balanced around the most common playstyles - small groups, larger groups and bigger servers. Our settings for small groups works well for most singleplayer people as well, but in case it doesn't, we do offer configuration options to change that.

Update 9.0 expands on the existing ones with a resource cost and crafting time multiplier to reduce the grind. Unfortunately it's impossible for us to provide defaults for every possible combination of amount of players and playstyles, hence we can only offer defaults that fit for most people. Hence, configuring the experience is possible and in case you are not happy with the defaults, recommended.

Eco does fully support playing Singleplayer, but indeed is targeted towards multiplayer gaming in groups or on public servers. A lot of the mechanics like Laws, Government, Taxes, Contracts and the Economy in total are based on that. This is described in the description of the game, though.

We're sorry that you found the game to have a very steep learning curve. We've added a ingame wiki called ""Ecopedia"" in upcoming Update 9.0 which should make it easier for new players to find their way into Eco :)

everything mentioned in the DevBlogs is already implemented in version 9.0 of the game, which is currently being played by over hundred testers. The Blogs are meant to give you an Introduction into the upcoming features while you are waiting for release.

In regards to your difficulties playing the game with only your wife, you might want to lower the collaboration setting of your game for faster progress. We can only provide defaults for the most used use cases, but it is unfortunately impossible to have a perfect setting for every use case and play style. That's why Eco is very configurable and why we're enhancing that configurability even more with a resource cost and crafting time multiplicator in Update 9.0.

There always will be some features not accessible to you, though, as Eco is made with community servers in mind that establish a small society. It's clear that you'll never need contracts or trading when playing with only one other person. That's not the main audience we develop the game for, though.

the bug you mention has been fixed in Update 9.0. Until then we recommend to use the /give command to create a farming skill book in case you couldn't get enough seeds.

99,55111380,english,"Present day review, coming back after approximatly a year to check in on things. Previously my old review soulfully focused on the optimization and pricing of the game. Currently I believe that the optimization has improved enough such that gameplay is fluid and reasonably attractive. The game itself gives exactly what you'd expect from it, the only thing I must state once more, but ill leave that after this: the game is good, you get what you pay for and it doesnt lie to you. I recommend this game for its gameplay alone, but what is more important is playerbase which I will discuss below.

It's incredibly sad to see a possibly award winning game get side swiped and put on the shelf due to bad marketing. Game developers at times grow to believe that because their game is worth an amount, that it should sell for such. For the few of us who are willing to deck out 30 bucks over spending 20 or less for better more popular titles, its fine: but for the majority it is not. Marketing wise the team should have kept it at a 20 dollars and participate in sales such they still appear on the front page often, influencing buyers and eventually gaining enough of a player base and traction that more players continue to buy the game. This is what this game lacks, a large enough player base and without it the game will slowly die off. Eco was released in 2018 on feburary 8th, the only way I can see this game regaining the traction it rightly deserves is by releasing the full game this year before it comes to late to recover and properly pricing it. People dont want a game which has been in development for 3 years for 30 dollars when there are arguably finer cheaper games out there worth more: this is simply the truth. Unlike other games in this genre, eco expects that you work with other players, it almost forces a community. Without the community you lose half the game, this is why I must bring this up because its not only important for the future development and success of the game but such that present day owners of the game continue to enjoy what they purchased.


Previous review back in 2019 of september

The games optimization could use a bit of fine tuning, as well as allot of additional adding to give the game a bit more flavor. Will give a proper review after early access. In my opinion, if they had lowered the game price while in early access to gain more buys and reviews as well as leniency for quality; this game could gain more of a following. Its really disapointing to see a great game not take off simply because of pricing error and I hope this doesn't happen to this gem. To conclude, better optimize, work on the game as usual it looks great as a concept, and possibly work on the price: the game may be worth the cost to some but competition says otherwise.  

Will be giving a new review once early access has been passed. Good luck developer and although i did not recommend this game, i would suggest giving it a try within the refund paramaters on steam to see if it's your cup of tea in the current stage.",1568485782,1593626943,True,0,0,0,12,True,False,True,76561198174177725,127,19,338,0,297,1593976962,1568606097.0,"Hello Genect_Defect,
i'm sorry you didn't like the performance of the game - we know of the issue and are working hard on improving it.

The pricing has been lowered for early access, by the way, as it was $40 in alpha phase after the kickstarter phase. We do feel this price is more than fair, given the play time you can get out of Eco - hundreds of hours.

Eco is a very configurable game in regards to progression and unfortunately that is required as there is no way for us to have fitting default settings for every possible playstyle and amount of players. Hence, we only offer defaults that fit for most people.

Update 9.0 includes a complete rebalance of the Tech Tree and additionally it does include new multipliers for both resource costs and crafting time, so maybe 9.0 will already fix the issues you are seeing currently.

We are also adding the Ecopedia in Update 9.0 which should flatten the learning curve a lot.

We'd be happy if you checked back when the Update drops :)

ECO is a fun and slightly challenging CoOp, survival building game, that you can play on your own and still have fun. It can be a bit tedious to get stuff done by yourself. But you will still have a lot of fun playing ECO.
 There is also no death in this game. You have to eat, to do work. but you cant die.

I would like the developers to add a true Minecraft like creative mode, for times you want to try out different looks for buildings before you dedicate time and resources for the final project. Using admin commands to spawn in blocks could be a bit more efficient, whit a admin item menu, that holds all ingame items like Minecraft.

You can host your own servers / worlds for free, and invite people to play on it. And if the standard planet size is to small for your liking, so can you change that easly in a .Ini file. Open your installation folder for ECO. Eco_Data/Server/Configs/ WordGenerator.eco. Open that file whit your preferable text program like Word or what ever. IMPORTANT. Do !!!NOT!!! allow your pc to tic the box for allways opening this kind of file in that text program, that could fork your PC in the future. Once the document is open, change '' ''x'' 72 ''y'' 72 '' to anything by times 4 Example ''x'' 288 ''y'' 288. Will give you a world that is ruffly about 8 square km. the bigger the world, the longer it will take to make the world. and the stronger PC you will need. Not only to make the world but to play in it. So keep that in mind.

But over all, i like this game and strongly recommend it if you can scrape together a group of 3+ people. But there is also servers you could join if you can't. So don't worry.

Singleplayer Experience:

I've been playing solo as thats just how i am and the experience, while peaceful, is very lonely, best of my knowledge theres no AI villages, no cool ruins or really any signs of life, i could be wrong tho. The world seed i went with generated a really tiny world with only 2 continents, a jungle and a mountain with a whole lot of water, im probably going to have to start over and just turn off seed generation since i seem to be stonewalled on the research (no bunnies or bison spawned anywhere or a lot of the other plants i seem to need). Plant seeds seem overly hard to get when you dont have the bench to make them took hours upon hours to get the seeds i did get, and most of the huckle berry bushes i've planted have died while the one wild one i have on the island has lasted for ever (and its not even the original plant). One thing that i really hate is how you can be to hungry to work, idk if its because im in the tutorial but i dont seem to die from anything. which is fairly concerning i've had a few times when i've gotten stuck in a random 3 block hole while climbing a mountain, luckily i had a handful of berries so i could dig my way out but i dread to think of how i'd have gotten out of that hole with out the food since i couldnt figure out how to respawn.

The rest of the game:

I have to say, the rest of the game performs quit nicely, the XP system is nice, tho it feels like anything less than a perfect dietary balance doesnt grant a very noticable XP boost, atleast its not a murder grind. I dont know why the ability to dive is a talent, if you know how to swim, you know how to sink. Its neat that throwing something out, like plant fiber or a broken tool, a researched book you dont need eventually turns into a trash block (buried it on the beach like a monster and dumped a bunch of it into the ocean). I like that most benches requires to be placed in a room of a certain size and tier, tho i missed the memo on how to increase the tier all rooms i've made are atleast 1 so i havent really had to worry about it. I think research should just be a time based thing rather than require so much of a particular item. i mean where do all the carcasses go when you research butchering, is the book made of all those animals? pretty hefty book i'd say, and paper million required like, 30 or 80 hewn logs and mortared stone (all those numbers are so miniscule i have to play a guessing game, i cant seem to make those any bigger). 


Overall: Its worth getting if you like community run gaming experiences. The devs and moderators are active and will actually provide support if you ask which is pretty above and beyond for alot of games marked ""Early Access"" Personally reminds of minecraft way back when it was becoming popular. If they ever added villagers i'd laugh if they called them testificates at first too lol.

30,70573112,english,"So for this game, i really wanted to like it (in fact i do like it, always enjoy a good crafting/survival type game). But my issue with this one is that it is really punishing to people who play in small groups. I usually play with a total of 2 people when i play most games (me and a friend). And with the two of us in this game it was almost impossible to go past the first few levels of tech due to needing a vast amount of other things from different tech areas (been a while since i played so i cant remember the terminology). Reading over the comments i don't see this issue being fixed or changed. I would like to see a game mode or option to have the game more balanced around smaller groups if you so choose it to be done that way (not make it a forced thing but an option when setting up a server/LAN or how ever that works). Or even the option for a solo run (as i don't think i tried but with it needing the multiple people for just 2 i would feel this would be an issue for solo play, if its not please ignore this last bit).

I am sadly not recommending this game on these points, if this wasn't so difficult to play with a small group i would 100% recommend this game. (My idea of a small group is 2-4 people. I'm sure its easier with 4 rather than 2 but as mentioned above, that's not something that usually works out for us)",1591776854,1591776854,False,3,0,0.523441910743713379,1,True,False,True,76561198042006422,220,3,403,0,399,1594109401,1594025708.0,"Hello Pipeline93,
sorry to hear you had issues with playing our game with a small group.

Eco is very configurable and you are able to set the collaboration settings to a value you like to get a faster progression. Update 9.0 will additionally include a resource cost and crafting time multiplier for you to use.

Unfortunately we cannot provide default settings for every possible amount of players and their preferred playstyles, hence we offer default settings that are working fine for the majority of players, but you can ever adapt the settings to your liking.

i'm sorry you had a bad experience, but you are right - Eco is a collaborative game and requires people to work together. If you played on a server with higher collaboration settings but your friends leave, this indeed causes major problems, that's unavoidable.

You can still change the collaboration setting after your friends left to make it a bit easier, though.

when you joined the official server you were presented with the rules for this server.

By claiming around the property of the other player, stapling stones as a high wall there you violated the rule against griefing, which we take very seriously on the official servers. You've been given the chance to explain your behaviour and sort it out yourself, but prefered to resort to disrespectful behaviour towards the admin in administrative action and the players as a whole, which lead to a ban and the unclaiming of the infringing claims.

Probably try to follow the rules the next time you visit an Eco Server or leave it, if you do not accept the rules presented to you. Not to mention it's kind of bad taste to pretty much confess it was on purpose via DM and accepting the ban as ""fair ban"", then writing a negative review.

79,69576297,english,"I realize that I played this game for 1001 hours, though in Geek Time that is just 9 hours. While the game is supposed to simulate human effects on an ecosystem, I think most of us play it because it's just a great blocky game with a lot of interesting stuff that happens behind the scenes, and the system of laws that players can vote on creates a unique playing experience.

The character leveling progression is what causes servers to become deserted after a few days. There is little reward for those who spend more time than others actively playing the game because of this time-based leveling system built into the game. This leads to some people buying several copies of the game just to play it - maybe that is great for revenue generation, but I don't think that is the intended way to play the game.

Now for the positive parts of the game, there is the classic Minecraft style appeal and player owned houses appeal to the game, along with a great amount of work needed to dig up all the iron in the desert and grasslands to make the necessary quality of life improvements over the course of the server game world and to be able to successfully defeat the meteor within the game world.

The game is a great way to demonstrate why monetary financial policy is an important thing and why free market traded currencies are better and safer than relying on a single dictated currency.

This game is great, and by that, I don't need to wear a red ballcap and host large rallies to show you why it's great, but you can just buy the game and see for yourself just how great it is, and it really is great.

A few suggestions that could help the game improve:

1.  Fix the bugs/glitches and memory leaks
2. Give the leader of the world the ability to appoint Ministers that look after each type of profession.
3. Be able to create towns with mayors etc. so world leader then the mayors for each town.
4. This might be hard to do, but add a way of escaping the meteor by Rocket to a new planet.  Just as an option. And on that planet they would have to start again.  
5. Add Nuclear Power Plants. To be able to make one of these would be amazing (Hard, but awesome). Players would be able to build it to help prevent global warming. Plus gives them something extra to think about (Nuclear Waste)

95,69326155,english,"Great concept of a game: unfortunately it's impossible to find a reliable multiplayer server to play it on.
There's no official servers running the official game mode ( which is 30-40 days games with an asteroid to defeat), so you're forced into trying to find a community server (with admin shenanigans) and that's where the nightmare begins.

In 110 hours i've never been able to play more than a day or 2 on the same server...
It suffers from the community server syndrome that plagues so many small indie games:
- The vast majority of the active community servers are ruled by cartels of admin & friends (who are often unsurprisingly the political rulers ingame...) and you simply end up banned if you displease or oppose them in any significant way.  Considering the time investment required in this game, it's an EXTREMELY frustrating experience. 
All the interesting gameplay of governance, democracy and law making is thus rendered void as its overriden by the presence of admins with full powers partial to their proteges and their own interests.
In all the servers i've tried i found such cartel invariably controlling government, city center, currency, how things are organized, and all the core economic jobs (so all the fun parts of the game). 
If you're not part of that popular group you can only stay at your place playing a tiny role of grinding resources for their profit as trying to do anything more significant will invariably lead to their hostility one way or another.
- By allowing servers to run custom settings and mods, its hard to find a vanilla server matching how the game was designed to be played.
- Too many servers for too few players means they all go inactive after a few days.
- Some servers can disappear from one day to the next because the admin got bored, or decided to restart it in some different way and you will lose the dozens of hours invested in it.

If you add up all these factors, and the time you have to invest in each game, it makes it very unlikely to find a reliable server. 
Here are a few examples:
- In 110 hours and 5, 6 trials i just ended my last attempt by getting instabanned for claiming a terrain that a popular player (who turned out once again to be the admin) had decided to use for himself seeing how convenient it now was after i had just spent time terrassing it and building a road to it. I was immediately told to let him have it or be banned.
- In another try, we played on a server where one of the 'popular' players was caught red-handed cheating by another player. Because he was part of that popular clan, he got his ban reverted into ""just a warning"" by the admin because surely he deserved a warning first... Seeing this, we gave up on that server and left.


There is nothing fun in these experiences and in the end you realize the game just leaves you frustrated and bitter, and that all the ingame political systems are just a charade.
It is, in a way, a very accurate ""Democracy Simulator"". 
Would not recommend.",1589744327,1589744553,False,108,11,0.789930760860443115,0,True,False,True,76561197991245494,158,14,6642,0,6642,1589737828,1589930124.0,"Hello Ronchiporc,
thanks for your review. I'm sorry you had bad experiences with Eco.

First, i'd like to recommend you to play on the two official vanilla servers Sea-Otter and Giant-Panda that have no admin intervention other than for deliberate griefing and misbehaviour in the chat, especially none in regards to gameplay, including government and economy. Looking out for the bigger community servers is also ever a good idea, but those indeed mostly have pre-established concepts they follow on their servers and that might not be what you search for. We do also offer an official server that does that, called White-Tiger.

The official servers do run the official game mode, despite White-Tiger. The 30 days time to meteor hit is rather a recommendation that can and should be changed by server admins regarding the amount and skill of the players that play on them. The 30 days were arbitrarily set back when Eco was first developed for use in classrooms, as those typically played Eco for exactly one month - but only during school, not 24/7. So a shorter time to meteor on public servers with way more players playing way more is very fine. Adaptions to configurations are actually required to have a good time for everyone as both player count as well as cooperation and ""skill"" can vary a lot depending on the server. Hence, Eco provides possibilitites to do exactly that and we even recommend to make use of them.

Eco actually has no strict way it's meant to be played. It's actually meant to be played however you wish and with full intention we made Eco very configurable. Every server offers a different experience and a lot of servers prepare great pre-established government and economy concepts that they've worked out over several cycles together with their resident players. This is interesting for a lot of players, especially those that rather not want to take part in legislation and economy creation. It's not necessarily abuse and those server typically explain their system in ingame-rules and on their websites. I'm not sure if you played on one of those, though or if your experience is from a server that did not have a established system but admins still controlled government.

If you feel that the way you want to play the game is underrepresented in the game, consider opening your own server where you create the experience that you want to have. Probably other people are interested as well :)

And while i sure feel your frustration about servers, in my experience these servers are not nearly the majority. It's an issue every game with servers has as well and where we can do little. We cannot tell admins to keep their servers up forever, they are paying for it. It's their servers - their rules. Hence, checking out the bigger communities and getting to know these people, the admins and residents and their rules is ever a good idea and maybe you find a nice community you want to be part of :)

there is no authentication problem in the game. An issue that can happen and leads to ""Connection failed"" is a corruption of the mod folder either due to wrongly installed or removed mods or Steam not removing old files on a Update (especially with installed Mods), but that only happens on Singleplayer Servers.

In case of that issue arising on a Multiplayer server there ever is a networking issue on the server that needs to be fixed on that side. This is not ""often"" either, but specifically affects especially one single hosting provider which we do not recommend to use since these issues arised.

1,69129611,english,"I like the idea of this game, but I don't like this game, and I don't recommend it. 

First, it's way too expensive. I'm a fucking moron of the highest order, don't repeat my mistakes. I can't believe I played 33 hours of this shit, it felt like nothing. I'd refund if I could. I'm a legit dipshit for paying this much for this game. Borderlands 3 cost the same and is denser with content, made by (mostly) professionals, and is all around a different but better game. The pricetag is ludicrous - this is fundamentally a half-baked unfinished slow-moving typical EA title, and I should have went with my instincts here - don't pay more than 5-10 bucks for this, if at all.

Second, the game has an identity problem. It's clearly not designed to be played with anything less than an entire classroom of people but offers ""3-5 player worlds"" and ""singleplayer"". The grind is unreal and there are few ways to actually expedite this system. The intent is for players to work together but the game is designed in such a way that for that to actually work you need dozens of people doing specific jobs, like in reality. What it fails to understand is that that's precisely why people make video games - reality fucking sucks. I spend my real life doing the same shit for 8 hours a day and here's a game that demands players essentially recreate this drudgery. 

In any other game you could spend 8 hours doing something fun or creative, hell, some people even play truck sim for hours in a day. The difference is that a game like truck sim has tactile depth, a noticeable tangibility to the game world and their actions in that world. A good game can make boring work fun, Spintires for example shows us that even the simplicity of driving trucks in mud can be fun. Eco is the opposite of that design philosophy - what's strong about Eco are its depth of interacting and complex systems. Unfortunately unless you can make these systems tangible to the player, they're disconnecting - just numbers in a spreadsheet.

Third - the grind is, as stated, unreal. Ever bunnyhop in a rough oval while pressing E? Ever stared at a tree while holding mouse1? Have a good time idiot, 'cause they didn't bother to make these experiences, which are the majority of gameplay, tactile in any capacity. Digging dirt is as dull and flat as chopping trees and those are both as uninspired as anything else you actually do with your time in this game. It's so lifeless, so boring.

Animals spawn haphazardly and have no real behavior, shooting them with arrows elicits no response other than their flight/death and is as boring and flat as stated above.

thanks for your review.

I won't go into too much detail about price, as that is very subjective. Comparing Eco to Borderlands is like comparing cars to vegetables - the two games have nothing in common, neither for gameplay, type of the game, staffing or anything else. It's two totally different games. Probably get both, if you like both, they're not interchangable. We think the price is very fine given the playtime you can easily get out of Eco with countless players having several hundreds of hours on their clock. In the end, the price needs to enable us to go on with development of the game and is a management decision that is made based on financial calculations.

While the game obviously is indeed designed for Multiplayer, playing it in smaller groups or singleplayer is perfectly possible as Eco is very configurable. It needs to be configured depending on how many people play and their preferred playstyles. We offer defaults that fit for most of our players, but it's impossible to provide presets for every single possible playstyle out there. We do allow configuration of the speed of skill gain and you can already configure the resource costs and crafting times of items as well. As the latter is harder to do currently, Update 9.0 will introduce a simple multiplicator with which you can easily set how many resources and how much time crafting will take, enabling you to set whatever configuration you want to have to no longer deem the game ""grindy"".

I can totally understand your stance on games being for recreation after work and you don't want them to resemble your work day. Though that is only one of many playstyles and opinions. I personally prefer to dive deep into one single game after work, persistently. I do not wish to have a shallow entertainment game for an hour after work, but i want to play for several hours in a game and grind is no issue to me at all, it's actually very fun to me when i have to ""work"" to get a result, call me crazy but that is incredibly satisfying for me. I'm not going to pretend Eco has no grind, but the grind it has is indeed intended. While you might not be part of the target group, we still offer you the option to configure the experience to your liking nontheless - that enables us to also reach players that do not like this playstyle. If you need any help with that, feel free to contact me at any time, or write to support@strangeloopgames.com.

Chopping a tree to get wood, you have to chop it down, then chop up the tree logs and then pick them up and move them to your storage spot.  That in and of itself sounds minor on the surface but the hit box is weird, trying get the right spot to chop the logs was kind of annoying, then  you can only carry one pile of a few logs at a time after you chop them.  Once you do you would think pressing a button to drop in your storage area would be next right?  No, another slog with extra steps just to drop off the logs.  press a button to open the dialog box for the storage then drag your logs from your toolbar on the bottom of screen to one storage area.  To push the realism, hunger keeps you from working.  which is rather quickly at least early minutes into the game.  My character got hungry and I no longer could chop or do anything except find some berries to eat and  i won't go into detail, but has way too many steps too.  Let me grab stuff, move them and just drop them off or eat them.  all these extra steps in the way do not make a more interesting game, just one that drags everything out and a chore.  

I'll be honest, I'm sure there's a good  game underneath all the labor and I know this is just one opinion but I play games to relax and enjoy not work.

i'm sorry you didn't like the game, it's understandable that different players have different tastes, but most of the experience you describe is indeed working as intended and part of the games unique design. There is one thing you mentioned though, that is actually possible:

You can simply right click with materials in your hands to store them in a stockpile, you do not need to open the UI. It should show that possibility above the stockpile when you are near it as well. This is possible with most if not all storages.

Eco is very configurable and you're able to change the speed of skill gain via config files, additionally in Update 9.0 you can set a resource cost and crafting time multiplier.

We've chosen defaults that fit for most players, but as this game was not made for single- but for multiplayer, these defaults cannot suit everyone unfortunately.

23,68597709,english,"I've sunk about 30 hours into one single player game and what I've found is that the game is filled by nature with tedious mechanics. I find the grind somewhat enjoyable, but it is reasonable to understand why someone would be turned off from it when the game requires you to spend dozens of hours just moving material. 

This problem is mitigated to an extent with multiplayer. There the focus is on creating a community that leans on each other, as each person is restricted to being a specialist in just a few fields. The idea is that you will produce goods for other players to purchase from your store and use as they see fit, be it creating more specialized goods or improving their houses. Multiplayer is clearly the ideal way to play the game in my opinion, however it also comes with the anxieties associated with actual commerce as supply and demand is important to remain wealthy enough to remain a factor in the development of the game. 

Specialties are tied to various books that when right clicked produce scrolls, these scrolls in turn enlighten the user to a new specialty allowing them to take on a new field. Most specialties have a clear flow. For instance you have a [Logging] specialty. It allows you to cut down trees more efficiently both in calories spent and the amount of chops. You can then take [Hewing] which allows you to turn the logs you've chopped into building components, which, as you gain more skill, reduces the cost of the recipe both in time and materials. Specialties also have recipes that require either the knowledge of them or having spent a specialty point on them. In single player you receive specialty points at an accelerated rate, where as in multiplayer you receive them at a normalized rate. This encourages trade and having a focus on a particular set of specialties in multiplayer.

Multiplayer also has an interesting mechanic in that there are server wide laws and the ability to denote a universal currency. Some instances I've seen is a tax on cutting down trees, which you can recoup the cost of by clearing the resulting trunk and debris. These mechanics also lend themselves to abuse. Part of the game is balancing industry and progress versus the environmental impact of needing to rip up plants, slaughtering animals, chopping forest, and so on. There are byproducts produced by some crafting, in particular smelting, that are direct poisons to the environment if not handled correctly. I've read stories of servers where someone gets into control of the mint, over printing currency and controlling the market, then there is the instances of people just lightly hiding previously mentioned byproducts in holes around the world, killing it slowly. 

If you made it this far, you might wonder, what is the goal of the game. Its simple, stop a meteor that will annihilate your world in a set amount of days using lasers. Straight forward as far as goals go, but in order to get those lasers, you'll have to go from sticks and stones to iron tools and brick buildings, then even further to modern construction equipment such as excavators and bull dozers to acquire enough materials to both build and power these laser arrays. All of these goals are acheived in realtime. Thankfully it can be sped up in singleplayer, but in multiplayer it is likely disabled.

I haven't read about future plans for the game, I'm just playing and figuring it out as I go.
No stress, just don't look at the asteroid. Nothing is trying to kill you, you can just idle wherever, whenever. Build tall towers, jump off them - it's fun!

I am enjoying the graphics (even with a lower end system, I think). The controls are easy and the UI seems to work just fine for me. I really like how the bow works, not exactly sure why, it just feels nice. Water behaves a bit wonky (I dug a tunnel down from a lake and out the side of a cliff and the water made it 3 cubes horizontally before giving up - I should have had a geyser), and gravity only seems at have an effect on objects when they first spawn (breaking rocks, etc). Not yet any object stability, you can undermine blocks and they will just levitate, same with furniture and such. This is fine for when you want to remodel a building with new construction materials, it's just weird. 

It [b]is[/b] grindey for resources. A LOT of, get the block, move the block, drop the block. But the results so far are very satisfying. Also, as you progress, you will unlock things to get more, faster, with less effort.

the difficulty of the game is adjustable, as of the upcoming Update 9.0 that also includes an easy way to modify resource costs and crafting times. For singleplayer we've chosen a default that we found fitting for the majority of players, but that also means that it will never be able to fit all players, hence Eco is very configurable. The same applies for online servers, administrators have a wide range of possibilitites to adjust the game to their amount and type of players as well and they actually need to do so, as it's impossible to deliver default configurations that do fit any possible server type and player amount.

Probably try the game again when 9.0 dropped and you can use the new sliders i mentioned for singleplayer :)

Pros:
+ It's pretty to look at
+ Great Multiplayer (if the server is active)
+ Diversity of flora & fauna
Cons:
- Mid-Late game (not enough content/guidance there that causes a huge drop off of active players after 1-2 weeks)
- Single Player (The single player is somewhat boring and is a chore to progress on your own. At least the option is there though.)
- Performance (decent performance if you're playing in short sessions. The game starts to struggle if you're playing for more than an hour. Rebooting temporarily fixes the issue. I know this should be fixed in 0.9 but this is worth mentioning since it isn't out publicly yet)

thanks for your review.

Actually your experience is ""intended"". Though, it's not like you would have this experience on every server, it greatly depends on the organisation the server can and wants to establish and the types of players that play. Failing to reach the goal is actually an intended mechanic and wanting to become rich is a type of playstyle a lot of players want to do - trade is also a form of cooperation.

For a bit more guaranteed organized approach i can recommend pretty much any of the bigger administrated community servers and our official server ""White-Tiger"". Your experience will vastly differ there - but you will have to take a hit on the freedom, as planning and organisation also means regulations. And understandably, a lot of players try to reach the goal without. That can work, but mostly doesn't. Seeing those experiences is an important part of the game.

this game was indeed developed for a multiplayer experience, though Eco is very configurable and in the upcoming Update 9.0 you also get the ability to easily change the resource costs and crafting times via a multiplicator, this probably will help you.

We used defaults that we found fitting for the majority of players, but unfortunately the tastes and playstyles of players differ vastly, hence providing defaults for every possible playstyle is impossible for us.

The time to hit for the meteor was not set arbitarily, but comes from when Eco was first made - for classrooms. That time was useful for special lessons with Eco that typically lasted for a month. You can adjust this time or turn off the meteor however you wish, though.

64,67634684,english,"Conclusion: This whole thing is currently absolutley unbalanced. So unbalanced i would even refund it if possible..

The game has very nice idears about shop-systems, laws, voting, goverment, polutions, building your own base an so on.. The basic idear behind is very awesome and it could make a lot of fun.

Theres about 50-100 different resources in this game. Some of them you need to build your base/house - some of them you need for your food, some on them you need to envolve. Laws can be used to build up an economy (for example fund people for building streets, creating shopping areas and so on..). All of this is on top covered by a goverment which is taxing players - very awesome!

Sadly this whole game is very unbalanced - out of this plenty different resources types the whole skill tree / envolving is based on this resources: iron/copper/gold ores. 

Everything which is needed to get forward in this game is depending on this resources and those are quite rare. If you go mining theres a chance about 1/10 that you get those iron ores, gold ore is even worse its about 1/50 - i would say.
If you find a block which includes one of those ores you can hit this block with your pickaxe you get 4 ores out of it.
I would estimate that you can mine about 100-200 iron ores / real life hour.
Out of this ores you can create iron bars, at the beginning of the game you can do out of 10 iron ores 1 iron bar YEHA!
The best exchange rate (if you converted about 3-5k iron ores (~25h of your real life mining hours)) is 2:1. 
2 iron ore -> 1 iron bar.

Theres no way to speeding up your mining except with a Excavactor, and guess what is needed to build this thing? Iron Ores/Bars! And how much you guess? Well i would estimate about 7-10k iron bars - its one of those things which you are able build at the very end of the game. If youre clever with math its about 60-80 real life hours (stupid) mining in your mine to gather enough ores to build this thing and reach the next level of mining. On top theres about 30-40 hours of mining before you can build the tools to build the Excavactor..

All fine so far (goals should be there, also having them far away makes sense), if the economy would cover and allow global grouping..

And heres now the very bad part about it: Since everybody is in need of this ores (to envolve), nobody is going to sell any you those. Everyone is trieing to gather his ores to bring himself forward (which makes completly sense), but its very stupid, because the way the resources a distributed the game prevents you from teaming up globally. 

If resources would be balanced in different skills/needs someone would sell you the stuff he doesnt need so someone else could gather it and use it in his different area to bring him forward and then (because he gained resources he doesnt need) he could sell them again and bring circulation into the economy.

But as i mentioned the whole game / skills / envolving is based on iron/gold/copper ore, you can say compared to the need of 100 resources from something else theres 1 resource of iron/copper/gold. Absoltutely bullshit !

They should rename it from eco to mining simulator.

If one day theres more balancing in this whole game it has great potential.

[h1]The Good:[/h1]
[b]Logistics:[/b] Really love the concept of adding heavy items that you cannot easily carry, thus the need to build roads and transport carts.

[b]Trade and economy:[/b] Amazing idea, and can really work well. Seems to get a lot better when you get a common currency, so wish that stage could be moved forward a bit. 

[b]The concept of different specialities:[/b] This is a great idea, but it really needs a lot more work to balance it. The idea that you follow a pathway that helps the wider community.

[h1]Where it goes wrong:[/h1]
[b]Progression:[/b] It is really really slow, and the reward element seems really lacking. This game seems to follow the most weird concept ever, ""reward you for simply waiting and not playing the game"". I have watched some of the developer videos on this, the idea being that they want more causal players to still get something out of it. But if you are only able to play it a few hours a day you have a more crappy house, so you still quickly fall behind. And here is the kicker.... Once you are behind there is no catching up, as everything is based on waiting. The sense of reward is very sparse, maybe you get one tiny reward per day of something new in this game. And the latest version makes this even worse, now you cannot change your choice and it is so easy to make a bad choice before you know what skills work well together. End up with hewing, mason, and farming (and you will have a very crap game, so you give up and start again). Also you hardly notice levelling up in the skills you do have, as you never had to make a choice. 

[i]How to improve this:[/i] 
1. Remove the concept of time: make reward based on work done in the game. To make things more balanced, add a ""catch up"" game mechanic. Something like you gain skill points faster, the further behind the world average you are.  You have to understand that progression is what is making people play this game, not because they want to contribute to the virtual world. Collaboration is not a motivator, it makes things fun, but people want to move on to the next thing. And this desire is what lets a lot of other things down. For example: If I up skill to make bricks, I then finish my brick house, I want to move on to something else. I don't want to keep being the brick guy for the rest of the game feeling that all I do is dig clay while everyone else has more fun doing other parts of the game. But the progress is set that it kind of expects me to do this. You get to watch others building the cool items as a result of your hard work mining the required resources (not fun at all!). When you restrict areas of a game you exacerbate any unbalanced aspect, people have to know that their choice has tons to discover or they get jealous and regret their poor choice (which can no longer be undone!!), and this game is massively unbalanced (Smelting unlocks so so much, while mining just reduces my food consumption, yet both are presented equally). Then the time frame of this game is like 30 days, so if I make a poor choice my only option is to quit and start in a new world. Leaving the existing world without someone filling my role.
   
2. Granular progression: Look at ""Path of Exile"", their core concept is around ""tiny progression makes things fun"". And it has worked out really well for them. If you are going to have many different trees you can follow you need a hell of a lot more depth on each tree. And you need a lot more clarity around which direction to take. Would be much smarter in the early stages of the game for you to choose 1 of 4 possible paths. Then have each path have its own version of a starter items, house, food, tools etc. Save trade for slightly later as people progress a bit. 

3. Group progression: Why not have a skill tree for the whole of society that benefits everyone. Have a ""town hall"" building, that has group research projects, and everyone must bring required goods to these big global goals. This then unlocks benefits for everyone in the world. Things such as 30% skill point speed improvement. This has 2 benefits it brings, 1. It causes group collaboration with goals that everyone benefits from. 2. It means that later players, and those that don't play so often get buffs that help them catch up faster. 

[b]Grind:[/b] Grind never seems to change in this game. Even with the levelling improvements they are hardly that obvious. And the game seems to be based on this concept that you get into a space which you then need to trade with others to get what you want. But this doesn't really work very well at all. For example: If I am the brick guy, I will grind and grind digging up clay and shale. I finish my house, and now the game expects me to continue this same grind to make bricks for everyone else, that just doesn't ever happen. So the only people with a Tier 2 brick house are the people making the bricks, everyone else gets a few token trades so the brick guy can buy some food. The farmer can never trade enough to get the bricks they need because the brick guy has got tired of doing the same grind. (Developers answer to this issue in 0.9 seems to be, lets make the grind even worse, so the brick guy needs even more food and has to trade more).
[i]How to improve this:[/i] Reward me for grinding mining or digging clay with faster ways to get those same resources. If you play modded Minecraft, the simple concept here is that you grind to automate, and the more boring elements are automated away later on, so the player can focus on the next exciting element. I can see that making it too easy to get resources will damage the limited world too fast, but it seems that the developers have taken the view of thinking of the virtual world first, rather than the player experience (There must be better options than making the grind harder). 
If you are expecting people to supply others with goods, you have to progressively reduce the grind involved to make those goods. (And it is true that this is done slightly with the recipes, so you need less clay to make a brick as you skill up, but it needs to be done tons more). 
To illustrate the grind: lets say you want a 5x5 brick room, and you want 4 of them (for each room type). Even if you make them as a tower, you will need: 1,152 bricks. And lets say you up skill your brick recipe, so you average 2 clay per brick, that means: 2,304 clay. You can only hold one clay per shovel scoop, so just for your own home that is a lot of scooping...  Almost 19 full stockpiles of clay. (And this doesn't take into account the grind needed to make the mortar as well). Now lets say that you have 5 other players who also want brick for their homes.. The numbers start to get insane. And then what is worse still, is that all this grind doesn't pay off very well either, because as soon as you go to tier 3, brick is kind of redundant, and all this grind feels like it has been for nothing. 

I hope some of this input has been helpful, as there is enough of a good game here that I really want to see it do better than it is.

Eco allows yiu to destroy your whole planet through pollution! What do you want more!

The game, as with basically every survival sandbox starts you of with nothing and yiu have to work work your way up. From simple wooden tools to gigantic factories, you basically progress through different era's. The world is fully changeable and you can form it to your liking!
It's awesome in large groups, since everyone can focus on a specialisation. Hunting, fishing, gathering, crafting..... You can even form your own government!
But that's were the pros end, unfortunately.
The game is only really enjoyable in larger groups, since alone you'll gonna have a hard time unlocking all specializations and doing all the work you need to do.
The calorie system in interesting, but hard to manage in singleplayer, since you dont3just have to gather food, but also cook it and you need a balanced diet to fill your calorie meter.
I also read comments about people not having food anywhere near their spawn....
The food mechanic could need a serious overhaul, as does balancing for singleplayers....

2. The fact that not everything is integrated into the game (people without two screens will find this painful) and you have to leave the game to browse for certain features of the game is completely stupid and honestly I haven't seen a game do this before for obvious reasons.

3. One of my friends had absoutely NO FOOD on his island and he ended up giving up.

Honestly I don't mind learning things and partaking in the game's certain special mechanics like its calorie systems but if you make the game super annoying from the get go (like no food on the island), it makes the game unplayable and enjoyable and you're just going to get people refunding it in 2 hours.

i'm sorry to hear that you didn't have a good experience with Eco.

I'll answer your questions one by one.

1. The slowing down only happens in area with a lot of high grass than you can remove and replace with infrastructure like roads. In Update 9.0 we introduce a Machete for doing this quickly, but the slow down is intended to encourage people to build infrastructure.

2. The Web Interface is there so that you can do stuff from out of the game. Eco was developed for usage in schools and this helped massively. In Update 9.0 most of the stuff on the Web UI can also be done ingame, especially laws will be ingame now.

3. This shouldn't happen and improvements were made to this in the new version. Nontheless, the game should tell you in the tutorial where the nearest food can be found.

4. Could you explain this point a bit more? If you're interested you can send me more detailed feedback to dennis@strangeloopgames.com or just add me on Steam.

15,66421212,english,"I'm at ~60 hours, I've only played on two private servers, I haven't played Singleplayer (if there is one)
This game is. So. Extremely. Complex.
On your first few minutes or even hours, it plays a lot like Minecraft, but a bit more realistically. Chop trees to build stuff, gather food, mine for ore. Build a little house. There's no way you can die, so you can't really ""fail"". Everything you do is just to improve your Level and your skills and your resources.

The goal is to collectively get advanced fast enough that you can stop the meteor, but I've also played on servers without meteor and honestly it doesn't really take anything away for me. The focus is on cooperation and constructive competition. You have to choose your profession, nobody can do everything, so you need someone to mine, someone to hunt, someone to deal with wood, someone to build machines, etc. Everyone can build a store and sell their stuff. Most servers have one single backed up currency. All of this makes for a very detailed capitalism-but-it-works simulation. Examples:
- If your store is at a convenient location, you can set your prices higher than if you're in the middle of nowhere
- If someone has the same profession as you, you need to figure out a way to stay in business together and not just undercut each others prices until you're both selling under value
- If you have enough seed money, you can just be an asshole and spend the whole day buying stores empty and sell their goods for higher prices

There's a government which is a direct democracy (although the owner of the server kind of has god/dictator rights), which means that people can propose laws and everyone can vote to pass them or not. The laws follow an algorithmic structure (If *do illegal stuff* -> then *consequence*) Laws can work with either fines/subsidies or just prevent some actions completely. Examples of laws we had:
- You have to pay a fine everytime you kill an endagered species
- You get some money everytime you clean up debris
- If you choose a certain profession you get a subsidy

The further your server progresses into more advanced technologies, the more crucial it is to work together or else it will take ages to get certain things done.
The environment is a big ass simulation where virtually everything you do has an impact. Fell too much trees in the area a species of animal lives in? Now their population numbers go down. There's pollution factors, if you pump too much CO2 in the atmosphere, the ocean levels will rise. Everytime you plant something you have to check if the ground has the right temperature, moisture level, nutrients. If you have monocultures the ground will become starved of the nutrients the plant needs the most and won't be fit for that plant so you have to use fertilizer or plant different plants there.

Your diet needs to be balanced, else you get less XP. You get more XP for more advanced food, so no living off campfire meat all game. There's housing system which also gives you extra XP the nicer your house is. But it also needs to be balanced between room categories and diverse, so no dumping 20 expensive chairs in a big hall for max XP.

I could go on for hours and I haven't even seen 20% of what this game is capable of. It. Is. So. Complex.

Of course it's not all perfect. I'm gonna list some downsides, but keep in mind that this is an early access beta and that the dev team is actively working on most of these issues.
- The dev team is pretty small, so development is slow compared to big companies (naturally)
- Performance is not optimized. Game can run very slow and you might need to turn graphics down to get stable fps
- Some stuff is still missing. You can't do much with fish for example.
- Wild animals behave weirdly and move erratic, making hunting a bit awkward (but still enjoyable)

And finally something that's always the problem with those kinds of games:

- Your server needs an active admin or admin team. Else the government can't do some stuff and you can get stuck for days because there's some stuff that needs to be done by the admins.
- You need an active community. Doesn't help if you start with 50 people and divide the professions equally when after 5 days there's no smelters anymore.

All in all I can 100% recommend this game if you enjoyed games like Minecraft or ARK and want a challenge that isn't so much traditional ""Gameplay difficulty"" (get better or else you die), but a very deep challenge of cooperation and community. Even in the state it's in right now I play every day and it's (and I know I'm repeating myself) SO. DAMN. COMPLEX. And I am very excited for the future.",1585832043,1585832043,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True,76561198059292357,93,1,3737,0,3733,1586522843,,

i'm sorry you didn't like the game. Unfortunately not every game can be for everyone, but maybe the addition of area of effect tools in Update 9.0 will decrease the strain for you.

Don't forget that you can also configure nearly everything in Eco, including the amounts of goods you need for crafting or the time to level up. This is especially recommended when you play singleplayer as Eco is balanced around a medium sized group playing collaboratively.

65,44344559,english,"This is an absolutely terrible game.

I could go on for hours but Steam won't let me due to character limits so I will keep this simple.

A wall doesn't even connect to the floor. How is this possible? It's 2020. People have been developing games for longer than your average programmers' age and somehow you can't figure out how to connect your walls to your floor units?  How many years of beta does this game have to be in for such a basic detail to be fixed? Even Minecraft got this right before they moved the game out of Beta over a decade ago and it was one overweight Swedish nerd doing all the work.
Even the stairs dont connect to the wall. They leave a big stupid looking gap. 

And what the hell is a ""cube"" when it comes to building? I have two friends in construction, I stooped to a dumb level and decided to ask them for shits and giggles wtf a ""cube"" is and they had no idea what I'm talking about, other than the generic geometric shape. Why did you put a cube in the game? It serves no purpose whatsoever. What happened to using blocks that are actually used in construction? Was that too complicated? 

And the storage space connections. It says on the wiki ""must be 9m"" but from/to what? 9m to the player, to the workbench, to another storage, to the tent? You need to specify wtf the radius relates to, or dont even have a stupid wiki.

Seriously, I am trying to learn this game, and due to giant leaps of logic and common sense, I am too reliant on the wiki, which isn't even close to being finished yet even though the game has been out wayyy to long for this to be acceptable, so basically it's like an instruction manual that has half the pages ripped out. WTF? Why cant you write your own help for the game instead of relying on a halfway dead fanbase? If it wasnt halfway dead, the wiki would be up-to-date and full of accurate information like most games.

I came back to this game after giving it an even worse review before, but this is just trash, and I don't see this game getting any better considering how long it has been out and how shitty the most basic mechanics are to figure out.

82,64613847,english,"I would like to first start out by saying, Eco is an incredible idea for a game with great developers who actually care about it. Being that it is such a great game, I ended up buying the Dev bundle from their website, well worth it to see this game succeed. However, the players that play it or run servers tend to be toxic. During my recent excursion into the world of Eco, I played on two official servers and four unofficial servers.

If you are new to the game and want to learn from the best players possible, either join the Eco official discord and ask questions or play on an official server. From my experience, there are incredibly nice players looking to help others on the official servers, while on unofficial servers, the admin will ban you for sneezing. 

Unofficial servers tend to die in this manner just a few days into the cycle and therefore are a massive waste of time to the new players of the game. In the 4 unofficial servers I played, 2 of them died before day 5 and I got banned from the other 2. The reason for the ban direct from the server owner: “Found to be abusing game mechanics, acquiring deeds/areas that you would not have access to. While they likely were traded by other players/friends, it’s is providing unfair advantage over others.” – I was playing with a small group (3) of friends, all new to the game. To avoid overlapping land claims in the game, since I was the one whom played the game before, I used their claims. At no point was there an abuse in game mechanics but simply put, I was showing my friends how to play and within 30 minutes, I, as well as my friends were banned. Admins also tend to use the admin commands more often then not. As I was playing late one night, the admin used the teleport command to return to his base and said “He was getting off for the night so he wanted to be in his base.” That was the first of many teleports I had seen him conduct. He ended up just giving himself a bunch of skillpoints to progress the game for himself.

Griefers: I really do not care if someone griefs a server by dumping tailings somewhere. There are in game mechanics to prevent that, but for some reason, no one wants to use them to prevent or deter others from doing so. If you don’t like someone dumping tailings, put a law up to prevent it in the future. This game is meant to be an in-depth sim, but no one wants the Eco-Terrorist to play. I find it more fun to have an additional threat to the world other than the meteor that takes 30 days to arrive. Having the added threat could increase or speed along the production of the needed resources for the community. 

Toxic: I attempted to host my own server under the premise “Do want you want, if the community does not like something you are doing, then make a law.” I had it up for a bit before I took it down due to multiple players coming from other servers to talk trash about it. Even a couple alt accounts from the guy that banned me above. I try to play the game to have fun and do not feel the need to be attacked for doing so. Turns out there are many “Server Wars” in Eco for some reason.
 
Overall amazing game, great concept and great dev team. 10/10 if you like Minecraft with a government. Just don’t play unofficial servers if you are new. Stick to official to learn, and then branch off.

There are a number of bugs, including one right off the bat during player creation which ended up putting smears of pitch black across the screen (just where you see the 3d preview of your character), eventually turning the whole screen black, which made it impossible to see the changes that took effect as I was making them; so I just randomly picked stuff. Luckily this did not happen during game play, and you can customize your player in-game.

It's like a substantive Mine craft. I can't get into Mind Craft, but this one keeps me wanting more.

And without selfishness, the concept of destroying the ecosystem is effortlessly solved by players who have any understanding of the game mechanics. The only real challenge is reigning in newbies from messing things up, but it's easy to do that in a way that quickly forces them to quit.

Further, the idea Eco is trying to implement doesn't work at the scale they're trying to implement it. Communities are too small, and lack meaningful competition between them, such that catching polluters is too easy. With little benefit to polluting (since it actively works against essentially the only goal the game offers) and a high likelyhood of being caught, the big morale dillema/government crisis the game markets itself over simply doesn't exist.

Some of these issues could be changed if eco's scale were on the order of hundreds of players instead of dozens. Some could be changed if there were win conditions between nations, or meaningful conflict (be that violence based or otherwise, there are more than one type).

But overall the game fails at what it sets out to achieve, even if you can enjoy this as a pretty minecraft esque social simulator in its own right.

thanks for your honest review.

Technically, Eco does not have a clear goal, the goal is ""The route is the goal"". While we do have a meteor to prevent, that can be disabled. The actual ""goal"" is just creating a working society that is able to work together from people you probably don't know and are spread all over the world. And that is a difficulty level around half of the servers are not able to beat.

I've been playing some thousand hours on my private account and one thing i saw on every single server is selfishness, it being expected with humans, so as far as that goes, i can't see where you are coming from. Maybe a different selfishness? A lot of people act selfish in economy, in governance and even when it comes to ecology. Lately, i saw a player sneaking his tailings into the mine someone else had digged out and just placed them there, as the mine was unclaimed. Stuff like this happens every day and is a big indicator of selfishness and the urge to get an advantage at any cost. Eco provides tools to fix that, be it ingame or via administrative tools (cause a lot of people actually deem both purposeful pollution as well as this griefing).

Eco is very configurable and adaptable. It's true that you need a big community to get the best experience, but Eco can also just be played in a group of friends not worrying too much about laws and economy - as a collaborative game.

While there is a competition on the bigger servers, the point of Eco actually is being collaborative. And your opinion seems to suggest that most of these are actually successful in that. Which is something good in my opinion. Eco wouldn't be fun if a majority of people would not collaborate. Still there is a few people that don't and that people have to be dealt with in a hopefully non-punishing way, and that works well.

The discussions i can see in chat are very representing of morale dilemmas and government crisises, be it the discussion of how economy should work or any other discussion that will likely have different opinions, be it a corrupt world leader, be it something else. Typically there is something going on at all times, just as in real life. And i've seen countless people quit, as this was too much for them already.

So, probably we are just playing on different servers or made largely different experiences - or you are expecting something else, probably way more hardcore than we offer. That's cool, as Eco is here to adapt to players needs. But aside of that, i wouldn't agree that we fail on the goals, i rather see your review as a proof that we actually reach the goal of working, collaborative servers.

There indeed is an issue with ecology though: Currently it is highly non-functional, therefore hard to leave a real footprint, this is fixed in 9.0 though, let's see how it goes then ;)

As a new player, progression has been very difficult. In my 28 hours, I've found myself stuck and unable to progress without a significant grind more often than not. I am generally not averse to games with steep learning curves, but those usually still provide a good deal of enjoyment even in failure. Sadly, that has not been my experience with Eco.

The game does a great job of allowing for a player driven economy, government, etc.,  but in the end it feels like I am playing a poverty simulator.  Try as I might to dig myself out, I can only just scrape by. It's an accurate simulation, but ultimately not very fun. I'm stuck in a dead-end profession with no profit to be had (the game doesn't allow you to respec)

I'm not giving up on Eco quite yet. Perhaps my issues are particular to the specific server on which I'm playing or perhaps a result of decisions made by the specific player government.

sorry to hear you didn't have a good experience with Eco.

It actually indeed depends very much on the server you are playing on, as players and therefore economy and governance will be very different on each server. On some, it's inexisting, on others very well regulated. I'd advise to try playing on one of the big community servers or the official servers, especially White-Tiger. Typically there are helpful people around that can get you kickstarted even when you had a bad start.

Also feel free to add me in steam or shoot a message to dennis@strangeloopgames.com if you have any specific questions that could help you get over the learning curve, we're here to help.

thanks for your review. I'm sorry you didn't like our game.

In case you are playing singleplayer we offer some new configuration options to change recipe costs and crafting time (which can also be used on multiplayer servers), maybe that is helping.

On paper, the ideas and everything are awesome, but the result is a cluttered mess with a counter intuitive UI. 

On top of that, do not expect to play this game alone or even with a few friends, everything about this game was made to be played on a large scale with many players to stimulate trade and economy, and justify the government and law system. 

Don't get me wrong, those are great mechanics but doesn't appeal to the casual gamer or people who don't like playing with tons of strangers. On top of that, aside science and nature (like the meteor) there is NO THREAT in this game. No npc to fight, no animals to hunt, there is no action what so ever.

45,62988758,english,"So far I can tell this game is great even not been fully ready, as it does not seems so far from because of gameplay options, already very fun and addictive. Some details could be improved but the dynamic of the game is great, it´s a Minecraft with a greater purpose. I could not find a server stable enough to finish a game but I could get the idea, it really simulates a true Economic system except from the social relationship complexities like how we really establishe property in the real world (via violence and later the State). But besides of that everything in the environment is well simulated like the animals, plants, farming, mining, housing, food, etc. Your actions will have effects short and long term, like how you clear an area for logging and reduce the animal population in some areas. So far there is not seasons and animal domestication, like no horses, cows, etc (but that is probably planned). The gaming concept of skill specialization show the importance of working in community and other decisions like sharing things, including your land, tools, resources.... How the currency work is also great which perfectly simulates a real world trading system from basic to advanced, for those who have basic understanding of economics you will understand what makes a currency and for example a central bank. As I said before the humam relationship are not similar to the real world but they are given in the scenario the game wants it to be, which is to resolve a common issue (which is not what we do most of the time). For that there is kind of true democracy where I hope the ones that contribute better will be celebrate, for that you can propose laws, be a leader, good trader and everything else. For example you can propose to protect and area or certain type of animal or plant that is going extinct and some many other things that are not even possible to imagine (altough I could not really easily understand the Law system which is a negative). Still a game, so laws cannot be broken in the current version, no law enforcement required so far (meaning there is not State). Overall I would say game is very fun, dynamic, addictive but also requires a lot of effort which I saw as negative for those who like casual games. Most of the matches (servers) are planned to last for 30 real day where you should grow your society economy level to be able to avoid the meteor colision, but there are mods and others options so I think there is infinite options to explore scenarios.

I feel like the amount of damage you do by merely existing in the world (trample damage) is a bit excessive, why are my feet killing plants when the bison over there has been walking around in the same area for days with no problem?  The skill trees also seems particularly weird.  I get needing everything to tie into each other but it really shouldn't require as much effort as it does to get the tech to make a loaf of bread.

That said the environment is beautiful and I am having fun.  I would like to make a couple of suggestions however:
Low tech composting for organic trash. It really shouldn't be this hard to get rid of plant seeds...they're seeds.  They're not going to corrupt the earth if I just throw them away.

Unlocking recipes for tools instead of just giving a new upgraded tool when you unlock the skill.  I pretty much have a bunch of broken iron tools now taking up inventory space because I haven't gotten the tech level to smelt iron to repair them yet.  Let me do this at my own pace and make the tools when I'm ready for them.

Simplifying skill trees...just a little.  Or at least not making every single skill tied together.  Like I said, it shouldn't be THAT difficult to bake bread.  Humans were making bread long before we had electricity, but here...we need it to make the flour required.  It's just...weird.

Things I love: Holy crap THANK YOU for pulling ingredients from nearby boxes for crafting instead of requiring me to hunt through everything and have it in my own inventory to craft something.  This is such a nice feature and saves so much frustration.
I'm also really glad that I can turn off the meteor.  I almost didn't buy the game because of that.  There's nothing wrong with it, but I prefer my games to not have timers.  I wouldn't get rid of the meteor, it's a good driving force for most players.  It's just not for me so I'm glad my play style is allowed.
The game is VERY pretty and the diversity of plants is really nice.  I'd like to see more animal species too, if possible.  Maybe more sea life?

There are too many flaws with this game, and the first is with development. For a game that was supposed to be at a commercial release level over a year ago, there's no completion date still, and updates are so few and far between (listed on website as 2 weeks but has been 4 months for 3 fixes on the last one)

The second is with the mechanics. For a game that supposedly wants you to control pollution and keep the world happy, its facebook-game-like resource and build scaling makes it feel more like they want you to kill the world fast. Many, many build paths in the tech tree make little to no sense, and without heavy modding this game is not only no fun, but a complete and utter waste of time.

Shaping up to be another ARK early access fiasco, avoid this game at all costs. Keep playing minecraft or something else. The dev's don't care, it costs far too much for what it is, and when you point out to them that jobs are half done they abuse you. (in relation to a post about a simple text popup that wasn't changed in an update creating confusion)

Garbage.... utter garbage

In response to the somehow allowed developer response, 
""Given it is simulating a real world in real time for a specific amount of days, crafting needed to take time in the world to make sense in regards to the design goals we had""

Early civs managed to smelt iron producing thousands of kilos and yes, they produced some pollution as they had no idea of the effects they were having on the environment. This was localized and in the end wasn't a great amount on a global scale.

In game, they had a mechanic to control pollution from such methods, which real world works, and replaced it with a method that requires you to produce a much larger amount of pollution, takes around 10-15x longer, and is possible to completely destroy your local environment whilst waiting for the method to be completed.....

i'm sorry that you didn't like our game.

You are correct that development currently is slower than usual, that is due to our goal to fix as many bugs for 9.0 as we can and especially as we try to improve the situation with performance for some players which requires a lot of backend changes. We detailed those on one of our newsletters, given this stuff is usually boring for normal players.

We also recently edited our Early Access area on Steam, stating a new expectation for leaving Early Access. Generally, Eco is not meant to ever be a finished game, as we plan it to be a forever-game that we will continously change and develop as long as players are still interested in it. The game is already fully playable but contains bugs and needs more balancing that we want to flesh out together with our community. We also have some more features we want to introduce before we are happy to call a version ""1.0"", which is the reason Eco stays in Early Access for now.

In regards to the game systems that is a very subjective opinion which i can neither oppose nor agree to. Eco was designed exactly like it is for a reason and there is enough players that like it to be like that. Given it is simulating a real world in real time for a specific amount of days, crafting needed to take time in the world to make sense in regards to the design goals we had. It has nothing to do with mobile games at all and works quite fine for our players. It's no problem that you don't like that, not every game is made for everyone as we can't make everyone happy. But it's definately fun for a lot of people and not garbage at all ;)

Be assured we do care. Price is a subjective thing and while i personally calculate the price i'm willing to pay per hour played (and you have lots of those), you might do differently, that's fine, in our opinion the game is priced well, especially as the Early Access does finance the development and doesn't go into shareholders pockets as profit.

I actually have no idea to what you post you are referring and what ""abuse"" allegedly happened there? Feel free to add me on Steam to tell me more about that or send me an e-mail to dennis@strangeloopgames.com and i'll take a look and hopefully can clear it up.

I'm only 5 hours in and still at what I would consider the very beginning of the game.  Is there grinding?  OF COURSE, but there is always grinding in a building game.  What I love is there is nothing trying to kill you (at least as of yet) as you try to build your little world.  I've only played single player mode, but I can see enjoying it with my friends as well.  Another thing I am really pleased with are the developers.  If you look through the discussions you can usually tell the developers that care from the ones that don't.  These developers are always answering questions and working to help anyone who needs it.  Are there some bugs in the game?  Sure, but you should expect that in early access.  I haven't come across any yet that are game limiting.

79,62400447,english,"I first played this game when it came out in early access almost two years ago.
There's been new stuff added, some stuff tweaked, but largely it feels and acts very similarly now as it did two years ago.
The idea behind it, the tech trees, the laws , economy system and the ecology system are all really cool ideas, which mostly functions really quite well, but it is not without flaws.

In short, the flaws, as many other reviews have pointed out already is that there are some bugs (which is to be expected, it is early access after all), and it suffers from fairly bad memory leaks.
Basically, when I login I can have settings on max and easily do 100+ fps, but an hour or two later I could be running the lowest settings (and really, it's very low settings, it looks like a game from the late 90s) and struggle to stay over 20fps. It works better if you stay in the same general area that you logged in at, without moving away from there much at all, but start to travel to go buy some food, hunt some animals, go to your mine to get some iron etc and performance quickly goes down into the dump. If you are going to play this game, you need to restart the game at least once every hour or two, it doesn't matter if you've got a beast of a computer.

The good? Everything else. Really, if you're okay with restarting the game fairly often, and don't mind the few minor bugs which are fairly easy to deal with, I'd say give this game a go. If you are into the survival genre of games, this is a unique one that offers something none of the others do, and I've played most of them. It only shows me having played the game for about 100 hours at the time of writing this review, but I've played a bunch on the client downloaded directly from their webpage, so there's at least 3-4 times as many hours actually played in total.

This is not a game for everyone, there is a lot of things you need to consider, and chances are that you're going to make some mistakes in your first playthough. And unlike other survival games, your mistakes has consequences on the world you play in and on the character you play as, so you could end up in a situation where it's very difficult, if not impossible, to recover from it. If that's you, take what you learned and you'll do a lot better next time.

TL;DR, Do you like survival games? Are you interessed in playing the most unique one of them all (in a good way)? Are you okay with restarting the game once every hour or so to fix memory leak issues that lags u? If so, I'd say you should absolutely try it.

thanks for your review.

We updated the looks and usability of UIs in 9.0 a bit. We hope it would fit your expectations more, but we know that Eco is a UI heavy game which can hardly be avoided. If you have any ideas on what we could do to make UIs better in your opinion feel free to send me a message on Steam or via mail to dennis@strangeloopgames.com, though.

The game is made by a small studio by the way that did invest a LOT of hours into the game, not a one-man dev. The things you criticize are actual design choices. We know that a not small amount of players do not like that, but we actually target the players that do. Eco is not meant to be easy, but meant to be focused on the player, actual work and collaboration to overcome the difficulties you have as a single player.

thanks for your review and your high playtime, we appreciate that.

I know that development currently seems outright slow, but that is actually due to the reason that we want to fix the bugs you are talking about as well as get the performance issues in check which unfortunately can't be done really fast as it needs a lot of background work to be done.

Unfortunately it's also not always possible to get a good trade-off between fixing bugs and improving background systems for performance while implementing features at the same time, without them having bugs. That's exactly the reason why the major update takes some more time this time.

We do have plans to go on with more, but smaller updates after release of 9.0, but a lot of work on Eco is done on several tasks in parallell as most stuff cannot be worked on by the same person at the same time. This also leads to our updates being rarer, but much bigger.

I hope you consider taking another look on Eco after 9.0 is out :)

First off, the core concepts of the game do not matter. You can hunt animals endlessly as they never go extinct, you can pollute nearly endlessly with almost no consequences.
the only server that is a true challenge is the official server that just makes the recipes for the endgame laser super expensive and a massive grind to do, considering this game is a massive grind anyways its just making it harder for the sake of making it hard, not through content.

Roadmap is ignored, Community is ignored in the most part by the developers and they have even added a moderator to their discord that leaves negative reactions/emojis  on questions about content that the developers have promised for nearly 2 years now 

Not only is the development super slow (1 buggy content adding update in the last year), but you arent getting a ""quality over quantity"" approach, the patches lack polish, frequently make the game unplayable, there are constant issues with the games auth servers preventing EVERYONE from logging on. People with high end hardware not being able to get 60 frames on low settings when in a built up town.

The official servers crash and go through drop cycles just like every server the game is hosted on.  no one can get this game to work properly on a server without issues, not even the people that made the game. 

I hope you like mining, because thats 90% of what you are going to do if you are a high hour player.

Want to do laws? Well have fun with the buggy webpage that takes an hour to make a law with any complication whatsoever, also good luck explaining your laws to anyone that cant do atleast basic code once they get past a certain degree of complexity. Oh yeah, and if your law passes and the admin of the server you are on isnt a fan of it.. well they are just going to delete it regardless of what the server population thinks.

You will expect big towns with atleast 50 people, You will be hard pressed to find a server with 20 active people past day 4. All servers die out very quick after the meteor is shot down and there are groups that play completely minimalist to rush this and then leave the server to die.

The ocean is useless and covers like 70% of the planet.

I could go on and on about this game but for one simple reason that is really the nail in the coffin for me is that games like this, give people a bad taste in their mouth about early access games, they make people not want to support saaller indie studios because they are afraid they are just purchasing another ECO, Even the steam page uses a picture of something that isnt implemented in the game yet (the alligator).

Maybe when 9.0 comes out these issues will be fixed and this review will be irrelevant but as of now, If you can deal with crap frame rates, constant bugs ect and development that doesnt really listen to the player base, and have atleast 20 hours a week to play you might find it worth it, if you care about any of those things dont buy it.

The skill system is to encourage people to specialize in a profession and trade between each other. One of the benefits of this is the complexity is cut you only really need to understand one little chunk of the game to thrive. Unfortunately right now if you tweak the skill numbers or play with a small number of people and do all the jobs there will be a lot to take in. We have plans to do more to make the single player experience fun but a lot of those area way out, we are currently focused on other parts of development.

For you last point about having to wait a lot I do have a small amount of good news. Right now have a sleeping in active development. When implemented it will allow the player to jump forward in time speeding up things like skill gain and crafting.

Anyways, thanks again for everything. I recommend keeping an eye on our updates, we will be adding features that address some of your issues.

If you wish to have a longer read:

I've watched multiple streamers play this and ofcourse played it myself. One thing you have to keep in mind: It's an EARLY ACCESS GAME. Yes you can stumble upon a few bugs, but they won't make the game unplayable. (I personally had problems with fishing and when chasing animals they seem to turn into ""headless chikens"" making it hard to hit them. I hope the animal AI gets reworked at some point)

It's perfect community environment. Trading, specializing in different categories (farming, forestry, tailoring, smithing etc.) and co-operation to advance in technology. If your server/game is set on high co-operation you'll see that getting skill points may be quite slow, but that is the factor that forces you to specialize in something and work together with others. 
Low co-operation on the other hand earns you skill points a lot faster and you can do everything solo, but you don't have to...

There's a complex environmental system. Hunting too many bisons for example may lead to their extinction. Too much CO2 from machinery and factories will lead to rising temperature and so on.. 
...but players can propose laws to limit these things. You just have to experience it yourself.
 
This game is getting updates. I've seen the schematics and plans on Eco's FB and It's great to see that they're adding cool late game machinery and vehicles and also improving stuff that's already in game. They have a vision and know what they want to achieve. At the same time they listen to the playerbase and appreciate all the feedback.

In conclusion it's [strike] a bit pricey, but in my opinion, [/strike] worth it. It's better playing it with friends or you can join a server and find other people to play with, but singleplayer experience is also enjoyable. (I suggest starting in  SP first so you'll get the hang of the game and understand the basics) There's in game tutorials aswell.

It's great.  It's still in development at the time of this review, so take that into consideration before purchasing, but even with it's current bugs and oddities, it's fully playable and enjoyable.

Imagine Minecraft, but no death or enemies.  Your enemy looms overhead in the form of a meteor in an orbital decay with your peaceful world.  You and your friends (or just you, it's possible to play solo or duo), must work together to advance your civilization to save your planet from the meteor by developing a giant laser to blast it out of the sky.  Go from raw veggies, fruit and charred meat to gourmet meals.  Go from stone age tools to modern excavators, tractors and trucks.  All of this while not destroying your planet through pollution, deforestation, etc.

They have intentionally broken playing this game offline, even when connecting to a server on the same machine running the game.

Reply to SLG-Dennis;

Hello Dennis,

It's nothing you can apolegise for really as it's not really the games fault, as stated in the review, the game itself is fun, otherwise I wouldn't have played it for 300 hours. 

I have tried both. 

I had the reset thing happen 4 times to me now on community servers (this includes two rather large ones).

I tried the official Sea-Otter server I believe, we might've spoken on discord even. I was there right when the server started anew beeing one of the  first players to join. The problem with the official server is that the difficulty is so hardcore only the most experienced players need apply. The said experience players were literally dividing up the economy amongst them selves in chat right from the start and you cannot compete with them as they know all the tricks. All fair I suppose, them beeing the more experienced players. But no place for anyone else to even try to do anything.

Mind you I have nearly 300 hours in this and I cannot compete with that. (Gitgud, amirite?)

As for constructive criticism;

Perhaps a way to locally save the server data so you can open it up on your own server and play on without the reset/rollback.

I will give this game another go as the 9.0 update rolls out and I can host my own Linux based dedicated server, provided I have the time. I might even adjust my review.

i'm sorry you had some bad experiences with community servers.

Have you ever tried some of the bigger community servers, that typically do reset votes? Or one of our official servers with guaranteed uptime?

Like in most other games, community servers are not managed by us, so it's the decision of the owner how long he rents the server and if and when he wants a new map.

players cannot be deleted from the server (you can of course ban them, though), as they are referenced in the database on countless occasions.

Clearly it is possible to play as solo, but most things in game gets much better when there is more players on server. Sadly like for me it is possible that server owner takes it offline for some reason just when you have used some days to get everything up and running.

Pros:
- A lot things to craft
- How it pretty much forces people to do co-operation
- Has a lot build-in tools to let people to work together in many different ways
- Graphics are nice
- Like more serious ""Minecraft clone""

Cons:
- If playing solo, this game gets really boring really fast (no even bots etc. to play with)
- Maybe a bit too tight limitations to some things. Not sure if can mod this to workaround

thanks for your review.

While we are aware of performance issue and working on a big update to sort the majority of them out, i'm not sure you'll receive better performance with that. The 8750 is a SoC processor for laptops and quite weak if used with a cpu intensive game as Eco is as it only offers low frequencies.

We hope to be able to improve that also a bit, but 40 FPS seems quite fine for that hardware, actually, as it's not a GPU but a CPU limit.

danke für deine Bewertung.

Wir planen bereits mit Update 9.0 eine Menge neue Deko-Objekte und Blöcke zum Bauen hinzuzufügen, vielleicht macht das das Spiel für dich interessanter.

Hinsichtlich des Schwierigkeitsgrades ist es so, dass Eco für Multiplayer entwickelt wurde. Den Singleplayer bieten wir aufgrund vieler Nachfragen an, er ist aber kein Entwicklungsfokus. Natürlich versuchen wir dennoch ihn zu verbessern und bieten mit Update 9.0 einen Multiplikator für die Kosten und die Zeit beim Craften an.

i'm sorry to hear that the game feels too slow for you?

Were you playing in Singleplayer? Eco is intended to be played in multiplayer and balanced around that, but you can adjust nearly everything in Eco. Update 9.0 also adds in a multiplier for crafting costs and crafting time to further customize the game experience to your liking.

If you have any more detailed feedback, feel free to add me on Steam or send me an e-mail to dennis@strangeloopgames.com.

- no real gameplay content added since early access release, just only quality of life changes
- spreading ideas and promises which never got in game.

i'm sorry for your experience. Unfortunately games on steam are bound to steams refund policy in opposite to games bought on our website directly where refunds are handled nicer. We can't refund games on steam ourselves.

We're aware of these issues you mention for some players and most of them should be improved very much in 9.0, so it might be worth checking back after we released that version, if you like the game concept in general.

Devs came though and fixed almost all of the issues I had with this title. No more dropping from servers, no more unplayable lag. So, this game now stands up there with some of my all time favorites.

Only issue still remaining is the framelate loss after playing for a few hours. Seems to stem from how much of the map you walk across since connecting to server. I will connect at 60 fps, and an hour or so later I will be at 25 fps. This isn't a huge issue since disconnecting and connecting again restarts this. It's just a minor inconvenience to people that play this too much.

I can now completely recommend this game to anyone that enjoys a building kind of community-driven game. Even minecraft players can find a much more vast title to enjoy while not moving far from what they love.

OLD REVIEW:
Game is great, but the net code desperately needs to be fixed. This issue is turning me, and all your other supporters away.

There were issues pre 7.4. But even with framerates in the teens, and constant bugs, we could at least stay connected to a server.

Stop updating pointless things like wood pulp models and iron ore thumbnails and fix the damn netcode. Please.

We were actually working on network, server, fps and bug fixes for 8.1 and will continue to do so for 8.2. Take a look at the game after the patch released yesterday and see if it has improved for you :)

39,59241392,english,"Summary: A great game that simulates our own physical and economical world on a micro scale that is easy to digest and fun to play if you like building games that reward patience, planning and cooperation this is for you. It plays best with a group of people committed to the game, it is not a 2-3 hour casual experience but should be carefully planned with a community as a month long game-play experience.

Game-play: Think Minecraft with pollution, limited resources, vehicles, specialized crafting tables, governments with player made laws and a robust skill tree. You will build a virtual community with other players and cooperate (hopefully) to advance your technology, pool resources and build a nation from the ground up. To top it all off, in 30 real time days an asteroid is going to destroy the planet and only by reaching the height of technology can you stop it.

Pros:

+ grindy but fun resource gathering mechanics (some careers are more fun than others)
+ skill tree makes each player useful if done right and cross dependencies are a must
+ the game has an ingenious economy and property management system completely player controlled
+ if you have a good community to play with the game can be a ton of fun as you collaborate to reach world goals, make roads, 
   government buildings, shopping malls etc.
+ overall this game plays like a mini 30-day MMO when played right

Cons:

- not a good single player experience or even with 2-3 friends
- largely dependent on community you play with being active
- some pretty big bugs and glitches
- very easy for players to grief other players or the entire server (good admin is very important)
- can be a steep learning curve for some
- developers are slooooooow to update, it's been a very long time since a significant update was released
- performance can sometimes be pretty bad considering how basic the graphics are",1575493738,1575493738,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True,76561197976477150,127,10,23579,1450,18832,1601906141,,
40,59227960,english,"ECO was the game that I was looking for, for so long; yet I feel like it's still not the game that it supposed to be.

I was very excited about the common goal, and the skill system. At first I thought the roads and buildings might bring a good task for the community. I also like the room/xp system.

At my first run I learned a lot of course. But it felt like I had to do everything on my own. I spent a lot of time on building a road to the city, and later managed to moved to the city, but that didn't changed anything game experiencewise. Players had a lot of rescources. I didn't feel like I could contribute to the community even in some noob way. I didn't even see a proper community. Some players traded and talked, but the destructuion of the meteor, or polluting the environment wasn't importaint. I think the whole fragile environment feature is exadurated. Trees grow slow. That's it.

On my second run, I started in the city center. I wanted to figure out farming/cooking, because it looked a legit bussiness. By the end of the game I achieved what I wanted, but I still didn't felt any need for cooperation, any major community decisions, or any community achievement. Everyone building their own little buildings - I must assume through horrible grinding - and the roads and the meteor is handled by a handful of players.

Maybe I didn't get to the best servers. Maybe there are other ways to play this. Change my mind :) I want to feel that I'm importaint in the community, even if just on a low level.

46,45064582,english,"Update: I thoroughly enjoyed this game for a second time and put another 60-ish hours into it in the last few weeks. But I wouldn't recommend it. It's been over a year since I last played it and I couldn't tell you a single feature that I didn't see before.

The biggest problem is progression. It starts off wonderful, but once you want to manufacture iron there is a TREMENDOUS hurdle before you can actually use ANYTHING made of iron. And the next tier requires a ton of gigantic machines that must be in very expensive structures to function, and they just produce one or two parts (like steel gears).

You spend the entire game thinking ""Oh man I can't wait until we get an excavator!""

By the time you can build an excavator, you can finish the game. It is the same tier. Not to mention the excavator is super janky to control. If another player uses it, then you get back inside of it and change to control the arm, THE OTHER PLAYER CAN'T MOVE FORWARD OR BACKWARD. Such a terrible bug, but it's still there! And people just deal with it by disconnecting, so it's probably not on the developers list of bugs.

It is so, so heart breaking. The game needs to be rebalanced and flow better. Why does it take so effing long to get a truck, and why do you not get a powered cart until after a truck? It's worse than a truck in every way, visible on a lower tier crafting table, but it's much more difficult to make so you can't get it until late in the game.

And don't get me started on the lag that builds up. You have to restart your game every 20 minutes because the FPS slowly crawls from 60fps down to an unbearable 12fps. Seems to be a massive performance bug with stockpiles / connected inventories.

Avoid this game, I doubt it will ever get fixed.

For one thing I vastly overestimated the game's stability.  I had touted Eco's engine as ""rock solid"", whereas more experience with the game has shown that to be very far from the case. 
 In fact, if anything it's less stable now than when I first reviewed it.

Nevertheless, I still believe that in many ways Eco really is superior to Minecraft, and not just because it's got an additional decade of graphics technology at its disposal.  It's got some novel building mechanics, and the fact that you can't die is quite refreshing in a game of this type.  Plus, it's built from the ground up with sophisticated multiplayer mechanics and a well-defined modding API, which Minecraft STILL inexplicably lacks.

My interest in Eco has tailed off substantially as updates have decreased in frequency, and I'm a bit worried that development may be abandoned before it's finished.

The main reason why i stopped playing are the cataclysmic update. You play a new server, those who appears in less then 5 days, easy peasy... you start a big project.. BAM update. server is now empty forever. you reset server, BAM fun again.. update... broken again. Its a eternal reset with no completion.

Yes theres that IO webserver to avoid loosing the IP when that happens... But lets get things strait. People are idiots. They want it dumb simple or they wont even try it. So maybe like what 10% of the eco community will be smart enaught to use IO server to avoid loosing the IP. And am being really generous here. Reality is they wont come back. cause they are on that new server that started 5 days ago again.

Thats not all.. UPDATE that break the login itself. How many time must i wait until they fix that broken system? You play on a server, bam cant get in no more. You dunno if its a ban, a glitch, a update that messed up your local config. FIX IT!! And no game are fun when they have remote loggin access that are often broken and wont permit you to play in solo on your own, local PC as server. Thats just plain SAD.

Then there those update that break BASIC fonction in the game. Like being visible to ohers? Water that cannot be fished! Took then weeks before fixing all this.

I actually went as far as buying myself my own server for awhile and try to understand what i could do to run a stable server, avoiding update if possible and gathering people. But Nope. The community, the so called dev, and way to much players in this.. TOXIC.

Even if they fixed this now. Too late. You made me hate this game.
No game shoudl be this broken and sold on any plateform. Even if its itill n developpement.

i'm not quite sure what you mean. There haven't been Eco Updates since the last one in August as we prepare 9.0 at this moment. There can't have been any updates causing the behaviour you describe.

Also, even when a update comes out, it does not at all make servers unavailable. Servers generate a server-id that is permanent at first launch, that is saved in Network.eco. This allows players to keep the servers in their favourite list even when the server changes IP - allowing servers with changing IPs to just work fine. Updates have no influence on that, either.

What you describe happens on some server hosters that fail to save the server ID and reset it every time the server is restarted. This is a failure of the server host and not of Eco. I'd be very interested in which circumstances you had that occuring and what did happen in detail, feel free to mail me to dennis@strangeloopgames.com if you want to elaborate on that.

Same for your next statement. There have been NO updates that could have broken anything. You can't login to servers when either our authserver is down or steam is down. (Which happens regularily at their maintenance days) Our authservers didn't have a single downtime in the last weeks. I'm not saying we never have any downtimes, as that would be plain wrong - but there hasn't been one in the last weeks.

I can only say that most of what you're experiencing is not happening to the vast majority of players - i've actually never heard it before.

We did have an update quite a while (months) ago that did break user visibility, but that was fixed via hotfix asap, not in weeks. I'm not aware of an issue with fishing. You can only fish in ocean water, though. Which was intended, but has been changed a bit in the upcoming update.

73,57784779,english,"I pick this up on a whim, and thought I'd give it a try. Since doing so I've also picked up a few AAA games, but I can't tear myself away from ECO to go try them. ECO is different. It is similar to Minecraft only in the block type nature of the terrain, and the textures make it much prettier to look at. 

Some of the points I like the most:
* The skill system allows you to level up by doing things. 
* You are rewarded by eating well
* You are rewarded for building a nice house.
* You are encouraged to be mindful of the ecosystem. 
* Farming is complicated, and requires a lot of thought. 
* There is much to learn, and it seems that the community has yet to solve many of the in-game challenges.
* The game feels complete as it is, yet there is plenty of room for added complexity and modding.

I have a feeling I will be playing this for a long time. At the time of this writing I'm 470 hours in, and I don't feel like I've scratched the surface.

Any other game that says ""player driven economy"" is a joke compared to this one. In Eco you are responsible for creating the economy, agreeing(or not) on a common currency and using it to buy and sell anything.
Many aspects players create such as economy, politics, industry, ecology and how they interact with each-other and the problems they create mimic the real world behavior of humans very well. So it's up to the players to understand these issues and cooperate to build a working society and win the game.

The game starts at 100FPS but within a couple of minutes it drops down to 20FPS, and within a couple of hours it drops down to 15FPS(I even tried to play it on the highest end gaming PC I could get my hands on). This means I constantly have to restart the game. Even though I have 32GB of RAM, the game has also crashed because of out of memory errors many times.

thank you for your review and your expressed high interest in the game.

We're aware of these issues and working on them. As we've published in a newsletter in much technical detail a month ago, this will take several major updates to correct, as a lot of backend stuff needs to be changed. In addition, we need a stable version of Unity DOTS to improve multithreading capabilities that we are in dire need of, but it's unfortunately not available yet. Eco is a very cpu-intensive game by design and we hope to be able to use newest technology and our changes to have a much better experience for you as soon as possible.

i'm sorry you didn't like our game, but it seems like our game is just not for you.

Eco is a simulation. Room requirements are there to link buildings with an actual use (in opposite to most ""competitor games""). I haven't seen industry in the wild yet, either. Even the local middle ages smith presenting old-school smithing has a roof above his anvil. I'm not sure if i would like to work on stones when it's raining either.

If you wouldn't have to build buildings, you wouldn't need them at all (aside for XP, but you probably wouldn't like that either) - that'd be very boring indeed. Especially for the economy aspect of the game, which would no longer have any building resources needed.

Pretty much the same applies for food. Any action you do costs you calories that you need to stock up again. It's fitting the simulation goal and allows to build economy around food.

Did you know you can adjust the difficulty and XP gain via config files to your likings? Our default is orientied to what we feel most players will like, but unfortunately this does not apply to everyone, so we made it possible for you to configure this to your liking. Update 9.0 additionally will introduce a crafting time and resources multiplier that allows you to even more adjust it to your likings.

I did everything profession-wise and all of them have their unique feeling and they can be very rewarding and fun. I was the World Leader multiple times on the official servers and I had a lot of fun taking care of the people's needs and making sure there is fair play.

I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this game for people who like trading, relaxing, hunting, farming, mining, crafting, building, chatting (and a lot of other things) in a game, be it casual or hardcore.

Pros:

- diversity of trading (stores, contracts, taxes, wages, currency minting, etc.)
- complex crafting and building
- rewarding professions
- housing and food exp influencing your whole progress (more trading since you can't craft everything by yourself)
- politics (government, laws, voting system, taxes, etc)
- high replayability (new games, new professions, new people, new politics, new opportunities)
- high variety of vehicles for transporting goods or traveling (from wheelbarrows to excavators)
- pollution modifying the fertility and aspect of the land and water (air and ground pollution)
- rewarding road building (road tiers influence vehicle speed)
- role playing (you can be anything depending on your choices and devotion... from a peasant to a big factory owner, a master chef, an engineer, a minister, a world leader, etc.)
- playing solo or in a group are both rewarding
- simple and efficient land claiming
- great progression (researching, unlocking new professions, new recipes, being more efficient on recipes, etc)
- one of the best (if not the best) graphics in a sandbox voxel game

Cons:

- it requires a relatively strong PC
- performance issues (you will have to restart the game from time to time duo to memory leak)
- bugs (slow chunk loading can result in falling in the ground with your vehicle if you don't slow down)
- politics can have a bad impact on the server if you choose the wrong World Leader (but you can choose a new one) 
- some servers shut down earlier than promised or have admin abuse (I recommend you to play on official servers and join the official ECO discord channel)
- low population on some servers especially if the world is older than a week
- most servers die out by day 7-15
- it could feel grindy if you don't know how to be efficient
- the Tutorial doesn't teach you enough (ask from other players)

My 2 cents: give everyone access to basic survivalist skills like lumbering, mining, gathering, and basic construction.  Then utilize the occupations for super specialization.  Going from level 1 to level 7 seems modestly meaningful at best right now.  Force us to specialize so we get big enough bonuses that collecting mats doesn't feel like an ungodly grind.  And by being super specialized it forces more cooperation which really is the point, isn't it?  Then the city builds outward to satisfy appetite for resources rather than a bunch of homesteads desperately trying to build roads to one another before they can trade even basic resources.

Few other suggestions:

1) start all players in the same area.  Seriously, to trade and coordinate we all need to be together (or nearby) and starting a new world only to have to trek to the other hemisphere is a pain.

2) stores and market need a UI overhaul.  Trying to find a market with the exact item you're looking for shouldn't be this difficult (check out eve online market tool, for example)

3) hover-over popups should disappear the moment i'm not hovering over them anymore

4) maybe scale meteor progression with active play-time?  knowing that i MUST commit 4h / day just to keep up with progression to stay relevant makes it feel like a chore.  Then when I miss 2 days I'm so far behind there's no reason to log back in to that server.  

5) The xp tools work well toward this goal (playing less one day doesn't put you xp-behind), but it does put you progression behind because the xp does so little.  Let me add additional stars to my ONE occupation for BIG bonuses.  That way when I come back I can mine/farm/timber faster to catch up.

All in all, great game, but shelving it until the grind problem is addressed.  Thanks and keep up the great work.

13,48896977,english,"The game has great potential. However I think the game took a huge step back in 8.0. I’m not sure what the Devs were thinking when they implemented some of the new changes. The game is fun, however with all the current issues, I will not leave a positive review. This [u] does not [/u] mean that I think the game is a lost cause. I still plan on playing the game. Especially when there’re new updates/fixes. As the game updates, I will update my review. 

[h1] CONS: [/h1]
Poorly optimized: 
[strike] Since the 8.0 update, I have TERRIBLE FPS. In previous versions of the game, I ran 50-60 FPS. With the current version, I max out at 15 FPS. The world loads in chunks slowly, to the point where I walk 15-20 steps I need to wait for it to load the next chunk. [/strike] -Fixed

[strike] There also is a huge memory leak issue as well. Immediately upon starting the game, my memory ranges 12-15GBs in usage. [/strike] -Fixed 

[u] Skill Point system: [/u]
The game no longer rewards players for being active in the game. It’s now a “level up while offline” game. No matter what you do, you cannot level up any faster, after you’ve eaten/created house items. You simply cannot do anything until the next day (sometimes longer) until you have the next available skill point to spend.  

[u] Ores/Foliage/New Rock types: [/u]
[strike] Currently there are major problems with the world generator. Most of the servers that updated to 8.0 have bugged ores, which won’t spawn at all. [/strike] -Fixed

[strike] Ore is now also very sporadic with their spawning (when they do spawn). Ore doesn’t form in one’s and two’s in real life. There are natural seams of it. In 8.0 the Devs for some reason decided to remove seems all together. [/strike] -Fixed (mostly)

Foliage is a joke. There is so much tall grass around, you can’t even see anything on the ground. Foliage needs to be cut in half with its current height. 

[strike] New rock types, have virtually zero usage. Basically no new crafting recipes use them. All they seems to do is get in your way and slow you down (especially since there are some that you can’t even break with an iron pick) [/strike] - Fixed

[u] Disappearance of items: [/u]
[strike] Numerous times I have cut trees down, and when I go to chop them into smaller pieces the tree just disappears. Nothing like chopping a Redwood tree 160 times, just to have it self-delete. [/strike] -Fixed

[strike] Crafting tables/carts vanish. [/strike] - Fixed

[strike] Players also stop loading into the world. [/strike] - Fixed 


[h1] PROS: [/h1]
[u] Concept: [/u]
Wonderful original idea for the survival/sandbox type of game. I enjoy problem solving. If you do too, then this game could be enjoyable for you. 

[u] Collaboration: [/u]
Working with other player in this game is a must. It creates a great community within a server. Knowing that you need to rely on other players to trade is pretty fun. It gives players a purpose/role to play in each server.

thank you for your very detailed review - much appreciated.

I'm going to answer each point one by one.

1. We are aware of some performance issues and are already working on them, feel free to leave me a message to further investigate this issue, though.

2. The new skill system is made to do exactly the opposite of what you experience. Until now you had to wait until you get skillpoints and people regularily just waited until they have some. Now you only have to wait for specialisation points, but can level up efficiency of your specialisation by actually doing things in the game. As far as we can see this lead to people playing way more than before. Probably you are playing with a smaller group and / or want to be able to do more specialisations on your own as the game was designed for? In that case you can increase the rate at which you gain new profession points by altering the values in the difficulty.eco config file on your server.

3. The ore generation unfortunately had an issue for bigger than default worlds in the latest patch, this has been fixed in the hotfix today. It requires a newly generated world, though. We're very sorry for this. It should work just fine now.

4. The new rock types can all be used for mortared stones and some of them already have recipes. All of them can be used to create the normal stone which is used in most crafting recipes. This will change later on, when we have system in place that allows us to give you the option which kind of stone you want to add to the recipe, so it makes no more difference. For now, you need to convert them to normal stone.

5. Disappearing of carts, logs and players is also a known issue, it is being worked on right now and will be fixed in the next hotfix.

Feel free to message me at dennis@strangeloopgames.com or add me as friend, if you have any further issues or questions.

thanks for your review.

Regarding the species that go extinct i assume you are referring to three of them that simply go extinct, as a biome for them is missing that comes back in the next update. Them going extinct is not blocking any progress, which is why we decided to not take them out of the game. The world ecosystem generally stays very stable for the first days, but then it can fluctuate a bit, which is not uncommon on real earth either.

Regarding the moderators: Those are community volunteers. It's impossible they know everything. They aren't employees and even of those not everyone knows how the simulation works in every detail, simply because people work on different things and the simulation is quite complex.

I'm sorry that you feel like our game is too workload-heavy for you, but we indeed play our game and we're absolutely confident that the stuff we want to add is indeed liked by the majority of our players, as Eco was supposed to be a complex game from the very beginning. You could take some well-known and extremely popular minecraft tech mods, if you wanted to compare. (And we are nowhere near that complexity) I'm quite sure there is lots of people that like exactly that. It's also a logical step needed to introduce more balanced professions that all have enough possibilitites for players to enjoy them long-term, because currently some professions simply have too little content to be useful over the course of a whole game cycle, as it is expected in Early Access. Also, don't forget that the machinery also allows to dig much more efficient with area-of-effect tools (Update 9.0) and heavy vehicles (already there) when you progress in the game.

50,55744724,english,"Eco is a Great game with some obvious flaws.
It is a game about cooperation and working together to balance a world, stop a disaster and hopefully have fun. Soloing is harder but not impossible in some instances if the economy on the server is looked after and the people planning it are intelligent. If you like boundless, creativerse, minecraft etc you might like this, if you like the cooperative aspects of those titles.

I got this game about 2 days ago (and as of writing this review) have thrown nearly 14 hours into the game. I'm trying to do a solo run in 60 days (its hard but its doable) alot of the negative reviews this game has is for earlier versions and people haven't seemed to have played the game since - probably to lazy - so most can be voided. There are a few issues and the community developer Dennis has discussed alot of the fixed issues that have happened in the past. The singleplayer works remarkably well, its massively challenging and it is really grindy but worth it for every landmark you reach. As with all early access games there is a fair share of bugs (apparently) but i've only run into about 2 so far

[b] Bugs [/b]
The first bug is a huge nuisance to a player because of the impacts it does have on the environment and how you can progress. Some times the debris from a trees disappears through the map and still is counted. It's quite frustrating but i have faith in the Developers that they will fix this in a patch.

Similar to the above bug, its the actual tree that does this. It occasionally gets slingshot through the map, stuck in the ground or thrown into the air. Which, again, if you are trying to make an ecologically stable society is a huge pain in the backside.

Both of the above can be fixed with a relog (atleast it was fixed for me after that)

[b] Pro's [/b]

The game does what it says it does (funnily enough) and from what i can see i can run it at above 40-60 FPS depending on what i was doing at the time. 

The early game grind is a pain but if you push through it the relief when you hit a landmark is amazing.

The economy system seems relatively well implemented but I play singleplayer so dont take my word for that

The economic impacts are quite prominent especially as time progresses as you can see plants dying.

Mining is quite enjoyable although I'll talk about that more later

Farming hasn't really worked for me because i'm a special little snowflake and built in a desert. Believe it or not its hard to grow stuff in the desert.

The map is really well done although it isn't a live map of the debris etc. Its updates every half hour althought it seems well polished and does what its supposed to do.

The tutorial (IMO) does do what its supposed to unlike in some games, thankfully else you'll run around destroying the environment without realising the damage. Although more information on how to prevent pollution should be free to use in game in the form of like...journal pages you discover around the map for doing things, or in the research table.

[b] Con's [/b]

Thought i'd get the Pro's out the way before the cons so more people would read the good of the game, im genuinely surprised at how good the game is, even in singleplayer.

Storage is a huge issue, especially if you enjoy mining like i do. The stockpiles hold a decent amount of stuff but a better way of storing them would be amazing (dont ask me about that because i aint got a clue for alternatives. 1 block breaking into 4 pieces, its a pain for storage and places a huge strain on the storage you have setup. Its cool that its realistic and all but i pray please no lol

Thats honestly the only issue i have with the game. I hope to get this game to 300 hours and still enjoy it but we shall see, im a very long way off of that :)

thank you for your review.

We are aware of the player drops you describe and working on solutions for them. They're not really caused by ""grind"", but rather by missing balance and content (and human nature in regards to how long someone is willing to play one game continously, too).

A lot of professions at the moment do not have enough content and impact on the game, which causes Smiths and Engineers to be the only really viable professions in the midgame to endgame, while other professions are getting boring, don't have much progress and ways to influence the goal of shooting the meteor down.

This is why this game is still in early access - we just don't have all content in yet, some professions have way more content than others, others have very little at all yet. 9.0 will already improve on this and we go on doing so in all future patches to ensure in the end, this game will have several fleshed out professions that all have a use until the very end, linking with other professions, so that every profession needs every other one.

thanks for your review.

We're aware of an issue with ecology resistance in the current patch, in Update 9.0 this one is fixed and all CO2 absorbing is reduced by around 25 times, making CO2 a real threat again. We also introduced predator animals that can attack you.

Our future roadmap that is soon to be released to the public also does include disasters, like droughts, forest fires, earthquakes, storms and others to give players more threats to deal with.

In regards to storage and required work this game is a bit special, as having issues with storage and the need of a lot of manual labour is actually intended. Of course, this should get easier the more advanced you get, therefore Update 9.0 will start with giving the higher level tools increasing amounts of area of effect, like a hammer that will be able to build whole walls in lines and similar.

56,55379970,english,"There's a lot of games out there. Find this, Kill this, complete this objective.. All of them, same ideas and concepts. ECO is completely original. You start off with a few things in an open planet teaming with life. You start building, collecting, hunting, mining, farming, fishing, or what ever you want your trade to be. Well your habits directly effect the world, your fishing nets slowly get lighter, that animal you love to hunt starts to get rarer to find. Your piles of tailings pollutes the ground angering the local farmer as now his crops don't grow, which now your local food supply chain is broken. All of this data is available to view as well. I love this game. Now my biggest issues were fixed with this last patch, as they fixed some performance issues. Now my current issues are in regards to mid to late game. The first 7 to 10 days, every thing runs great for the server you choice. The issue is, no new players join after that point and active player counts start to fall. Once they start to fall, a lot of players just check out early. Also a lot of servers like to make huge worlds, which make it harder to interact with other players and your effects on the world are greatly reduced. I think a great fix for the last issue would be for ECO to host about 4 servers with the correct settings, maybe have a ranking system, only allowing players that complete the play through to join the later of the servers. Lastly this game is still in Beta, I'm now playing with friends which helps correct the player count fall off and we're working on making an official reddit server. I highly recommend getting this game.

57,55339809,english,"I gotta say, I was skeptical when I bought this game at first but it has really grown on me. The whole concept of how each players choice can effect the overall environment of the planet is what intrigued me and I must say the devs did a fantastic job pursuing the idea of how environmental choices matter. I'm currently playing a 2-player Co-op playthrough so my review isn't based on the larger scale multiplayer.

The gameplay is like a environmental cautious, modern minecraft with an advanced tech-tree on crack. Everything in ECO requires real life time to process, so that being said you can easily lose track of your hours played. The overall goal of the game is to advance your technology enough to destroy an incoming meteorite within 30 real life days. So having friends or more players will definitely help advance yourself faster as they can choose other technologies to follow. More often than not, you'll have to rely on other players advancing their skill-trees which makes ECO a very community oriented game. I wouldn't recommend ECO as a single player game unless you prefer to spend literal days to do anything. 

Pros:
- Choices really do matter in ECO.
- Has a decent variety of different skill trees to keep you interested.
- Graphics have a relaxing/toony feel.
- Itches my grind/time-progression needs.

Cons:
- I wish there was a little more to do with the Animals (Breeding, farming, Husbandry, etc)
- More mod support! This game could have endless possibilities.

Eco was indeed developed with multiplayer in mind and the whole feature description of Eco on Steam tells you that. No matter that, Eco supports singleplayer but depending on a players taste our default configuration for difficulty might not feel good for each player. Eco is very configurable, though and you can set growth rates, difficulty and leveling speeds yourself to a value that fits your playstyle.

Update 9.0 will expand further on that and implement a resource cost and crafting time multiplier that will allow you to tune recipes to your needs.

Apparently there are exploits in the game that can cause server corruption plus the ""owners"" of servers can just turn them off.  A collective goal is a great idea, but it's a serious waste of time to play if the servers can't be stable.  I can not recommend this game at this time.

Addendum:  Post SLG-Dennis's suggestion, there appears to be only two SLG servers in the list of games.  Regardless, I joined one but it's essentially overcrowded for my taste.  I believe at the time I joined there were 250 players with 30+ online.  It made it difficult to find a useful profession from a starting player's perspective.   A friend has the game but hasn't played in a while started up a private server.   We're trying to get a couple of his other friends who have the game to join up.

I've also joined up on a new server with a low pop that's growing.  The lack of a common currency makes trading and a basic economy more difficult with players off-line.  The game definitely benefits from a community spirit.  My sense is that there are small hurdles to overcome (by design) to bring a a server together into a community.  New players, like myself, simply don't know the game well enough to know what those are and how to overcome them.

PPS.  After several--way, way more--hours of playing and on different servers, the bigger problems persist.  Servers will lose active populations right around the time tier 2/tier3 materials are required.  Servers can also just dissapear.   Servers set with low speed skill gains take too long to develop communities.  High-speed skill gains make everyone self-sufficient thus killing the community building/cooperation aspect of the game.  My best experience so far has been with a buddy on a low-speed (1.5x) where we could shape our skill sets to work together.  (I did farm, food, and mortar.  He did butcher, hewn, and smelting.)  The only way I can honestly recommend this game at this time, as before, is being able to play it with your own group.  Honestly, I have yet to see the end-game phase on any server.  There's some Quality of Life stuff that still need work and, seriously, bread is a Tier 3 baked good?  Bread is about as basic as it gets.  There's a tier 2 receipe that requires bread which need a tier 3 R&D.  So there's balance stuff like that which I'm sure the devs will eventually get around to doing.

I wanted to like this game. I've put over a hundred hours into survival craft-'em-ups, and one promising to model a complex environment, [i]and[/i] add time pressure so you actually have some sense of a target to work towards?

Well, that was music to my ears.

Unfortunately when I got in, it was all a bit tedious. [b]The Bad[/b]:
[list]
[*]Crafting times are a common thread in other entires in the genre, like Rust, but here they clearly need some tweaking. Everything seems to just takes so long that it absolutely piledrives the pacing. 5 minutes to craft the research bench? Why does the research itself have a time requirement when it [i]also[/i] has a resource requirement? A game that isn't an MMO really shouldn't have this much padding.
[*]A few little quality of life improvements are really called for here. An example; at one point I needed to collect plant fibre, but unlike every other basic resource, it wasn't tutorialized. It seemed most obvious that it would be a collectable resource like the gatherable plants (beans, corn, etc.), but in the end it turned out that it required an upgrade in the Farming skill tree to unlock a scythe. When you need to resort to Google in the first hour of gameplay, that's a troubling sign.
[*]One of the first tasks is to build a little cabin, because the research system requires a table to be set up in an indoor area. Unfortunately, you need to actually unlock the ability to build a proper roof. I had to resort to an ugly, flat, blocky roof that didn't look natural on the otherwise lovely cabin walls. This is [b]obviously[/b] my [i]pettiest[/i] complaint, but I feel like the devs should have given us the option of making things look at least a little aesthetically pleasing right off the hop, as is the case with Rust or ARK.
[/list]

But all [b]the good things[/b] I said in the preamble still apply:
[list]
[*]Not enough entries in this genre have tangible goals, period, let alone existential threats in the form of an ever-present meteor circling closer each day.
[*]I love the idea of the nutrition system.
[*]A less grindy version of the current research system would make it feel less like I was just wasting my bloody time
[/list]

As it stands, that was [i]exactly[/i] the impression I had. After an hour of gameplay I simply wasn't having any fun, and saw at least another 10 hours worth of grinding ahead before I got to anything like rewarding content. I'm sure it will be a great game one day, but that day is not today.",1528497408,1567218016,True,0,0,0.676227748394012451,9,True,False,True,76561197997843060,438,29,2621,0,61,1592680163,1528513499.0,"Thanks for the feedback, we're currently working on early game balancing so you can expect this stuff to change a lot as we iterate on it.  The game is designed to be played for 30 days with a group of players, thus there are certain features that simply take time.

I even created mods (like a treasure hunt mod) for that game to add more content but it was not enough to keep it interesting for my community.

Dont buy this game at the moment.

i'm sorry you didn't like our game.

I'm here to assure you that we are still working on the game with full capacity and there is a big patch coming soon. Development isn't dead nor do we plan to cease it.

74,54855125,english,"210 hours in, and I'm still LOVING ECO. It offers an amazing blend of Minecraft-style building with better graphics, group collaboration, a user-to-user economy, laws, and more. Have had a ton of fun so far and can already tell it's my new favorite game. Is it perfect? No, not yet. It's early access. So it has bugs and lag, an unclear and complex tech tree, and (at least until recently) a memory leak that requires client/server restarts, but - to me - these are minor inconveniences to experience a truly remarkable game! I'm AMAZED by what Strange Loop has accomplished!",1567000717,1567000717,True,2,1,0.533898293972015381,0,True,False,True,76561198042058471,128,1,38695,0,12603,1600180214,,

Eco is an excellent and unique game made for high collaboration but can also be played highly competitive.

Skills, Experience multiplier:
In Eco you gain skill points over time depending on your experience multiplier which you can increase by eating a balanced diet.
Skill points can be used to unlock skills which will make your efficiency on that type of work be greater than someone who doesn't have that skill: for example you can take the skill 'smelting' which means you need fewer ores and create less pollution than someone who doesn't own this skill.
When you take a certain skill you also get a level for this skill that can increase when you do skill related acts and depending on your exp multiplier it will be faster or slower than others.
This way you can change the economy by playing highly efficient which can be a challenge but highly rewarding.

Dislikes:

Players:

I will be a little more specific on this topic BUT this has nothing to do with how the game was made and should be IGNORED in any review.
Abusive server owners using admin powers to spawn in thousands of items is THE thing that I hate the most in this game,
When you start asking them certain questions about it they will ban you.

The second type of people dislike the game because they have no clue of what to do or ask for help: they join a server play alone and inefficient and leave soon because core items are expensive.

Skills:

Don't get me wrong I love the skills in this game but there are some issues with them:
Certain skills how so much influence in how the game will play out but others are almost or even completely useless!
Food is a key item in the game it gives you an experience multiplier but also calories and there is so much different types of food that certain cooking related skills become useless because others are way better and sometimes even cheaper.
There is also a skill called 'paper milling' which makes it more efficient to make paper but paper is only used in 3 items in the whole game and one of these 3 is a different model of one of them.
All wood related skills are only used early to mid game and become useless late game.



Conclusion:

Eco is an excellent unique game that is worth its price.",1566992958,1566992958,True,21,2,0.721854686737060547,0,True,False,True,76561198133433513,163,7,23392,0,15500,1599899393,,
76,54829956,english,"I feel like I should address some of the negative reviews I keep seeing. 

Eco is an excellent game! A more mature version of Minecraft with a focus on technological development and camaraderie. It has some surprising realism. Most of the negative reviews are the community servers; there are many that will have a bunch of people mucking about, making a mess, and not working together to solve the game-ending crisis. I find this quite funny since we face ecological and environmental ruin in the real world, and similarly; no one seems to care. I don't think this is a negative mark against the game but it's something to keep in mind. This game is best played with friends especially if you want any hope of actually progressing towards an objective.

The building and tech progression in the game is very fun. Resource gathering can be a chore early on, but as someone who enjoyed mindlessly mining in Minecraft; I found it to be enjoyable. Things can take a lot of time, but this is configurable when you host a server. You can play a game that lasts a month of real time, or a week, or a day -- whatever you tweak the exp/skill rates and meteor impact time to. Because of the skill points and specializations; you can play with a massive number of people who need to coordinate their professions to be able to achieve success, or play with a handful of people with a higher skill rate who multi-task several professions as needed.

The game runs alright, but some lower-spec'd computers may have a problem. Though I was just testing on my girlfriend's Ryzen 5 3400G integrated APU graphics and things were still playable at around 20~30fps depending on scene and settings. A high framerate isn't as important in Eco than it is in other games due to Eco lacking most combat-oriented threats.

I picked this up in the summer sale after having been interested in it because of it's concept for a year or two now.  We had a conversation between a group of friends with the 2 (out of 7) who already owned it giving it a strong recommendation.  At this stage I've put in 49 hours according to steam, and it's a big thumbs up for me.  Yes there are few issues and quirks, but it is early access.  

It's a team game that can reflect society's lack of co-operation, and I can see there being issues if you get the wrong admin on a server.  Especially good if you play with a small group and co-operate together fairly well.

Looking at the road map for development it seems there are a lot more improvements on the horizon.  So even if you are not tempted now I would suggest keeping an eye on it.

Edit: after 250 hours 0.8.2.9

The mid to late game feels very grindy which suits some of us but not others, and certain skills lead down dead ends, Almost need to forward plan a lot, and if someone in your chain stops or isn't as efficient as you would like you can feel like putting your head through a brick wall.

you were banned for spreading over 200 tailings after a fight with former comrades directly next to their base over a noticeable area in the water - a severe case of griefing, actually the most severe case of griefing we ever had on a official server, requiring us half an hour of time to fix it up. This is only your fault, noone elses. The rules are clear and written in the server description.

A ban on the official servers does not stop you from playing the game, though. We encourage players to play on community servers, anyway.

As for your claim issue: It's ever a good idea to claim everything you own, otherwise it's simply not your property - even though i understand that this can feel bad.

99,54295123,english,"Eco could be a great game, but the lack of a player-base ruins the experience for me, hands down the worst part. Second part that ruins the game is the memory leak that hogs up all the computers resources and drops the frames down to a solid 5 even with a high end pc (Game restart required. occurs every 10-20 minutes). 
I've been playing on a 20-30 ish first day active server(The only one over 10 that I've been able to find (seem to average like 60-70 concurrent players total in the game), and even with those numbers, we all have to play 10 + hours a day to even see remote progress.

For new players this system is horrible, and I think this is why the fall-off must have been so large for this game over time. Also the fact that other players are able to abuse the XP gain to a large lead over everyone else by just systematically creating monster buildings that no human would ever-ever live in, for that sweet bonus xp. 
I don't know, I reallly want to like this game, there are just.. too many frustrations, and with a lack of a player-base it just puts the nail in the coffin for me.

we are working hard on fixing potential memory leak and fps issues and you should see noticeable improvements in Update 8.3.

Given the progression, it totally depends on the servers settings. The administrator of the server can freely configure how fast you gain experience and how many specialisations you can take. They are not restricted, but will usually adapt the system to the amount of expected players to work out as they would like it. In Update 9.0 we will also introduce a crafting resources and time multiplier to further enhance the confguration possibiities and improve singleplayer mode.

Building a house - even majestic ones is part of the game. In the recent patches we fixed quite some issues that allowed unrealistic abuse of the system. Building those buildings costs a lot of resources and efforts if it is to be done in an effective way (requiring highest tier materials), so the effort to use ratio should be quite fine.

If you'd like to tell me what the issue with big buildings in the game in regards to XP is in more detail or have any other questions, feel free to add me as friend on steam or send me an e-mail to dennis@strangeloopgames.com and i'll gladly hand your feedback to the developers :)

Luckily, we were able to advance just in time to wipe it. I enjoyed the building aspect, having to trade and work with others, and the importance of not over-harvesting resources. 

Downsides of the game: After playing it through, I didn't have much of an appetite to join another server and start over from scratch. I haven't had much of a desire to play after advancing all the way through.

5,54094455,english,"Eco used to be an amazing game. I really enjoyed it to the point where I've paid for multiple servers. I had countless hours played with my friends and family on this game. I also liked how involved the devs were with the community as well as how transparent they were with what theyre working on,
And then everything changed with their updates. I used to be able to play Eco with a max of two other people, and have vehicles by the fourth-ish day of relaxed grinding. With the state the game is in now, it would take us well over two weeks of harsh grinding, eight hours a day, to achieve the simplest of vehicles (a powered cart).
To earn a skill point needed to specialize a specific skill (which is an absolute must with how high they cranked up material costs), you need to be on a server for at least a day (we played for no less than 5 hours a day and still achieved only 1 skill point every 20 hours). To get that skill point, it was around 100-200 experience. After a few levels, the needed xp for one skill point jumps to 1600xp needed. Simple 8th grade math will show that this is just absolutely ridiculous.
It seems the devs dont want players to achieve many specializations and only focus on a select few. For the rest of the skills, they would want you working with the rest of the players on your world to create either an Utopian bartering economy, or a capitilists dream world of utilizing stores and banks to achieve the materials you arent spec'd into,
Unfortunately, Eco does not have the player-base for a system set up like that (the highest I've seen lately is 4 people in a public server). So what that means is, by them making a game dependent on multiple people in a world, without having the player-base for that, they have essentially killed off any hopes of new players buying the game and sticking around long enough to not get that sweet Steam refund.
I hate to say this, I really do, but save your money and dont buy this game.

yes, we do focus on a multiplayer experience with medium groups and there are quite some servers that have the necessary population, i see enough servers with 20+ players.

You can ever adapt the game difficulty setting to your liking to make it easier for you, Update 9.0 will extend on this by offering a resource cost and a crafting time multiplier, so that should solve all your problems.

But our game is not about combat, but about collaboration with other people and building a society - and that is something no minecraft mod can offer.

But the devs have little or no idea how to setup network play.  It appears they have pet baboons trying to do it since their game has been unplayable for over a year.  They keep saying disable your firewall/antivirus.  I only run the firewall and virus protection inherent to windows 10.  If their programs has issues with that, it's not windows 10 problem, it's due to the fact they don't know what the hell they are doing.  I have TONS of games that run perfectly fine on windows 10, but these choobs can't seem to get it right.  The game has been broken now for over 12 months (May 2018 was the last I was able to play).  

They also tell me to turn off port forwarding.  I NEVER port forwarded this game before, and it isn't port forwarded now.  And I sure as heel am not turning off windows firewall or Defender to play their game.  (I tried anyways, rebooted computer and it still timed out), so it's not an issue with windows firewall, it's just bad programming.  The fault is with Eco and not with your firewall\Antivirus software.  Do not buy this game, it does not work.  I have 4 friends that own this game and it does not work for any of us.  So they are batting 5/5 on breaking the game and having no clue what they are doing.  

Spending money on this game with result in refunding it within 10 to 15 minutes depending on how patient you are with trying to fix the devs lack of programming mentality.  Me, when i pay money for something, it had better work, or I hit the refund button.  I don't care if it is ""early access"".  Steam should amend it's refund policy to allow refunds at ANY time during the early access process.

The game starts simple but rapidly introduces complexity as you progress, Adding mechanics like pollution, over-hunting/over-fishing as well as more complex building recipes. Overall this game is very fun with some replayability. To break this game down into pros and cons.

Pros:
1) Good difficulty curve. (Not too simple, yet not too much as to overwhelm you)
2) Multiple Play-Styles via Professions. (You can focus on one profession in multiplayer or spread your points out across multiple)
3) Good scaling between single player and multiplayer games. (going solo gives you more skill points to make up for less people to earn them)

Cons:
1) Multiplayer focused (I feel that many of this game's aspects is designed around 4+ player servers cooperatively working to save the world. This is great for people who have that many people who can play (or who doesn't mind trying to find a spot in a public server) but makes solo play feel less supported)

don't worry, the earth in Eco of course is actually flat, just open the map in the web interface and you'll see its real shape. We just bend it ingame because of the additional sales we get from all those sphere-earthers. The cake is a lie.

ECO is a game of creation and development, which portraits the issues about rapid expansion on the nature itself, with mechanics such as pollution, extinction of animals, diminishing ressources and environenmental destruction. - Which gives a new aspect to block-themed survival games, like no other.
The goal of the game, is to create a working society, with trades, currencies, proper housing and developing technology, to, in the end, be able to save the planet you are calling home, from an oncoming meteor that threatens to destroy your planet.

ECO is a fun game in the block-survival genre, for all ages.

98,52459839,english,"ECO is a cool, interesting, and unique game, and fun to play. When it works.

-Sadly a third of my playtime is debugging, either because the game or serverstructure are not working properly.
When its not taking severaly minutes connect, im usually stuck in an endless loading loop, where i cant connect to singleplayer or a multiplayer server. None of the ""fixes"" on the internet work. The Devs consider this bug fixed, apparently its not fixed. Its just one big trial and error and eventually you are lucky enough for your world to start. Then its still possible for you to randomly disconnect from the server, even tho your network is fine. Do i do something wrong ? idk, the game doesnt tell me.
-When it works it has atrocious performance most of the time for no apparent reason (10-8 FPS is a regular thing, doesnt matter if on lowest potato settings; i74400k, 1060 6GB OC, 16GB RAM). I get that its ""EaRly AcCeSs"" and ""oPtiMizAtIoN cOmEs lAsT"", but cmon. this is not an alpha and you charge money for it.
-The UI and inventorymanagement is one of the worst designs ive seen in a while (maybe stationeers is worse, you get used to it after some time).
-Some weird gameplaydesigns that dont correlate very well with the rest of the game.
fe: you need a certain seed for a crafting recipe to learn an essential skill in the game. But its possible that your world does not spawn the plant that can contain that seed. Also relying on RNG is a bad idea. Who thought its fun to wait several RL hours for the one blueberry bush in your world to regrow berrys, only for it to not contain a single seed ? how is it possible to farm hundreds of berrys, but not a single seed ? when you need 5 of them?) 
fe: the world is cluttered with plants and trees. Why make it that even the smallest pixel from the smallest plant or grass can make you move considerably slower ? I get the idea, but its just not fun gameplay. Tone it down a bit, or remove it, or at least make the ""skill"" to ""move fast through grass"" (which proprably just exist, if it exists, to blow up the skilltree) easily accessible. If the player considers jumping like a lunatic the better alternative to your intended movement, it may be time to reconsider the design of it.

I want to play the game, but its really hard to do so at least for me atm. If it gets better in the future i will update my review. (30.06.19)",1561907244,1561907471,False,2,0,0.522149920463562012,1,True,False,True,76561198036224459,190,17,1522,0,589,1562889406,1562563465.0,"Hello 23rubel,
i'm sorry you didn't like our game as much as we do and had issues with it.

Given your connection issues, those are actually unknown to us. If you want, you can send me an e-mail to dennis@strangeloopgames.com with more detail, so i can investigate that issue. 

As far as performance for some machines goes, we are working on improving that in update 8.3, which has focus on fps improvements.

As for the gameplay designs you mention:
- It should NOT be possible that a world does not spawn required plants and at least since 8.2 this should no longer happen at all. If it still does, please report a bug.
- As for the RNG: Players are meant to conserve the plants, if you are already at the stage of only having a single blueberry bush, the RNG is intended - it's not any easier in real life to preserve the last type of a species. When you still have plenty of them left, this should be no issue. At the time of your review there was an issue with harvesting, though - so yields should now be better.
- As far as the speed malus goes: This is intended, it encourages you to actually build roads in the game and makes hunting more of a realistic challenge.

18,52111906,english,"Eco is game about working together and contributing to the community that you create. You start with nothing but a tent and a few land claim papers and immediately work to cut down trees to build homes and other structures.

The defining feature of Eco that sets it apart from other games of the genre such as Minecraft is the Ecosystem simulation. Every action you and your community do has an effect on the planet. For instance smelting Ores into more usable ingots will create tailings as a by-product which will seep into the land and pollute water sources, having an effect on the wildlife and fauna in that area. To counter this Eco allows players to run their own Governments which they can use to create laws to ban and tax certain practices.

Eco evolves from a game about simple settlers building houses out of timber and stone to more modern means, using excavators and creating large road networks of tarmac. This game is amazing in a large group of which many dedicated servers are open to the playerbase and can be hosted by community members. Features such as contracts and VOIP create a thriving community and is great to feel and see your contributions as the server adapts. Some servers have a time objective such as build a laser to defeat an meteor on a collision course with the planet in around a real time month which is chaos... and brilliant.

36,51417513,english,"A comprehensive review takes time, which I don't have but after playing it for a couple of hours I want to leave a review with some points that might help players as well as developers.

1. For people who think of buying the game

- It is early access for a reason - if you get annoyed by quirks or not completely finished concepts this game is probably not yet for you
- Try to reserve some time for the first play session (couple hours at least) - you will need to wrap your head around things 
- Join an online server that is on Day 1 or Day 2 so you do not lag behind so much

2. Some hints for the developers in terms of prioritization
(note that I write this currently without having been in the mid and late game as I think the impression in the beginning is more valuable to the devs than the late game details)

2.1 Generic points
- Make it obvious that there is a third person perspective - I have motion sickness issues, and after a couple hours I wanted to throw the game out and then accidentially discovered the TPV which saved it for me
- Field of view in third person view should automatically jump higher as otherwise it feels still quite claustrophopic
- As soon as you have something in hand the obstruction of the thing you want to pick up more of is annoying (I have no good idea how to fix it)
- The tutorial is ok, needs improvements in getting the player going - I suggest more example building projects - like the most tiny house possible so a player understood the concept - and then adds a chair or whatnot to it.
- Move the statistics views into the game - at least some of the basic ones - as well as voting as it is breaking the immersion and is slow when opening that in the browser
- Make a wheelbarrow a part of the tutorial
- Have an option for auto grant access to specific players whenever you set down something. Lot's of people play within small groups who will auto share stuff within them and it is annoying to set rights for a friend if you are gathering plants on the other side of a mountain.
- Make the supply chain of stockpiles clearer in terms of what is, will be connected to workbenches. I would almost suggest to completely scrap the access check boxes and invest rather into a graphic that shows which stockpiles are how far away and which are accessible and which are just barely out of reach
- Explain where stone comes from by renaming the recipes or at least go through it once in the tutorial - it took me forever to understand that it is created from other types of 'stone' and cannot just be mined - I literally ran around testing different places to find stone
- Maybe have a list of all buildings that you own and if there is an intersection of landclaims on the same building/rooms make sure all players share the skill experience (makes people build things together in their tiny groups instead of building houses twice or three times)
- Explain stores better with eg. an NPC or other form of test purchase (<-- little unspecific/ i know)
- Touch biomes in the tutorial

2.2 My personal prioritization
- Accessibility issues (TPV)
- Tutorial improvements (housing, wheelbarrow, biomes)
- Autoshare with friends
- Supply chain stockpile redesign

39,51413308,english,"It's been quite a while since i wrote a review for a game, but I had to express my views about this game.

So the basic idea of the game is to stop a meteor from hitting your planet while also not ruining your planet in the proces of stopping said meteor within 30 real time days. The way it works is that there are numerous amount of jobs that players are able to perform. Think about, smiths, cooks, bakers, miners, lumberjacks, tailors, farmers, etc. The drawback is that you only have the ability to pick a few amount of these jobs. (you get around 5-8 skill points in a full run of eco). This means you will have to work together as a team to save your planet. Cooks feed the miners, the miners give Iron back for better cooking stations etc etc. Thats basicly a very rough synopsis of what the game is.

Now it does work pretty well when a server has a population of around 10-20 active players. any lower than this and you will struggle to get all jobs neccesary to progress in the game. So i give gameplay an 8/10

Furthermore the community i've experienced over multiple servers are all friendly and willing to help / explain stuff you don;t understand. 9/10 for community.

Graphics are pretty solid, nothing to special about them. 6/10

Sound same as graphics nothing to special 6/10

Opttimization is pretty poorly done as of now. They did recently release an update which clearly boosts performance by a bit. So given the fact that they do work on the problem, ill give it a 6/10 , instead of a 4/10.


All in all i got really hooked on this game, and you can choose to spend a full day on it for 30 days, or just a couple of hours for 30 days. It doesn;t really matter. cause both options are viable and you don't become useless or overlooked that quickly. 
So i DO recommend this game. Just find a server that has a about 8-12 players online. mostly they will have active players @ around 20.",1561333485,1561333707,True,2,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,True,76561197987331656,461,9,24283,0,10253,1599776101,,
40,51399658,english,"I don't usually bother writing my opinions on forums like this, but reading a lot of the reviews I feel like there is a lot of undeserved and unfair comments made by people regarding this game. I personally believe that people should not have the option to post a review if they don't have played the game for at least several days.

The game does have cons, it is by no means perfect. Things like poor optimisation, bugs and glitches spring to mind immediately, but what do people expect from a game which hasn't even officially released yet?!
 The game is in early access, I believe we are in the beta stages at the moment and bugs / glitches are to be expected and to be honest most of them are very minor. Stuff like trucks and carts flying up in the air and getting stuck on various objects on their way down is surely annoying, but not game breaking.

The only real con at the moment is optimisation, there is lag going on every now and again and FPS drop downs, but to be fair to the devs the last update has improved on this greatly.

I cannot praise this game enough. It is a true simulation and incredibly in depth. The new skills system is being bashed, but I personally don't agree with it. The old system was very punishing for new / casual play. I believe the star system we have in place now is far superior. Encourages people to play and actually be active, along with collaboration.

The crafting system is the best I have ever seen in a video game. It's so creatively done and it is a lot of fun progressing through the tiers with different machinery that you and your friends create together. 

The world is immersive, I truly feel that I am part of it and what I do matters / has impact. The fact that I can make a species extinct or literally destroy the world, makes me feel so protective of it and all of it's aspects. 

Community is a big part of the game too. Electing a world leader, deciding together how you all want your civilization to progress. Trading with each other, getting together to build the world from the ground up.... it's truly magnificent.

Sadly the only real downfall of ECO is not the game itself, but the community. Some players just cannot understand I think, that this is meant to be played in a group. Yes, you can play solo, but for me those players just miss the point entirely. 
All of this negative talk about having to wait days for stars and how it's all grind leads me to believe that players treat this as if it's Minecraft or trying to get as many of the professions as possible by themselves, rather than trading and interacting with their fellow mates as the game is intending them to do.

I have to admit that it is hard to find a good server. There are a lot of griefers, trolls and those who just refuse to learn when you try to help them. But this is true for all multiplayer games. Genuine, friendly players do exist. It just takes time and patience to find them. It can be long winded, but the pay off when you do find the right people for you is worth it.

However if you long for a decent group, feel free to message me. The group I play with is a small, close knit team and we will gladly help out other social and friendly people looking for a place.

So to sum up, yes the game is not perfect there are issues, but the foundation is solid and the devs team are dedicated. If you truly enjoy world simulation and collaboration this is it! 
If you prefer fast pace and multiplayer is not for you, then I'd give ECO a pass, because the chances are you just won't enjoy it.",1561285645,1561292123,True,12,0,0.632874131202697754,0,True,False,True,76561198256115944,50,2,54585,0,40290,1600724273,,

This game is fun.... in concept. The pieces are all here for an active rp game with survival aspects but it requires a community of people or a decent group of friends, that of which i do not have. The servers are dead and youre forced to go solo and this causes a creative block as everything you need to make a modernized base is locked behind a ""Specialization"" or a blueprint which is much to costly. The only challenge of actually surviving is the hunger and your diet actually matters which would be cool if every plant and animal is never around when you need them, you can farm but guess what, you cant grow anything with out the farming Specialization making this game hard to love. When, or if, the community kicks into high gear and server are more active then i would recommend this game, but it pains me to dis on this game. If you do have a group of people you plan on playing with then buy the game but if youre solo id wait for a sale cause its really not worth 30 dollars at the moment.

Of course if you feel my review is bias or incorrect then feel free to leave comment with your side of the story but this is from my play through.

thanks for your review.

Regarding the servers - did you try to play on one of the official servers or on one of the servers the bigger communitites offer? Those are usually well-visisted and well governed and really fun to play on.

Also, regarding farming, you should actually not need the farming specialisation to farm - you only need it if you want to craft seeds out of food items, which you don't really need to be a good farmer. Could it be that the server you were playing on restricted the farming possibilitites via a mod or a law?

45,51251963,english,"I gave this game a positive review because I love chopping down trees, chopping them into logs, loading them on my cart, cleaning up the mess, and planting new trees. Also, I want other people to buy this game, so the developers can keep working on it.

My overall gaming experience with eco, though, has so far not been so great.

When creating a new game, the game recommends that you join a public server for a better gaming experience. So, I guess, the reason my gaming experience has been suboptimal, is because I've been doing it all wrong.

Maybe I should try out the playing with random strangers on the internet thing for this game. It's just... considering how easy it is to mess things up for other eco players when you don't intend to. I don't want to see what it looks like when people troll on purpose.


When I first bought the game, I started a solo game, that seemed nice and chill.

Then talked some buddies into trying it and we started a 4 man game.
We each picked different tech skills and then each picked the grinding skills we thought were appropriate for our tech skills.
Some days into our game I saw that my next skill choosing was 5 real life days in the future even though I already had housing of all types at 50% softcap reduction of the highest tier we were able to produce with our combined tech abilities as well as perfectly balanced food intake.

One of us had gone for farming/gathering, which ended up being utterly discouraging. Since, apparently, there was no use for farming, at least that early in game...

Another one of us picked a wrong mining talent. After which him doing mining was discouraging, since mining would take him twice as long as it would anyone with the right mining talent...

We abandoned the 4 man game.

I started a new solo game, found some nice audiobooks to make the grinding more entertaining. And grinded away for the length of a couple of audiobooks.

Nice and chill. Until it turns out that there is no copper in the depths and biomes that usually contains copper ore...

So now what? Dig out lanes in every depth in every biome to learn whether my game is somehow bugged or whether developers has recently decided to place copper someplace else? (EDIT: I've finally found copper ore. Unlike previous maps I've played, the copper is all clustered up. So when I finally found any, I found a lot.)

Mining is currently a very unsatisfactory grind. Any hit that does not break the rock, sounds like a miss. Accidentally hitting a piece from an already broken rock has a sound that somewhat reminds me of nails grating against a black board. Experiencing this soundbyte is not rare when mining in utter darkness. I don't spend enough time in one spot to warrant the waste of time and ressources involved in setting up a torch stand and then permanently losing a torch for short term short range lighting.

Most of the rock I mine, I have to destroy. There isn't really that much need for stone and only very select types of rock can be ground to sand...

Maybe there is more use for rocks at later tech levels, I don't know. Can't get there without copper...

The concept of eco is fascinating.

i'm very sorry to hear you had a bad experience.

Unfortunately, your statement ist not completely true. Unclaiming of property - for example to clean up inactive players - can only be done by proposing a law and getting a majority vote of all participating players on it - no single person can do this alone. This process takes at least 24 hours. While i can understand that as affected person this feels bad for you, the law system is a major part of the game for multiplayer and can be used to do a lot of different things by majority vote. If you don't like the law feature, you can play on a server that has disabled the law feature.

51,51140277,english,"I loved this game, I mean loved it. I've log 873 hours on and had a ton of fun. Sadly I have to write a bad review of the game now because of the direction on where the game went. If you read any of the posts on this game prior to the leveling system update, you will see that this game was top notch. I see a lot of people complain now about the game, I too have to agree. 

The game is about economic, law and community building in a block style world. The problem is the devs don't fix the broken parts, they just develop new systems to replace the old ones and if those are broken, they ignore them and add more systems in. Example: the old leveling system vs the new system. The old system was much better even though it was broken. When I say broken, i mean it had a lot of dead ends, useless skills and lack of content. Instead of the devs fixing the system, they rewrote the whole system and broke a ton more skills. If you look at the pattern of player attendance, its clear that after the new leveling system was put in place that players tried it and abandoned the game. The theory behind this is the devs didn't listen to the needs of the players and developed a system built around balancing skill development to support both all day players and a few hours a day players, which failed because it made even more skill useless. The problem was the old system was more balanced to support part time players vs all day players then the new system. Which means the devs created a new system based on the misunderstanding of information and they still haven't corrected the problems with the old system.

A lot of player complain about farming. In the game farming has little to do with the any of the skill sets. The farming skill set only deals with turning raw crops into seeds to plant. The harvesting skill set is designed to increase base value crop yield. Farming itself in the game is based on RL players understanding of how the game operates to grow crops. It was amazing because of the thought process behind designing farms and maximizing crop production. Under the new skill system, all that changed because crops became over abundant and the need for food completely dropped off. This also cascaded to cause cooks and farmers to be useless. First, new biome creation made it very too easy to grow crops and wild crop yields became over abundant. Second, players started burning a lot less energy and required less food. It broke down under the new system to the point that a player will burn about 3k cals over the course of an hour of constant work (a player was more likely to repair a stone pick axe 3 times before they needed to eat) That energy could be replaced with 2 cooked meals or 15 raw crops. Some could argue that cooked food would increase skill point gain, which was true under the old system, but has very limited effect under the new system. 

If the devs had just improved on the problem of the old system then the game would be a lot better now then it is. But like I said, the same problems from the old system still exist in the new system. Skills like paper making have limited function, all it does is make paper which is used to make bookshelves. Its a full skill set that only works with one other skill set to make 2 items that has very little practical function for overall community development. Granted the devs have tried to fix this by adding items from dead end skills into advanced item creation, but because of the limited connection to other skills it still makes the player feel like they have to sacrifice hours of hard work for a skill that does fulfill a critical one time need in the community that has no other real purpose. This has been a problem since the lunch of the game, not enough connections between skill sets or uses for most skill skill sets.

The real problem I have with this game is it claims to be focused on economic development. Its not! In basic economic development you need the function of supply and demand. Ideally the game concept is one player is going to produce a good that other players will demand. Given the basic set up of the game it does that. A lumber jack will cut down wood and sell it to a wood worker who will make a bed to sell to another player. But that only goes so far. If a server has 25 players then it only needs 25 beds, maybe 50 if players want more SP house value. So what happens after the amount of required beds is fulfilled? The value of a bed and the value of the wood working skill both reach 0. At the start of any map, economies start to boom, players will be competing with each other over customers. They will undercut item values in order to sell their goods and make money. The problem is the demand for an item only lasts as long as players need them. But there are only so many beds a player needs to buy. Because of the cut of housing SP in repeated placement of the same house items, the return on the value of the item hits 0. With beds its around the 4th bed a player stops gaining any real value from placing them. So going back to supply and demand, if you have 25 players in a server its likely that the max demand for beds in that server is 200. After the max number of beds is reached, the demand for them will be gone and whats left over will be an excess of supply that has no value. This causes a problem for long term economic play. You can't play an economic game that has no demand for the items you create. Under the old system, cooked food was the only item that had a constant demand from the players from start to finish. Under the new system, cooked food has very little value and very limited demand. So economic game play fails in the game. The only way to counter that problem is for the devs to place a degrade system in the game. A way for items to break down and rot, that way it increases a demand for players. Why after a year of this being a problem in the game does it still needs to be fixed? This concept did come up during a live stream with the devs, they never gave an answer to solving this problem. This needs to be fixed before players start to return.

There are a number of other problems the game has, including massive lag issues from Laws and objects. All problems the devs are aware of but disregard. A year ago I would fully support anyone wanting to play this game, but today, I would suggest you wait until they fix a lot of the older problems they haven't bothered to fix. Maybe one day this game will be great again. Until then I would stay away from it. 

I really want to have a reason to play it again. Maybe the devs will give me one.",1560096974,1560096974,False,552,16,0.937116324901580811,0,True,False,True,76561198060136985,64,2,54228,0,52384,1592747133,1560308741.0,"Hello Jacqhammer,
thanks for your very detailed and honest review, i hope i have some good news for you.

For 9.0, we are working on fleshing out the skill system. You are totally right, we did put it in with too little polish and kept it like that for too long. A lot of talents are not implemented or have little use. We are going to change this and also adapt profession balance and content in this update. (Hopefully we will also manage to get farming to a better state, but that might rather happen in a later update) Of course, this will not fix all issues, as some issues are just caused by some objects, concepts and professions not yet being in the game (which is one of the reasons it's early access) which would be required to make other things useful, though. For example paper milling. It's a totally useless skill now - but it will have a lot of use when you see how it will integrate with all law and government stuff later on.

We are also aware of issues with economy in a lot of cases - but do also know of cases where it works pretty well. A degradation system is something we thought of and we already do have a concept for upkeep for machines. We would love to implement all that stuff immediately, but unfortunately our resources do not allow to do all this in no-time. We need to set focus on some specific things at for the very moment this is - as you have also noted - performance. 

I'd love if you took another look on Eco when the first parts of 9.0 have rolled out.

sorry to hear you feel the game is slow paced.

Actually it greatly depends on the type of the server and the difficulty setting.

The food consumption was specifically raised to make the profession of a cook more useful, which it hadn't been before. When playing on a big population server you should be able to buy the food from people specialised in that. That's how Eco on multiplayer servers works - work is distributed between people and the more experienced you get, the faster and easier you can create things.

Don't go into this game thinking of the traditional survival, its more focused around building, research and development of economy's, its more like a combination of sim city and minecraft with a limited time to advance

Aspects I love about this game
Building
Fabricating
Research
Ecosystem
Really polished for a game in development.

Aspects I don't like.
Because there is no threat to survival other then the natural conclusion, it really feels bland after a while because building and research gets old because you know the world is coming to an end and its all pointless because your progress will be wiped, which makes player structures simply boxes to house fabricating facility's .

However that being said, the procedural world, ecosystem, skill system, voxel building, biome's and player run economy are all things I would like to see in a RPG or MMORPG in the future, I think Eco is a true testament to a lot of nice systems working together to what they are trying to produce.

Fertilizers are only needed to enable farming, they won't give any benefits or drawbacks beyond 40-50% (maby even lower) and won't do anything until at least 1200% (I stopped there cause this was just ridiculous). Other plants will go extinct as well (wheat, tomatoes, pumpkins, corn and especially rice) - but they at least can be saved by seeds. And once the fields are sown, they will propagate the wild ones despite all statements made by CMs. They suggested that the plants popped naturally in good conditions, but (a) these same conditions allowed them to go fully extinct (0 rice plants in the word, a couple of days they were preserved only in seed form in my granary) and (b) the conditions are sub-optimal at best (20-40%) in the first place. There were some plots with as high as 100% for wheat, however, and this fact haven't helped against wild wheat going the way of dodo. The animals are nailed down to the respective biomes. No wetlands? Tough luck for your turkeys and foxes. If a sufficient biome for animals is present, they'll breed like rabid rabbits. Our hunter made it a personal quest to eliminate all deer.

Eco actually has a big focus on collaboration and the law, economy, ecologic and government systems you won't find in minecraft. I think the two games - despite their basics being ""blocky game"" - are really different and have totally different gameplay.

Please keep in mind that Eco is intended to be played by a medium group in multiplayer, but nontheless we are continously improving singleplayer. In 9.0 we will add config options for resource consumption and crafting time rates.

60,51004686,english,"After about 100 hours of playing, I am still a little on the fence with this game. The game play is good. I really like the concept. And the developers are actively working on upgrades, and fixes (All pluses in my book). Also, the point of trying to advance the worlds civilization and technology to stop an asteroid from destroying the planet, is a great idea for a Minecraft style game. However, I find that virtually all the servers I have attempted to play typically disappear after about 6 to 10 days.

          Considering the long arc of skill training for the game, this can be a serious problem. The smaller servers are typically player based, and as such it is hard to begrudge someone who has issues pop up that preclude them from maintaining playing. But the smaller servers are the ones where you would find a comfortable number of players to make interaction manageable. The larger servers tend to be overrun with players who do not always have a community based play style. Or just crowd you out. So I prefer a smaller tighter group to play with, that allows for more freedom, and better community interactions.

          To really get into the game, you need to play about 3 days, to basically get up and running as a character. The skill progression for a standard game takes about that long to have enough skills to make gathering resources, and building a home work. Otherwise, the waste in manufacturing items, is unsustainable. Which is the point of making the game collaborative. You can't get up in enough skills to do it on your own. Which makes solo gaming a grind hell if you wanted to play that route. But playing with other people is still an option, so it tries to allow for a variety of player styles, which I like as a concept. Even if in this game, playing alone would eliminate a lot of what would make the playing of it fun.

          I recommend this game for the game play. However there are some issues with regards to finding a decent server to play it. And that you may find that one day when you try to log into that one world you had put a lot of time into, you discover to your dismay, it is no longer online.

unfortunately since update 8.0 a lot of improvements were made that likely increased the system requirements by quite a bit.

People should be able to be better at cooking and open their restaurants for high quality food, that gives you more points and etc.

thanks for your review.

As i've already answered you in detail in a forum post to a question that seems very linked with your review, i'll just repeat in ""short"" what i've written there.

The only roadmap we at the moment use, is the one here: https://accounts.strangeloopgames.com/roadmap

This one actually is regularily updated and shows what the current in progress work for the next patch (in this case 8.2 with bug fixes and performance fixes as a main objective and enhancment of vehicles as well as further polishing of the 8.0 biomes, plants and animals as secondary objectives) is.

When 8.2 is released this will be replaced by the goals for update 9.0 which are big improvements for government and law systems as well as a complete new mining and smelting progression system with new pollutant sources that are way more dangerous than they have ever been. On top we will have improvements to UI, Chat, Professions, Balance and Recipes and several other minor features. We give sneak peaks on those on all of our social media channels, including steam blog posts before updating the roadmap when 8.2 is released.

The other features in the list are all features we want to implement over the course of Ecos development and offer players the possibility to vote for them, but they do not respresent the order or likelyhood of if and when they are implemented (which is also stated on that page), as game design decisions are more important than player votes. Just implementing trains and focusing solely on that will not give you great enjoyment, i promise you. Nontheless the votings show us what people find most interesting and around what we can build our biggest updates, given Eco is meant as a game of vision where development will never end as long as people play and support it. While trains may not be deemed something easy to implement and useful at this state of the game this can change later in the game when all the core features are implemented and we just can extend the game with fleshed-out new systems.

Given that, there actually are no features that are overdue. I'm suspecting you are referring to boats, but those to my knowledge were never announced for a patch (feel free to correct me if wrong, then i'll get a statement for you), we just presented our first models for them, like we also did for some very advanced vehicles. I've explained that in detail in your forums post, so i'll renounce to repeat all that stuff here again in order to have a post one can actually read in time.

I'm also sorry that you are not happy about the communication but i feel we have well improved in that area with our weekly newsletters that we are doing since some weeks, not only showing the vision of the game, but also what features we are planning, working on and what you can expect in the next patches. All this information is presented on all of our channels which means discord, steam, facebook, reddit, twitter and even e-mail, so it really should reach anybody interested.

If you have any suggestions on how we can improve that even more, feel free to contact me via e-mail at dennis@strangeloopgames.com, chat with me in the forums or discord or just add me as friend. I'd also like to hear which decisions you think are questionable and why.

We are totally aware that performance issues since 8.0 have been getting too little attention and are now working on fixing this issue. We also are aware that professions need rebalancing and will do a lot in this area for 9.0. We'll also have a big focus on providing player simple game-driven means for easier collaboration.

thanks for your review.

I'm sorry you didn't like the game. Did you play in singleplayer or in multiplayer with multiple people? Eco is actually meant to be played on a server with plenty of people, where you can easily trade with other people and split professions.

We know that the skillpoints in a house only counting for one person is something that we need to take a look on, but other than that our authorisation system should work fine. Would you mind telling me the problems you occured while playing with authroisation and anything else you would like to mention?

The many aspects that I loved playing Eco are the different deep and interesting systems and how they interact with eachother. Farming, cooking, tailoring, smelting, ... each skill tree rely on one another. 
The community aspect is probably my favorite, you can't survive without having good interactions with your neighbours, you'll have to make some friends, maybe some won't accept you and this is ok, but at the end of the day you'll have to collaborate or face a certain defeat.

89,50374323,english,"I [b] really [/b] want to recommend this game, however there are three pressing issues that make me not want to recommend this.

1. Time Requirement
This is the least of the issues as it makes sense, however it is still an issue for me. When you play this game, if you do not dedicate a large amount of time, anyone with the same job as you will overtake you. It makes sense to reward those who spend more time in the game, however sometimes people that have more free time than others just tend to impossible to pass even if you spend all of your free time on it. This also makes a sense of requirement to play the game. It feels like if you do not play every day and try to keep up with everyone else, you will fall far behind even in one day. This is a very difficult issue to fix, however I have heard a couple people suggest time sensitive servers that either only allow you to play for so many hours a day, or are only online at certain times. I am not sure if these would even be reasonable as they would be difficult with time zones, but its the only solution I have heard.

2. Finding a Good Server
The most important part of playing the game is finding a good server to play on, and this is difficult to do without spending multiple days searching. Like most people, I like to play from early game through to late game, however this is nearly impossible. Most servers are already multiple days in, which isn't a huge issue, however starting on a level playing field is nice. If you sort the servers to your desired specialization, and set it so you only get servers in the early days, you will be lucky if you get 2 servers with more than 7 people in them. I have found that the official servers often are most populated, however the downside with those, is that they reset every 30 days to my knowledge. This means that if you spend a large amount of time playing on a server and wish to continue playing towards the end, you do not get a say in it and you lose all of your progress (this is not a huge issue as most people do not plan on playing one server for more than 30 days). Lastly, even if you do find a good server that you enjoy, as the days go on and you sink more and more time into the server, other people will begin to leave. This has happened to me on multiple occasions where I spend multiple days (in one case over a week) on a server, only for a majority of the people to leave the server and your left practically alone.

3. Large Groups of People
One of the biggest issues I run into is when groups of friends all play together on a server. This obviously can be okay, but only if the friends playing together consider others experiences in the process. The issue in this arises with the economy. The economy in this game is used for purchasing important items or materials and selling your products to purchase more of these items or materials. This is normally a reasonable situation, however groups often ignore the economy entirely and just give each other items for free. This means that groups are often able to undercut competition and take control of the server. I have experienced this multiple times, however there is one experience that annoys me above all others. I started playing on a high specialization server and over a week I sunk many hours into building many small farms and mills to produce goods to sell. After many hours I finally purchased a small pre built shop in the town square and began selling my goods for as cheap as I could manage while still making a decent profit. The literal day after I had built my shop, the top player in the server invited one of his friends to play on the server, this was no big deal to begin with. Fast forward a day and I get on to check how everything is doing. I notice he is talking to his friend and his friend had decided to be a farmer as well. I am fine with competition and actually enjoy it as it produces lower prices for people buying the goods. At first I saw this as no big deal, but then I checked the map. Within the time I was gone (less than 24 hours) him and his friend had built an ugly floating bridge to a small island and he had filled the entire island with crops and a base over four times time size of mine. He had accomplished much more than I had in over a week, in less than a day simply because he was friends with the richest person on the server. Not only was everything they had built an eyesore, they didn't care to make it look any better and he started selling his goods at next to nothing, making all of my efforts worthless. This is a difficult issue to tackle, I do not know a way that could fix this issue, and some may not even consider it an issue. That being said, solo players are often screwed over by groups of people, and forced out of the world.

With all of this being said, if you have a large amount of free time this game can be enjoyable. During a week that I had nothing going on, I played this game for hours a day and enjoyed every moment of it. Once you manage to find a server it can be enjoyable as long as groups of people don't come along and ruin it.
This game really does have outstanding potential to me, and if even a few of these issues were to be fixed I would recommend it above every other game in my library, however in it's current state these issues all add onto one another and will end up leaving you with hours of time wasted on a server you will not be able to go back to, only to waste many more hours simply searching for a new server.",1556474103,1556474103,False,50,3,0.760318994522094727,1,True,False,True,76561198144771337,83,6,7554,0,7554,1556471997,1558552102.0,"Hello Buck Shot,
thanks for your detailed review.

I'll answer the points you mentioned in short one-by-one.

1. Time consumption is something that is usual for this type of game, especially Eco that resembles real life in a whole lot of ways. We designed the skill system in a way that allows players that join to the game later and have less time to participate in the economy but there is no way how you could prevent someone that invests more time into the game to not surpass you - it would also be unfair because what is the point in playing the game when you don't get an advantage from this? There likely will never be a solution to this - mainly because it is not necessarily a problem. Even when you are not the best in your skill, you can still play the game just fine usually. 

Would you mind telling me what exact reason led you to think it is bad that other players can surpass you? What disadvantages that you totally dislike did you have because of that and did they lead you to loose motivation? We probably should focus on the issues this creates, not on the cause itself. It should be perfectly possible to invest less time than others into the game and still have fun, even when you cannot be the ""best"" player on the server.

Feel free to send me an e-mail to dennis@strangeloopgames.com or add me as friend on steam.

2. We are aware of this issue and want to improve the ways for you to find a suitable server by giving more information about the server and it's progress. Momentarily Eco is usually played in 30 days long cycles as you have noticed. This is commonly noticed by players leaving when this point in time comes nearer. As a long-term goal we want Eco to be a game that you can play forever, but this requires us to finish all the games content and concepts first and is nothing we could easily change with just another patch. There are some long-term servers out there that are played by dedicated groups of players, but you rarely see ""strangers"" there. If you are interested in playing on a long-term server you might want to search for a community that does that and join it. In any case, this also is a problem of players themselves, Eco is a typical ""Make-Your-Own-Objective"" type game that technically can be run until all resources are depleted, but you need to find people that like this playstyle. Most players at the moment actually prefer the cycles that give them a lot of playtime and fun over some weeks with the possibility to play other games after a cycle.

3. This is also an issue we are aware of and searching for solutions. It's very hard to regulate that and i made best experiences with servers that put restrictions on working together like this. A well-administrated server can tackle that problem by rules.

-------------------
In addition to Dennis's notes I wanted to add a comment. Thanks for the thoughtful review, and all the stuff you mentioned are things we are working on in Early Access.  

I want there to be roles in the game that don't require a lot of activity, specifically ones that interact deeply with the economy.  A player that doesn't play as much as others could login, setup contracts, stock their store, make some trades, create some craft orders, make proposals in the government, and log off. They should be a very valuable contributor, without needing to commit more time like roles of builder/farmer/harvester would, they're more like a researcher/merchant.  So this is definitely something on our radar, and we're improving contracts to support this.

With regards to working with groups, we're also adding more ways to make this more meaningful, specifically with tiers of government: local, national, global.  So there will be groups at different levels that cooperate and compete in specific ways, and on up the chain.  The goal is to make smart investments/economic decisions/government action provide greater success in the game than raw play time, and that's something we're working towards.

In any case thanks for the feedback, and check back soon, we're in Early Access and working full-steam on it still.

This is the extent of my experience now. I do enjoy it, but I'm afraid the grinding will bore me in the not too distant future. I am about to start opening a shop, so maybe the trade will take the game to the next level and give me new incentives.

So far I'm not really seeing the advertized focus of the game on the balance between ecology and economy, tragedy of the commons and sustainability in general. Maybe this will become more of an issue if my world gets to a later stage. However I'm slightly disappointed that you are forced into modernist development to progress at the start.

Two major issues so far:
- Server connection issues: I've had times that every few mintues the game becomes unresponsive and takes about 10 seconds to resolve connecion issues. This is very frustrating.
- Graphics and optimization: I'm running on a GTX970 and have to turn down some graphics settings quite a bit, in particular view distance and plant detail. Some optimization and/or better graphic presets are needed.

The game is missing some key features however, for instance im to the point where my efficiency rating are so high im running out of room to put things, (exp) mining,.. when mining for iron im mining tons of sandstone and i have no were to put it, the stockpiles are the largest storage plot, even in higher tiers you dont get any bigger storage, sure im breaking it down as fast as im mining it but then you get either tons of sand or tons of mortar, and still have the same issue, ive got 15 chest and 16 stock piles full of mortar,... its starting to slow the game down a bit when loading those areas, but i cant trash anything or it creates pollution so im stuck at the point of having TOO much, fyi i am playing single player i dont have any friends =(, bigger stockpiles or a recycling system would be nice,...

I've recently introduced a seperate label for exploits and balance issues on our bugtracker. Feel free to report such issues!

But please keep in mind that this is an early access game. Missing content and therefore missing balance is common and nothing special for such titles, we're doing our best to fix all issues, but we can only focus on some for each release.

Thanks for playing Eco so long!

i'm sorry you didn't like our game.

It's not intended to be very challenging there, though as the challenge in this game comes from the participation with other people.

For faster time progression you can sleep in a bed (and in the starter camp from the beginning) or you can actually host your singleplayer world as a server on your computer if you prefer to have time running all the time. But this is something people usually do not want to do.

6,50094021,english,"Eco is briliant simulation of humans who need work together to achieve much, without damaging the world too much. It's kind of hard to compare this to any other game. Yes it has some similarities to a game like Minecraft, but only in gathering resources and building something with that. But its a very unique game all in all. And that is great! It's fresh, different and challenging.

This game is mosty about working together as a small community (which reminds me a lot of older MMO's with deep player economies) to build more and more complex things. Cooperation is key, while at the same time everyone wants to have their own shop and own money. Because it's impossible to do all things alone (except when you play singleplayer, but that is just a grind), you need to sell and buy stuff a lot to and from other  people. This makes for a true capitalism simulator online! And at the same time there is politics, laws you can vote for and ofcourse the environment which can be easily destroyed if you dont take care of it. But you still need to exploit it to build all those complex machines. Choices, choices, choices... And you don't get to make those choices alone, you need those other citizens of your world. And thats where the fun starts, if you find a good server to play on. 

And all this only lasts 30 days if you don't get that meteor shot down... So there's also the challenge of time.


Pro's: 
- Visuals are great!
- Gameplay is solid, despite early access
- Not many game breaking bugs
- Awesome crafting and economy systems
- Great law system
- Community building is great
- Total freedom to do what you want

Con's:
- Many servers don't keep up the cooperation all the way until the end
- The endgame requires massive amounts of resources and can become a grind
- Server lag happens 
- It's time consuming ;)

You can actually use the following hotkeys:
Left click = move whole stack to opposite inventory
Alt + Left click = move one item of current stack to opposite inventory
Ctrl + Left click = move a half of current stack to opposite inventory
Alt + Ctrl + Left click = move all items of this kind to opposite inventory

We also made a lot of QoL changes like scrollwheel support for selection bars in splitting and steps for selection.

13,49904031,english,"Small TL;DR below

Eco is a game that has some length to become one of the most indepth, multiplayer, survival games here. When you look at the trailer and dive into the game for the first time, everything seems so nice. You build, you eat, you form a community and you achieve your final objective, which is destroying the meteor without actually destroying the environment. Seems nice? Well the game (and some people around it) have some points that have to be adressed:

1: Bugs
I know, it's an EA game and I expected to experience bugs. Some are minor, and some are litteraly game breaking(will elaborate in my 2nd point) and hardware breaking. The game as it is, is borderline unplayable due to lags. From framedrops (chopping debris from a tree can drop your frames from 60 FPS to 6-12 PFS), to the point that the game doesnt use your Graphics card anymore, so you would have to restart per 5-10 minutes if you want to play above 5 PFS. 

2: Gameplay
The game in this state gameplay wise is just not fun, tedious, and broken. For a game thats supposed to be focused to be an educational program, this game just copy pastes the grinding mechanic which you can find at any MMORPG game. The game progresses when people take more advanced skills. Skillpoints are gained by the nutrition gathered from food and by the interior of your house(s). Getting good food or furniture for your house requires the correspondenting labour (for food you gather/farm, for furniture you process the raw materials into it). At first glance there seems to be no problem, but the 2nd point AKA housing points can be too easily exploited. Even if there are high tier furniture, which is only availabl mid/late game, you can litteraly achieve the same by just making as much rooms as possible with low tier furniture. Not only can that person (or group) progress much faster than intended, it also encourages that people process their own products, therefore making them independend from others. Other than that pollution has on big world little to no effect. Have 500 tailings on the server? No problem, even the world doesn't care. 
As I said the game is tedious and grindy. Why is it like that? Let me explain. As said above to achieve the final objective you need lasers to destroy it? Cant build lasers? Get the tech for it? Dont have the research? Grind the materials! But wait, Im not done yet. Dont have the skillpoints for it? Improve nutrition and housing. Cant improve nutrition? Improve housing (as everyone does). Dont have building material or furniture? Grind the mats for it! I know you need to get the materials to eventually improve at something but at this time, since grinding is directly connected to winning the game. It just doesnt feel fun. But you can play at your own tempo right? Cause since the average game is 30 days right? Well, in the next point i prove that wrong.

3: The community
This is the first time I've seen a community, playing a game with 0 PVP elements and still try to compete/monopolize. If you're planning to play the game laid back, you better find some people who play at the same tempo as you, cause if someone or some people uses the thing I explained above, then in less than a day you can be irrelevant to the whole server. The thing is even when there are quite some proffessions, those only need to be filled by 4-6 players. Lets say you will do smithing, and you play just at a normal rate and someone else also picked smithing and is gaining far more Skillpoints than you, and has more playtime. Not only will he be far more efficient than you (cause manufacturing stuff at a reduced cost, is directly bound to the ammount of raw labour you've practiced, other players will buy from him and supply him, since that's more efficient. With small servers this is not a big problem, but with moderate or big servers (especially one where all people settle around one location) this disencourages people to continue playing on that server. Now there is a circle you can see in activity from most of the players. 
* they join a fresh world
* they take one of the basic skills (even tho like others already picked it)
* either they settle too close to the people with the same skill, or they isolate themselves from the rest of the community (making it almost impossible to trade with them)
* they log off and come back in a while seeing that the world has progressed without them and that no one buys/sells to them
* they leave the world since they have no added value to it and are looking for a new one
* repeat the above

4: Development
This is probably the MOST important point to why I advise not to buy this game. Eco has a roadmap for quite a time (which is just a vague illustration of what they want to implement at what time). They have also created a poll in which they let the community vote to what they want to see in the game. If you are going to look at those two things you can almost say that the devs have another vision for what has priority. Dont get me wrong here. The most voted idea is the implementation of trains (which will be impossible with their current workforce and programming experience). But at least they synergize with one thing that the community wants. CONTENT!!! And ofcourse every game needs a decent ammount of content to be played. But the reason this dissatisfies me is cause between the content updates, there was hardly any focus on BALANCING the current game mechanics. Imagine playing a MOBA game like League of Legends. And in the current meta mages are overpowered and marksmen (adc's) are weak. If Riot would act like SLG would do, they would add 5 more mages and 10 items for mages builds. The game craves for content, but what it needs is BALANCING. WHAT MATTERS IS MAKING THE GAME FAIR AND PLAYABLE FOR EVERYONE.

As for now im going to leave it at this since im not motivated to point out any more of the points, which can only go worse than whats written above. The game now is unbalanced, the focus of the devs are everywhere except where its supposed to be and parts of the community make my eyes bleed. I adivise everyone that read this to NOT buy this game. Set it on a wishlist, join the discord and carefully watch the development if you are REALLY interested. Cause as of now this ""program"" can barely be called a game. Maybe a pre-pre-Alpha state what can become a game, but definitely not ready yet to be on steam Early Access.",1554175205,1554175307,False,49,7,0.709316253662109375,9,True,False,True,76561198392045540,36,2,46502,97,44537,1601516222,1554231318.0,"Hello roflmarv,
thanks for your detailed review and that you did play the game for nearly 750 hours regardless of the issues you had.

I'll address each of your points in short:

1. We are fully aware of the issues you mentioned and working hard on fixing them, we released a big hotfix to address some issues a bit after update 8.0, update 8.1 with way more fixes is scheduled for this week and the next update 8.2 will also mainly focus on bugfixes and performance improvements. This should improve the situation.

2. Actually, in comparison to other games, we have a lot of unique and interesting systems, like the nutrition and housing influence on skillpoints and with our recently introduced revised skillsystem we also made sure that progress in skills is gained by actually doing something. You are fully correct that the housing system can be used to exploit the system, especially by min-max gamers. We're aware of that and investigating how we can fix this issue. If you are interested, there is already a mod which does a simple but great job in balancing that by limiting the maximum amount of housing skill points to your food skill value - which also boosts the balance of the cook.

As for the grind, is there any specific idea you would have to improve the system? Feel free to add me as friend or send me an e-mail to dennis@strangeloopgames.com.

It's not uncommon for games to require you to research and learn skills and gather materials to achieve a goal. It's pretty standard. In Eco you also have options to make your life easier by collaboration, trade and government interaction (Lasers often are server-wide projects) which should provide plenty of ways to get to your goal. Leveling up skills also reduces the amount of needed materials by quite a lot.

3. We're also aware that there are motivation issues for some players, especially when joining a server in the middle of the game. We're investigating what we can do to improve that situation, but the points you mentioned are actually intended. Collaboration is not something that can only be approached one way - people actively trading and engaging in competition with each other is a form of collaboration you'll see in most modern civilisations in real life. The game is great in simulating this, including all the difficulties with it - that's where government and laws come in place and also server administrators and server concepts can change the gameplay considerably. We do know that some professions are just less useful than others in the late game, but our long-term goal is definately to balance these, split these where needed and introduce and extend the professions where needed.

4. You are right, balancing is something that we need to do and we plan to looking into that after we fixed the issues you mentioned in 1. As far as the roadmap goes, that is a collection of things we want to do and let players tell us what they would like to see the most. But we do actually mention that this is a poll, not a vote. We still stand for all these features, but development requires us to think about which feature can be implemented with how much work and when the best time for a feature is. We also want to add features that not everyone is hyped for but everyone on medium to big sized servers uses nontheless - the law and governent systems that are going to be improved in update 9.0, for example.

I tried it with a friend on a private world, to get the hang of things.

- Chatbox keeps randomly scrolling around, making it completely useless

- Fishing doesn't seem to do anything
- Fish traps can only be placed on land ???
- Displacing dirt with the shovel works one block at a time, unless you put those blocks in a storage, then you can suddenly pick up more

thanks for your review. I'm happy that i can tell you that we adressed some of these issues in the upcoming update 8.1, which is scheduled for this week.

In 8.1 the scrolling chatbox, fishing and tutorials have been fixed. The issue about fish traps is known and being looked at at the moment.

For your issue with the grind, keep in mind that you get more efficient in things by doing them and that this game is made for larger collaborating groups in mind, we do have plans to add a resource multiplier to the game, though.

As for the shovel, we had a big shovel earlier, but that one just didn't feel realistic, considering it's hard to fill a shovel completely when actually digging compared to getting the dirt from a dirt heap. I know that this change was controversial, but there is a mod to get it back in the game that you could try if you prefer it differently.

20,49686886,english,Since my original review I have spoken with Dennis the community manager. My original review was negative due to the ginding needed to excel. Dennis sent me a long email explaining the intricacies of the game. I have never had a developer willing to not only answer my negative review but continue correspondance in order to explain their decisions. This game is a fantastic game that i have dedicated a lot of time to and I have had a great time. It can be grindy but that is really determined by the server itself. the admin of the server has the ability to increase how fast XP is gained.

28,40559197,english,"Ever wonder what Minecraft would look like if Greenpeace made it?  Here is your game, Eco.  This game is a global voxel-based ecology simulator where, in its base form, players must use the land and resources to create a device to blow up an asteroid that will collide with your planet and destroy all life.  You start off as a player in a virgin world full of plants, animals, trees, oceans, and all of the beauty of nature, and you must take resources in order to accomplish the life-saving goal.  In doing so, however, players need to also be careful to not destroy the planet.  Everything, such as deforestation, pollution, and wildlife populations is interconnected and upsetting this balance too much to achieve your goal will destroy your world from ecological disaster.

And on this front the game provides amazing visual feedback.  Land becomes barren if you cut down too many trees.  Wildlife becomes sparse.  Wild foods will stop growing, water will turn muddy brown.  There are lots of signs that things are tipping in the wrong direction here.

In doing all of this, players also have individual wants and needs.  Food and housing are required to advance your character to the point where he can research and build these things, and players that have the better stuff will advance faster.  

Because of this, greed can set in very quickly and you can have a hierarchy develop, either through positive impacts like stronger leaders emerging, or negative impacts such as greed and corruption wanting some players to have a bigger slice of the pie.  To counter these impacts, players can vote on laws that prevent certain actions, such as cutting down too many trees, leaving trash around.  Or positive reinforcements such as rewards for good behavior like chopping tree stumps to allow new trees to grow in its place.

These are the mechanics of the game, but do they work?

This amount of collaboration sounds great, but it is a double edged sword.  When it works, it is one of the best and most fulfilling experiences there is.  When it doesn't work, it is a mess of trolls and me-players cutting down all of the trees, taking up all of the space, no roads, nothing.  Playing the game like this will exhaust resources extremely quickly, and joining in when the world has become a hell hole with no way to even make your place in it can be a miserable experience.  Latency is also an issue.  The game behaves incredibly poorly with high latency, even moreso than Minecraft or any other game.  Physics become bugged, you can teleport to different parts of the land without reason, and you're given no feedback.  The game will tell you when there are huge spikes, but it is a very negative experience when you end up on a bad server.

  In addition, it's very difficult to join in on games at later stages, beyond Day 10 perhaps (unless they are smaller servers).  Not all servers are newbie friendly as well, and while most people are welcoming to new players, there are ones that require high collaboration and won't welcome newbies, limiting your choices even more.

If you buy this game, buy it knowing that you might go on 5 straight servers that either are laggy or where the worlds are a mess, and that because of how hard it is to find a server.  You might even waste a couple hours on a server before you realize that you want no part of it.  If you do not have friends to play this, you'll have to be patient.  

I am going to continue recommending this game because of the effort from developers and the sky high fun factor when everything works.  It is an amazing educational experience, has parallels to real life, and you feel like a true part of the world you are in and a responsibility to do your part in maintaining balance between achieving your goals, those of the server, and not screwing up the planet while doing so.",1520161258,1552868554,True,55,3,0.817358493804931641,2,True,False,True,76561197966661634,238,59,25503,0,10553,1583819833,,

In singleplayer I can get around 40 - 50 FPS in single player 1080p High. However, singleplayer is not reccomended as it's a team based game. In Multiplayer I only get 15 - 25 FPS because it's so bad (even with an ethernet cable plugged into my PC). I made sure none of my hardware was bottle necking it. 
I have never seen a game perform so poorly to the point PUBG performs better on my PC. If they fix these problems I would reccomend the game because it's fun and creative.

With the recent patch I see a substantial performance gain. I think there's still progress to be made as you can disconnect randomly sometimes. Overall it's a much better playable experience. If you find a good server you can find yourself having lot's of fun!

You can. Want to be a hippie and plant trees all over the world? Want to become a road worker and develop the infrastructure? Want to become the elected leader and control taxes?

This is one of the most feature rich Early Access games I have ever played. I started after the 0.8 update which appearently introduced unoptimized and laggy experiences for some. I have an average gaming PC, and would expect better/smoother FPS than I'm getting BUT if you turn off Vsync and Global Illumination it almost doubles your FPS. Another large factor is viewing distance as well. Tinkering with these settings alone will make the game signficantly more enjoyable. I say go ahead and buy, if my 290x and 8320 processor can run this game on a smooth 40fps with these adjustments then have no fear for more modern rigs.

I have been playing a private server with a few friends and I love the concept of learning and building as a community instead of individually. I suppose you could do both but that would be way more difficult and time consuming. There are just a few issues that i have with the game. I'll list my pros and cons in the bottom.

Cons: 
* Memory leak
*No possible way to destroy, trash or scrap unwanted items
*Some animations are buggy ( ex. using the scythe) causes fps issues (lowering graphics doesn't solve this issue)
*Jumping in the corner of blocks can sometimes cause you character to get stuck in a falling animation and emit a wind blowing sound for a few seconds before encountering a falling animation and sound effect
*Some players have an issue connecting to servers (restarting the server seems to fix the issue temporarily)
*Moving around the map away from your usual location (house) can cause extreme fps issues since the game must render all the new blocks ever so often

Pros:
*Tons of building and creativity options
*Encourages teamwork in a community environment 
*A Leveling system that allows you to learn new skills / trades which unlock new crafting recipes
*Ability to create player owned shops to buy and sell wanted and unwanted items
*Ability to create player specific currency 
*Ability to enhance experience rates based on player owned house
*Time is bases on actual time and not in game day night cycle

Overall i think this is a amazing game and I have since enjoyed the time I've spent playing it.

1.  They made the game EVEN MORE GRINDY.  Holy effing heck.  The changes to ore generation mean that you will not be able to find materials without carting them from all over the globe.  Good luck if you need copper.   Wait, you didn't build your base in grassland?  No iron for you either.  Give me a break.

Especially if the server is solo, or small team.

2.  Solo play has been punished even more.  They actually doubled the ingredients for most recipes.  The players dont want this game to be a full time job just so the devs can tell us what a piece of garbage we are for polluting the environment.

The game is like a SJW version of minecraft that takes weeks to play and at the end tells you that you were a bad person all along.

i'm sorry to hear that you feel that our new ore generation increased the grind.

Actually, this game is designed around multiplayer and with society and economy in mind. Like with the split professions between different players that requires you to trade this change does simply the same. You don't find every resource everywhere on earth either. This works out fine on medium sized servers, where i play on myself. Other servers can adapt the settings to make it easier.

As far as singleplayer goes i can understand your complaint, but we provide configuration options to adapt the gameplay to everyones liking and we're going to improve on that further down the road.

The complaints about low framerate and memory leaks seem to well apply to me. The sysreqs say minimum ram: 2GB, recommended 4GB... within a few minutes of playing the executable ballooned up to over 7GB and climbing, my framerate on a GTX 960 (far above the min/recommended GPUs) was 15fps, turning shadows down increased it a little, but it is still very clear this engine is not performing as intended.

The idea for the game is nice, I hope they get it together and fix whatever they broke and at that point I may rebuy the game and change my review accordingly.

actually, when you eat one of the starter tomatoes a tutorial should appear telling you how to gather more food. The game is designed to not get you deadlocked.

As far as naming conventions for the characters i really don't see any difference between the two ways to call it and there was no further intention in doing so.

Regarding your comment: Not being able to die in this game is intended. The game is about economy, ecology and society. This is not one of the standard survivial games, but has a clear focus on building a working society. You fight other players with arguments instead of weapons. This might not be for everyone, but it was not meant to be yet another survival game.

So after returning to the game the first time in awhile, I've had nothing but issues with lag and poor performance. I by no means have a horrible PC, and I even have a friend who has a top of the line one, and we both experience extremely poor performance. Something is not optimized correctly.

Granted, you don't need 60FPS for a game like this, but I'm averaging like 15FPS on everything down, and lows of like 5FPS at some points. (when I mine a rock, chop a tree, cut grass, etc.) In fact, I've had this game on multiple occasions absolutely destroy my PC when trying to quit out.

 I miss the performance of the earlier game (when I would get like 50FPS), and for that reason I cannot recommend you pay $30 due to the above mentioned issues. Hopefully the developers figure it out, because I do really enjoy the games mechanics!

Beautifully crafted game. I remember playing Minecraft with my friends and we always used to build a “community”, however nothing felt community-based besides our houses being within a proximity. Not to compare this game to Minecraft because I believe it shares no similarities besides the blocks. This is the game I have been searching for since 2011, and I’m so glad to finally have it here. 

This game is such a unique and original idea, which is refreshing in this day and age of video games. 

The only thing I can’t recommend is single player-play. You begin to feel lonely fast, however don’t fear. You don’t need friends per say! Don’t be afraid to join a server and interact with the player base! Most people you encounter will only add onto your experience. 

Overall, I believe there is things that still need to be polished, but with 2 hot fixes since release, it shows me that the developer/developing team is dedicated towards improving the game; which in my opinion is already an amazing game.

Since this is a positive review, I'll list the bad first.
Chat: The chat is my biggest pet peve. While functional and gives you the important information it breaks all the time. For whatever reason, and this isn't just a me problem, it will jump halfway up the chat history and sit there. Please devs fix this!
Early access: Fortunately for me this was a well paid off gamble, but having the early access tag is always a negative in my opinion thanks to the thousands of cash grab 'early access' games. I could rant about it, but I understand the need for the phrase in certain situations.
Nuisance bugs: Most bugs aren't game breaking, but they are annoying.. Sometimes fun(ny), too. Annoying things like a glitch through the map because broken up ore fell on you the right way and clipped you out of bounds, your cart bouncing when you load it, or trees bouncing when you chop them to pieces. I did have some fun ones. Like expecting a tree to fall over, but instead it rocketed into space for a couple seconds. Starting the rocket program out early.. I don't recommend trying to use trees to hit the asteroid.
Tooltips: If you don't have a 1 million DPI mouse to twitch over the tooltip to keep it open, well your SoL.
Skills: They don't explain them..

Now with that the good list is way too big for this. I'll post the few I think are more important.
Sense of community in public servers: It's stupidly high in this game. Either you all work together or die together. This can help create a bond between you and your servermates as you decide what you're going to do to help everyone out.
Co-operation: Choosing to do different levels of co-operation is a double edge sword. You get less xp as time passes, but you're more relied on for your profession at higher difficulties. It is a good play style that I love because you can be an important cog in your community no matter where you decide your build is going.
Aesthetic: This game looks great, and it feels great in world. I find myself immersed and losing all track of time for hours on end as I go about my day being the job I choose for that server.
Concept: Just everything about this concept is great. Execution might be jenky a little, but it plays off very well. Having to go from rags to riches while trying to keep your world from going to hell is a fun time.
Politics: The politics in the game can get fun, having a fun time creating political parties who will vote a certain way in an rp fashion. Maybe your party has to band together to prevent an animal to go extinct. Everything is on a balanced on different people's views on how to play and what is needed.

76,49055318,english,"Okay so first of all, yes, I'm giving this a positive review (after writing this I've switched it to negative so the devs might read it). Even with its current problems (which I will get to in the second half), Eco is a one-of-a-kind game that offers something not currently available, and also does it with a great design in both graphical style and gameplay. However, read the second half of this review if you're thinking of a purchase.

So what kind of game is this and who is it for? It's a game about paving the untamed wilds and forming a civilization, complete with an economy. If you're the kind of player who likes to tear down a jungle and turn it into a city, this is a great game. The pacing is slow compared to something like, say, Minecraft, but it's faster paced than other games in the genre like Wurm Online.

I'd say there's two halves to this game: one is the actual digging and construction, and the other half is working with other players (sometimes total strangers) and forming an economy. And this second part is where a lot of people are leaving negative reviews, but I think that they're missing the intended experience: if your whole world goes to shit and nobody cooperates, that IS the game. You did not have a failed experience. Just sit back and laugh at the drama.

Now, that being said, be prepared to throw your expectations of other people out the window. Otherwise, you're gonna have a bad time. No other game has got me swearing at my neighbours and fellow players more than this game. Many people are selfish. They're greedy. They hoard all the resources for no reason. Sometimes everybody's prices are completely insane. At least in a game where people are shooting at you, you know who your enemies are. Well how about a situation where you're selling a whole ton of building materials for the lowest price on the server, and your neighbour is complaining that nobody has any building materials for sale. So you remind him about your fantastic stock and prices, and he just goes ""oh yea i forgot about that"" and then continues to not buy anything from you for days, weeks, ever. Why does he not buy anything from you? Oh geez who knows, man. Maybe it's because your house is bigger than his and he's jealous of your success. Maybe he's a total dimwit. Who knows, who knows. But that's Eco. And yes this is a real thing that happened.

So that being said, don't run into this expecting to experience the cooperation of a Utopian society. You'll mostly want to just burn the whole world to the ground and everybody in it. But my advice is to stick it through until a server dies and then move on to the next one, because all servers offer a completely different experience. One server I was on, nobody was buying what I was producing. Another server I logged onto had 5 buy orders of 999 for it. It completely depends on who you're playing with, but at the same time, not knowing how the economy is going to develop is part of the fun, as well as trying to adapt to those weird conditions.

OKAY NOW ALL THAT BEING SAID HERE IS THE SECOND HALF OF THIS REVIEW:

At least one of the coders at Strange Loop Games lied on his resume. Parts of this game code are absolute HOT GARBAGE. I have never played a game that is as badly programmed as this one. I can not stress how badly this is coded, and let me get into the details.

So first of all, the game now uses more than 7 gigs of ram while running. So if you've got 8 gigs of ram and you also run windows? SOL. Okay, strangely high requirements, that's not so bad. But get this: the more stockpiles on a server, the slower the game runs until it becomes unplayable. Yes, that's right, stockpiles. A pile of stuff that just sits there. Oh no, it shouldn't do anything until you access it, but for some reason only the guy who coded it knows, the stockpiles are actively thinking about something constantly because the more of them in a server, plainly and simply, the worse the server runs. They don't even have to be near you to slow things down. And being a stockpile in a game about industry, you need them. The more stockpiles you can have means the more efficient your business can deal with the logistics of storage, but also the laggier your game gets at all frames. It's like every frame the game draws it needs to ask all the stockpiles if they're feeling okay, first.

Okay let us continue. When you cut a square of grass, the FPS drops by 80% for FIVE SECONDS following the cut. It's like it has to consult ALL THE GRASS IN THE CHUNK everytime you cut one piece of grass. Why does it do this? Gee I don't know, only the coder can tell us.

Well the game runs bad, so you turn your resolution down. Well guess what? It's not really rendering the lower resolution properly. It's actually taking that resolution of 1280x720 and STRETCHING THE IMAGE AND RENDERING IT AT 1920x1080. I have never seen a game do this. It blows my mind. So in order to get the actual performance improvement, you have to turn down the native resolution of windows, and then boot the game into the lower resolution. Again, I have never seen a game behave like this! It's scares me! What kind of madman programmed this mess and how did they even get it to do that? To further perplex the user, if you don't turn down the native resolution of windows, not only will you not get the performance improvement of the lower resolution but every once in awhile the game will hang for 20 seconds and randomly switch your resolution back to 1920x1080 without asking. what?? how??? huh????

Do you want to turn off graphical features like light rays coming through the leaves from the sun? Well too bad, because the game switches them back on after 3 seconds. Why? OH MY GOD I DON'T KNOW WHY!

One time I was dragging a piece of plant seed from a stockpile to my backpack, and when the game hung on a frame it showed the entire view window had the graphic rendered over it at full screen with 50% transparency. WHY? Why would this be a thing that happens during the process of dragging an icon from one container to the other? Why would it choose to render it at fullscreen at 50% transparency for a frame? Just to make it run slower?

Okay so continuing, there's a new bug where when you mine stone, about up to about 30% can lag out, disappear, and rain down on the surface above your mine. But what I've come to realize is that while this happens with granite, limestone, and sandstone, it does not happen with shale. How can the code for 3 rocks be so different than 1? Did they re-code the new stone types from scratch?

In the new version they said they were going to increase visibility and optimize chunk loading, and now the chunks just don't load for anybody. You can move along at a walking pace and you still have to wait seconds for the next chunk in front of you to load. Yes that means you can't see further than 5 feet in front of you (if at all) when you're exploring the game world. This didn't happen in version 7, and now, with what they call OPTIMIZATIONS, nobody can render chunks properly anymore.

I used to think I was the only person with the graphics turned so low, but every screenshot from every person on the server I'm on, all 6 of us who are left after 25 stopped playing, are running the game at the lowest graphics setting at resolutions equal or lower to 1280x720.

Oh yea and to top it all off, the new version has a big ol memory leak. Have you heard that word since 2003? Oh wow do memory leaks bring me back. I thought we were done with them but no, here's a blast from the past. Enjoy restarting your game every 30 minutes as it gradually begins to hang for up to 20 seconds or longer.

Okay so all that being said, with all the bugs present and the current code being an absolute enigma of steaming dog-doodoo, this game can be fixed and it can be fixed in 6 months if they get a new lead coder. It's still in early access, and the actual gameplay design and graphical style is like a 9/10, okay.",1550417792,1550417792,False,1364,162,0.912644386291503906,107,True,False,True,76561197961915793,55,13,4189,0,4055,1599962391,1551095131.0,"Hello Hercules Rockefeller,
we are aware of and sorry for the performance issues that update 8.0 introduced.

We are a rather small team of passionated people working on this game and doing our best to make continuous improvements on the game. Update 8.0 was a major overhaul of the game with a lot of changes that we felt make the game better. Unfortunately, this also introduced problems. We know that this release didn't went as good as it could, have identified problems that lead to that and are working on fixing those.

A first measure is, that we decided to put our main focus on improving performance and fixing bugs for 8.1 - it will be a bugfix and performance update. We hope that you'll take another look on the game when this update releases.

83,49006144,english,"This game is definitely one of those that I hate to love. That being said, on the whole I would recommend it, but with several major caveats.

tl;dr, this is a Minecraft-like, but with a strong focus on building an economic/political/environmental system together with other players, and is pretty much only enjoyable when played multiplayer on a larger server.

I've fallen haaaard for this game over the past few weeks, playing on a large server with some randoms who generally turned out to be okay to play with. Without knowing a damn thing about the game (and unfortunately the official Wiki for the game is absolute trash, so there's not much help or direction there either), I decided to specialize in farming, with an eventual goal to become a baker. My husband plays with me, and to complement the food production business, he decided to start as a hunter and work his way towards being a chef. Together, we wanted to carve out a culinary empire on the server we play on.

Unfortunately it seems that this might have been something of a bad newbie move. Some specialization (like Hewing) are absolutely vital in the early game (unless you have the time and inclination to do an absolute shit-ton of grinding in order to build your first house), and if you join a fresh server with a low world age, you will quickly run into a situation where the economy hasn't developed enough to provide you with resources to build in exchange for materials from your own specialization (i.e. trading food for building materials). Once the economy of the server stabilizes and sufficient people take up different professions, this becomes a bit better, but in the beginning its rough.

This has definitely been a ""wait, WHAT time did you say it was?!"" game for me. It's insanely easy to lose track of time in this game.

All in all it shows a lot of promise, but there are several glaring issues:

-Legit don't know if the devs even test their hot code before pushing it live. I get that it's a small dev team, and maybe it's because I started playing right as a massive content patch went live, but there have been several absolutely massive bugs since 8.0.0 was pushed live, one of which makes ores in worlds generated at that patch version pretty much nonexistent.
-The game is extremely poorly optimized. So far there have been three hotfix patches to 8.0.0 that have succeeded in making it slightly better, only then to make it very much worse again.
-Traversal of the game is really frustrating. Moving through the rainforest biome slows your character to an absolute CRAWL, and heavy woods aren't much better. That being said, eventually your server (should?) have a much more developed network of roads which makes this much easier, but I can totally see some servers not really making that a priority.
-The currency system is deep, but it needs better onboarding, as there are a lot of people who don't really seem to understand that store credit is a bad thing and that currency adoption is good.
-In general there needs to be a better market interface. Right now I can open the economic window and see a shop across the map buying something that I want to sell. So I load myself up and make a ten-minute trek across the world, only to get there and find that the shop doesn't have any free storage capacity left to actually buy my wares. That desperately needs to be fixed.

All said, I hate that I love this game. Your enjoyment is going to be heavily dependent on how much you liked Minecraft and how much you like economic and political simulators -- and probably above all, it'll be dependent on how good the group of people you're playing with is.

Verdict: I think it's definitely worth a buy, but you need to go into it knowing that you're getting a product that is VERY MUCH in Early Access, and have a lot of patience for bugs. But when the game's good, it's DAMN good.",1550232926,1550232926,True,0,0,0.498687654733657837,0,True,False,True,76561197978482546,741,21,4664,0,3098,1599909694,,

Even less playable with very few players (Jesus Christ please for the love of god add a resource collected multiplier to low pop servers)
Skill system STILL is only a bunch of boring as ass massive resource cost reductions, meaning that getting started on anything new is ATLEAST 5X more painful then it needs to be. When I get a new skill I shouldn't be going ""Oh ok, that's slightly less grindy now"" I should be going ""Oh wow that's really interesting, I wonder how I can get the most out of that?""

The skill system doesn't need to be reworked... The resource costs need to be cut to 20% of what they are now and then add in skills that do interesting things. (And PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE add a skill that removes movement speed penalties and increases base movement speed)

88,48905342,english,"I strongly want to advise people reading most comment that the specialization in this game is a false statement.

There's no specialization in this game, anyone can possess any number of certain points in all disciplines, it's just a matter or time, nothing else limits that, and since your skill points are not actively generated but generated offline as well, its only a matter of who joined the game first that will be most advanced, regardless of it's activity.
I was extremely disappointed, since by reading comments I was lead to belief each people had unique impact in the game, but you might join an advanced server at any time where 2-3 peoples have access to all skills in each tech tree and are basically 1 man armies.
Joining a game in which no one actually needed me beside going to fetch stone was the misleading aspect that killed the multiplayer experience for me, and since it's basically a multiplayer game where you need to have a pre-made group of players to start a game, it was the end of the experience for me.

Players needs to have a system of limited specialization, allowing no more than one or two maxed specialization. That way each player will have more value in a community and be less treated like rock-picking garbage like we actually are.

As for your issue with the mint: That's a good example on when to use the law system, you could for example propose a law to restrict the building of mints, for example by agreeing with other players on a centralised mint. You could also look for some of the bigger servers that ususally have great concepts thought out by their administrators, often including a government-controlled global currency. There are a lot of possibilities in Eco on how to structure a society and the economy.

Pros - 
Really awesome crafting system, very expansive with good rewards for your efforts. 
Makes you think about how you impact the planet based on what you're doing. 
Really fun to build in this game. Resources for building are fair, where you feel like you did some work but not overboard.

Cons - 
It is good that you negatively impact the planet when you do things, but having more wood pulp (trash) from cutting down a tree than you do actual wood is a bit insane. Every tree you cut down gives you 50-100 wood pulp that you can do very little with, and you can't burn it to power your fires for crafting, which makes absolutely no sense. 
Can only carry 20 wood/stone etc at a time unless you're on a modded server. This can be upgraded some, so it isn't the end of the world. 
You can build a skidsteer or escavator. These are awesome machines. You can carry 10 dirt in a stack... or 400 of anything besides dirt. So basically you get to use the machine for about 1 minute and 30 seconds before having to empty it. This is a major issue with these machines and makes them nearly unusable. 

Can't think of much else that is negative. If you enjoy crafting and building, this is certainly right up your alley.",1548479156,1548517743,True,7,0,0.573934078216552734,0,True,False,True,76561198083060022,208,57,6073,0,5883.0,1556984731,,

This has been one of the best experiences I've ever had with a video game. The depth and detail of the entire game blows my mind. The actions of your fellow citizens and yourself has a cause and effect of the planet you play on. Here are a few things that make this game awesome.

-Ecology and animal/plant supervision
-Controlling pollution and garbage, knowing how to dispose of them properly. Tailings....
-Government and being able to establish laws and create currency, first server we spent like 6 hours determining amount in circulation and backing, it was an amazing process. 
-Economy and store fronts, using the economy viewer and seeing whats on the market, I usually do a shopping trip before i log off and go pick up things for the house or the next day. (My friend and I will ride around together in the truck and blow money!)
-Human interaction, this game can get heated when other people control certain aspects of the market, it take speaking and listening skills to try and work with multiple people with diffrent ideologies.

i'm sorry to hear you didn't like our game.

You wrote about mandatory quests, i assume you mean the tutorials, do you? Those are meant to give you help when getting into the game, so you do not have problems with it. They are not mandatory, though, you can press the ""x"" to cancel them - each one or all at once.

As far as long running times go: You'll get access to vehicles later in the game and it's adviseable to settle near friends to play together. You can also increase and reduce the size of the world to whatever size you think would fit you.

16,48406154,english,"I would like to preface this review by stating that, even in its early access state, Eco has easily become one of my favorite games of all time. 

Briefly stated, Eco is the closest in conception to a Sandbox MMO, albeit with far fewer players. The skill system encourages players to collaborate with one another by limiting players to a specialized profession, such as Carpentry, Masonry, Tailoring, and etcetera in the early game, or even Electrical Engineering, Industrial Engineering, Oil Drilling, and further in the later game.

In order for global commerce to commence, players must mint their own currencies, otherwise they must trade utilizing a barter system. Though, interesting gameplay may emerge here, as very few players will have the skill required to mint currency; Those players will decide upon the standard, whether that standard be Gold, or Dirt, the choice is left up to them, and thus, the state of the economy will exist in the shadow of their actions.

On top of this, a political system exists, by which, players must propose legislation, and vote on its ratification. Said system works similarly to a visual programming language, such as [i]Scratch[/i]. Utilizing this system, players may propose laws which restrict certain actions, subsidize certain behaviors, define districts, and etcetera. While the political system is not yet fully implemented, and functions primarily as a direct democracy at this current time, future versions allow players the ability to grant titles, and modify the political system, and the distribution of tax funds as they see fit.

With that said, the game is certainly still an Early Access product, and as such, there does exist optimization issues, and experimental features. Do expect some major server stability bugs, and potential server rollbacks. However, if one clearly understands the risks of buying into an Early Access product, and the bothersome predicaments that may arise in such an environment, then I can certainly attest to the excellence of Eco, and further, I can fully recommend this product.",1547837306,1547837306,True,2,0,0.519999980926513672,0,True,False,True,76561198140659688,199,1,5785,0,5468.0,1578373507,,
17,48177899,english,"****UPDATE****
So far I've played for 100 hours and WOW am I impressed!
PROS:
The UI stuff is great and SO much quality of life stuff 
connected storage, waypoints (and share globally if World Leader), being able to individually authorize access to just about EVERYTHING, TOOLTIPS ARE AMAZING!

Now, there are a few cons - 
***1. this game is still in EA so I understand, there are sometimes bugs: things not loading on the mini map, there are some issues with the government - my friends can't seem to open the page to vote for a world leader. (solved: i was going a P2P server, on a regular server works wonderfully)
*2. I wish there were dedicated servers so the server can just run - there are BUT for purchase. 
*3. Choosing an Earth size would be great too, apparently on a server you can
4. A few more character customization options/****ability to change character once it's been loaded into a world (you can)
5. Before leaving the game I wish there was an easier way to look at the impact you've had on the Earth - like a summary page or something.

SUGGESTION:
1. I wish there was an easier way to upgrade building material, like an upgrade all in this area if you have the materials, but I COMPLETELY understand why it's not like that. Just someone who doesn't always love building and then re-building it can be more of a pain than fun.
2. CARRY 2 Materials PLEEEASE, just for being able to upgrade more efficiently. Right now you carry one specific building material and if you're upgrading to a new material let's say glass, and you go to what you want to upgrade, you have to put the glass down, break down the old blocks, put those away, then pick up the glass and place it. It's a little more tedious than it needs to be, and just being able to carry one extra material OR having the extra material directly connect to let's say a cart that would be AMAZING!

21,41515008,english,"Note that I like this game and I think it is going in the right direction but be aware of what this is befroe you buy and be very weary of it in its current state.

What I like:
This gane is a great simulator for Social and Ecological interactions.  As this game progresses the developers are providing tools that are desired and harmful at the same time.  Playing alone or with a close nit group oof friends is easiest and fastest and enjoyable.  Playing with a diverse set of strangers however really show what this game is about as peoples greed and ego start impacting the progression.

Quasi-servival game where staying alive is not the challenge.

Great developer attention.  Good changes have already happend to the game and more are on the horizon.  

You can beat the game in the current state.  


What I don't like:
World Generation does not generate self sustaining ecosystems on the basic world size.   It is VERY likely that a plant or animal will have its habitat reduced to nothing killing off that plant or animal with no human intrervention.  If you don't go gather plants quickly first thing you are likely to end up without something critical when the time comes.  In 5 our of 6 games on the standard size I had to generate at least 1 plant to be able to research something.

The Client can't run for long sessions without restarting it. Various graphical glitches like the tree you cut down disapearing or the map not showing the land are common. 

The tutorial has gotten better but is still hard for new players to complete without a google serarch or asking someone how you find something.  

Game is very complex and lacks a lot of necisarry information in game.  



My main reason for not recomending this game is that it has a huge learning curve and really needs at leasta  small group of dedicated people to play.   This alone is a lot of time and effort, which can be a lot of fun. However when you add on to that the bugs and headaches of the early access changes and you are just as likely to get fed up from an unintended issues as you are from a legidamate design choice.

Will restrictive pollution laws really ruin economy?

Yes the game offers ultra realistic building and earth perserving but if you thrive to preserve the earth bad enough the grind this game then go do it in real life, its probably easier to do there, and it offers actual satisfaction rather than recieving one stone block for about half an hours work. If only the front pictures were in chronilogical in game order as then they would show what the game really offers. Constant grind with no meaningful reward or satisfaction other than destroying a metior which takes 30 real life days to arrive by which you will either be writing a review similar to mine or have suffered a serious illness meaning you are unable to uninstall and proceed to write a bad review.

28,48155048,english,"edit: i will still not reccomend thins game in its current state as i feel there is still things that need to be worked on, however, after having a short discussion with a member of the development team, my oppinion of this game has changed. it is not often that you find developers that genuinley care about the game or take the time to speak to their playerbase. for this reason, i you care about supporting devs that truly care and dont want to scam you then this game should be considered

new reveiw:
This game has many issues, the HUD is very bulky and makes the screen feel cluttered, the game is not self explanitory at all, it takes a very long time to play so it is not reccomendd for casual players and has a lot of bugs. However never before have i seen developers that care about their fan base and their game. Not to mention that developers will take the time to email you and will actually reply to feedback you give to the game. This game is far from finished, however the art style is beautiful, the idea behind the game is unique and the game is the foundation to what seems to me to be a potentially good game. however be warned it is not a survival game and is very hard to get 'in too' pa ce 


old reveiw:
(If you need to test out the uninstall button look no further! if youre expecting a good survival game look the other way this game gives you no other threats than a metior which takes days to arrive and by that time youre already bored to death playing rust again. The main threat in this game doesnt seem to be the metior, its fucking food and wooden carts, oh no, you dont die you just cant do anything if youre hungry, and guess what after about two hours theres no food left. this game has so much content but alll of it is utter sh it e. let me say this one last time DO NOT GET THIS GAME IT IS BORING AND BROKEN.)",1546806203,1547052285,False,7,1,0.458553552627563477,0,True,False,True,76561198306173711,30,12,646,0,612.0,1585405628,1546836655.0,"Hello Steve,
i'm sorry that you didn't like our game.

Eco has a unique approach about the survival parts. It's not about PvP or monsters, but about preserving earth and collaboratively stopping a meteor from destroying it while not destroying it yourself in this process. Getting players to work together, discussing laws, creating and stabilizing an economy is the kind of ""PvP"" our game has. Instead of new armor and weapons you'll get better and more efficient ways to do things - it's a very realistical approach and also used for educational purposes.

30,48174037,english,"I want so badly to like this game. I really do. In fact, this is the first game I have ever truly played - and actually enjoyed - in multiplayer mode. I have a good computer and excellent wifi. Despite this, I can only play this game on the lowest settings with everything nice turned off. I want to play this game in multiplayer but it is impossible for me  to stay connected to the servers.

(And that's coming from someone who normally HATES multiplayer games.)

Realistic (kind of) - you actually chop down trees instead of punching them, you can only shovel out one scoop of dirt at a time, and the calories in/out is pretty clever. I also like the overabundance of tomatoes near my home. In the future, I'd like to see a bigger variety of foods/crops that you can grow/cook. I was planning to go into the farming branch.

Cooperation - I like the ingame economy because it adds to the cooperative spirit of the game. I couldn't stay connected to the server long enough to read about the laws, but it sounds pretty cool to set laws for your settlement. I also enjoyed being able to see that others were opening stores and selling items we may not have been able to access on our own. I couldn't find mushroom spores, so I would have ended up buying them from another player.

Story - I've never quite played anything quite like this game. The storyline is creative. I'm just worried how this game will play out after you're done with the main story line. 

Do I recommend this game? Yes, but only because you can play in single player. If these issues were as prevalent in single player, I would not be able to recommend this game. Still, I have had a lot of fun and hope to be able to continue playing this game in the future. 

Also, the wheelbarrow sucks.

i'm sad to hear you are unhappy with the game.

Eco is especially made for collaboration of several people and is definately played best with some friends. Having even more players can make the game even more interesting, but is absolutely not required to reach and beat the endgame. You can even do it alone in singleplayer, but that's indeed not what the game was made for. Nontheless we offer a lot of settings that allow to modify the skillpoints gain so everyone can play like he wants. Did you try that?

61,47237920,english,"I was really happy to get this game when I bought it few days ago. As a science student at University, I really appreciate what the developers have designed and implemented in this game, especially the interactions between different organisms and players in the whole environment. In my opinion, this is basically an in-depth version of Minecraft with better graphics, higher educational values and a more accurately simulated mother nature.

That said, what really disappointed me so far is the cooperative part of the game. While many other reviews here highlighted the cooperative issue between players in the worlds, here I am concerning on the part of the ADMIN OF THE WORLDS. 

I would say I am an active player and would like to devote my time to a single server, so that I can build the community with others and hope to fight against the meteor together within 30 days. However, in the past 3 days I have spent in this game, I went through 4 worlds which were then closed, restarted or gone offline all in a sudden after exploring and building my base enthusiastically for almost a whole day. In one particular world, for example, I discovered that it was restarted by the admin one day and when I asked him the reason behind, all I got is ""lacking certain animal in the previous landscape"". This example really shows the ridiculous ignorance of the admin to the previous contributions of all the players in the world and he simply restarted the world without any notification. 

I understand it is not within the control of the game developers to monitor the actions of these private world admins. However, with the major aim of this game to promote cooperation between players to solve a simulated envrionmental crisis, I believe it is important to keep the players and also THE WORLD ITSELF active in order to allow the whole community to even reach the final steps of completing the goal of the game. Because having a group of personal friends to play this game together is usually not the case most of the time, private worlds that are opened to strangers become the main way of individual players to enjoy this game. Therefore, implementing measures to regulate their establishments and maintenance is vital to the future development of the game. 

Here are some preliminary suggestions to the developers concerning this issue:
1. Do not allow private worlds to be closed, restarted or go offline before the meteor impacts if they are opened to public and there is still a significant proportion of players remained active in the game
2. If the admins do desire to close or restart a public server before the meteor impacts, requests with solid explanations should be provided and reviewed by the game developers before granting permission
3. The admins should conduct a poll to show that 50% (or any other percentage with majority representation) of the public server population agree with the closure or the re-establishment before proceeding to step 2",1543687192,1543687192,False,33,9,0.500935971736907959,6,True,False,True,76561198044629028,8,1,3530,0,1930.0,1572018103,1543780216.0,"Hello,
i'm sad to hear you had a bad experience with public servers and want to thank you for your detailed review and your suggestions.

We are aware of this issue and while we do not plan to restrict community server admins like you suggested, we do plan to offer offical servers later this year which should fix these issues.
There are also quite some big communities out there that have great concepts - even going beyond the scope of Eco, adding even more depth - for their servers that already do pretty much what you suggested in (3). Probably you want to take a look at those?

Furthermore, the hunger system is very tedious. You'll spend 2 minutes gathering material and your character will refuse to do anything else until you eat.

my honest advice would be more to the creators. Make sure playing it alone is remotely possable to hold interest.
because they based so much on working with others, make a randomly spawning AI that is willing to trade with you at your house. or even make AI  Rent out your work shop or work in your workshop for a time or for a portion of the products.

IF you single play this I wouldn't bother. I did find it fun but that what when I could actually get things done, earn skill points and get bigger better things.

The game is still in development and the focus is on multiplayer more than single player so things have lagged a bit. However we did at the ability to sleep in the 7.8 patch last week and that should significantly help with the parts of the game that have you waiting. 

Independent of that you can also use the chat commands of /giveskillpoints to give yourself however many skill points you want or go into the server configuration and change skill point gain or skill cost.

So when you played a long time you finally get a house and some basic workbenches but then you gotta expand which takes a lot of time. All in all it just takes too long.

45,45346474,english,"Eco- Ett spel om ekologi och ekonomi.

Spelet Eco släpptes för alla den 28:onde februari 2018. Spelet är gjort av ett litet spel företag med endast 12 personer. StrangeLoopGames huvudkontor ligger i seattle.

Eco handlar om att man är på en planet med en hel del andra människor, där måste man leva bo och tjäna pengar. Tillsammans med andra spelare bygger man upp en ekonomi med egen valuta som kan vara backad av nästan vad som helst. Man måste hela tiden hålla koll på ekonomin då man kan orsaka inflation och så vill man ju vara rikast. Men man måste akta sig när man försöker göra sig rik då djur man jagar, växter man plockar upp för mat och träd man hugger ner kommer att kunna ta slut om man inte balanserar det bra, orsakar man att ett djur inte finns inom näringskedjan så kan andra djur dö ut och vissa växter bli fler. Man kan även orsaka utsläpp om man är oansvarig, man måste hantera soppor och bearbetningsavfall på ett bra sätt, samtidigt är en meteor på väg och samhället måste utvecklas snabbt för att kunna skjuta ner den. Man kan även skapa lagar för att samhället ska fungera bra, de lagarna kan inkludera saker som skatt på att bygga eller förbjuda dumpning av sopor på offentliga platser.

Eco är byggt på ett lärande och engagerande sätt vilket är jättebra. Spelet lär dig om hur ekologi fungerar och varför man måste ta hand om planeten, för även i spelet kan vattennivån och temperaturen öka och man får se konsekvenser om hur vi beter oss idag. Den lär en även basiska koncept om ekonomi som skatt, lån, egendom, inflation, tillgång och efterfrågan, monopol samt handel. Jag tycker att allt det här är intressant och välgjort. Det är inte bara informativt men även naturligt socialt då man måste samarbeta med andra för att bygga ett fungerande samhälle med val, skatter, infrastruktur och lag system.

Jag tycker att fler borde spela ECO, det kostar bara 27€(60€ brukar vara standard för spel). Inte bara det men det är engagerande och man kan spela det i flera 100 timmar utan att bli uttråkad. Ända problemen med spelet är att det fortfarande har en hel del buggar och behöver mer innehåll, det uppdateras lagom ofta. Det lär unga och barn en basisk ide om hur vi måste ta hand om vår jord vilket är bra.

I see a lot of new and interesting ideas.  Unique game-play and all wrapped up in a pretty vibrant world.  Glitches were very few and far between. The building mechanics were rock solid and uniquely done. 

Our first run we ran out of wood on our planet (No, seriously) and found ourselves playing other titles waiting on the  wood to grow back (real days). We quickly realized this was going to be an issue on a game breaking level. 

Our second run we adopted new growth mechanics, .5 on all trees and .2 on all food, and doubled skill points. This was much more playable in a standard time frame. However this also allowed us to see just how limited the content was after the time gates are lifted. Let me say.. VERY limited content.  Even then, it was fun to play.

I have no idea how well this game will play with a group of strangers. Even as friends it was cut throat. It was not unheard of for one of us to rob some corn or ""borrow"" some wood lol. Play with strangers at your own risk.

Only real negative we experienced was disconnects. They were frequent and shared by all three of us. At times it was 3 minutes and other times 3 hours. No rhyme or reason to it. One of ours went Afk for a bit and was doing absolutely nothing and still got a disconnect.... no idea. Can definitely be frustrating. 

Typically with disconnects and limited content I would just thumbs down and move on. However, we genuinely had fun. The content that is in game was unique and well done. I would definitely recommend the purchase with the understanding that it's EA. 

I am definitely looking forward to see where Development takes this.",1539718234,1539718234,True,21,0,0.718004107475280762,2,True,False,True,76561197972271775,261,55,3985,0,3960,1558142688,1539801776.0,"Thank you for the kind words, I'm glad you had a good time. A lot of the content doesn't really appear unless you are playing with low skill point gain and a lot of players.

As far as your bugs did you report them? We are always actively trying to squash them and need all the help on the reporting side we can get."
50,45223966,english,"I want to love this game. I really do, but there is so much wrong here that I just can't. I've spent a lot of time on it and I've enjoyed that time, but I would never recommend this game to anyone.

Almost everything you do in this game is a chore. This isn't always a bad thing but without mods to increase the range on stockpile connections and methods of dealing with tailings you'll spend nearly 80% of your time just moving things or carving out space to store things that take up so much room that you give up on doing it right and just put them in carts in a hole. Of course from what I understand putting tailings in carts makes the game think they're on the surface so at that point you might as well just have a 1 block deep cart pit. It's kind of dumb.

Building in this game should be fun and in a way it is, but we get back to the transporting resources problem. An acceptable house takes around 350 blocks. Most building resources stack in lots of 20. That means you need to make 18 trips to pick up blocks to build with. You can make that easier with a cart, but you're still picking things up a minimum of 18 times. In the late stages of the game using 1000+ blocks isn't uncommon and it's ridiculous the amount of effort that goes in to just moving things around to make those blocks and then moving those blocks into a position to be usable. That's not game breaking though. Some might even find that fun.

There are no threats in this game. Calling it an open world survival game is a blatant lie. It's an open world game with no elements of survival. You can not die.  Believe me, I've tried. Again, this isn't game breaking and some prefer it that way. Some don't and I must admit I'd like to have some consequence to my stupid decisions. Just no fall damage. Fall damage is dumb no matter what game you're playing. 

I like the research part. I like tiered buildings and all the machines needed to make things. I don't like how I am basically forced to have a straight concrete house at the end of the game rather than something pretty with bricks and wood. That's a very bad design choice and I hold a grudge about it.",1539296162,1539296493,False,5,2,0.453740090131759644,5,True,False,True,76561198070737440,259,18,4628,0,4628,1539309928,1539635929.0,"First of all thank you for taking the time to articulate your thoughts so nicely.

Tailings aren’t in a great place there are going to be part of recipes and systems that haven’t been implemented into the game yet. There is a patch going out that should cut the amount produced a bit but it’s a bandaid on the problem for now.

As to everything else being a chore that is intentional. Part of it is as much as possible we don’t want to “cheat” space, that is to say we something that takes up a block of space to always take up one block of space. Right now we have drawn the line at allowing things like carts to cheat but we don’t want to go any further. Part of it is for progression. Instead of getting better arms and armor progression give progressing in Eco gives access to things like trucks and excavators which making dealing with large quantities of blocks easier. This also forces people to balance between the potential environmental impact and the increased productivity.

I am in agreement with you on the tags. Those are user defined tags and we have no control over them. I’d change them if I could but I can’t.

I agree with you about the aesthetics of tiered buildings. Short term we aren’t going to do much other than maybe relax the requirements of the rooms to give a little more wiggle room. Long term we know we are going to do a lot to give options to beautify structuctures.

As you have noticed this can really slow down plant growth, skill point gain, and crafting.

Right now the only solution is to leave the server running day and night. If you can’t handle it yourself I would recommend either renting a dedicated server or joining someone else's dedicated server. If you don’t want to do that we are going to want to hold tight, just a little bit. We are currently working on implementing sleep. Sleep will allow you to fast forward the game skipping over any waiting.

It is being updated constantly, making it a pretty decent deal. Make sure you keep joining your world in case the meteor destroys it before you even get to the stone age, because that can happen.
The game has servers, but it would probably be hard for you to make any friends, because the community is so small, for now.
If you cut down your neighbors' forests then they might get mad and report you to the mayor, so watch out for that.
When I got the game it was quite bad, but now we have shelters that you place down after a minute of playtime instead of two hours. Also, yards have been added specifically for keeping your stuff. (Like the trees from your OWN forest and not your neighbors'.)
I think you should get this game if you don’t mind spending a lot of time (a month) on it.
Also, for now, you can’t complete the game in single player, so invite someone over to help you with transporting your stone blocks in wheelbarrows. Or just play the servers instead of using single player.

Another issue is with the current world generation. For some odd reason, the world generates with a lot of overhangs on hills. And I mean a LOT.

I enjoy this game a lot but the game at the current state is rather unplayable.

1. A LOT OF LAG, esp if you play in a mutiplayer server, and your community starts to build more stuff, the server just cannot handle it. For instance I had spend 15 mins trying to harvest my corns and only get a few. Because of the lag.

2. Disconnection. This is another bane of fun. Aside from the lag you can get randomly disconnected A LOT. There is this time I am trying to buy something from a store, I spent 15 mins trying to open the store, get kicked by server, loading the world and repeat. 

To conclude, as much as I like the game (I also think it has a lot of potentials), it is VERY difficult to play this game 'efficiently' because you waste a lot of time lagging and getting disconnected>trying to log in again.

They promise a lot of roleplay with a government, laws, marketplace, currencies, work contracts, and all those things are in the game and it's really a good job !

But I feel like the main thing was forgotten : FUN.

When you're playing to a video game, it's to take a break, to have fun with your friends or alone.
And what makes a game fun, is that you can play it thousands of times without never getting bored, without doing the same jokes every time.

CSGO is very fun for example, you can play it seriously by playing for competition or you just don't care and you troll the ennemies.

In the same category as Eco there is Rust which can be fun too : a deer that climbs vertically, you never find your friend after 2 hours but you're 2 minutes away from him, knocking to forteresses's doors with a grandma voice, asking for help because you lost your puppy aha ...

Every time there are games which presents itself being serious, but you can do tons of different things with it no matter what your goal is, and this is why it's awesome.

But I never had this feeling with Eco.
You can play it seriously and spending hours and hours building your house, but Eco never try to surprise/amuse you.

- there are buffalos, but they are running away from you (will never happen in real life)
- There isn't a single animal that can be dangerous for you
- no natural disaster except the meteorite
- nothing in Eco was made to have fun

The government the laws the work contracts all those things it's great, but WHERE IS THE FUN ?
I feel like the developers were sooo focused on creating an innovative game that they forgot it's nearly impossible to play Eco in another way than being the perfect citizen.

When you are on a server EVERYONE IS SERIOUS, it does not reflect the reality. 99% of the time players are talking about working more and more, buying/selling more ressources, THAT'S ALL.

You will never see someone suggesting darts contest or cars race, N E V E R. Way too fun.

94,43959332,english,"Eco has such great potential to be something truly amazing, but at the moment falls short in some of the most important areas of a game. And while Eco has a good game foundation, I can't recommend paying to play it in its current state.

Like any game on Facebook, the player is Primarly waiting on timers so that one may progress through the game. That is, the player needs to save skill points to purchase deeper technologies to advance to the point of winning. The only way to gain skill points is to wait for them, one may increase this rate by maintaining their nutrition and upgrading their house, which require an additional investment of waiting for the crafting tables to produce materials.

The play-pattern is otherwise very tedious; Constantly having to repair the hand tools for the several small tasks available and consistently running out of nutrition when doing any amount of work. There are ways to reduce these penalties, but it requires the player wait for more skill points.

There is no task that encourages significant play investment, and in many cases, will simply overwhelm the ecosystem and create an irreversibly losing game. This encourages the player to do as little work as necessary to progress their game-state. Further making Eco a waiting game.

Playing on a public server, or with many others who are all doing their own thing, infinitely compounds the issue. For each additional player on the server, half of the work is required to progress, doubling the amount of time a player need not play the game.

While many of the other aspects of the game seem fun, they only make the game... less of a game. As technology advances, the player unlocks better tools that can do all the work faster. With the player not needing to spend so much time working, they are again stuck waiting.

The creative aspects of the game are somewhat shallow. One can manipulate the world a bit and/or build a house, but a lot of the materials are locked behind timers, and only once significant progress has been made, can the player access other creative materials; Which can only be used in making a shop or house. Eco doesn't fill the creative experience as well as other voxel-based survival games.

Government gives players a way to supress player actions, where too much play is happening and causing ecosystem problems, a law can help alleviate some pressure by forcing players to wait instead of play. It's otherwise arbitrary to the main game loop, but a neat aspect.

TLDR: Eco is just a waiting game where most of the mechanics encourage more waiting. Playing too much can destroy the ecosystem and cause a game loss.

Things i liked about the game:
-Sphere planet. something you dont see too often in games.
-Simple but nice art style

-attempts to bring awarness on nutrition. 
-start with primitive technology and advance to modern age tech.
-excuvators, and farm equipment. never used it but not something iv seen in other open world games.


Things i disliked:
-a few small bugs. (my HUD wouldnt pop up after i skipped the tutorial. you need to go through it or you dont get your HUD) 
-when you use a tool and the animation starts, where ever you are looking when the animation ends is where you hit. (for ex: you are looking at ""block 1"" with a shovel. you left click to pick up ""block 1"" but before the animation finishes you look at ""block 2."" you will end up picking up ""block 2"")

-The world map renders the whole map which may end up dropping 10FPS. not too much of an issue as you can close it but can be annoying
-The world map's filter options is a long list with no search bar. (endless scrolling if you want to find out where a biome is)

-the skill menu is rather messy and confusing. then you got some skills that are a waste of points (for ex: one crafting recipe uses two logs. there is a skill to reduce how many logs it takes but it only goes to 80%. meaning the recipe still uses 2 logs)
-researching new skills is left unexplained by the tutorial and is unnecessarily complicated. (you craft a ""skill book,"" which you somehow then turn it into a skill scroll. skill scrolls are consumed on use from what iv heard, while the skill book remains)
-the crafting menu is messy and confusing. early game and later game tech is mixed together with no categories/filters. makes it difficult to understand what you even need to get next.
-The crafting menu isnt even in alphabetical order.

Fun to build stuff, load the car with materials and go for a roadtrip if you like..
Many options and alot of things to create.

cons:
Too overcomplicated to be enjoyable. I mean, every time i'm going to build something it ends up like building 5 new tables, research skills and so on and it makes me forget what I was going to build at the first time.

The excavator makes a big mess, on our server we had stones laying around everywhere after our digging session. Stones everywhere! even stuck in the sky we could see shattered stoneblocks.

The eating system - Make it more simple so we don't have to cook for like 2 hours to even be able to play and do other stuff. Maybe some people like this skill, but please make it optional so we don't need to have like 10 meals in the inventory to make the character happy.

All in all, pretty fun game. But I think the developer(s) overcomplicated a lot off stuff. Just focus on the main things like glitches and reconsider making the game more simple.",1532698024,1532698024,False,22,3,0.596804618835449219,0,True,False,True,76561198237333570,18,1,5167,0,4550.0,1589740506,,

Cons - PC requirements

=== AFTER NETWORK UPDATE ===

Playable in all servers! I haven't tried to run the server in a local setting or in friend invites, but it seems like the devs have fixed most of the network problems. No disconnection for 2 hours of gameplay.

Friends recommended.


=== BEFORE NETWORK UPDATE ===

First run with GF --
Server setup: 2 hours. (might be because of network or security issues, in the end, we just connected via LAN cable)
Gameplay with GF: 20 minutes. (GF seemed lost and quite simply, does not know what to do, she got confused on the variety of tables and panels.. she just chopped every tree and killed all animals.. wemen)

Second run alone + public servers --
-Fun learning curve (complicated game)
-Grindy but with a hell lot of different things to do
-Better with a partner or a group
-Awesome frontend and integration on browser (kudos to the devs)
-You can run while shooting arrows from bows with 100% crosshair accuracy

3rd run with GF and VPN hamachi --
- finally connected with GF!
- config files are awesome (everything moddable, or is that even a word)
- hassle connection, cuz it's relayed by hamachi, website sometimes wont load (YES, there is a website integrated to the world, you can see the information of your world thru browsers: population of species, population of trees, etc etc.)",1524838732,1532681552,True,0,0,0.552488386631011963,2,True,False,True,76561198047302277,103,41,7803,0,1405.0,1534758331,1524852422.0,"We have rewritten our networking system to use UDP instead of TCP and it works much better.

The Devs are amazing, constantly fixing bugs with constant updates and doing their best to keep up with anything. My only main problem for now is the balance of jobs. Currently the chefs can almost completely control the world, which is not good. For example, on my very first server we started small, so there was only one chef that cooked for the entire server. as more peope joined and we got bigger, they on chef was the only one with a good enough level to feed us all effiecently. we had others try to become chefs, and we got about 2 others to become real ones, but the first chef still controlled all the food output.

And then one day, he didnt log in.

Very suddenly with no warning he disapeared, and suddenly no one had any food.

(Happening almost right after that, everyone was talking about creating a ""player currency"", so a blacksmith tried to make one. everyone immediatly bought into it and tried switching to it, when we realized he had complete controll over all of it. One of the Admin's tried to fix the issue by stealing all of his coins and putting them in the ""bank"". Then chaos ensued and the server died very suddenly.)

Thats my only real problem, so thanks for the amazing game, and please keep up the good work!

Edit 7/22/2018: This is an amazing game that has undergone some intense rework and bug fixing. The game, at the start of its ""Early Acess"", had a very nice road-map laid out for everyone to see and examine and keep up with the developers as they progressed throughout the development process, which was very nice and transparent. They kept to the map and soon enough they will have a truly revolutionary Economic/Ecosystem Simulator with aspects of RPG and Crisis aversion to help guide players towards a goal. 

I would recommend this to everyone that enjoys a little RP and a little city building. If you enjoy running economies and such you can also mint your own currency and back it with different incentives for different jobs to help bolster your progress towards protecting the world against the meteor!

11,43604308,english,"Edit:  I have changed my rating of this game from negative to positive.  My gamer desktop was getting fixed when I tried this the first time and my experience has been infinitely better on that machine than my new laptop.  (I'll be reviewing how my laptop's setup). 

On my 6 year old gamer desktop, I get 60fps easy, have had only two disconnects which I think were not Eco related and have played without issue for a couple days now.  I still think the building s a bit cumbersome compared to other games of this genre, but once you get a crane, you can lay down in lines and planes (not until then - and Crane is pretty deep in the tech tree).

I also firmly believe in supporting indie developers in platforms like Unity and Unreal - too much work went into this to give a negative post - especially while in early access.  Although I think early access is overused.

One thing to note:  While there are no mods on the workshop, the entire game's code base is essentially exposed and moddable.  You can setup your own servers and modify nearly every aspect of the server world.  So it's far more 'moddable' than most moddable games.

I also love the fact you can host your own server right from the get go.  They've put alot of work into something this flexible and extensible.  

Good luck to this team - great job producing something so fun and unique.

Old Negative Post:

I really love the concept of this game and would love to be able to play it.  I spent far more time disconnecting and reconnecting than playing.  After about the 20th disconnect I gave up.  Very, very frustrating.  In my opinion, this game shouldn't be released yet - it needs far more stabilization and testing work.  I hate giving a thumbs down, but it's just not playable for me.

In addition, the mechanics of play are a bit tiresome.  Way too much micro-management when it comes to harvesting and especially building.  I do not see this as a replayable game.  Way too much work for the fun factor.  To harvest wood, you have to have your cursor exactly in the right facing plane to start chopping.  Then you chop several times.  Then you the chop the trunk into pieces, then you carry the logs (20 at a time) back to your base.  You put the logs in an infinitely small storage space and build stuff from there.  All the while, you're switching in and out of mouse mode and trying to maintain exact position of the mouse to do this.  This is incredibly frustrating and building is even worse.  The snapping and ease of use needs an incredible amount of work.

I have a brand new ASUS laptop with 16G Ram (striped) and an I7 with 500GB striped solid state drives.  Graphics card is medium to high range.  I have Windows 10 Pro.  I would expect to be able to play with this setup but I can't.",1531918419,1532114602,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True,76561197993459541,114,26,39921,0,2878.0,1599750359,1532032842.0,"Hey,

32,43116685,english,"A pretty and interesting game. Which is unfortunate.

Pros:
The Skill point system is an interesting mechanic.
Environment is pretty.
Crafting is interesting. 
End game gives it a point. 

Cons:
You rely heavily on others to be able to accomplish anything which can get very frustrating especially since unless you play 
        with an organised group of people you have to rely on the common decency of people on the internet.
The law and voting system while theorectically functional also relies on the availability of others and the quality of the 
        internet people involved.
The Calorie system to gain skill points over time, while interesting, is just a pain in the ass and considering its the core 
        gameplay mechanic it hands way too much power over to cooks. 
The economy: Again. Depends on people not gouging others. If I wanted to play 'Capitalism: The Game' I'd just get a job in 
        insurance and actually make real money. 
The housing system: You get more skill points by 'having a nice house'. I've yet to find a detailed and accurate guide (it 
       might exist I dont know) but jesus is it fiddly. You have to balance room values when you have more than one room 
       and calculate diminishing returns and... its just a mess. It stops being fun and just drops into calculus where you don't 
       actually have all the values. Again as it works on the core gameplay mechanic it forces you into the mess.


It has potential but honestly because it relies so heavily on common decency on the internet is going to be a flop and die quickly. Which is a shame, it could have been a new minecraft.

Edit: fucking hell.
Playing as a smith. Smithing probalby becomes valuable later on but because it's a niche skill and metal being very useful but only needed in small amounts it's very hard to make an economy as a smith.
Cooks have all the power as everything has calorie costs. 
The food system is even more of a pain. 
Chef gods suck.

 Still playing on a friends only server. Basically just waiting 2.5 days to get enough skill points so my smithing becomes efficient enough to not take half a mountain to make a steel pick. Just popping in to eat a couple meals and making sure my braziers' have enough fuel.

My main complaint actually is the way profs. and time spent. Every person on the server now basically just comes on once a day, buys a couple skills and logs off. 

2 big problems with this:

1. It adds an waiting game to an already GRINDY game. Madness. 
2. It sabotages the whole social aspect of the game by doing so.",1530152316,1530860641,False,90,9,0.843726158142089844,8,True,False,True,76561197967976115,743,90,21610,0,8108.0,1566028731,,
33,43327719,english,"Eco scratches an itch for me that no sandbox craft builder has before because it introduces a 100% player-driven economy revolving around skill points. Unlike Minecraft and the like, in Eco you're motivated to build and craft because that's what's giving you skill points to advance up the RPG skill tree, and ultimately save the planet from impending doom--an asteroid.

The laws system is another brilliant addition that furthers the emergent gameplay of Eco, where players can create clause-based laws (almost programming style) and then everyone on a server votes for them. For example, maybe you want to establish a subsidized road system, so you create a law with a clause that says ""Every 1 day, tax players 10 credits"" and another that says ""When player places Stone Road, allocate 5 credits"". So, at first it's working great, and players are building out a nice road network. You've even created a new type of job: Road Builder. But then the cracks start to appear and you realize that players have learned they can place a road block for 5 credits, pick it back up for free, and then place it again for another 5 credits. They found a loophole! So then you're rushing to repeal the law or control the production of road blocks through politics, bribery, other laws, you name it. The emergent gameplay is where this game shines.

If that sounds like something up your alley, then Eco is fantastic and unique. I'd say it's for someone who enjoys Minecraft, Sim City, Factorio, and a mix of economy/business simulators and crafting games.

Visually, the game is very polished, and there's plenty of content for a rich experience. The devs are frequently adding to the game, but it definitely lives up to it's ""alpha"" gamestate given the number of crashes I experience. That all being said, it's well worth the $30, and feels like a mostly-complete game unlike most early access titles.

35,43282549,english,"The core gameplay has similarities to traditional voxel building/survival games like Minecraft, but the emphasis is on large scale interactions between many players and the environment - e.g emergent economy (by player operated stores with various currencies), ecological changes, technological advances, player run governments with tax and law systems, etc... 

However, it is hard to start out in this game, especially if you're a new player trying to get integrated into an established server. I had the luck of joining a new server beginning at day 1 and advancing from there, but for newer players it can be somewhat overwhelming, especially due to challenges posed by the game's mechanics (e.g depleted resources).

This game is definitely not meant to be played as SP - if that's your aim, just go play Minecraft or something. This game truly shines when playing with multiple players over larger periods of time.

42,43196884,english,"ECO is a refreshing take on the coop / survival / sandbox game that, even in early access, is already very deep and completely unique in its approach.

The cooperation, environment preservation, and economic management all blend together in a relatively well balanced mix that will suck the time out of your schedule :D.

It's not a game that you will enjoy if you play solo, and it's not a game that you will enjoy if you want to curbstomp the other players on your server. But the magic of ECO resides in precisely the opposite, as it is one of the very few games that will make you feel like the whole community that is your server, is banding together toward the same goal.

Oddly enough, it's also the best game to play if you want to learn about the very basics of the economy, with basic (yet very complex) questions like ""what gives value to my money?"". There's also some lessons to be learned about the environment, regulations, and the management of a small community.

So go support the devs and buy this game now!

-----------------------------------------------------------------

That's the bulk of the review. If you're still there, here are some thoughts about the game's ""grind"":

All games that have an economic aspect, must inherently also have some form of resource acquisition constraints (i.e ""The Grind""!) because otherwise if resources weren't scarce and/or hard to acquire, there would be no economy to begin with! This explains why the game can feel a bit grindy if you don't plan enough on which settings and with which people you want to play, as using more ""casual"" server settings can only work if you all roughly have the same (limited) amount of playtime.

Most people don't take the time and just jump straight into a server with very different player profiles, and then feel left behind as some of the community progresses faster than them, and acquires new technologies allowing them to grow exponentially... And THAT is the real issue.

Just like some other games with passive skillpoint acquisition, it's also paradoxically very anti-grind, as there's (barring some non-default server settings) a hard limit on how much skillpoints you will gain each day, regardless of your playtime.",1530390138,1530390214,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True,76561198010909133,609,70,14337,157,6499.0,1601806726,,

Not only does it literally organize and track every single entity in game, including those of the map and players, but it does it in real time while also providing DEFAULT FUNCTIONALITY FOR AUTO BACKUPS.

I consider this game comparable too Kerbal Space Programm and Stationeers, where its more educative and coorperative instead of compettative gameplay, players who have mostly selfish goals in mind prolly will burn out fast in this game.
There is no instant grativication, certain actions can take a while to show effect, and the server community has to work as whole, with no much room for lone wolfs. Although the game is pretty well playable Solo, its stenghts and fun is in a small community that is working towards a shared goal.

This goal can be archieved ofcourse in several ways, do you go for a cutt-throat kapitalistic model, or a more communistic shared approach, Will you go green, or full out pollution destroying the world anyways.
Do you work together, or will you try to outsmart otherplayers by cornering the market, undercut the economy.

82,42385436,english,"Eco is a Great game with some inherent flaws. 
It is a game about cooperation and working together to balance a world, stop a disaster and hopefully have fun. Soloing is harder but not impossible in some instances if the economy on the server is looked after and the people planning it are intelligent. If you like boundless, creativerse, minecraft etc you might like this, if you like the cooperative aspects of those titles.

A small map server or community is fun and I would highly recommend this game for a weekend lan party, with sped up skillpoint gain or a tight clan that play together.

A large map server or community suffers from some serious gameplay problems however, some people have talked about them in other reviews and I will try to cover all I have observed.

In a large world. Get there early, in the center of the city on day 1 and you'll always be far more priveledged than those that come later. I often find myself browsing the server lists looking for a new larger server starting for this very reason. For servers with crafting XP on, players who play more can maybe catchup, without crafting XP you're even more stuck. However crafting XP makes everyone a jack of all trades eventually and hurts the economy a bit more, it also vastly benefits those that play a lot of hours.

A certain amount of all this is logical if you think about the progression in other games. Here though, it's taken to the extreme. Players mint the currency, whoever does this and their friends are rich. On a large map location is everything, and whoever is closest to the center is in extremely advantageous position. Laws passed benefit cleaner technologies later on, whereas new players are still struggling and paying large bills from the laws to catch up. New players don't have the skill points to keep up with the demands of a end game economy, so they get stuck. Money gets in the hands of a few players, and new players struggle to get any.

All of this is reduced the smaller the player numbers and the smaller the map size, to be a non issue if you get to maybe 5 friends playing together, or a clan maybe, then it'd be a really fun game. However the larger the map or playerbase on the server the larger this issue presents itself. As for solo play it is hard work, takes a long time, as eco takes a long time, it is a game about cooperation. That said for the die hard soloists they can enjoy themselves certainly, just expect a long game.

Now obviously the elephant in the room is that the admin can do anything he wants, it is his server, so finding a level headed fair admin who isn't too trigger happy is key. Finding one who will keep the peace, and the game world running, without cheating too much and not ticking the community off in the process. It is not a position for everyone certainly and some servers are going to be a nightmare because of this, while some a fun place to play.

In a game where the players can set laws on everything, the same applies. If you've got in an intelligent community who generally aren't jerks to each other, you'll probably have fun, if not the experience will suck.

As for the graphics sound etc, its all okay. Nothing really jumps out at me, for a voxel game its pretty good.

Other gameplay notes. Pollution has the effect described, ground pollution needs more sources than it currently has imho, it is a very temporary effect. Air pollution works okay, water pollution doesn't seem to do a whole lot oddly, so dump your waste and polluting industries out to sea. Make an artificial island there and job done. Just balance the CO2 with trees. Skillpoints are critical so do some heavy research on what is needed by your server, what is bought and sold for example. Then check if crafting XP is on, if it is on taking a couple of skills to massproduce materials will net you a lot of XP.

There are some serious falling through the world issues still and lag around hills at times, disconnects etc, all the marks of an alpha and quite buggy at times.

Other Suggestions: Large maps could badly do with boats, this might reduce the impact of distance for new players at least, joining an established larger server.  Laws need some condition on inactivity for example, to remove coin and plots from inactive players when the law is passed.

On balance I am -just- at not recommended, and a reviewer wishing for a neutral thumb as always in these situations.",1527693779,1527699652,False,61,7,0.828888475894927979,0,True,False,True,76561197992092055,304,9,6685,0,3995.0,1597745219,1527707146.0,"Thanks for the thoughtful feedback.

Pros:
-Progression feels interesting.
-It's important to keep the future in mind throughout the game.

-The game is very grindy. It's nice if you just want to grind away, but sometimes it can be just plain annoying.
-Farming is very complicated. I'm still not sure how to handle it.

92,42273806,english,"Having read some of the recent negative reviews, I felt compelled to leave a positive one.

Eco is built with a specific playstyle in mind, that of the 'Micro-Multiplayer Onling Game', as opposed to Massively Multiplayer. The server is meant to be persistant, with long tasks running while you are offline. In addition, plant growth takes more than 24 realtime hours for the fastest crops, sometimes 48. Trees can take 3 to 5 days. You're not going to get that sort of duration playing on a local server that's only up when you're playing.

So, play on a server! Find one that's only a day or two in and pick a niche. And do pick a niche. Cooperation and specialization are encouraged via the skill system, with the cost to open a skill tree increasing as you open more skill trees, with the specific rate of increase according to the server setting, which will limit how many skillsets most people would acquire. Unless you're like me and spend a lot of time doing tasks like mining, which earn you skill points.

There's no combat or death in Eco as it's meant to be cooperative, but actions do cost 'calories' to perform, which you get by eating stuff. All foods have some rating in Carbs, Fats, Proteins, and Vitamens, and there's a formula for how many skillpoints you get from just food based upon the total value of your diet and how well balanced it is.

Food and farming is an interesting chain and I'm only just starting to learn how to properly farm. Hunting is with bow and arrow, and unless you don't mind using a lot of arrows I suggest learning the Hunting skill tree to increase your damage - It takes like 6 shots at base to down a bison.

Farming itself is fairly complex as you can't just farm things anywhere - all plants have a temperature and moister range they like, so you  have to find the right place to plant. Plants themselves can disappear or die out entirely if not careful - if you harvest all the trees in an area, they're not going back. In addition, high polution can reduce the suitability and thus your yields.

Oh yeah, pollution. Lots of activities once you get to metalworking cause pollution. Early metal refining creates toxic tailings which you need to dispose of properly or they pollute everywhere. Even advanced technology creates pollution as it's used, although with enough wind turbines and solar arrays you can have electrical power without pouring smoke into the skies.

There's a player government and player economy - and as it has to do with people, it's hit or miss. Laws aren't well documented, and the servers I've been on have had very minimal player activitiy thus far, but I have an idea of what to expect.

Is Eco worth the price?
Honestly, yes. There's still a few bugs and a lot of potential content, but Strange Loop Games seems to have a good workflow and idea of what they're doing. New mechanics are being added, and their coding staff is on the ball. I reported a very weird edge case that caused a crash due to attempting to repair a spawned item that had no cost, and the bug was addressed with a dev saying they fixed it - within 48 hours.

As of this review I've got 146.8 hours on record. That's under 21 cents per hour, and I'm still addicted to it.

If you like open world multiplayer crafting games, I recommend Eco. 

Just don't jump onto a developed server and expect things to be newb friendly. My current server is 8 days old and we've already chewed through most of the easily found veins of ore, and one player (cough cough, me) has a monopoly on rice.

What a waste of $30. MIGHT AS WELL AFK ON IT SO I HAVE A PRETTY SCREEN SAVER. THANKS STEAM.


Edit:

Tried it again since I'm stuck with it, still hate it. Learned a couple of things, though:

- Map (M) has a feature on the right that -somewhat- helps you locate whatever you're looking for. It looks like a heat map, so it's a general location spotter ... not exactly accurate.
- Farming / replanting trees (you get tree saplings from swinging an axe at the tree leaves before chopping the tree down) seems like a waste of energy since the growth time is excessively long.
- Tried fishing. Catches don't happen quickly, so you're literally sitting around waiting on fish to bite. I felt like I was fishing irl, just without any bugs flying around me and no sunburn. Irl fishing is at least more fruitful in rewards. 
- My sound fx for my foot steps randomly stopped playing? Did I ever hear them in the first place? Am I hallucinating intended sound fx?
- Placing crafting tables (any kind) is irritating as fuck because of the stupid room size requirement. I had to constantly expand the building/hut I started with just to make the table work. The alternative would be to swap them out, but if you had multiple projects you wanted to complete at the same time (to be time effecient), you wouldn't want to store any of your tables.

TL;DR Edit
Stuck with the game still; still very frustrated that I have it; reluctantly trying to learn it since I own it now; frustration for it grows.

Multiplayer Edit
Kept seeing reviews about multiplayer being the big factor, so I went to join a server to try and enjoy this game.

- Connection sometimes doesn't attempt to load up; gets stuck on a spinning cog with no text to signal that it's loading.
- Tried a few different servers, but each were nearly cleaned out for beginners. i.e. no foraged items available, no trees, etc. (these could be fixed if the company revamped the damn growth times) One server's participants even joked about ""I blame the 40 people who came before you wiped out the trees before leaving."" That shouldn't be able to impact the server to that degree, or at least you should be able to regrow trees at a substantial rate.
- Maps aren't typically very big, so if there have been a lot of server visitors, a lot of the land has been claimed already and trying to find some land for yourself is very difficult.
- Better hope you can figure out a way to get food on these cleared out maps before your calories empty out, which is extremely fast in the beginning.

this game is far from done, so much nonesence in this game that made me issue a refund.

1: transport simulator.
this game just begs you to transport resourses 90% of the time
this makes the game feel tedious and not worth it.
oh there are carts, but the speed of these are so reduced that walking/running with a single load is faster....

2:Cant carry more than 20 of wood or stone.
This results you to waste 90% of the time to walk back and forth across the planet, IF the planet even botherd to spawn trees at all, in wich my planet didnt...

3:Characters food drops like a stone, the character seems like he has the worst case of eating disorder you ever seen

4: World generator issue.
3 times in a row I gotten horrible worlds, all from barly any trees (tops 20 trees) to absolutly no wildlife at all
and sometimes I get stuck on loading the world, after 15mins of loading I had to kill the eco prosess to try reload the game

5: character creation.
this is jsut a insult to look at, there are hardly any customization in the game to make the player look apart from others.
same face same cloths with SLIGHT variation.....

6: buildings needed
I understand living in a house for real is a good thing, but when you need a 50 meter high skyscraper to put the oil refinary INSIDE the building, wich is not done in real life... thats jsut bulls**t, but thats not the only issue, the tiers makes no sence at all

7: no center of the planet.
this is a disapointmet, it should be able to harness the power of the molten magma, but nope....

8: NEED MORE RESOURSES!
everything needs resourses in this game, and its not like minecraft that it requires 2-4 logs to make one ting, nope.... need 3-8 trees if not more, kinda reminds me of factorio

9: no saveslots
kinda reminds me of the big flop of a game, no man sky with no saveslots.

So why the thumbs down? Because it’s extremely boring and frustrating to actually play. The game has a difficult and fundamental contradiction: it can only succeed if a server finds a community of thinking, analytical players who are nonetheless content to spend >80% of their in-game time in mindless activities. You move through danger-free environments to resource blocks, hold the mouse button to harvest them, and pick them up individually to carry back to a storage or collection area. Then just repeat…forever, as far as I could tell. Moving up the tech tree to new kinds of resources doesn’t alter this basic pattern.

Exploring the economy of a new world and planning how you can contribute is fascinating. You can tour potential neighbors’ settlements, skill trees, store items and locations, and consider the local terrain and biomes. You evaluate crop yield areas using the world map and cool analytical tools. You plan your skill point investment accordingly. This part of Eco is pure gold. But once you actually start playing the game it’s impossibly boring work. It feels like “Shoveling Simulator 2019”. Why not just shovel in real life? It’s more rewarding and just as entertaining.

I hate writing this because I really do love Eco’s concept and it’s a beautiful world. But the contradiction between intent and gameplay experience is just too stark to ignore. 

The game developers, whom I salute for their bold vision, seem focused on adding to the tech tree depth. But the game’s problem is not tech tree depth…it’s the core gameplay experience, what you actually spend your time doing while playing the game. It breaks my heart because Eco should be fantastic.

I love strategy games like Rimworld (550 hrs!), Factorio (294 hrs), Crusader Kings 2 (403 hrs), Europa Universalis (223 hrs), and XCOM: Enemy Unknown (150 hrs). Eco belongs on that list, yet I’m giving up after 20 hours.

We're actually focusing on the specific issue now, with the addition of vehicles.  The idea of vehicles is that as you tech-up and gain them, your labor is amplified, and the time you amount of building/farming/collecting you can do increases exponentially.  Eventually it's so large you can impact the environment in a huge way, and if your civics aren't ahead the whole thing can collapse.

This is why we're focusing on vehicles now, and expect with version 8 coming in a future release the issue you indicate should be reduced. Thanks for the feedback and it is something we're continuing to tune through Early Access.

It's essentially a social experiment.  Everyone needs to contribute in some way, and greed will make things harder but politics quickly come into play.  Worth trying if you love Guild 2,  Wurm ONline, Minecraft, Rising World, etc...

You could do the same thing, but at a less efficient rate (1/2 the rate he does) and so it doesn't make sense for you to waste your time doing it when he does it so much better, but he needs you for furniture which you do at an excellent level and so you both work together - he gets some of the profits from you, because you need his lumber and you make money off the goods you make from his lumber.  This game is an economy similator!  

Yes the food in the world gets taken, but that's because people are greedy and will not leave some to repopulate the area...  That's why making friends is important so you can make friends with a farmer who will provide you foods in exchange for furniture or what have you.  Communicate, set up shop, and come out ahead!

Original review:
Hey devs!

Love your game, but as you may already be aware from other reviews, there is something weird about the network connection to the servers or something about the game/steam. Both me, friends and family have issues staying on the servers. It works fine first time you connect, but next time it seems something goes wrong. 

After fiddling with my own server(hosted by 3rd party paid service), own router, computer, opening all ports and failing, it somehow now works better for me. I am still not sure what actually solved it, though I felt it may have been the Firewall or Anti-virus.

But my friends and family are still experiencing issues. It is hard to understand what is causing this. They get kicked off servers for being inactive(though while active or about to logon) and often no error appear when disconnecting at random. I find threads and reviews from other players having difficulty too, but no workaround or solution to the issues.

Giving ECO thumbs down until there is some workaround or fix.


For anyone wondering; this game is a ecosystem simulator. Plays like Minecraft, but no focus on fighting whatsoever. You will be challenged to save the world by advancing and developing new technology to stop your planet from being destroyed by a meteor. The meteor will orbit your planet with a time limit, timer depends on server settings. With some pressure, you will need to make sure not to destroy your own planet by cutting down too many trees, littering garbage and pollution from your factories. Bigger servers with high collaboration will limit your skillpoints gained and allow players to specialize in order for trade, economy and team work to play a bigger role.

I enjoyed this game, it is way more fun to play with others than singleplayer.

Pros:

> Meteor gives a goal to work towards.
> Economy and contracts are very fun aspects of the game.
> Beautiful Graphics
> Dev team is actually very active and listens to direct feedback.

Cons:
> Buggy, but what Alpha/Beta game isn't.
> Graphics as in coloration, water, lighting are all beautiful, however, it's still heavily lacking especially when compared to other vloxels like minecraft and pixark.
> If a players of a certain role stop playing a server, basically the entire server is dead because no one can progress until someone else trains in that missing profession.
> Players can't actually, die, which takes away from the challenge a bit.
> Animal AI is VERY derpy. Like worse that rust in alpha stage was if that says anything. Seriously, animals can scale a 50 foot vertical cliff in like 1 step...

30,39942782,english,"<<<SINGLE PLAYER REVIEW>>> (miltiplayer review below) Updated 09MAY2018

Bottom line up front:
Yes, this can be played as single player and it is fun to play. No IT IS NOT INTENDED as single player and you are missing the intent of the game if you only play single player. 

I played a majority of time in single player while I wait for my family back home to get the game (im stationed TDY at the moment), and had a great single player experience.

The game runs perfect on my laptop and is very stable. I encountered a few bugs like getting stuck on a tree (you can just type /unstuck and it will fix it) and a few minor things, but nothing game breaking yet. 

The graphics are very well done and the atmosphere is wonderful. I was walking through the woods and a buck ran down the hill across a beautiful waterfall; things like that happen often as the world is teaming with life. 

Progression is great and even though I KNOW I WONT SINGLE HANDEDLY SAVE THE WORLD.... I am impressed with how much you can really accomplish in a short period of time. 

My favorite part of the game is it really feels like you are part of an eco system. When you chop down a tree you make a mess, when you fire up the furnace you are polluting, when you hunt and gather you really feel like you are taking from the planet. Even in single player you can have an impact. 

Building is fun and can be complex. There are tons of crafting options and I don’t think I will explore them all before I inevitably die in a fiery global catastrophe, but I’m going to have fun trying :)

Things you can do in single player:
-Hunt, fish, farm, chop trees, mine,
-Clean up your mess
-Build, craft
-Watch the meteor get closer and closer
-Have a whole world to yourself and have fun!

Things you can do in multiplayer:
-Enact laws, develop a community, become the leader
-See a world dynamically develop
-Get disconnected from the server over and over (Mostly FIXED AO06MAY) 
-Have a chance at destroying the meteor
-Have a blast

You will enjoy the game for a time while playing single player, but you will eventually want to join a community. I agree this isn’t a game you will want to play alone for too long. I am excited to try this out with my family and maybe even on a server when they work out a few more server bugs... 

So again... If you want to play single player, this is a lot of fun and you can still have a great experience! Just count it as practice for when you join one of the communities later on 😊

<<<MULTIPLAYER REVIEW>>> 

 (Most disconnect issues FIXED AO06MAY2018). I still get disconnected, but not as often.

I purchased the game for my family back home, and we spent all day trying to connect. I finally gave up and rented server space (I have never done that before, It's kinda cool) and we were able to play together. My favorite thing to do is watch my wife hunt elk and buffalo. I'm not sure why, but it's fun to see her chase down game with a bow and then go cook at the campfire. She's a better cook in the game than back home!

So, even with a rented server I had lots of issues… disconnect every 10-30 min, falling through the world, not being able to interact, etc. The devs hve been very active, releasing updates just about every day since launch.

Even with the issues, I had a blast playing with my family! We built a log home and are working on upgrading it now. It is amazing how much there is to do and how fun it is. 
The Dev’s are very active so I expect the server issues to be fixed soon.

UPDATE 06MAY2018

I have spent 1/2 my time in Multiplayer and about 1/2 in SIngle Player. I have to say I enjoy them equally. Multiplayer: it's a blast to carve out a spot on a planet and be a part of a community. However, I dont like how the owner of the server will wipe the server and start with a fresh world, especially after updates. Just when I get settled in and start having a lot of fun, its gone. Of crouse Single Player that doesnt happen, and I have built more than I ever expected I could by myself. You can see my screen shots on my profile, they are all singleplayer.",1518137460,1525616513,True,96,3,0.857919871807098389,4,True,False,True,76561198007314492,297,17,39613,2683,11664,1602038822,,
31,41875614,english,"I bought this game three weeks ago from this review date. The game IS in early access, but in the past three weeks I've put in just under 160 hours = just under a third of my free time over the past 3 weeks. 

I LOVE this game, It's a bit intense to find the server with the right balance, as many people have made the game either too easy and short (Blowing up the meteor in 2-3 days), or altogether too difficult (Gets grindy to the point where people start switching off after 10-12 days)

Pros:
-Fun house designing
-Depending on what you enjoy you can pick skills - I personally enjoy simulation/economy style games, so controlling my own store has been awesome. Others I've played with commented on how engineering and design are enjoyable to them and as such pick skills like construction or road building.
-Good servers can make the game even more lifelike - properly utilizing the voting systems or even placing parliamentary systems can make the game a great source of fun.
-In High Spec. servers you pick basically 1-2 jobs to do over the life of the server, which requires communication with others and working together as a whole to complete the task of defeating the meteor.
- The game itself brings in a large amount of balancing tasks. We got to a point on my last playthrough that required a guy to basically have a full time job planting trees and killing bison to overcome the emissions volume from our smelters. (We did mod our server for a 50% increase in emissions)


Cons
- Certain skills feels grindier than others but don't necessarily make better income (ex. a Miller basically just buys produce, maxes mills and sets up queues, not all that much going on - but makes bank as he's req'd for baking and many aspects of cooking as well. While a Carpenter/Miner has to go and actually cart around goods that have a max cap (20 in hands)

- I hesitate to put this on the Con list, as I personally enjoy video games that take up large quantities of my personal time. (I'm an escapist) With certain server configs the game requires you to be on every 6-8 hours, and if you miss out on those timings you fall behind in terms of the server. Basically any kid this summer will be able to outplay those of us who have to work, simply because they're on far too consistently.

(/endcons)

This game inherently involves working with other humans towards a shared goal. It's much like real life (except we don't make enough common goals irl) As such you are able to communicate and work with other players - whether that be for the good or bad of the game. I've had some amazing experience laughing with people about the powered cart that was duped from a server reset and ended up lodged between two buildings (insert drunk driving joke here). On the other hand as the only large scale farmer I had at one point been coerced into a trade war between two cooks who hated eachother

You spend 4 hours chopping and transporting lumber, because you don't have a road that will allow you to use a cart, you can't make a road because you don't have the skill points to learn the road making skill and nobody on the server is selling the tool you need, and you wouldn't want to use your (time dependant) skill points anyway because you hardly get any and need them for farming. You need the lumber, because you have to expand your house to get more daily skill points...

Every planet I played on had 80-90% of the landmass as one biome, and the remaining 10-20% was too scattered and never had enough room to actually spawn resources. 

The soundtrack captures a very good vibe, though there is too much silence between the tracks that play, probably because it's not finished yet, but it's early access so what is there to do but wait.

44,41746470,english,"I have to pop my review cherry on this one. The experience and potential of this game are simply amazing.

Solo or on a server with friends, the whole feeling is spot on. For an early access title, I am blown away by the smart design decisions taken by the team. Progression and pace are just right. The resource management, crafting and building systems are deep without being convoluted. The tech tree spends enough time in each era to make you feel the full impact the changes. 

WHY THIS GAME IS WORTH YOUR TIME AND DOUGH:
[list]
[*] [b]Navigation[/b] is boundless. No fall damage, no climbing restrictions. The game actually lets me play with its core elements without interrupting me with pointless challenges or frustration that bring nothing to the experience.

[*] [b]Survival[/b] mechanics are actually part of the gameplay loop. Being properly fed will help gain skill points faster. When you are hungry, you simply can't sprint or work (use tools) anymore. You can still do everything else and will not die. Having a proper home with good furniture also helps you gain skill points faster. These are the only ways of gaining skill points. [b]YOU CANNOT DIE IN THIS GAME[/b]

[*] [b]Progression[/b] is designed to let you play with what you have discovered. You [i]cannot[/i] lock yourself out of a key skill and subsequently halt your progress. The only way to get skill points, which drives your overall progression in recipes, tech, skills, buildings and stats, is over time. You get more over time depending on nutrition and house quality (see previous point)

[*] [b]Storytelling[/b] is used in a clever way: you start with nothing, and there is an asteroid coming for your planet. You must complete enough progression to find a way to destroy it. In this current version, the asteroid takes 30 real days (counts down even when offline) to reach the planet. [b]This is plenty of time[/b] for you to discover the game and enjoy your time, maybe not even be 100% optimal but the simple presence of this overarching narrative gives a sense of purpose to the whole experience. Once again, very smart and cleverly designed.

And lastly, i must mention most of the negative reviews are from people who simply can't connect to a server for some reason. This is a possibility in early access, and shouldn't be a dealbreaker as it is more of an exception than the rule. With the refund policy, you have nothing to lose.

53,41678195,english,"GOOD:
Intricate skill tree and research mechanism, encouraging specialization and cooperation

Voxel based game but still visually appealing as creatures, plants, avatars etc. aren't also made out of 'blocks'.

Functional dedicated server included (so many games of this type either lack this completely, or what is there is a broken mess.)

""Beyond the builder"" - with the added ecological component, weather, government, economy.  In many of these games you build all the things and then its just pvp time or play something else, Eco offers another dynamic.

Realistic/sensible gameplay (and physics, for the most part) without being unforgiving.  If you want to move a block of dirt, you physically move it.  None of this 'gather up 1000 of something and then just destroy it-  the ecological balance and realism of items never going 'poof' is an interesting new dimension to this genre.

Good quality of life features - Storage linking to workbenches, campfire turns off when not in use, etc.


NOT-SO-GOOD:
Can be a bit unforgiving if you're just trying to play it by yourself, easy to get overwhelmed with undestroyable items. 

Terraforming/building large scale projects/houses can be extremely tedious.  For example starting out you quickly realize that none of the tables beyond the basic workbench will function unless enclosed in a ""room"" - and then you realize you need to chop, cut into pieces, and haul a dozen or so trees and hew all of that into logs and then manually construct a house according to specific parameters or the tables simply wont 'turn on'.   There'll probably be some terran flattening involved or foundation digging which means moving blocks of dirt one shovelful at a time.  Its not too bad, but gets a bit tedious.

I started a few single player games to undertand the mechanics and it is deep... all from what nutrients a certain plant needs to yield more to building laser turrets, I ended up finishing the game after a few 90 hours of gametime which is a good deal for the bucks.

I love the research - crafting thing, always getting to the next level, knowing the outcome of the next level.. wanting this new item that will take your further...

I do miss a bit of a challenge besides just gathering, crafting and researching, the meteor is not that frightning.. maybe at first but you pretty early (within 24 hours of gametime) get to a point where you know you will make it.. I had 25 days left when I blew up the meteor, so since the wild life is not aggresive you just take what you need, do what you want not considering any danger coz there is none.

The environment challenge took a few tries to overcome, but after that it all comes down to gathering, researching and crafting....

58,41649261,english,"A creative take on a Microsoft like game with technology progression. Where Minecraft simply allows you to build anything you can find, this game progresses as you play opening up skills and technology based on your character and what you want to do. It’s imparitive to work with others on the server to progress. You can play solo from what Ive seen but it will be difficult. Additionally the effect of your progression directly affects your world. If you harvest out all your trees of one species, you won’t find them anymore. This could cause imbalance. I’m not really sure how yet. Do certain trees host certain animals or so certain species of trees process CO2 better? Is there even an atmosphere or is it simply “you have factories here and they destroy the air in those places at a rate of x over y time.”

Granted I haven’t played much yet (2.4 hours) but the thing that feels like it’s missing is weather. A proper ecosystem has rain to water the plants, and the player. You have a very extensive food diet system (even tracks what is in your stomach and how full you are) but yet you aren’t required to drink water? I would think that drinking water is a key element to any diet. Plants need water, and rain is a way to get it. From what I’ve seen watering plants is a thing but outside that, I’m not sure. Maybe I’ll discover this later.

Additionally the biomes don’t make much sense in their positioning. I live in a snow biome that is next to a grassland that is boarding an ocean. Seems that within 100 blocks of my base, there are all the biomes. Snow, desert, ocean, forest, etc. It doesn’t make much sense how that could come about in an ecosystem.

Grass is really weak. I chop a tree down and it falls on some grass. I chop the tree up and the grass under that tree is already dead and there is a huge dirt spot. Seems to me that grass is far more resilient in real life than this grass. Also, since that grass is missing now along with the tree, does this affect the CO2 levels in the atmosphere? 

Also doesn’t seem to be any real dangerous animals. Bison which are 3 times my size run away from me. They aren’t aggressive to defend their territory. I would think that they’d either ignore me or attack me. I think right now my worse problem and most dangerous survival element is falling from high places, drowning or starving. For it to be a survival game it doesn’t feel like there’s enough danger in the world. 

Also eco systems while not popular to discuss, how do animals and plants reproduce? Is there life and death of animals? There don’t appear to be predators to kill off smaller animals or the player so what makes one animal more dominantly stronger to provide their niche? The only danger animals have is from players. Are there males and female animals? I didn’t see any baby animals. I don’t see any mothers taking care of their young or protecting them... I’m trying to put my finger on what makes the eco system. The only thing I can see here is “don’t destroy the plants” type eco system and a “don’t kill off all the animals” systems but nothing that really says “hey breed animals yourself to keep specific species alive” or “make a zoo to protect and take care animals”. The only plants that seem to generate seeds are the ones you can farm and eat.

As far as game stability the only issue I seem to have is when I open the world map for the first time my FPS drops a lot (down from 30 or so to 10-15fps). Outside that the game seems to run fine. 

This is just my first take on the game. It seems fun, so I’m giving it a thumbs up for now. I think there’s a lot of missing elements in the ecosystem of eco, and there is plenty of room for improvements on FPS as well.

72,41547409,english,"I hate giving this a negative review, but there are just some basic items that need fixed to make it an enjoyable game instead of the mechanics fight that it is now.  This is definately a game to watch as it is on the right track.

Pros:

Great depth of skill tree
Good premise about the metor that must be destroyed or else the world will be
decent building, can use some work for sure
Awesome mechanic of linked inventories (open one chest you have access to all linked chests)

Cons:

No way to get rid of excess inventory
painful mechanic of moving earth, like show stopper level

They build/market the game as being eco-friendly.  Ie.. the stuff you build can pollute the world so you need to be cautious and think about the things you will build.  That is great and part of what makes this game stand out.  The problem is that it doesn't deal with recycling which means there is no way to get rid of your excess inventory.  I have maybe 12 books and multiple pages from said books that are just filling up chests.  This is not a huge deal, but they were made from wood/paper so let me burn them as fuel and possible take an air pollution hit.  I mean I gotta cooks stuff so let me use the books/pages.  Hand in hand with this is that the chest size is fixed at 16 slots.  Let us skill up and build bigger chests, not the best solution to the non-deletable inventory, but it would help.

Here is the big one though.  If you want to move dirt you can only do so one shovel at a time.  eg... pick up one shovel of dirt, walk to where you want to place it and drop.  Rinse and repeat forever.  The reason this is so horrible is not just because it is so painfully slow, it is because every other thing in the game (except for skill books and pages) stacks and can be carried in multiples.  rock/ore/coal you can carry up to five units worth (an earth unit and a rock unit are the same size).

I also am experiencing lag like crazy for some reason.  I suspect it is becuase I was browsing public servers and then loaded my local game.  First 2 days I played solo, no lag at all.  Now on the third day, every time I open a chest or open a crafting table it takes about 30 seconds to bring up the interface.  Before it was instantaneous.

And lastly, dont' put a bug report feature in the game that requires you log into Github to submit the report.  If you do insist on that, then warn the user that they will not be able to submit the bug without a Github account BEFORE they type up the report.  That is just junior league stuff.

I will check back in  a few months and see if they have fixed and update my review at that time.",1524010167,1524010167,False,3,1,0.474681884050369263,1,True,False,True,76561198030860247,132,22,762,0,762,1524011189,1524180590.0,"The ability to get rid of excess inventory will be included when we add 'trash' which should be in the next release coming up.

Research times are super long. Construction of research items require a huge amount of resources, which would make sense given the 30 real life days you have to save the world. That being said, if you're playing alone, you'll take months to actually see the end game. Everything just seems laborious, and there is no real challenge to this game. You're restricted by the research, and if you're alone, it might be more forgiving to play something else for a couple of hours. That being said, if you have people to play with, the research can be divided between a number of people, the resource collection is much quicker, and you can actually enjoy more of the elements of this game.  

Graphics are very nice for a voxel type game. Game runs relatively well, and I experienced no crashes. Building is easy and relatively open for choices (when research is completed). Resource collection is interesting in terms of how it's actually done, which is in parts - you cut down a tree, then cut pieces off to max your carry capacity then take the wood to a stockpile/pile it up. Music is repetitive but at least decent. The day/night cycle could be made better by adding weather elements. Animals do not attack you which is odd when you shoot a wolf in its hindquarters, or chase down an elk. 

If they added a different game mode where it was more suitable for more casual players, this game could be huge. Its potential is excellent.

75,41531718,english,"Beautiful, relaxing and unique.

With so many Minecraft clones and spinoffs the survival / sandbox / crafting genre is pretty crowded. This game stands out for several reasons. Its has an interesting backstory and concept and the fact that you only have 30 days from the moment you start a new game to solve the challenge is a unique approach in itself. 

I has a really nice feel to the environent, in fact I might even say stunning, with excellent lighting and really quite soothing music. The approach the developers have taken to make the ""blockiness"" much smoother makes the environment feel more organic than minecraft. 

The way your actions have an impact on the world adds an interesting dynamic to gameplay.

I feel that it could do with the option to extend your gameplay beyond 30 days because some people havent got the time to play that often. This especially applies for people playing alone.

Which brings me to another point. This game is designed primarily for co-operative play and thats something I feel more games than should, often fail to offer co-op play. However I feel that the game could do with maybe a couple of gameplay modes which are more forgiving for single players.

All in all an excellent offering and perfect for those who like relaxing games.

Summary points:
-You need friends to play with to make it fun.
-You need to have a fair amount of time available to progress anywhere.
-Essentially just a HD modded version of minecraft.
-Extremely limited carry capacity, to elaborate you have a carry slot, only one item type can be held in this slot and you can only carry so much. I know it's part of the game mechanics to need to build stuff like carts and whatnot but everything is far too tedious. You'll spend an hour or so just building a basic log cabin.
+It has a fairly decent skill system so you can each progress in your own tree to work together
+The world impact map is interesting but thats about it, I wouldnt exactly call it useful.

Basically if you like slow progression and have £23 to just dump then feel free, other wise just go play minecraft with some mods.

It is not perfect, but the developers are obviously committed to it and the results up to now are pretty impressive.

86,41490366,english,"After playing for 2 hours of playing with my friend I decided to get a refund. Here's the problem I have with this game: In most crafting games like factorio, you do the fun part, which is designing what you want to build; then the actual building part is almost instantainous. This game take a more ""realistic"" approach, where if you want to build a log cabin, you literrally spend like 2 hours chopping down trees and cutting up wood, and processing logs, and carring boards like 10 at a time to your cabin, because you can only hold ""1 armfull"". It's like real work, like not-fun work. And if I'm going to spend all that effort just to build a simple cabin.. I'd rather just go out in the back yard and build the real thing.

The other problem I have with this game is the skill tree system. They talk about how you have to ""specialize"" to form an economy with your friends, but really all it is, is that tons of basic actions you need to play the game, like schucking clams, or building stairs, or whatever are locked in a skill tree, and you only have enough points to unlock one or the other.

13,41152721,english,"I think its time for more informative quick review on this game as a server admin.. Please note this is my own expierience running 40 man server.

Lets start with server stability

Server stability is joke I have to restart 4-5 times a day running on high spec servers because game cannot handle long plays at all.. There will be errors that will casue players to discconect, crash and hell even make all server go down because they exectued double click on item.. This is how bad it is and thats nicely put...  I think over a week I get like 60 - 80 dumps... 

If the servers are not stable this means the communities will not be stable which means game overall health will not be stable.. People that Twitch cant promote game because if it cant run properly on servers they will not spend their time in this game because it will make them lose viewers everytime server loses stability, this is like chain effect which will lead to less players in game and lose overall popularity of game in long run.

Client issue

Multiplayer Server list is currently a mess.. First once list loading and if you leave it loading fully it will crash your game unless you hit stop.. This been here from release and I am astouned it hasnt been fixed(as it acts gateway for every player)... Also after existing server and trying to join server again your clinet will freez you must restart game...

Information on server list needs to be more informative there are so many servers but no one actually knows what settings and multipliers they are running that should be visible for all players High Coloboration is not enough for description.

The patches

Devs keep releasing patches but it doesnt seem any of them are tested and it seems that those patches tend to break more things then fix (there is also big habit of releasing hotfix for a hotfix which just escalates nighmare of managing server)..What they should really do is to test their patches lot more rigirous to prevent such situations. Furthermore there is really a lack of informaiton on updates.. If you wanna stay updated you will have to be on their offical discord because steam pages nor their website will ever have up to date information... And not even talking about all patch notes which are very brief and not as informative to players at all.. And lastly there seems to be habbit of un-unversionsed patches which you can only find out by updating your server based on feeling(i know right).. Overall this is absolutly the worst patch managment I ever seen being done in game.. Lack of communication and lack of profesionalism from devs is very much astounding. 

Game updates

While game updates seems to be currently comming 3-4 weeks they are not properly tested.. Devs carry on testing stress test but it doesnt provide them with any real information.. Because while server will run fine for first 3 days of fresh install, all errors start creeping up from long plays of game which hasnt been tested what so ever... I like to see them run server with no errors for 10 days with people doing all kinds of things.... Perhaps and offical server would actually help where they could see those errors themselfs instead of us using our time reporting whcih shouldnt be broken in first palce.

Html law voting system

In game you get to vote for laws while it sounds like a great idea execution not so great... Lets just say if you have any special charcaters in your steam name forget it you wont even be able to use that system... Hell it doesnt even work properly for plain text names.. Most of the time submitting law will result in error and occasionally it will work.... Also the whole law submission is not very user friendly while its easier to do its not easy to understand how to achieve your desired outcome for law....

Bottom line its way too bugy and can be real pain...

Gameplay

Oh boy there is way too much to say.

Lets start by saying game has potential while it has very cool concepts and ideas and some of them work well most of them are really broken at this stage...

Character Specilisation

The game really draws you in it has many specilisations but none of them are balanced enough due to fact there is no demand for it.. Lets say you choose cook everyone will always need food from you however if choose tailor you will only make items once and there will never be more demand for it just make 1000 of cloths and your done for rest of the game... This means there is very little or no reward in terms of choosing that specilisation. There should be wear and tear on items and they should affect your stats even more which would mean you would have to go see tailor to fix those items... There is lot of ways to fix this and add intresting mechanics

Another example Hunter doesnt feel like rewarding skill at all anyone can fish anyone can hunt... People that not hunters should not be able to shoot at all or make them so weak that it would take them way more arrows to even do some sort of damage.. If we have specialities they should be exclusive!

It just feels sometimes the game is not sure itself if it want you to stay in one proffesion or be multiple proffesions...

Game Difficulty

Currently the game is too easy hell it is even easy by making it harder...You probably wondering what? Well let me put this this way we tried running server on standard vanilla settings, we tried it with multipliers and then we tried with super difficult settings that would probably make you gauge your eyes out....

And in all instances sure the start was abit harder but then you get to stage and say what now.. The difficulty doesnt feel like difficulty of game itself but more as nerf to your own leveling.. It doesnt feel like achievment when we made server harder but more as job with little reward... But if you make it easy then what the point of any cooloboration I might awell make everything be a cook be a carpenter the whole economy becomes pointless and at that stage I am playing single player...

I think difficulty should be based on world settings for example It would be more likly that animals will go extint if you dont proper look after planet and review all the statistics... If you would pollute you would get harher punishments such as sea level would rise considerably...

Bottom lines the difficulty of game should be more based on environment you in not so much on your skill level and progression  

Economy

Concept great but this is not mmo where you have sustainable amount of players to interact with economy.. So lets say player leaves game that means he might own half of the server money that means there is less money in overall server and if you inject more money well it will justs screw up more economy... Also to keep track of all the prices is just next to impossible. There should be centrelised npc that controls economy the current concept doesnt work for 10-40 man servers at all...And not even talking about price fights...

And lastly

While there is great emphasis on your actions causing destruction to world I can tell you that now.. This is not the case I yet to have expierience where population of animals die out or atmosphere gets so poluted that everything starts dying out.... 

There is no concequence apart of meteorite which is gimickya as hell and really easy to stop...

I think another important point to mention the dev focus is on new cars new boats ect while those things are nice they are focused way too late game and dont really add any value apart of rp interaction they make game even more easier.. I rather them focus on introducing more uses for items I mean as example gold we all hate 

One thing that is positive is actuall players in this game are really friendly and chilled out and that probably was the best part of eco... But thats not because of the game but because of the game that player invision and want... And that is the main difference... The game really draws you in with all the uniqness but poor execution just leaves you bitter",1522415456,1522949101,False,4,0,0.480149805545806885,4,True,False,True,76561198006955471,110,10,8535,0,8535,1522396058,1527703483.0,"Hi Legend, thanks for the detailed report, I want to address all of these so will take it step by step:

UPDATE: All known network issues have been fixed as of 7.4

- Stability.  7.3 fixes the majority of crashes that were happening in 7.2. You should have much fewer crashes now.
- Patches. We're currently staffing up on the QA side to have constant testing of the long game.  As you mention its much harder to test problems that occur after a few hundred hours of play time, but that is our goal.  Expect more stability here.
- Patch notes and notification.  Good feeback, and we will begin more transparent with patch timing and contents.
- Special characters in name: This was fixed 3 days ago and will be in the next release: https://github.com/StrangeLoopGames/EcoIssues/issues/5139 Fixed a number of other law bugs that were in 7.2.  We will continue working on the interface as well.
- Balance and specialization: there are still some major systems to add to the game, clothing which you identified, but also late game vehicles.  Check out our roadmap here: https://ecoauth.strangeloopgames.com/roadmap
- Economy.  We put players in full control of the economy, so if a player leaves it will definitely be a blow, but other players are free to create their own currencies, and the economy can adapt.  We are planning to add more government control of currency and property which will let it be more adaptable still.
- Ecosystem.  We're adding new sources of pollution, with garbage coming in an update soon, and oil pollution etc having a very large impact.
- Community. Agreed we have a fantastic community supporting us as we take on this big project.

Thanks for your review and patience while we're building this game in Early Access.

I do not recommend this game for a couple of reasons.

1st The game optiminization is poor, sometimes I have 60+ fps sometimes it just drops like crazy for no reason, nothing is built completely new world.

2nd Game is too slow, but I mean TOO slow.. Unless you make a private server to speed it up the game is just too slow, the skills and everything that you are supposed to be getting is just too slow, I think the 30days is a bit of a overkill since it only counts when you are logged into the world... (so better play online)

3rd I don't know but I kinda wen't throught everything in less than 14 hours... which makes me think there isn't enough of content for something that costs 27.99Eur (as of 4/4/2018).

4th The updates are rolling painfully slow, I am still waiting on the vehicle update.

The game has postive side too but this is all about why I am not recommending it.

However the game concept is good and it is likely to develop a loyal following as it gets more developed. It is not good for single players now and might never be.  Most game play features are only for a mutiplayer server. 

I give it a thumbs up with the usual early access reservations. If in doubt don't buy it but do start following development. This one is worth watching.

=============

An essential game for environmental science students. Minecraft like survival game. Where the goal is to level up from the stone age to modern industry. The catch is all industry environmental damage is accurately recorded along the way. So you going to have to come up with really good enviromental plans. The second catch is there is time limit where the planet must be saved from a meteorite. Rush things along and you will an enviroment too toxic with industrial waste.

Of course people in multiplayer will not agree on the best action. So there is a whole political system in there too. Players can vote on new laws and elect leaders. The real gem of the game is world events are posted to a local host web page. Leaders will have to come up graphs and facts to support their environmental policy.

The game will run in single player but it is almost impossible to get very far. This is very much a mutiplayer only game by design right now.

Lots of fun, but only really good with a group of people who you're sure are committed to the game (so if you've got, say, a gaming group you've known for years and there are a bunch of people there interested - go for Eco).  Rather than a full on yes-I-recommend, I would give this game an middle-of-the-road-but-lean-toward-buying-it.  In other words, I like what they've done and where they're going enough to not give it a negative review, but the way servers die on you is extremely annoying (see below).

Full story:

This is a very fun game, with what seems to me a very engaged devteam.  But the game has a problem that isn't the devs' fault, but it does wreck the experience for me.  You've got 30 real-time days to destroy the meteor, and nobody wants to join a server 15 days in - I want to be in at the ground floor and know my contributions mattered throughout the entire time.

So that means I browse the servers looking for a Day 1 or Day 2.  I log in the first time, and there are usually a bunch of people on, scurrying around collecting resources, figuring out what spec they'll be, and what spec their neighbors will be...  Figuring out where the town(s) will be, etc.  Tons of fun.

Three days later, half the people (or more) don't log in anymore.  And with the game's deep-not-wide skilltree system (which is a big plus for me!), you could suddenly be minus your farmer, or your tailor, or your brickmaker, or whichever.

Meanwhile, very very few new people are joining the server, because, from what I've observed - everyone wants to be there at the beginning - in on the ground floor.  So there's nobody coming in to replace the skillsets that have quit.  In my experience, once a server hits six to eight days, the dedicated players decide to either restart the server or join a fresh new server.

I've been on four or five servers now and haven't gotten past Day 8.

And just to be clear, this isn't entirely the devs' fault!  They've done a great job with a great game.  I just hope they can come up with a solution to this, because I'm a bit sick of dumping 20-30 hours into a server just to see it wither and die.

The singleplayer game is always an option, and I do play it from time to time (usually during updates when the server I'm on hasn't yet been updated).  But the whole point of this game is multiplayer coop, so singleplayer is very milquetoast.

Please, devs, I implore you to come up with a creative way to help people through those early-midgame doldrums.  I don't know what the solution is, but given how good the game is, I'm sure it's within your grasp!",1522449814,1522449814,True,0,0,0.462328791618347168,0,True,False,True,76561198031447475,110,5,19243,0,13442,1598527577,,

47,41133842,english,"Overall, I enjoyed my time playing ECO immensly.  It is a beautiful game in so many ways.  The graphics are tremendous for a voxel game.  The skill system is also a nice evolution that emphasizes multiplayer in a way that I have not seen before.  It is tremendously addictive and has a ton of content for an early release game.  I definitly feel I got my money's worth and plan to play it more in the future.

That all being said, while I feel it is far more developed that a typical EA game, it still is an EA game.  They have worked hard on improvements, but the server stability and performance is probably the biggest issue I had with the game up until the 7.3 release.  That being said, those issues never kept me from playing.  Although, they were enough to drive some away.  It is my understanding that it is much better now though.

Also, the progression system, while increadibly engaging, does need more developement.   A team of 3-4 experience players, who are heavily collaberating, can progress to shoot down the meteor in 7-10 days.  After the meteor is shot down, at least on our server, people just didnt want to play any more and we had to wipe the server.  For me at least, that is way too short of a world.  So, if you like to build and take your time, I recommend playing on a server with no meteor.

73,40978085,english,"Waste of time. pretty much just a digging simulator with alot of waiting time.
Pros:
The game is really pretty.
The music is really relaxing (all 30 seconds of it)
The hunting, woodcutting etc is pretty immersive.
Lots of stuff to explore.
You can make really pretty houses.
Doesn't support the flat earth theory.

Cons:
Really boring game, i love survival games. but this is not a survival game. it's more like a stripped down sandbox.
The mechanics are fun to start with. But they get really boring. having to move one block of dirt and then run somewhere else to dumb it, it just takes too much time.
The hunger system doesn't work really. when you get hungry enough you can't work, but that's it. you can't die. besides that the balancing of eating diffrent kinds of food, well there is alot missing.
Mining stone..... why would you even make it so you have to mine each block twice? this is not because of lag. but they decided that stones break in three pieces, two small and one big, you have to chop the big one up again to pick it up.
Sooo much waiting. i've spend alot of hours in this game just standing. you have to wait for each item you craft, some takes a long time even with upgrades.
The multiplayer connection is edgy at best. we startet by just hosting through steam, but then my friends couldn't connect and we had to make a dedicated server.

All in all, if you like digging go for it. if not stay far away

This game has a bit of Minecraft, Factorio or Subnautica. You gather ressources, build a base and advance in technology roughly from stone age to modern tech. I really love some of the details in this game. For example you have to use a cart to efficiently move earth around, or you really have to pay attention where to plant crops. In the end the game is lacking the depth and ""endlessness"" of Minecraft, the complexity of Factorio and the beautiful world to explore like in Subnautica.

There are also still quite some bugs. Server crashes quite often especially later on. Sounds are partly not well balanced. Some of the game elements seem unfinished and some of the art and animations are not done. Fluids are not working. Overall it seems not well balanced. Also: barrels should be reusable!

Overall this is fun and worth a try if you are into these kind of games.",1521014933,1521697170,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True,76561197970339445,550,190,3545,0,3524,1521957642,,
81,40968566,english,"I do recommend this game, it is fun to play, there are lots of ways how to specialize, interact with other players and it is really really obvious how dependend everyone is on another. Which is fun... at least for people like me.

BUT:

If you happen to play with friends from the start and your friends don't happen to be the biggest blockheads in the universe, the game in its current state is surprisingly easy. If you expect that it is hard with people that actually DO cooperate the game is very easy and you will have a hard time breaking the planet for the fun of setting a friends beach cabin under water due to rising sea levels.

Just follow the three basic rules to not destroy the planet.

Do not chop down all the trees at once and clean up all the stumps and branches.

Just produce the amount of iron you need for research and stick to stone tools until you have the Blast furnace that doesn't produce tailings in the process.

Avoid producing anything that isn't crucial until you hit max efficieny in the related skill (which is fast)

Why should anyone do this? Because you actually get rewarded when you do it.
Trees will just regrow without you doing much to promote it (sometimes annoyingly fast when you plan to build there) and the branches also yield a resource you will need plenty of. The blast furnace doesn't produce tailings, so you dont have any toxic blocks you need to get rid of or that alternatively transform wherever you put them into a toxic wasteland. But again you get rewarded for the lazy option since doing nothing is still less annoying than dumping toxic waste mindlessly into the next river. Skilling max efficiency also rewards you even more. On highest level you make 5x more items out of the same amount of raw ressources, and since you cant carry a mountain worth of stone in your pocket like you can in minecraft it again promotes lazyness.

So while the social working together, economy and ""getting along with other people"" part seems to work fine and gives you interesting stuff to deal with, the ECOlogy part is not really that well designed currently. Don't go on a deforestation spree and you would have to work really hard to get all the ressources to built all the factorys and run them in order to actually make a visible dent into the ecosystem

The game really needs more ways to actually get short term gains on cost of the environment, like burning trees down (CO2 emission) for fast land clearance without having to invest as much time in the cleanup. Campfires lamps Kilns and everything that uses fuel should actually emit CO2. etc.

In order to be morally challanging the game actually needs to offer short term rewards at a cost, vs slower/less yielding options with less of an impact.",1521694451,1521694451,True,122,3,0.903290748596191406,0,True,False,True,76561198052279159,189,14,21085,6977,7665,1602006812,,

Definitely optimasation is still to work on. Recoomended system requirements are way too low to run it the game with fancy graphics. I have nVidia GTX 750 and i5-4670 and getting about 11 FPS on full detail, with GPU being the bottleneck.

Concept (Ecosystem)
Possible to play in Single Player (just more patience needed)
Not many bugs as for early access (game is only in Alpha)
Crafting takes time (maked as '-' by some, but I like it)
Gives a real feeling of success when progressing from 'stone age' through 'modern time'
Ease of running your own server
Can be improved and expanded indefinitely
Modding possible

After this failure on this one server me and my friend tried to set up our own private server. My friend started the server, forwarded ports but.... It stayed on connection failed because when I tried to join my friend trough steam it kept trying to connect to localhost.

2,40847262,english,"Pros + 

+ Original in a way.
+ Gameplay was somewhat fun at first.
+ Multiplayer enabled.
+ Seems to have a fairly decent population. 
+ Interesting use of eco mechanics. 

Cons -

- The gameplay was charming at first but then began to lose its attractive qualities. 
- Tries to copy Minecraft and almost like SPORE and comes up short in the areas I like those games the most for. 
- Story wise you are trying to prevent an astroid from hitting your planet, but in order to do that you degrade the planet... I think if they just left the astroid out and just had a survival factor with monster threats it would have been more fun... 
- The people that I did meet were pretty helpful, but it was so they could get free labor out of me basically...

32,40771382,english,"Review is based on Patch 7.2.3

Eco is a fascinating game, and one that I highly recommend. I play a lot of Survival and Building games, so it is hard for a game to set itself apart in a somewhat crowded genre. While still in Early Access, Eco has managed to claim 137.4 hours so far, and still many hours to go. This sets it apart because not only have I already sunk in a lot of hours, but I am looking forward to sinking even more in.

Eco is a game where your survival extends to not just yourself but your entire planet. A cataclysmic meteor is 30 actual days of gameplay away, and you must go from stone tools to meteor busting lasers to stop it. To distance itself even farther, your actions impact the planet as well. This means smelting metals will pollute the ground, and the air. Chopping down trees will cause animals to lose their habitat, which means your food sources will become harder to obtain if you are not careful. To put the icing on the cake, the game strongly encourages cooperative gameplay, so it will be hard to save the world alone (settings can be adjusted for solo play).

Aside from the usual things you expect from a building and survival game, like research, crafting, etc, just how fast you learn new things also depends on you making a home for yourself and feeding yourself a balanced diet. This means you cannot live in a tiny box filled with 20 crafting tables, because you simply cannot. So you will find yourself creating a living town with people filling roles of baker, butcher, and the like. In solo play, you'll find that you still need to fill all these roles, and provide space for them.

Overall, I really recommend Eco. I like how your actions impact the world, and there is a lot of promise with the roadmap for even more features and refinement to the current gameplay. For a cooperative experience, it definitely has been one of my more enjoyable experiences, even on a smaller server with some close friends.

[h1]The Bad[/h1]

Despite this, it has one of the most compelling hooks I've ever seen in a multiplayer game: functional small scale player economies.

I don't want to stop playing this game because joining a server and becoming the best X specialization (tailor, brickmaker, chef, woodworker, to name a few) and knowing that your specialization actively contributes to the tech scale of the server as a whole is an incredible experience. That said, the game is an unstable unplayable mess at the moment, and the other players on your server can have a profound impact on your enjoyment of the game. Because collaboration towards greater technology is key to the major long term objective of Eco (shooting down the meteor with a laser) your server's population diversifying properly is extremely important.

Crashes are frequent and, although technical issues are expected in Early Access, the degree to which they're present here warrants further waiting to play without pulling your hair out. The unconventional approach to ""survival like"" multiplayer gameplay, however, is incredibly novel and a breath of fresh air for the genre and I can't wait to see how it develops.

Worth checking out to see its approach to small scale player economies, but don't get too invested because your server will probably explode and lags horrendously when more than 10 players join.

Some game mechanics that make online multiplayer fun (in my opinion) is the economy/market and law systems. You can cooperate better by proposing laws and vote for laws.

For a comparison, in Minecraft I get bored pretty fast because the gameplay feels like it's lacking a direction somehow, and modding it isn't as enjoyable as I wish it would be. In Eco there is a purpose for the gameplay, a direction to it. I like that. It feels more complete while it's still a sandbox/open world game.

One bad thing about the game, if I have to mention one, would be the movement of your own character and other characters. It's weird and seems a bit bugged out, but it doesn't ruin the gaming experience that much. This will probably get improved very soon.

In my previous review, I endorsed buying it anyway and seeing how it goes. 2 weeks have passed where I didn't feel able to go back into it because the designated chef has no way to pass food to me, and a rather large update to quite a few game features on Wednesday still hasn't addressed that.

[b]Do you like the game?[/b]
     Absolutely! Ive logged almost 48 hours within the first 7 days of me purchasing this game.

[b]Was it worth the money?[/b]
     Certainly! I feel like the price is definetly fitting if not lower than what i would have expected for a game of this content

[b]Is it completely community based?[/b]
     Yes and no. There are public servers and depending on how the server set it up there are different rankings of community involvement. If you wanted to play single player by yourself you are well more than capable. Similarly, if you want to play in a huge community you are able to do so.

[h1]Detailed:[/h1]

This game is great! I was just struck by the trailer as it was certainly something ive never seen before. The whole conecpt actually seemed overwhelming to me at first and especially the price.. However, I took a shot in the dark and actually genuielly feel like this was a well worth purchase and definetly would not mind buying it again! After 3 years of this game being in development there is certainly much content and the community keeps the whole game running along with new encounters every day.

This game has been in development for over 3 years now and was just recently added to steam's early access which means two things. 1. there is PLENTY of content (very well made too!) it is certainly not lacking. There is just this feeling of satisfaction as everything kind of just fits. 2. its in early access and as posted on Eco's website there is plenty more to be added from the roadmap. It is also known that this game adds many new large features to the game every month or so (in accordance to the road map which i should also mention that the owners of this game get to vote on what features come in the next big updates). But also I do want to mention that they are VERY fast to send out patchs. Since last update which was 2 days ago there has already been 3 quick bug fixes!

For me, Eco is the essence of the ideal game. It takes my favourite parts of Minecraft and Factorio, adds in a really interesting ecology simulation and gameplay focused on multiplayer, some really interesting underlying technology (spherical voxel planet), and then on top of that has something important to say.

I was holding back on this review until seeing what the next update would be like. I often invest time and money into early access games (just check my steam library), just to be disappointed by the game getting abandoned, neglected or taken in the wrong direction. However the recent update has given me confidence that the developer knows what they are doing. The update focused on improving the UI, improving multiplayer stability and fixing bugs. I have seen time and time again developers completely waste the potential of a game by working on the wrong things. I know Eco is in early access - but the hype starts as soon as the game is released, a lot of games fizzle out while still in early access because the frustrated players moves on to something more stable.

63,40643947,english,"The idea of this game looked like a great game to play with my fiance... and in theory it could be.  At least I've been trying very hard to like it.  Initially, it was exactly what I wanted... but then the flaws started to appear.  

First, there is very little you can do after the initial grind.  I have nearly reached the peak tech in the game, and have found nothing exciting to build... nothing to make the grind easier, and nothing cool, unique or fun to have.  Simply things that cost more raw resources and have a different skin.

Second, there are the bugs.  Game breaking bugs.  Frequent bugs.  I have set up a server for my friends, and I can scarecely keep the thing running.  This thing is a co-located, dedicated machine (8 cores @ 3.4 ghz, 32gb RAM) that should easily handle far more than 4 or 5 players.  Not only does the server frequently crash and freeze, but the client side is equally bad.  Today, I had to take a break after reconnecting every 5 minutes or so because I couldn't change items, place blocks, interact with something, or items disappeared from my inventory.  I've also had to restart the server 5 times in the couple of hours I played.

To make things worse, the support channel moderator was snippy and rude when I went to report the issue.  Several server operators were attempting to figure out what steps could reproduce the 100% CPU usage spikes while the moderator made excuses blaming the clearly more experienced server admins for having poor machines or improper configurations.

The game *could* be good at some point in the future... the premise is neat.  However, at its current state, this feels like an early alpha that should not be public at all.  Lack of content, poor service, and game crippling bugs are not something I would expect in a $30 game (even if you buy into the ""early release"" thing).

67,40643041,english,"[b]Is the game any good ? Pros vs Cons:[/b]

[h1]Pros[/h1]
[list]
[*] [b]The skill tree is big.[/b] Farmer is a profession which is different from Gatherer and different from Cook and from Baker, and from Miller. And those are only the professions related to food.
[*] [b]The social part of the game is great.[/b] You can sell stuff to others, build one or more currency, establish complex laws and tax system, elect someone as mayor, authorize Bob and Jim to have access to chest #654 but only Jo has access to stockpile #129. In most games, you only need one jerk to ruin your base. In this game, the majority can restrict how much pollution you create and how many trees you can chop: You can create laws.
[*] [b]You can create very complex laws.[/b] For example: You can't kill more than 157 rabbits if there's less than 985 AmeriEuroDeutschmark in the treasury or if the pollution tax fee is bigger than the amount of players currently logged in. That law makes no sense... but if everyone vote Yes on that law then IT'S THE LAW!
[*] [b]The environment part is well implemented.[/b] If you chop too much trees in the same area, the pollution you will produce will not get absorbed, so your farms plots will die and you won't have any more food to eat. If you kill all the rabbits, well there's no more rabbits. Tomatoes take longer to grow than beans. Etc.
[*] [b]There are a lot of UI (graphs, charts, overlays, etc.)[/b] to give you information about your world (the amount of nearby pollution, temperature, fertility of ground, etc.)
[*] [b]The amount of realistics details is great.[/b] The better food you eat, the more efficient you are. Too much carbs in your diet and not enough vitamins ? You'll have to fix that! Build a nice house. hmmm your kitchen is way bigger than your living room and your character is not happy about that... I said a balanced house, you fool !
[/list] 

[h1] Cons [/h1]
[list] 
[*] [b]The game is a little pricey[/b] for what it currently offers.
[*] [b]There's a lot of unintuitive information[/b] and there is no information in game and there are no up-to-date wikis.
[*] [b]Hunting is pain.[/b] Animals have instant rotation speed and instant cliff jumping abilities. Trying to kill them with a bow(the only way to kill them) is infuriating. I assume this will get fixed in a later version.
[*] [b]The graphic engine is not optimized[/b]. I can go down to 10 fps on a GTX 1080 at normal graphic level in some areas of the world. I assume this will get fixed in a later version.
[/list] 

[h1] Extra notes [/h1]
[b]Note #1[/b]
The game has a very slow pace because:
[olist]
[*] You earn skill point with time, whether you are logged in or not. So at some point, there's nothing left to do... you have to stop playing and come back to the game another day. That's great if you don't have a lot of time and you're playing with a friend who has tons of time. You won't be left behind.
[*] There's no inherent threat. No enemies are trying to kill you. You just build stuff for a month. If you kill the asteroid, you can keep playing with no other goal then to build more stuff.
[/olist]

[b]Note #2[/b]
If you play with less than 5 players, you'll miss out on at least 30% of the appeal of the game: the social part.

75,40609109,english,"I wanted to like this but I cannot Recommend this game

First off, time passes independantly of the endgame crisis - so it'll take 30 real world days for the comet to hit, despite 1 
 or 120+ ingame days passing - and it'll pass even if you're not online. Go on a 2 week holiday and wont have a chance to play? Well screw you, the game actively punishes you for it.

Secondly is the freaking building and mining mechanics. Sure, it looks cool chopping down a tree, having the entire thing fall and then cutting it into carriable sizes.. but its tedious; same with digging and mining.. Its even worse when it comes to construction - expect to spend 20/30 minutes building a 3x3 wood cabin

Thirdly, the game seems to hate people who want to play a solo game. The easiest difficulty is still intended for 1-3 players and playing alone on that, you're not going to be able to learn everything you'd need to hit endgame.

It'll start loading things completely unrequired for a solo game; in the loading you'll be sat annoyed, wondering why the game spends 2 minutes loading ""serverAPB"" or ""DiscordApp"" for a game you're playing solo.

Nor can you delete game saves in any conventional sence. I'm assuming if you go digging around the files, you probably could.. but this is a game apparently intended for 'educating children'.

Don't let the awards fool you - it has no educational value. I have no idea how this got any kind of educational grant money (from what I've heard). Outside of ""pollution is bad"", ""animals live in certian places"" and ""did you know buildings can be made out of wood?"" it teaches nothing, and certianly wouldnt be worth a school forking hundreds of dollars for the rights to use it - It'd be cheaper and less time consuming for subjects like this to just be taught in a normal lesson.

The only kids I could see this helping is those with autism, ADD or dyslexia; even then it'd only be to calm them down and stop them smearing crap along the walls like a crayon, not to educate them.

Bringing me to my final point - If this game looks appealing to you, go buy minecraft instead - its cheaper, has alot more content and runs far better on even older computers.

THIS GAME IS A COMPLETE WASTE OF TIME, AND NOT WORTH THE MONEY! It takes entirely too long to accomplish anything and the point system in the game is over used. For starters you start with a small number of points with zero skills unlocked including basic cooking skills, so your first decision in the game is if you want to be able to build a home or be able to eat. 
The only way to beat this game is as a community, so basically if the entire server isn’t working together with everyone mastering different skill to accomplishment the mission of destroying the asteroid with a laser you fail. Well in my 20 years of gaming I’ve never seen a full server come together to accomplish a mission. Everyone to busy doing their own thing and if they are willing to work with you they want to charge you outrageous amounts of meme credits (game currency) for a basic service or resource they can do or collect.

The main objective of this game is to build a contraption that will blow the impending meteor away. To do this, you need to advance your civilization by unlocking skill set which lead to technology unlock. But the skill unlock takes time. It use real time day where the skill is gained on day to day basis and the gain rate depend on few factors such as hunger and housing.

Look for a place where is near to main population centre to cut trade travel time low and specialize yourselves. You cannot be a jack of all trade in this game. You will not have enough skill to do it. Specialize as miner for example and sell your raw material to a blacksmith and use that money gained for your survivability.

20,40463912,english,"Background and Review**

Eco is a community-based game; the players develop laws, government, and an economy to determine the success of their world. All resources come from a simulated ecosystem, with thousands of plants and animals simulating 24/7. Work together through the player-run government and economy to build the technology to stop a meteor on a collision course with the planet, without polluting the world and killing it off in the process before that even happens. However you’re not alone in this world. Besides the other players, you’ll be sharing the world with a detailed wilderness simulation full of plants and animals.  They simulate 24 hours a day, living out their lives with or without human interaction, growing, feeding and reproducing.  Together they form an ecosystem rich with resources, resources that you must use to survive and develop a civilization.

However, these resources are finite.  Chop down every tree and fail to plant more? They won’t be growing back.  Hunt every elk for food?  They’re now extinct.  Pollute a section of land with mining runoffs?  Your crops are poisoned.  This ecosystem is your only lifeline in a race against time, your source of resources that will either prevent humanity’s destruction, or become the source of its destruction when the group squanders its resources.

Thus you’re facing two existential crises simultaneously: an external threat that you must avert, and the threat of causing your own destruction.  A rock and a hard place.

To solve this you’ll need to collaborate among a group of dozens of players (and eventually hundreds or thousands of people as we grow the game). You’ll need a strong economy that generates resources that can build the civilization, but that does so in a way that doesn’t destroy the ecosystem.  You’ll need to make key decisions as a group as to the best approach to do that, and the game provides you a tool for that, a virtual government.

In Eco you can propose and vote on laws that then become physical limitations in the world.  Limit the number of trees each player can chop down per day to 10 for example, and they will be physically prevented from chopping an 11th.  To aid in arguing for these type of decisions, the player can use data collected from the ecosystem simulation, using graphs and data as support for laws. Together these features create an extremely powerful tool, a way for the group to guide itself and align its interests in the face of impending crises.

 “We’re all in this together, and yet the only enemy is ourselves…”

It won’t be an easy journey.  Despite everyone occupying the same world and having the same interest in its survival, individual incentives will make for vastly different positions.  Is your character a lumberjack specializing in cutting down trees for their livelihood?  You’re likely going to have a different idea as to how many trees should be allowed cut down than others.  We’re all in this together, and yet the only enemy is ourselves, the individual’s needs vs the group’s.

Will you find a balance?  Will your world survive, or be lost and wiped from existence?  Eco is possibly the first video game where your character can actually save the world, because the alternative is for once possible.

Review 

The first 5 minutes of the game were very confusing for me. However, shortly after I found myself already liking this game and I hadn't even completed anything. I was just simply walking around and looking at the world . You see all players on this server had the option to learn various skills in this civilization you are trying to form. Not everyone can learn the same skills. Unfourtantely for me I found myself lacking skills to make a few materials after making my first home. I really needed a door for my new place that I spent a decent ammount of time constructing and so I decided since I was an excellent fisherman I would trade a lumbersmith. 

If you love mine craft you'll abousltley love this game to peices. The emmerse enviroment and the soothing music as you try and figure out what your role in stopping the apoclopyse will be. 

Game days functions as real time days. 

Starting on a fresh server you all barely have anything. You literally discover new technologys that transform wodden homes into brick then into actual citys. You even can form your own currency later on. When someone discovers certain aspects of the games they gain access into advance skills such as crafting automobiles, boats, electric, kitchen appliances. This game just has endless ammounts of opportunitys to do anything and everything.

FYI this game is funded by the department of education because of how accurate it is and the direction that it is taking. You won't be disapointed by playing this game.  Do yourselves a favor and pick it up ASAP. 

The game is 20/10
FYI the community is not super large as it still in alpha and just started but I bet you my salary its going to blow up.

Specifically, the addition of research, mechanisms and building stations, technology, and the ticking clock that gives every action in the game meaning. In addition, it is a very unique experience to have to worry about how your actions affect the environment in a game such as this, and this extra thought process when expanding your civilization adds a lot to the game as time goes on.

It's not perfect, and on the server I was on, the meteor was destroyed way too quickly. I think there's a lot of balancing the devs could still work on in terms of progression with machines and skill points. It doesn't quite make sense how 1 machine can make a laser that kills the meteor, but also makes other things that shouldn't be end-game like stoves. If the devs pushed back the progression as to when the community could build that laser whether it'd be increasing the amount of items required to craft it, or by adding only 1 specific machine in-game that could make it which is extremely hard to come by (think like using items from each profession that can only be crafted by an end-game skill tree in that profession) -- then I feel like the game would become more fulfilling for those in the same server. It'd give people more time to progress in their skills until it's close to 30 days when you really should feel panicked about the meteor blowing everyone up.

I'm sure there are still people who would continue to play even after the meteor is destroyed, but to me it feels pointless... like why continue to live in a game with no sense of danger or goal when you can do other fulfilling things? lol.

Now let me explain my story, I saw this game when it first became ""popular"" but didn't really take an intrest in it (I had a mac and I wasn't sure if it would work and all that and the old $40 price) but after I got a decent windows computer and the price went to 30 I decided to check it out!

There was one problem though, I got hooked. I decided to start a single player until my friends got the game. I didn't have that much fun (the single player is kinda dull) but a few days later my friends got it. We spent about 10 minutes getting the server figured out, but it turns out it's really easy! (Go to tools under library and download and run ""Eco Server"") We started and had a lot of fun! At the time of writing I'm still having fun!

I decided to take up carpentry, but due to only having 2-3 players it was diffucult! We fixed this problem by cranking up the skill rate but a good bit. This solved it and we were rolling again!

Overall the graphics are nice, the shaders amazing, the gameplay is fun with other players, and the mechanics are amazing. The idea is so fresh and fun. I wish this was used in like my science class (like it was meant to be used) because that would be sweet.

I haven't tried a server but from the other reviews it looks like it could be fun!

So, give it a look! And if you like it, maybe we could play a server together at some point!

TLDR: Game concept is nearly a 10/10 if you've always dreamed of a game that allowed you to work with others to create a civilization online.

My Dream Game and the best gaming experience I have had in years.
Firstly Kudos to the devs for creating a product that even in beta is rediculously fun. 
I actually had to pull myself away from playing the game in order to write this (my first ever) game review.

This review will be highly positvie but will include constructive criticisms from my personal experiences.
I've tried every profession in the game and the positives of the professions are many.
1. They are pretty unique and play differently (of course there is overlap. They aren't COMPLETELY unique)
2. They are all needed
3. They require different time commitments. The no-lifers and those will limited time are on equal footing

I tried 4-5 servers and would play 2 or even 3 at a time in order to try everything out. Unfortunately all of these servers failed in that they had to be restarted or were taken offline or were unstable.  This is a part of ECO that I feel that devs should look into. With collaboration being so important, grouping up with random players and admins can lead to frustration and wasted time. Especially when so many people are needed to collaborate and play daily. This may simply be unavoidable in this genre however.

Queue my current server
I decided to try to take on a more public works focussed role and not be as selfish or worried about getting housing points or just picking a profession and hoping it helps the community.
This time I decided to start building roads and getting individuals connected.
I welcomed newcomers in a friendly way and helped them to learn the game.
I encouraged everyone to communite and post objectives.
I didn't do a single thing for myself during this time besides have a space where I could craft.

Eventually folks started moving to an area I designed the roads to intersect. 
I then began to develop this area more and other individuals started to move shops in and so on and so forth.
I continued to provide incentives and be a friendly team player and this area continued to grow.

Today we have an actual town setup with stone roads connecting all parts of the town. The roads extend far North,South,East and West and connect residences to the town. 
We have a working capitlist economy going, with a global currency.
We have a working government with 3 branches, including Public Works, a Treasury, and an Environmental Protection Branch. 
Everyone works together without doing the typical ""no one owns anything, hive mind"" BS that is typically required in collaborative games.

The one thing missing is actual laws, but hopefully the devs will get that sorted over the coming weeks.

I feel that I've figured this game out and I see what the devs envisioned when they designed it. 
This is is all about working together, not necessarily in the traditional ""lets all consolidate resources"" kind of way, but in a ""I need to be useful and provide good/services to the community"" kind of way.

There are definitely some beta gameplay kinks and bugs but I've confident those will be worked out.

Devs - Thank you so much for bringing your vision to life and allowing us all to play this wonderful game.
If you need any critiques / input I'd be glad to help share.

I like forward to my server (hopefully) destroying that meteor before 30 days is up. If we don't well I look forward to getting to do this all over again :).

Thanks!

85,40271645,english,"Eco is similar to minecraft....but on steroids...
Eco is a highly ambitious sandbox survival game where your actions have consequences. Any action you do causes a reaction by the enviorment. Such as choping down trees will cause desert areas to get bigger and less chances of replulation of trees... which means less help vs. airpolution. Yes there is air polution..ground polution, water pulution in the fact that the sea rises if you dump stuff into it. Everything you do has an effect on the ecosystem, so you will have to make sure to keep everything balanced.

Another great this is the inclusion of skill trees(kinda). You cant just get on and build the best stuff and win the game...you have to collect resources, keep energy up, this raises skill point which then you unlock new things.

Fresh, New Mechanics
Great Immersion
Fun Gameplay

First off, I would agreee with most other reviewers that it has a bit of a Minecraft feel to it, but less pixelated. Its great for people who like to dig/build/explore, but I think what makes it better than Minecraft is that there is more of a sense of purpose, and not just a 100% sandbox type game. It does definitely feel more original than most other similiar games.

Secondly, As a science junkie, I also really enjoyed the level of detail they put into the cause-and-effect aspect of this game. Everything you do can have a potential concequence as you become more advanced and it definitely makes you think. The environment and the biomes are beautiful too. 

Lastly, kudos to the devs for making the storage system so amazing. Being able to access off chests from any other chest or even from crafting statsions is a godsend and reduses having to run back and forth. There are many other nice features but that one was (for me) the best. 

Ive only played it single player so far, but I think the game appeals to both the lone-wolf solo players and community-oriented players. It definitely takes longer to advance and complete several tasks at the same time when playing solo, but its still doable and fun regardless.

96,40145715,english,"UPDATE: Thanks for all your comments, friends! It is through discussion like this that we can all learn. :) Upon discussing the issues observed with a developer through the Eco Discord (highly recommend joining!), it appears the world generation for our multiplayer server was bugged, resulting in an abnormally high death-rate for all plants. This is a known issue, though seemingly one I missed in my research. D'oh!!!

I've regenerated the world on said server and have found much better results with similar methods. The death-rate for sowed plants appears to float between 20-40% now. On Day 4 of the old server, more than half of all wild plants were dead (edible and not). It is now Day 4 on the new server, and I am happy to report that wild plants are dying at closer to a 15% rate.

Further testing has yielded the following results:

1) Specialization multipliers kill the game with less than 5 people. Avoid them until you've gained your bearings. 

2) The ""Fertile Ground"" overlay is meh. I found much more use out of the ""Temperature"" and specific crop overlays. 

3) There is a lot of information given in farming that isn't immediately important for getting food going early game. Get the soil analyzer ASAP, but don't be intimidated.

Of my original points, I still find it frustrating that seeds must be essentially sacrificed for analyzing if you get to a certain point, but I understand the need for such a system. If you're smart about gathering plants in the first few days, it shouldn't be a problem by the time you get enough points for the soil analyzer. Secondly, I have been unable to find a working ""Aqueduct"" or Pipe that will adjust moisture of soil in the latest update. Seems you will be at the mercy of the land/natural water. Lastly, it would be great if the game stored information about crops once the soil analyzer is used on them once (spreadsheets are only fun to a point, imo!). I believe the other points have been addressed by my notes above.

Thank y'all again for your time and comments. If any of y'all are interested in discussing some of the finer points of farming, feel free to add me. Always happy to learn something new :)

ORIGINAL REVIEW:
I would really love to rate this game highly. The environment systems and crafting/building mechanics are phenomenal. In many ways, this game is groundbreaking. However, after playing as a farmer/gatherer for the last 32 hours, I am giving this game a big ""NO"" until some changes roll through. 

Early/mid-game farming means the following:

   - 40-60% of all crops planted will die. Nope, nothing you can do about it, even with higher matches on your soil.
   - Want to spec into literally anything else? LOL TOO BAD. To be even remotely useful in farming, you have to be putting 100% of your points into the Farming tree.
   - Gathering in the world sustains a group of three people for (give or take) 3 days before everything starts either dying or becoming too scarce to gather without extinction. Thus, seed production (even with the farming skill + seed efficiency) is laughable.
   - The soil analyzer is useless unless you have a plant already sowed in the area. This requires you to waste precious seeds to survey if (like most people) your wild plants have been gathered to eat by the time you get the soil analyzer.
   - Want to improve the moisture of your area? Welp, sucks to be you. You have to wait for someone to get high enough to make aqueducts! 

Since the majority of the food you would WANT to make requires a dozen or more of a single crop (and generally 3-4 different crops), you essentially have to have a separate person be a cook to cash in on efficiencies. There is no way for your farmer and your cook to be the same person, unless you jack all of your server settings down (WHY!?). In my short play time, this has created a pigeonhole effect of which I'm not fond. Farming is NOT fun in this game right now.

I'd like to see the following improvements to the farming tree:

   1) Improve the soil analyzer/crop details. If I can see the moisture, temperature, and nutrient levels of a tile, I should be able to determine (without 54 spreadsheets) what crops can be planted in the area (matches).
   2) Allow farmers the ability to preserve plants sowed. What is the point of becoming a farmer if all of my crops die at the same rate anyway? :)

I find it very refreshing to see a ""open world, survival, block-crafting game"", as i tend to call them, that brings a new spin to a genre, that is so often a copy-paste cashgrab. with Eco you can see that the Developers have put alot of thought into making it a well rounded experience, although it's still in Early Access and is clearly missing some Features/balancing.

Pro:
	-It's a bit like Stardew Valley in 3D:  Mainly because it is slow and incredibly relaxing

	-offline Skillpoints: when you are offline you still generate skillpoints if you have eaten 	enough. As far as i've seen for up to 48 hours. That means if you play in a group you are not 	being cut of if you can't play every single day.


	-accessability: the game tells you where to look if yoou need to know something without 
         holding your hand too much.

The game itself is great in many ways, but what's the point? You spend a GOD AWFUL amount of rl time setting up and moving your civilization forward. Where's the fear of losing it all? The only enemy you have is the meteor. You literally can't die in the game. 

It took me two hours just to figure out what the hell was going on. The ecosystem simulation is great, but this is not the type of game I was looking for and it saddens me that I'm stuck with it.

Eco is, on the face of it, another Minecraft-esque clone with its own unique twist. At least, that is how it looks. It also has quite a few things in common with 7 Days to Die (namely workbenches, technological progression, and the skill system). As always, this is in Alpa, so your milage and usability may vary.

== World Graphics ==

It's clear that while the underlying principle of a minecraft game (a world made up of cubes) is still in place, substantial effort has been made to move away from this, especially when it makes some sense. The basic terrain is still made of cubes, but graphically the sharp edges and corners have been rather logically smoothed out. Dirt overhangs, then slopes down to the next level. Rocks look properly craggy.

Another pleasant change from Minecraft as well is that trees, shrubbery, and aquatic life is as circular as it needs to be. Just because the game engine thinks in cubes doesn't mean that everything has to look like it. As well there is a wide selection of plant life beyond trees. Shrubbery, grasses, several different kinds of plant food, and seeweed are all welcome details.

The lighting engine is what one would expect for a game of this era, casting proper shadows relative to light sources (artificial as well as natural), as well as god rays and some nice bloom effects. While nothing groundbreaking (indeed other engines do better), for Eco it's perfectly servicable.

== Crafting/Resources ==

The meat of any crafting survival game. In this, Eco does not dissapoint. It plays a lot like Minecraft with some of the more classical industrial mods attached. So you have wood and iron, but you can move on to steel and oil and other chemical options, and that's just in vanilla. You have a staggeringly broad variety of recipies for food, running from a basic roasted beet to molecular chemistry (yes, really).

Actual crafting for pretty much anything is done at a selection of workbenches, of which more advanced types get unlocked through research as you go along. Like in 7 Days to Die (7DtD), a workbench keeps working even when you're not at it, so you can do some basic automation while you're doing other things (which is good as some recipies can take a while to process).

But there are a lot of nice quality of life modifications that aren't in games like Minecraft or 7DtD. For one, you can link a workbench to storage chests and storage yards. For example, you can have a campfire set up for some basic cooking, linked to a storage yard (for a supply of wood), and then to a chest where it can output its products. Since a lot of the workbenches are fairly specialized, this can make it quite easy to manage in-house production chains that convert raw resources into finished goods or useful intermediaries.

== Technology Progression ==

Like in 7DtD, there is a progression from wood and stone tools (and construction materials) upwards to steel, plastic, and concrete. Unlike 7DtD however, it's not simply a matter of getting enough levels in the requisite skills. One has to first ""research"" a skillbook that unlocks this new group of skills. And this is handled in a rather interesting and logical way. For example, you don't start off with the ability to farm. You need to research it to unlock the specialization. What's needed to do that? Some common farm seeds. More advanced wood crafting? Some roughly hewn logs and some planks. And so on, and on.

== Multiplayer Potential ==

A lot of co-operative and restrictive capabilities are built into the base game. You claim various spots of land, and then you can define who can build or modify what's there. You can do the same thing for various work stations, and even set up how much you want your users to Pay to use them. Similarily, you can create a contract board where you can set up orders and what you're willing to pay to get them done.

But there's another system that really pushes towards multi-player co-operation, and that's specialization. Depending on server settings, each player is allowed so many ""specializations"". These can encompass things like cooking, mining, smelting, engineering, and more. Training beyond the allowed amounts starts costing more and more skill points per level, soon enough making progression in new careers prohibitively expensive. Fortunately, it's just a setting, so if you want to play by yourself you can. But it's an interesting mechanic. Additionally, once you research a new specialization, it creates a book that can give it to multiple people.

== Consequences ==

This is the big difference, and the main selling point that seperates it from other survival crafting games. Overfish, overharvest, overhunt, any of these things will damage and or destroy the local biosphere. As well, the shift to processing metals can generate a substantial amount of pollution, which can in turn impact animal life and even your farms (theoretically to the point of rendering the entire map uninhabitable).

You have access to a substantial amount of data for your world, which is useful to identify locations where certian plants or animals can be found. As well, this can help you map out pollution, and track other changes (which can even include sea level changes). Tying in to this is the ability to pass laws that restrict or encourage activity to try and keep this environmental damage in check.

== What's Missing So Far ==

One thing I'm lamenting the absence of is weather. Every day is another clear, sunny day. Given all of the focus on game effects and the ecosystem, the absence of rain is alone is rather stunning. I would have expected at least a Minecraft-esque server-wide rain/thunderstorm event, something that would have perhaps blown down trees, watered crops, possibly set a fire or two, and perhaps washed out atmospheric pollution and made it contaminate the ground.

Aside from fishing, I haven't seen much else in the way to interact with the water. It would be interesting if there were other things that could be done, like boats or proper diving gear.

Upgraded farming. I haven't gotten to the deep end of the tech tree, but some upgrades and enhancements to farming would be nice. Sprinklers, perhaps hydropondics, that sort of things.

== Final Thoughts ==

As an Alpha game, it clearly has some promise. The basic foundation is pretty solid so far, but what it needs is more iteration, more core features, and from what it sounds like, some definite stability work. But it's no worse than other games that are in the same position (like 7DtD), and for multiplayer it definetly has some upsides.

It's so fun to join a world, pick a profession, peddle your wares, form alliances with other players, and everything else this game has to offer. It's a combination of all the best parts of crafting survival games and real time strategy. My group, for example, is trying to out compete a rival group's minted currency and claim as much land as possible, while keeping the environment on and around our property healthy. So much cooperation goes into this, and this is probably the only game community where I've actually seen people cooperating and listening to the needs of the group so well.

44,40061584,english,"FIRST IMPRESSION
During my first run I gave the game 120 minutes of my time. During this time I learned how to gather resources and dig holes while efficiently placing dirt because from what I see you cannot just pack blocks of it into your bag/inventory. Your shovel carries a block of dirt and you have to dispose of it. Same with trees and mining the stone/minerals; you have to stack/place it places and bring it into the crafting tables/campfires the same way. The character customization was basic and just color changing but I did like that it had something. The tutorial just hands you tools and I did not like that, I was looking around for sticks/wood for a pickaxe or tool to gather resources for nearly 10 minutes until I noticed the tutoral box at the top left. I was thinking that I might refund the game until the tutorial taught me that I could view the world in 3D and look at the environment filtering out what resources I need and where the animals are located. This was when the depth hit me, I am surviving developing a sustainable civilization while maintaining a thriving ecosystem and with that at my finger tips I started looking in to where I was building and what resources were near to cut my traveling and where a good quarry would be. I started building the dirt piles and stacking my ores and wood. I put a tiny bit of time into the crafting system but noticed it all requires the certain skills and I noticed the 29 points I had and started picking up things like hunting and masonry, peeked into my campfire all the food you can make and noticed there were things like fishing. So in conclusion I would recommend this game to any survival head who wants the beautiful scenery and progression systems - 10/10 will play again. 

I think playing alone was fine but I can see how having friends would make it sooooo much better. I was doing some research and noticed there were lasers and factories so I am really looking forward to the content. 

WHAT I THINK THE GAME NEEDS:
Make-shift tools
3rd person crosshair
Better hair
Better beards
PVP (Would be a really good hungergames-like game)
Agressive animals
START WITH NOTHING (I WOULD LOVE THAT)
Should have to craft backpack not spawn with it. 
Should have to make a tool to view the world or find the components. (Adds a chance to actually mess up the starting and have to FIX it once you start monitoring the environments)
Transportation systems (ex: boats, animals)

FOR THE RECORD:
I only put 120 minutes into this game and anything listed above may be in the game but it did not reach me after 120 minutes so they may be included in late-game content. 

ALSO
I know the game is more based on ecosystems and cause/effect build up BUT I think it has a really good survival grasp here and the developers should run with it; let us start with nothing in middle of a planet that we know is gonna be smashed in 30 days.

Imagine Minecraft with a bunch of tech mods, plus mechanics for economics, environmental science, legislation/diplomacy, and nicer (at the very least, modern) visuals, plus an impending armageddon. That's essentially what Eco is. At this point, it's absolutely not Minecraft anymore. But that's the easiest point of comparison for most people, so that's where my frame of reference is.

You and your friends are going to have to figure out how to delegate responsibility and work together to prevent a global catastrophe, all while keeping the environment clean and using your resources and your environment responsibly. It will take all of you to keep your world habitable and productive.

There are a few weird technical bugs in this game. Physics with carts is weird, players sometimes fall through the world, public job postings seem to break occasionally. Overall, though, this game is very stable, and none of our players have found themselves in a position where they've lost significant amounts of time to bugs or glitches.

63,40035205,english,"Hey, I dont usually write reviews for games but I feel like this one deserves it. Im currently the owner of one of the most populated dedicated servers on Eco (Syndicate) and this review is coming from someone who has taken the time to learn every aspect of the game before writing a review about it.

For starters, Eco is a beautiful game. Not only is it a learning experience but its the type of game that will make you lose track of time, forget to go to sleep and nearly starve yourself. 

Every choice you make in Eco has a consequence to the eco-system. Remember all those trees you cut down to build your house? well, you forgot to replant them and now your planet has no way to produce oxygen and remove carbon from the air. Remember that mine you dug under your house to get stone from? well, now you killed all the plants in the area that had roots that relied on that soil you dug up. Eco requires you to be 3 steps ahead at all times. Every resource you decide to take from your planet, you better replace it with two others and pray to God that only one of them dies during its growth cycle.

This kind of system might sound extremely tedious and at first I thought the same thing... Until the Mayor on our server created a law and organized players to make a last ditch effort to save our planet. We spent hours planting every seed we had collected over the past week and within a couple days, our planet was back to a living, breating eco system. The animals came back, the ground turned green again and we learned from our mistakes. This game brings people together and teaches you a valuable lesson about life.

70,40030269,english,"Lots of the negative review's im reading are stupid, i've been hosting a server for me and my friends to play on and it works fine other than randomly kicking them off once every 10-15 minutes, (Their working on fixing that) and i didnt have to port foward at all, they just joined me through steam or i sent them them ip and port provided in the server pannel and they joined, simple and easy.

BUG: When you add a server and use the correct ip and port you have to exit and re-open your game in order for it to appear, the server will pop up at the very top of the server list as a favourite, its because its the wrong ip/port. I found out that the 3000/3001 Ports were not the right ones to use, under ""Network > Display"" on the server pannel I found that the ""WebPort"" was the port that worked.          Example: 216.3.128.12:5606            If your friends still cant join you and see the server try turning off your firewall.                                  IP          PORT

People complaining about earning skill points at a really slow rate in multiplayer, if your hosting a server on the server pannel you can click Simulation > Config and then find ""BaseSkillGainRate"" click the number to the right of it and make it as high as you want. (100 is one skill point)

If you are hosting a server and want to join it just click ""Add Server"" and then type ""localhost"" without the "" "" .

Yes the tutorial is not very good and does not explain all the skills and what is best to get, be careful with what you spend your points on. Also you can earn up to 50 skill points per day (100 being 1 skill point) with a nice house that is well furnished and furnished correctly.

Food is all over the place, i found 500 berries, 50 tomatoes, 300 beans and more in half an in-game day.

All in all me and my friends love the game, if you like minecraft Eco is like minecraft but better, harder and funner.

79,40016337,english,"I've been following this game for year and a half now and it finally arrived on Steam. I spent few hours reading and looking around to figure out if I would buy it or not. 

Eco is meant to be played multiplayer because many features don't make sense in a singleplayer game. However, I wanted to make my first steps at my own pace to have a chance to understand the game, discover mechanics and try the different roles that the skill trees have to offer. I was worried that it couldn't be achieved playing alone and I'm glad to say I was wrong. The devs made sure the skill point earning rate was incredibly increased for people playing alone so they can access all the skill trees. It doesnt mean you'll unlock everything in 5 minutes but you have a chance to slowly work your way to the top of all trees which is super amazing if you want to have a look at everything at least once. Eventually, joining a server would be the thing to do if you want to get the best of Eco but making baby steps in singleplayer is more than doable and enjoyable.

For an early access game, so far I dont have major complains to do. Everything seems to work fairly well, I had no major bugs nor crash that prevented to enjoy the game. Sure the game doesnt have all features yet... but since the first time I took a look at the game (around a year and a half ago), they made decent and serious progress. I dont feel they are the kind of devs that will run with your money. So I decided to make the big jump and buy it even if I'm not super into early access games.

Graphics are cool and many mechanics of the game are awesome. The farming for example, is far more sophisticated than any other games I played. Growing stuff is not just about plowing a square of dirt, planting something and waiting a day for it to grow. The fishing is great aswell. You can use either fishing rod or fishing traps which I absolutely like because you can catch fishes without being forced to fish 24/7 with your rod near a river. The hunting is fun awell and well paired with a very in depth cooking skill tree.  
It's pretty awesome that you have to research part of the skill trees so you're not able to unlock everything in no time. The grinding though is not awful and boring. You have to grind a bit to progress your skill trees and research new skills but it's not requiring an indecent amount of time and ressources. It's pretty well balanced so far for EA game. Again, all this is in singleplayer only as I didnt try the multiplayer yet.

I think the most interesting thing about this game is the main objective of the game... preventing destruction of planet by a meteor... without destroying the planet yourself in the process... cuz yes, species can disappear. Killed all the hares? Well no more hares. You're screwed! It requires players to care of not just mindlessly overfarming every ressources but only take what they really need. Gather more often but less to give the species time to spread else they'll disappear forever. Make sure to replant trees cuz no, trees don't magically grow everywhere like in minecraft! I mean it's super amazing. And you have to mind about all this while rushing to prevent that meteor from destroying the planet. GG!

If devs keep going, it'll be a great game but also a very nice educational tool to show people that getting all kind of fancy technologies to live longer will be useless if we destroy the planet by the time we acquire them.

I dont recommend this game to people that hate all sort of grinding  nor to people that want super realstic survival game. IN this game, you can't die. Animals wont try to eat you by night either. You just need to manage your food intake to earn as much skill points as possible before planet destruction. But it's not a game where you'll die constantly because you can't find something to eat. It's all about quickly building a civilization as optimally as possible to destroy a meteor and make sure the planet is safe and healthy at the end.",1518403229,1518403229,True,78,4,0.850749075412750244,0,True,False,True,76561198006531153,478,154,1123,0,823.0,1546494392,,

TL:DR 
Multiplayer good, Single player updated!

The Good

- Excellent graphics and art style
- Music is spot on.
- Textures are sharp and fit the scenery
- Great animation.

The Bad 

- Haven't found any. 

The Ugly 

- Some of the menues are a little tough to work in (small font/buttons), but that may be an issue with my monitor or a setting I haven't tweaked. 

Things to note.

- Skill points are shown calculated [i]per day[/i]. [b]However[/b] they are awarded per hour. This seems to make single player viable without taking the wind out of the sails of multiplayer. I'll update as I learn more. 

- Skill point gain is based on character neutrition. 

- Family friendly.

The concept is [u]AMAZING[/u]! Plus, I love how the entire world is at your fingertips yet still feels roomy. You can circumvent the globe easily, but there is an abundance of space for adventure, building, etc. The graphics and music create a vibrant and fun atmosphere. That being said, the game needs a bit of ironing out.

Single player might as well not exist except as a way to familiarize yourself with the controls and gameplay. The main goal is not obtainable alone, and even minor tasks are tragically tedious to the point of being boring. I wish players could carry more resources with a craftable wheelbarrow or something to make crafting/building less monotonous. I think it would even be hard with 2 people - so keep that in mind.

The gameplay has a few weird quirks, too, like not being able to DROP things. I get it, ECO, keep it clean, and I LOVE THAT part!! But things like seeds, grass, foliage, and leaves cannot be dropped from your inventory unless it is put into storage/waste building... REALLY?! Can't drop leaves on the ground??..... Really .....

However, this game is clearly much more multiplayer oriented,

As far as the devs go, they seem to really believe in this game, and update it continually, and I firmly believe that they will continue to do so until the end result feels complete. And in response to people saying the game's buggy, I've yet to see anything remotely game-breaking after about 4 hours. Either people are too picky to own an EA game, or I'm getting really lucky, to me the first seems more likely.

4,39909021,english,"(See Update Below - This Next Part Is Original Review)

This game seems to have a lot to it, and so my feelings may very well change in the future. However, I chose Farmer as my profession and I'm very disappointed with it. It seems different things might effect how well your plants do, such as Moisture, Temperature, and the soil contents (nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium). I experimented with the Tomato Plant and failed to notice a difference in yield or growth time between one planted in a location listed as a '95% match for this Tomatoes' and one with 0%. I do not know whether to raise the nitrogen or not. I don't know how to even experiment with it, except maybe to keep an eye on the yield and growth time (I'm not too encouraged to do so currently.. also, could I even lower it if I needed to?). Plants are dying, and it tells me 'This plant is dead. Ecosystem'. What do I even do with that?

Some things do not seem obvious, and you may find yourself trying to find bits of useable information on the internet.

Maybe other professions are more enjoyable, and smoother to operate. But I spent a lot of skill points pursuing this one, so I may need to wait quite a bit to get into another one very seriously. My impression of the game, however, right now, is that this is quite possibly a game that was not ready for a release to steam, and has quite a ways to go in basic development that should have been done already. This may be one to hold off on for some time. To try and be fair, though, this game looks very nice to me, I really like the concept, and I think it has a LOT of potential.

UPDATE: At moments I've been unsure whether to switch this to a positive review. I've spent a lot of time playing, and it's been a decent experience. There's so much to do. The way the environment may respond to your actions, through population swings, or pollution, or maybe other stuff.. I like. As I wrote before, this game seems like it has a lot of potential. I've encountered stores for selling goods, a Law-Making system, graphs charting population growth and decline of different plant and animal species, a seemingly decent structure of skills to learn.. The rate of progression seems good on the server I was playing on. It takes time to earn Skill Points, to get into new skills, but there may be so much for you to do in the meantime. This may counter players spending 5 hours and feeling bored of the game. This game could maybe interest you for hundreds of hours.

BUT

It seems we what do a lot of in the server is make theories on how things work. Which, is it a good thing, a bad thing? Idk. It's been frustrating at times, for some of us maybe. Very frustrating. Also, there seems to be a lot of problems with the game. Today it's been very difficult at times to get decent play-time. On for a bit, kicked for a bit. Repeat. 

If you think you can put up with game breaking problems, features that don't seem to be fully implemented, not knowing sometimes what is even going on, and possibly a lot of minor problems, and this game seems like something you'd really like, maybe go for it. I may leave the overall recommendation negative, however. It's difficult to place a one-size-fits-all recommendation, but I have trouble generally recommending this game because it's apparently so messed up.

So now with that said I looked into this game last year and was enthralled by the concept of having to save the planet you are placed on with a fully simulated ecosystem that you had to be mindful of.  There is a skillpoint system in the game that while yes is slow and in no way intended for single player at the moment (the dev has stated they are aware and are looking to fix it) the game is meant to have people working together in communities. Now based off of other reviews and my personal time in servers a community doesnt just happen like some people expect it to for some reason these are other players not npcs people have to communitcate with each other I wenyt on a german server by accident and didnt realise until later but the server including me still communitcate and have a basic working community. Now the pollution problem is something that is player made people are treating this like minecraftand clear cutting evry tree and killing every animal which supringly will destroy an ecosystem so they complain about the fact that they have to restart.

All in all the skill system is a bit slow but you dont need the points every second you're p[laying they are meant for you to gain a new area of specilty you can still build and interact with the world while you're waiting on the points to genertae and hell the server admin can even adjust the rate on servers. And you dont need a diploma in ecology inorder to avoid destroying an enviroment just be a little sensible people.

I'm going to give this an 8/10 for now since it is in early access and there are some bugs and the skill points while not neeeded at every second are slow to gain.

==Description==
I tell you, this game is going to make it big on Steam. The first thing I thought when I saw it was ""another Minecraft copy."" I was completely wrong. Eco, as you can tell by the title, is a functioning ecosystem and building game. You can run a server,. and control government and pass laws. You use skills points to upgrade you abilities to craft and advance your civilization.
You're working towards destroying a meteror coming for the planet. A fun feature of the game is the property system. You receive a deed that you can manage for your property and restrict players from it. 

==Pros==
Game has no bugs. Or at least none that I have found. Extremely impressive for a BRAND NEW game.
Honest to god fun experience.
Worth the price.
Easily able to join friends.
You can sit down for hours and play it and not get bored.

==Cons==
Er? Nothing really.

==Conclusion==
Eco is a great game that's going to be the next big thing on Steam. I highly recommend that you give this game a try. You won't be disappointed.

That in mind I'd actually really recommend this to people looking for a community-driven experience. The game is visually appealing, it's an interesting concept and as an early access title I expect more good things to be coming its way. The only thing that would have bugged me aside from that it's more multiplayer-oriented than I expected was that a decent portion of the interface involves the game minimizing and opening a webpage with your world's status, laws, ect on it... even in single player mode. It would benefit from an ingame browsers so your game doesn't minimize everytime you want to check the world status, though I must say I can appreciate the actually design and structure of the web page.

24,39933186,english,"Ok so I picked up two copies of the game, and as hard as I try to stay objective here, this game is barely playable in the current state.

The Interface - Game interface is poor, design looks very outdated/alpha style. I was surprised at the lack of hotkeys or menus to provide any information, no details when hovering over any item, very basic. The most simple steps like dragging and dropping are problematic in this game at best.  The one thing that looks half decent is the mini-map. Rest is literally 
 free to play basic rpg maker interface. 3/10

Graphics - Graphics are ok however the way that the land is generated really makes no sense, nothing to do with reality. Animals are nicely rendered which is a plus, and some of the buildings and effects are rendered quite nicely, including the water. Definately not minecraft like, textures have more complexity to them, somewhere between minecraft and Portal knights 7/10

Gameplay - Gameplay seems simple enough, pick some skills, get the tools required and grind away to gather materials. Gathering is still buggy, even on a good connection, well-speced system, there are issues hitting a log to split it (you have to have it focused at the perfect spot for the hit to register [which gets old real fast]) as well as interacting with other objects in the world. Even for early access, this game feels glitchy as hell and should be in pre-alpha still based on current functionality. How to craft or do anything? No tooltips, nothing. You have to scour the internet for some vague description. In all honesty, I have never seen a game with more lack of instructions than this game. Even the .99 cent games have some sort of tutorial or how to. Takes forever to do anything, and when you get to do it, theres a complete lack of instructions, and nothing feels intuitive. For me personally, the lack of any explanation of how anything works, and the sheer mechanics fails and bugs are what got me to refund the game. Try to pick up logs, can't already holding too much (nothing in my hand). Try to drop logs can't (no logs available). Restart client, same issues reocurr. This game is so riddled with basic functionality bugs it'll make you rip your hair out. Character customization is a joke, you basically change the color on clothes hair and skin on a 8bit male or female that looks terrible at best. Even the original runescape probably had better options. I will however give it a few points for only getting stuck twice (once by placing a log down too close to a branch behind me which got my character stuck, and once for getting too close to a pile of objects ) 2/10

Music - Oh here comes this over the top, super loud environmental music that's supposed to make us delve into the game. Somehow, it doesn't match the gameplay, and by default is super loud (like a Spotify commercial) and it replays quite often. 4/10

Concept/Multiplayer - This game really has a good concept and idea they tried to implement. If things actually worked as intended (or at all) this is awesome> being able to have economy and large groups working on objectives. However, seeing where they are at today, it's more likely Half-Life 3 will finish before this game is playable on such a scale. (8/10)


Overall thoughts - This game is like communism, it's a great idea but it'll never work. The scope is huge, but the implementation looks like a bunch of high school kids decided to make a video game. Sure, the original idea is nice but once you experience it the way it's currently working, it feels like it lacks any effort, polish or functionality. If you want to spend days of your life grinding in some pixel world where everything feels grindy then by all means this is the right game for you. For me, this game is not ready for Early Access, add some damn tooltips, or at least a proper official wiki .

Much like real life there are a number of skills you can specialize in. Farming, hunting, carpentry to name a few. There aren't enough skill points to max out all the skills so you will need to focus on a few and cooperate with others on the server to progress.

There is a steep learning curve, and the game doesn't hold your hand at all. The game does have a tutorial, but it doesn't even really cover the basics, nor is there much of an up to date guide. I still haven't passed this hurdle yet, but I can already tell that the game is very deep.

Summary
Pros:
-Great Co-Op Play
-Great Physical Mechanics (no gravity though)
-The Premise Provides Purpose Throughout the Entire Game

Cons:
-Requires Patience to Learn Skills
-Single Player is Nearly Impossible
-High Demand on Graphics Resources

This game is great if you love team play, building shit, and can spend about 30 minutes in the tutorial learning the controls.  The setting is great and makes you constantly feel some sort of purpose when playing.  Graphics optimization is poor, however, this game just entered Alpha so it shouldn't be expected to stay that way forever.  Gaining skill points is a bit slow, you will find yourself trying to kill time to earn a skill point so you can unlock the things you want to do.  For this reason, I can understand why people say that playing single player is impossible.  Overall, great game.

A lot of people complain about this being an SJW game, when it's actually far from that. At it's core, it's an economy simulator embedded in an ecological simulation that only really shines in multiplayer. It's extremely tempting to just pick all the tomatoes and beets on your continent, especially if you are worried about your neighbors taking them anyway, but once they're all gone, they're gone for good. 

The RPG style specialization provides extreme efficiency bonuses to almost everything you could do, from the cook needing less and less ingredients for his increasingly complex food, to the professional lumberjack who can get 50 metric tons of lumber from a single tree after leveling up sufficiently, and here lies the danger of it all. 
Since every plant, every tree, constantly drains nutrients from the environment, and since every player constantly needs to chug down food for XP and energy, the world will eventually simply run dry unless everything is done by highly efficiency-boosted people. Add on top of that the pollution mechanics and things will get out of whack.

Just beware that this game is veeery slow. You accumulate skill points (and thus specialization efficiency) over time as long as the server is running, whether you're online or not, and crafting happens over time as well. You can and should change those values to something like x5 speed if you play with less than three or four people though.
Don't waste your 2 testing hours waiting around for XP, max out that multiplier in the settings and give it a go.

Do not believe when people say it is or the SP tag on the store page, it's impossible to play this game without ramping up the skill rate gain as you would need to spend a huge amount of time playing it to acquire all the skill points necessary (your skill point gain is per REAL LIFE DAY). Even if you want to play with a small group of friends (3-4) i strongly suggest you do NOT.

Skill gain is based on nutrition and a ""house level"", so the higher both of these the more daily skill points you get, thing is, you can just log out of the server with all the nutrition from eating the finest meals and the best house decor and then when you log in on the next couple of days, you will have a bunch of skill points. The first problem i had with this system is that it feels like one of those Browser Games, like Tribal wars or Ikariam where you had to wait for 20 minutes to do something (yeah there's things like this on the game..). 

 Now the second problem i have is this; You play for 5  hours and you gain a total of 5 skill points, but, if someone else has access to more meal variety and house decor for the ""house level"" (which they would need more players or friends to give him that ), they can simply eat all the food, get all of the bonus from the nutrition and house level and just log out, return in the next 5 hours and they will have 10 skill points from this skill point buff which you don't have access to !  
 In the end you would've spend 5 hours doing nothing and then someone else could just log in with all of the skill points and use it on end game stuff or more advanced stuff while you just wasted 5 hours cutting trees and making ramps, what incentive this gives people to actually PLAY THE GAME?

The game doesn't feel rewarding enough, you are just grinding for hours and hours to slowly advance through this horrible Browser Game waiting game, and thats one of the main problems i have with it, you CAN'T play with a small group of friends, the game is made for a huge amount of players to cooperate, thing is, no one is going to do that, we've seen it already on other online games. Server has 50 citizens? oh great, then we will have a lot of carpenters, farmers or bakers right? No, a lot of people can just play what they want without even communicating, there can be 10 carpenters and no farmers, they can just create their own plot of land on the corner of the earth, create a small hut and log out of the server bored (what seems to happen a lot as the servers citizen pop is always bigger than the current online players).

This game has a lot of potential for it to be a major success like Minecraft was, but this Skill system is what will eventually kill the game IMHO.

I do hope that if there is a problem with the server that they will eventually have the client inform you of problems instead of going to a title without any menu. Other than that though it works well now. As far as the game play goes it's very grind and gather. It's not entirely bad grinding as you can queue up work and research while you are gathering or building. The grind and progress does make it hard to have a single player experience so it helps to have friends to take on other tasks, similar to games like Rust or Ark in vanilla play. This probably helps make the multiplayer more interesting but I'm sure as development progresses there will be more single player things officially made or perhaps if modding becomes a thing then the community will have something for that. You can simply play by yourself and since you have admin commands, you can cheat in whatever makes it more fun to play... as long as you don't spoil yourself. However you really miss out on a lot of the game's features without other players. The Economy and Legal system won't really do much without other players to make it relevant.

47,39913271,english,"I want to be clear, my ""no"" recommendation here doesn't mean I'm saying this is a ""bad"" game. I've seen the fanboys attacking the other ""not recommended"" vote reviews and taking these recommendations personally, so for those of you that applies to, please try to unrustle your jimmies. This is just not a ""survival crafting"" game for all fans of the genre.

This game is equal parts Minecraft-style art, ""survival"" crafting, and idle clicker game. While you can build, dig, chop, mine, cook, hunt, etc. for as long as you have the stamina and food to support those activities, your only player progress comes from waiting. You gain skill points in this game by waiting real time, the amount of crafting you do during your time in game has no impact on your skill levels. The only way to increase the amount of skill points you gain is to balance your nutrition in game and to decorate your house(Or to join a server that has turned the skill point rate way up, I prefer to play games on default settings first), both of these actions impact your ""skill points per day""(And by ""day"" I mean real time 24hr period). Character progress quickly becomes skill point expensive, and no single character can be a jack of all trades(which I like). It can be difficult to get established if you're starting out solo and are struggling to find other players with complimenting skills(everyone has woodworking so they can build a house). I didn't try the game in single player, I can't imagine trying to accomplish anything by yourself in this game on its default settings.

The nutrition system and economy are both very interesting and I like the idea of professions but I was ultimately turned off by the way skill points are handled in Eco. Unfortunately, I can't expirement with the game any further without losing my ability to refund(117 minutes) and I already have enough $20+ dollar games sitting in my library that never even make it to the ""10 hours played"" mark.",1518025672,1518025672,False,22,5,0.563766598701477051,4,True,False,True,76561198045394607,305,1,118,0,118,1518023129,1518069366.0,"Hi there, sorry you cant recommend the experience but glad you found parts you enjoyed.  Please bear in mind we're branching out of the survival crafting genre with very different mechanics we're experimenting with (survival is a community applied tag, not our own), and much of it is still early.    Our next update will have tweaks to the single player, especially early progression and specialization cost, we'll introduce actions giving skill points based on food and housing (as an option) and we'll push specialization out till later so player's can dabble in a lot of things before specialization.

It's a complete change of pace from all the ""big"" games at the minute, especially considering you're facing the end of the world unless you and the rest of the inhabitants work your asses off and prepare for the impending doom. 

First thing you will need to know this is NOT your typical survival game, this is not Rust, this is not ARK nor is it anything like Miscreated with Minecraft style graphics. What does this mean? It means you will be wanting to play this online and co-operate with your fellow humans, I know in this day and age where you're used to running around a map looking for guns and shooting each other just to say you were the last man standing it might seem a bit alien to you but once upon a time people used to play together / work together and ECO is THAT game.

Your first big decision will be what profession to take, my advice before you even get into that is talk to the people on the server, get a feel for what they're like (You don't exactly want to be playing with people that don't have patience for a new player for example) ask what professions they need and DO NOT blow all your skill points right away, trust me just slow right down, breath, follow the tutorial, ask questions in chat if need be and DO NOT spend skill points unless you are %100 sure you need it. The reason being is skill points are gained over time, real life time, the better your health the more points you'll receive in a day, I've been eating every fruit / veg around and my health is not the greatest but I'll be getting a skill point per hour (these go up whilst offline too).

As you can see skill points are what stop you from being a one man crafting army, you'll have people that specialise in building roads, you'll have farmers, hunters, gathers and more.

You work together trading materials, building each others items with one common goal in mind, survive the bloody meteor that's about to obliterate your existence.

Crafting / gathering in ECO is done well, you'll axe down a tree and then have to cut it down into smaller parts to carry it back (apparently you get cars and things down the line as your server / players technology advances!)

There are plenty of things to craft and the prerequsites feel realistic for what you're building, similar to Empryion if you've ever played that. 

As I said, I had my doubts, mainly about people actually playing together and wanting to work as a team but boy was I wrong, everyone is helpful and pitching in with any way they can, our server has just opened it's first shop and we have farms and cooks on the go!

A breath of fresh air and a much welcome game to my library and certainly doesn't feel like your typical Early Access game!

We're also looking at developing systems to help advance skill points along in single player.  Hope youll give it another shot as those come online.
