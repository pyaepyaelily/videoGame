10,77071069,english,"There's some argument that there are better dinosaur survival games out there, and while for other play styles probably yes. I for one think this is the best Dinosaur survival game on Steam so far. 

The graphics aren't called top notch, but I guarantee the features in this game and the constant attention from the developers is much better than having an over-glorified butt-munching battle with anything you cross paths with like observed in some other games I've seen. 

The devs fix minor things to massive things really fast and it's enjoyable. It's fun they add special skins and limited time shimmers. I enjoy the growth. I don't like having a stopping point because then I get less invested with my dinosaur. This game also implements skills and a genetic system to make growing more exciting.

There are players that are going to attack you and many of the LARGEST servers I've seen have super petty and toxic people online, people that will harass you because they attacked your child so you killed them kinda petty. BUT there are many decent servers out there and so you don't have to play with people that only want to harass you and your group because you didn't let them walk all over you.

There are many abilities for many dinosaurs. The Sai (Similar to the ankylosaur) can tuck in and deflect damage, turn in place to keep it's tail facing enemies and swing it's tail either direction. It's heavy so things can't swoop up and monch you as easily. Slow, but a decent dinosaur to grow. This is one example. Another good one is the Acro. It's able to roar at prey or enemies and deplete some of their stamina, it's strong and has a decent growth time. You can dig as the orycto and build a customized den. Tornados can't pluck up adult apas.

There's really so much this game has to offer and I wish I had more friends to play it with. I can't get it all in this one post, but I guarantee if you like this sort of game and want an active and DEDICATED dev team.... You'll like this one.

14,76971272,english,"Short version:

If you like dinosaur games that have a lot to offer with regular updates, don't mind some bugs that might kill you and can handle toxic players and losing a dinosaur you spent a long time growing, you should give this game a chance. If you are unsure, wait some time and once the game updates more try then. It might seem bad but this game has come a long way here, I got this game soon after launch in steam and it's a lot better now in many ways. Hope you can support the game to grow even better.

Long version:

With the lack of a good balanced review with pros and cons I made this. At the end of the review I made some ideas on how to fix some of the problems.

Pros:
+Weather system: Drought (if it doesn't rain in a long time some water sources might dry up from drinking), tornados, rain, storms and floods will keep you moving.
+Special ability: Some dinosaurs have special abilities for example megalosaurus can see stats of other players and parasaurolophus can highlight enemy players to the rest of the herd to see.
+Skill tree: Want a fast rex or strong maybe, in between? take your pick.
+Nesting: You can get the baby buff to boost your growth if you are near your babies. If you hatch from an egg and have big parents you have a better chance to get good +inherits (+ points in skill tree).
+Lot of action: Be careful there might be rexes walking behind that hill.
+Customation: You can make your creature have the colors of the rainbow, but if you don't like that you can turn filters on in the settings to have more natural colors around you.
+Burrows: Orys can make big tunnel systems with multiple entrances/exits and you can even farm food in them.
+Land, Air and Ocean: You can fly as pteranodon (tropeognathus is being worked on), walk on land as herbivore or carnivore, or swim in the oceans as mosa or other aquatic, can’t decide if you want to be on land or water there are 2 semi-aquatics you can play as.
+6 save slots: You can have up to 6 creatures in one server.
+Balance: Most of the creatures are well balanced but problems come with infinite growth.
+More creatures are being worked on
+Carry food and babies
+It’s actually FUN: There is a lot to do, play with your friends or find others in a group finder to play with you, most people are friendly and ready to help you.

For some can be Pros or Cons:
Infinite growth: I personally like this growing big and strong, but at the same time some bigger creatures will just rule the server not giving you a chance to grow big.
Not too realistic: For me a pro but not for everyone. Being able to jump to the sky as elasmo (aquatic) and pachy knocking megalo in air only for it to fall to its death and so on.
Growth: Even though not that long but some people don’t have the time to grow dinos like rexes that take time. You can play combat mode but it doesn't feel the same.
+Herbivores can mix group, some servers allow carnivores to do the same, ask admin to do it (but not fun when ptera mix packs with carnis to scout).

Cons:
- Bugs: Can be sometimes annoying, have almost drowned a few times because I was stuck.
- Not well optimised: Even with good computers can be hard to get good fps.
Toxic players: Sadly they have found their way here.
- Not enough players: Only a few servers are popular. We need more players to populate more servers so other kinds of game rules can be or not be made to please as many players as possible. (so get this game and play to fix this)
- Juveniles: They are so weak and can't do anything so many will just afk grow
- Stress from weather: Kind of realistic and gives a bit of challenge, but will often make players sit under a rock or in a cave.
- Scent: On ground level ok, but underwater it's bad. I know it's going to be redone at one point.
- Not new player friendly: Yeah
- Having to use other programs ( exmp. obs) to take a video of rule breaks in hope of getting your dino back.
- Not enough creatures to play as leaving some creatures in constant fight, for example the ocean realm with only 3 options 2 being apex and 1 that will swim and fly away from them and 2 semi-aquatic that can go on land. It's a mess.

One last Pro:
Communication between developers and players. During live streams most of the questions from viewers will be answered, some are kept secret for later. Successions on how to make something work will be heard and written down, some even implemented. Even in Discord developers sometimes talk in the chat and communicate with the players.

How to fix:
You can agree or not, there are just my ideas.

o Toxic players: ability to mute players, text they write wont show up but to avoid confusion their name will be in chat so you know who other people might be writing to.
o Revenge killing: 5-30min after being killed by someone/group not being able to kill them and them not being able to kill you when you switch to a new/existing dino.
o Scouting birds: If you play as any bird no matter the size of it there should be cooldown if you want to change it to.
o Infinite growth: More servers with cap. Maybe after a certain point the stamina pool will start to get a lot smaller so others have a chance to run away if seen far enough.
o Juveniles: More smaller creatures to kill and ai dinos. Maybe have more stamina or speed than adults being smaller and lighter. More places only they can go to hide.
o Stress from weather: Make weather resistance skill better, like when 3/3 walking outside during a growth storm would reduce comfort a lot slower so it would be easier to walk.
o New player friendliness: Make tutorial to controls, scent system and meaning of colors. Small hint for me, try combat mode servers first to see how different dinos work, read through the skill tree to see what it has (press t to open). Game mode is on the right side of the server list.
o Growth: Make it faster maybe until 1.2 growth then normal in a few servers so people who don't have all day long to grow dinos can enjoy survival mode.

In conclusion:
I personally enjoy the game and hope you would give it a change if not now then later as the game keeps getting regular updates. New map and creature models are being made and they are going to make this game look graphically a lot better so be patient and wait for it if graphics are your problem. Join the bob’s discord to keep in touch what’s coming. Meanwhile I will keep playing and watching as the game grows.

Full of pretentious brats who troll and kill eachother for fun and when you call them out on their shit, these people will call others to gang up on you to say why you are wrong and stuff, showcasing a very high mob mentality in such servers. I normally dont complain about being killed in a videogame, but in this game its kinda a big deal. In team fortress 2 for example, if you die, you can respawn in a few seconds good as new. In Beasts of Bermuda however, You must grow your dino first, which usually takes a long time. and if you are killed, guess what.... all that progress is lost and all that time wasted. alot of players will KOS (kill for sport) and this ruins the game experience for most.This game is also very unfriendly to newcomers. Most players in these servers know eachother closely and new players are usually ignored and/or made fun of. I do not reccommend this game until the community brightens up.

For all the people who are currently taking a break from the Isle, or even Path of titans,(i'm not saying they are bad, it's just if you want something else to play) Beasts of Bermuda is a witty and well crafted game. It features a smaller cast of dinosaurs, but it's a better pay off. There are gigantic dinosaurs such Apatosaurus, Acrocanthosaurus, and the Feared Tyrannosaurus rex. In the air, There are Pteranodon who gracefully fly through the skies, watching over the animals below them. And in the sea, giant marine reptiles have kaiju battles on a daily basis just to see tomorrow. This game is based on abilities. Each dinosaur/Pterosaur/Marine reptile has a different niche and role that ties them to the game. For example, the Apatosaurus can walk backwards to get a better shot at defending their herd. Pachycephalosaurus have great speed to ram into foes. And Ichthyovenator can swim as if it was a large dolphin.Along with that, You can unlock talents and invest in a certain build. You can become an absolute juggernaut in the combat tree, become fast and agile in the speeed tree, or become resourceful in the survival tree. Another feature of the game is MAJOR customization and breeding. Breeding has a lot of benefits. It gives the parent players ""baby buffs"" and gives the baby inherits. These inherits are additional points on the Talent tree. But be careful, sometimes they have negative effects. I'd absolutely 100% recommend this game. It may have a few flaws here and there, but the constant connection between the devs and the players can help with that over time.

59,74838648,english,"This is going to be a compare review to The Isle.

Let me start by saying I believe they aim to be different style games within the genre in the end. So I don't want to say one is better. I will say in their current states I find BoB to be far more rewarding for my time spent, even if like The Isle it can all come crashing down in seconds. 

Starting with surface stuff. The Isle definitely has the better sound engineer, like honestly who did that for them is really good. BoB isn't bad but you'll need to tweak a few settings to reliably hear footsteps. 
The graphics in the isle are marginally better in that they appear slightly more crisp and real. While BoB looks more akin to Ark. That said, BoB has way more stuff going on in the water. Throw in the weather affects, lightning strikes, floods, extinction floods, tornadoes, heavy fog, general foul weather, soon to add forest fires. On the flip side night time isn't nearly as dark and there is no night vision mechanic. The map will keep you guessing, one moment you're chillin, next you're trying to outrun the water and the sea creatures coming with it.

Breeding is a thing in BoB. You can inherit colors from your parents, like really inherit not semi randomness. Color customization is nearly infinite and there is different patterns for each dino. You get talent points to spend on perks, some dino have special talents available to them. There is three trees you can spend into. You can grow past 100% (1.0). Parents growth level and talents will affect what kind of extra talent points you get to inherit, because up to 1.2 growth you have a chance to random inherit extra points. Positive or negative, usually positive though. As for growth it caps out (on our sever at 4.0) by then its literally impossible to keep up with food and water requirements. Growth slows as you get bigger and foor and water consumption goes up. BUT fear not, all that hard work surviving and growing isn't wasted. Find a mate make some eggs and hatch into one of your own to get your hard earned inherits. Also did i mention you can have 6 dinos per server? Also when hatched you come in as an egg not a hatchling. Parents can carry young, and eggs. They can also carry food back to nests.

Downside, to BoB over the Isle. Severs sizes are generally smaller but i've noticed servers upping player caps as the game gains popularity. Also the map feels smaller, but with the water level changes, ocean and caves you'll have plenty to check out.

Most of the combat mechanics are more involved as well. More than just tail riding and running around mashing left click. There are special abilities for each dino and most have a primary and secondary attacks.

Lastly the Dino selection is on par with the Isle if you consider the survival dinos they have finished, not counting the number of unfinished dinos. BoB offers 5 carnivores, 3 aquatic dinos (also carns), 1 flyer and 6 herbys. Plus side they are all completed, full skill trees and life cycle. None of this half finished BS the Isle calls okay for years at a time.

Again in the end these games are in development by small teams, progress is likely to be slow. Both teams are doing great work and they aim to be different games. Looking forward to the future of both. That said, as is BoB is more worth your time invested. In my opinion anyway. They heavily under sell themselves and there a bunch of little mechanics to the game you'll never know about unless you play. If you're debating which way to toss your 20 dollars, I highly suggest BoB first, then later buy The Isle.",1598279571,1600782122,True,23,0,0.71368098258972168,0,True,False,True,76561198012130402,199,12,29698,7364,21558,1602090553,,

Para can be two tapped easily no matter what growth its at. 
Pachy will nearly die if it takes a fall even a pixel higher than its jump height.  And it's supposed to run and fight like that.....yeah....
Also, apato plays like it's a trolling dino on the part of the developers. It moves like a sloth and it's mainly defenseless solo until 2.0.  It's also the main target of any and all overgrown preds.  You get to enjoy watching all the time you invested get  destroyed because preds can tank your tail, and you'll never land a stomp without talents.  
Herbis can be necrobombed because they can't move gore from their herding spots so carnis can just be cunts and leave drumsticks where they sleep. 
Acros can basically laugh damage off thanks to their broken healing, cut large distances faster than any herbi, and they can debuff you.

74,75929031,english,"My main gripe with this thing is performance issue. The games graphics look like something from the PS3 days and that's being generous. When the graphics are this subpar and a  3900 and GTX 2070 get 20-30 fps during gameplay it's simply sad. Note that is on MAX settings but their is no excuse for it being that bad. On the game's basic mechanics work as well as you could expect from an early access. One big note for a game like this is that you actually get skill points so you can customize your dino. For example you can customize a pteranodon to be either a baby snatcher, a water diving bird who hunts for fish or even a baby snatcher. Which I will admit is a ton of fun.Something cool is that your dino can also get stressed from being near other dinos not your species this keeps you from ""carebearing"" other species and make it feel more realistic. You get four main types of dinos to play withFlyer-A pteranodon or glorified vulture, you steal eggs or scavenge dead bodies. Aqua-You get to play multiple types of aqua creatures, swim around and eat AI fish and try not to get nomed by other players. Mosasourus is the main thing here. Carnivore-Land based, like T-Rex or Raptor. Herbivore-Land based herbis, apatosaurus, parasaurolophus and a few more. The Community- If you have been reading reviews i'm sure you seen this complaint before, but this community is mostly cancer. And that's coming from someone who has played the isle. I've never seen so many people be this rude or hostile to new players. Ask for help? Get told of and called an idiot for not knowing basic mechanics, because of course this game doesn't have tutorials so you are forced too ask. One thing that is odd here is how much other players attack their own species even as adults, most other dino games while this does happen, most communities bring people in so they have more friends to play with, not here. If you are looking for a dino game give this one a pass for now, look into Path of Titans it's making fast progress and could be something to sate your dream of being a dino.

PROS:

-(sometimes)interesting and dynamic gameplay, including growth, herding, a comfort system and a talent system
-in-depth skin customization
-fairly well thought out survival mechanics
-a wide variety of dinosaurs to play as, all of which have unique and engaging mechanics
-playable marine animals
-a playable pterosaur, with some of the best flight I've ever seen from a dino game
-dynamic weather that can range from a slight breeze to biblical level floods which cover most of the map with water
-pachy

CONS:
-sub-par graphics, lighting is pretty crappy as well as environment design being somewhat boring and unengaging

-poor gameplay balance, especially when considering the game has no growth cap by default, meaning players with a lot of time to kill can grow to godzilla-like proportions

-skin customization can get pretty wild, with players often making disgusting skins that can really ruin immersion(recent patch seems to have fixed this issue, though)

-gameplay is incredibly high risk/reward, since growth is not capped, any time you die you lose massive amounts of progress with nothing to show for it, you thought 6 hours of growth as Rex in isle was bad? try 6 consecutive days of time flushed straight down the drain

-animations are somewhat sub-par, massive dinosaurs can seem to tiptoe as if they weigh nothing, along with some animations not scaling well with growth. Also, saichania's run animation

-servers are mostly player hosted, with limited players on official servers, meaning corrupt moderation and pages upon pages of frustrating and convoluted rules are pretty much par for the course, which can make gameplay incredibly stale

-aquatics, while seemingly fun are incredibly tedious, owing to the fact that there are 3 playable aquatics and 2 semi-aquatics, meaning that aquatic players have a very limited amount of people to interact with, even on servers with 100+ players. Oceans on any given server are also dominated by massive aquatics that patrol the water and basically make the oceans unplayable

-survival talents, especially food and water longevity favor AFK growth, making it easier for players to sit around and do nothing in massive herds guarded by 2.0+ apatos

-maps are pretty small, which on one hand can be seen as a plus, because it means player interactions happen more frequently, however that also means that massive packs and gigantic dinos can patrol it very easily, making it unreasonably hard to grow

I'd really love to recommend BoB, but with the current state of the game, massive dinos, boring carebear servers and neon green roleplaying 2.5 apatos, I can't.",1545603094,1599428783,False,0,0,0.497060000896453857,0,True,False,True,76561198164574232,67,15,54886,29,54631,1601741958,,

But what brings the title down is the community. There is absolutely no sense of camaraderie, and the majority are just utter cunts. 
Right from the beginning I've started noticing that there were just a few servers that are populated, 4 or so. As you spend some time in these servers you begin to notice behavioural patterns. Everyone is in their own little pack and they will not converse with anyone else. The only times anyone will fight is when it is 5 against 1. When in danger, that 1 will usually hide and attempt to log out. If you happen to meet someone of your species one to one, they will kill on sight. When you run into anything else, they will kill on sight. When you hunt someone down, he will change characters, which can be done in seconds after death, and he will bring something to revenge kill you. If you are spotted by anything at all, especially Pteranodons, they will either notify someone or bring something of their own to hunt you down. 
Basically the whole game is just a Deathmatch. The community is the least friendly and least helpful from the ones I've seen in recent years. When they are not waving dicks and insulting each other, they are slaughtering each other. Especially the ones living inside the game, those dedicating 18 hours of their life here every day. They do not wish for anyone to challenge their hegemony and to out-grow them, so they will go to great lengths to ensure that it does not happen. 

Most of the servers will out-lay some rules. And nobody will follow them, because there is no way to enforce them. Replay system does not exist, and the game does not have an event catalogue for admins to administrate the server, like the one I would have access to in ARMA 3 for example. One day I was playing as a Mosa, and a Krono ambushed me, I took him down. In less than 2 minutes a much larger Krono appears on my exact location, and takes me down in 2-3 bites, as I sat with the player body down, which is a rule. The next day the same thing happens, me and my friend gets spotted by a pair of Pteranodons from the air, after we hunted down a large Acro. The Pteranodons spoke and we knew who the players are. Moments later, the same players arrive with their much larger Mosas, and kill us both with the body down already. When confronted in the chat, they claimed they have not killed anything other than a small Elasmo in the last hour. They simply do not give a damn, they lack a moral compass and will blatantly lie, because they know they will not get punished as in order for it to happen, the victim must be constantly recording his entire game with 3rd party software, and with any decent bit-rate occupying 800mb of space for every minute, good luck with that.

To make it short, unless you are a low-life, have no sense of camaraderie and enjoy being a massive cunt and love nothing more but to cause other players grief, this is just a game for you. But if you are looking for an interesting role-playing experience and to make new acquaintances within the game, it is best left alone and avoided.",1599136934,1599136934,False,34,0,0.737997710704803467,1,True,False,True,76561198205917080,231,6,22166,8772,2515,1602091229,,

I know it isn't crucial to gameplay, but coming from someplace like The Isle, this changes a lot. Having inherited and randomised traits to your appearance AND skills when nested -- brilliant feature. The inheritance system in this game is outstanding, and the amount of builds and possibilities are almost limitless.

Character aside, the map and gameplay experience itself is wildly entertaining. I spent the first 5 hours playing the game trying to survive and onslaught of floods and even the odd tornado as a baby velo and ptera. It's terrifying. Constantly searching for higher ground when you're having to worry about your shelter, comfort, food, water -- even the risk of marine dinos coming to snatch you up when you're too close to the rising water. There's so much to do, even at such an early stage in the game. 

The maps, whilst there are only three, still hold so much to explore. You can't see it all from just one dino; the game encourages you to play the others so you can see the map from all aspects; underwater, underground in burrows, from the sky or just from the ground. And, if you like one server so much you want another dino there... but already have one on that server? Not a problem! You get multiple character slots, so you can grow multiple on the same server.

14,75306873,english,"[h1]This Game Actively Discourages New Players[/h1]

Don't get me wrong; I love this game. But new players are at a huge disadvantage, especially when attempting to join a more active server. Younger dinosaurs are smaller, weaker, and often times much slower than older dinosaurs, and those bigger dinos are often grouped together which makes trying to counter them much more difficult. 

There's no incentive for players to leave young dinos alone. In fact, I could argue that it is even encouraged to hunt down young dinos, as engaging in any sort of combat gives players an adrenaline bonus and hunt points, even when the young dino is too small to leave behind any food.

There is very little player interaction outside of your own group (granted that you're in one). The chat box and your various calls serve as the only practical, non-violent forms of engagement between ungrouped dinos. This leaves little opportunity for empathy to be formed with other players, and that leads to some horrible toxicity within the community.

I've seen one of my favorite servers completely die out due to a small group of players who have grown Megs to an insanely large size, and they were able to slaughter countless other dinos without any repercussions, many of whom were far younger and offered little to no food.

As cool as this game is, it largely favors long time players over new players, to the point that it's a detriment to new players wanting to get into the game. Since younger dinos can't feasibly defend themselves against older dinos (who are encouraged to hunt them), this game can become super frustrating. Older dinos should be given incentives to leave younger dinos alone, so everyone has a more fair chance to play.",1599017023,1599017023,False,8,1,0.59813082218170166,0,True,False,True,76561198150060192,57,1,27674,3498,17378,1602089836,,

Well... problem is exactly there, because big dino parents won't give you an egg, they save them for their clan member, or even for them and if you try to apply for one, they simply reject your request.

That is the only reason i would not recommend this game at this point in time. If this mechanic gets changed in the future i will consider updating my review. Until then, no i cannot recommend it.",1598894842,1598894842,False,1,0,0.525862038135528564,0,True,False,True,76561198020963244,112,17,41210,395,30962,1601575511,,

I really disagree with how the devs have been taking this game forward. I don't like that they are forcing a playstyle on the players, and that it's either be a super aggressive carnivore who has to constantly kill, or be food. Yes I do understand that this is a survival game but it's still a [i]game[/i] and should be fun for a variety of players.

Things like the famine patch, the fact that the devs really don't share what's going on with the game, and specific corrupt servers and players, just ruined this game for me.

I also heavily disagree with taking away everything for servers to gain support through donations. Don't get me wrong, keeping this game from being run by pay to win servers is perfectly fine, I just don't understand how private servers are going to keep running without being able to offer their community [i]anything[/i] for helping keep the server alive. 

[b]Original Review:[/b]

[b]Criticism:[/b]

I'm not going to lie this game is chocked full of bugs and crashes. This game is still Early Access and (as of a recent patch) has just had all of the coding switched to an updated version so I'm hoping these issue will be fixed soon. 

I also see lots of people complaining about other people on the game being in huge mega packs or killing for no reason etc etc, and yes this does happen and the best way I've found to go about not having to deal with these problems is to find a server that has rules against this kind of stuff. If you don't put in some effort to finding a good server that will help you have a fair game then I don't see why you're complaining.

The customization ability is absolutely amazing! You can choose abilities to go with your play style or just generally convenient talent points that makes surviving easier. The ability to use a full color wheel when making a skin lets you pick from a huge range of colors and whether you want to focus on having camouflage or just look nice. 

Dinosaurs have unique abilities as well to make them have individual perks to playing one over another, for example while a parasaur might not be the strongest creature, you can highlight a carnivore and warn everyone in the area of the danger all with the push of a button.",1554066907,1598886220,False,0,0,0.504098355770111084,0,True,False,True,76561198391314266,17,1,28094,1404,26123,1601852603,,

It's similar in some ways to other survival sims of its type; you have the usual food, water, stamina management, and dinosaur growth from youth to adult (and beyond, as in the case of Beasts of Bermuda).  This game complicates issues by throwing a few curve balls such as having to manage your animals stress, feed it a proper diet, and shelter it when appropriate.  On several occasions, flash floods and storms have sent me scrambling for cover, or fleeing from caves I thought would give good shelter when they, too, flood.  On the whole, surviving is a pretty tense and engaging experience.

The variety of animal you can play also helps to make the experience more varied than the usual fare; you can live as a purely aquatic creature and rule the oceans, weaving through hidden caverns underground to reach and prey upon unsuspecting thirsty animals.  Or you can be a beastie of the sky; flying is particularly satisfying.

Among the current selection of dinosaur survival games, this one'd definitely be my top pick.  It has some issues and some bugs, but overall it's a lot of fun.

63,74458197,english,The game is very much enjoyable at least at the start i will continue to play it to see how it goes but basically the main issue i have is the growth system you think The Isle Was a Looong time for growing well when u play this game and go back The isle Has nothing On here Basically a Rex on The isle takes 7 Hours But on here it will Take 8 Hours just to get an average 1.0 Rex but to get to 2.0 which alot of players are reaching 2.0 so if you want to survive you need to be 2.0 And let me tell you It will Take you 50-100 Hours To get a rex to 2.0 LIKE WHAT!!!!!! this is where this game suffers BADLY from if they want to allow you to have unlimited growth thats fine But the way its handled here is Horrible to Newer players You can all be in a pack If you all get to 1.0 and some1 else has 2.0 You Are underley Screwed that 2.0 Dino will Nearly kill u Within a few Hits and there is Not a dam Thing you can do The balance is horrible with this growth system and if you want to be a big dino You gotta PUT ur life AND SOUL into this game Forever Bottom line is EVEN if Your alright with Growing for 50-100 Hours ok But when you die welp there goes 100 Hours Try again and you can die very easily to cliffs and Apatos knocking you off cliffs this game would be fine with just 1.0 But when dinos het to the 2.0 or even 3.0 Ranged the server is doomed And the reason i hate this Soo much Is cause you cant even really get much expeience with fighting meaning you cant quickly redeem Yourself so you are gonna die mutiple times trying to be a Giant If you want to get the best experience from this game stay with small stuff STAY FARRR AWAY from Apex this game Till the growth is New Player Friendly,1597673022,1597673022,False,2,0,0.519522666931152344,0,True,False,True,76561198880795665,6,4,2790,0,1571,1600416119,,

Not to mention the weather changes, extinction floods and how it all is just brings a terrifying yet extremely exciting and rewarding feeling.

Combat in my opnion isnt the most ""Satisfying"", probably because of the way it feels a bit ""hit or miss"". It can feel a bit junky or not live up to the standards.

87,54520585,english,"(EDIT: Updating my review, as most of the improvements I was hoping for have been implemented now - great work devs! And added a few things related to what I've learned about the game since.)

Firstly, straight to the point - I have 700+ hours logged in The Isle, and I was curious if this game would be able to hold my attention. It definitely can, and the different systems that the game employs are wonderfully varied yet still balanced enough for a fun experience, even as this game is still in early access. I'm not sure I could go back to The Isle again without missing the multitude of customization options and features that BoB offers, as well as BoB's amazing PvE which includes surviving thunderstorms, massive floods, wind and rain. 

It's the little things in BoB that makes the game more than the sum of its parts for me: 

- It's the fact that there's so many abilities depending on the dino you play, as well as the talent-system and the talents you choose. The talent-system is upgrades done right - they're stat-buffs, but also new abilities that you can employ in game, and there's real and meaningful strategizing involved in choosing your talents, as they roll in slower once you reach a certain growth.

- It's the fact that the game detects when you're inside or outside of cover, and by how much. This sounds insignificant, but it offers a lot of change to how you'd normally play a game like this. It's the difference between being safe or at risk from the elements (as well as other dinosaurs), and it's a wonderful boon of exploring the map to find caves, nooks and crannies that offer this protection, and learning how to move between them as needed.

- It's the comfort system, which is an amazing system and an ingenious addition to the survival sim genre. Your main goal is to keep your dinosaur comfortable, and every choice you make in the game affects how stressed or comforted your dinosaur is. You'll have to choose between losing comfort by searching for food in a storm, or wait out the storm at the risk of starving. You'll have to choose whether to stay hidden from potential danger or lose comfort to being close to other dinosaurs that stress out your dino. Likewise, you can gain comfort from being near friends and family, eating certain foods and staying safe and dry. The comfort system is wonderful in that it doesn't prohibit you from doing anything you want - it just adds consequence to your choices over time.

- It's the way nesting works, with stress levels affecting the egg and subsequently the talents of the hatched player, in both good and bad ways, and how having the right talents goes a long way to hatching strong offspring, making coupling up that much more interesting and meaningful. 

- It's the way that you can fly, climb and swim, all which drastically change the way the game is played, the things you experience, and the places you can go. These game modes are work in progress and thus not without glitches, but overall I'd say they work surprisingly well, and I've yet to find anything to deter me from the fun I'm having climbing around as a velo, gliding for speed as a ptera and exploring underwater caves as a mosa.

- it's the way all these little mechanics work together, not just as they are, but with their inherent possibilities for the future of this game. Already I'm looking forward to the implementation of even more weather events, such as droughts, and the addition of even more dinosaurs. This may be the single most important aspect of any EA title - it's potential towards becoming a full game. And I see plenty of this potential in BoB.


Of course the game isn't perfect. The following points are things that don't take away from me having fun with the game, but are things I hope to see improved and which are good to know when deciding whether to get this game: 


-̶ ̶T̶h̶e̶ ̶l̶a̶c̶k̶ ̶o̶f̶ ̶p̶l̶a̶y̶e̶r̶s̶,̶ ̶a̶n̶d̶/̶o̶r̶ ̶s̶m̶a̶l̶l̶ ̶p̶l̶a̶y̶e̶r̶ ̶c̶o̶u̶n̶t̶ ̶o̶n̶ ̶t̶h̶e̶ ̶s̶e̶r̶v̶e̶r̶s̶.̶ ̶ Much improved! The newest map makes it easier to find people, and I currently play on a 100/100 slot server!

I've yet to test if skin customization on nested dinosaurs is still buggy, but all of it is workable.

- The sound design. It's workable, but there's definite room for improvement. Players in The Isle seem more keen on using their calls to communicate, and I believe it's because these calls are more to the point and of higher quality - it makes sense to use them as a shorthand. As an example, I'll compare the Utah friendly call in the Isle with the Velo friendly call in BoB. The utah friendly call is short, well-made and gets the point across. The Velo friendly call is a 3-4 second animation involving several sounds which, while cute and interesting, isn't all that good as a shorthand. The use of calls brings life to the game world, and it would be wonderful to hear more of the dinosaurs in BoB. Same goes for the ambient and effect sounds in BoB which could be more immersive, as many of them still feel rather 'stock'.

I could go further into describing the different talents, the aesthetic character customization (limitless colors and so many skins to choose from to each dinosaur), the food system and how the freshness of food plays a role...but I'll leave it at this, and let you all go on to discover these things for yourselves.

Addition: I've seen several people say that the general, colorful aesthetics turn them off the game, and in some cases makes it look like a kids game. To the first point I say, it's a matter of personal taste, and no, this game does NOT look like your realistic dino sim. In that regard it plays better if you think of it as a fantasy game with dinosaurs. To the second point, I'm a full grown adult and I've played this game with many other full grown adults. I don't get the impression that the game is played mainly by kids, more that it's a game for pretty much everyone. Plus some dinosaurs are surprisingly challenging to keep alive. If you need your realistic dinosaur sim fix as well, I'd say play this game and Path of Titans, and get the best of both worlds. :)

95,71063763,english,"The IDEA of this game is actually pretty cool. Players get to start as an itty-bitty dino and survive their way up to adult. There's a variety of foods to eat, a nesting and genetics system, talent tree with multiple branches, dope-ass storms that cause water levels to rise and fall, lakes/ponds that evaporate, and caves and oceans to explore. Playing as a flyer or an aquatic creature can actually be a lot of fun (sometimes). 

The graphics are pretty good, and the game and older dino models actually get updated frequently, which is a huge plus. Official servers are cool, but be careful about playing on unofficial servers. A lot of them have their own rules for what you can and can't do that you have to look up on a separate site.

Unfortunately, I just can't like this game after multiple sessions and hours of trying and really wanting to. It's fun while being broken in, but quickly loses its charm. 

Gameplay is tedious and the only reward to be had for growing big and stronk is the ability to ruin someone's day. It takes hoooours to grow anything to a viable size, and for a lot of it a player is more or less defenseless, especially if they are unable to find a group. Hiding is a must for most growing creatures. Which means hours of trying to smash yourself into weird places and doing nothing aside from occasionally managing hunger/thirst/air. I mean sure, you could be bold and explore and frolic, but as soon as you move your chances of being found and smushed go waaaay up. And that's a very bad thing because death is very punishing in this game: players lose their character and all progress. They retain nothing. Rinse and repeat and that's your game!

The PVP just doesn't feel satisfying, either. There is no collision and combat both feels and looks clunky. 

I honestly can't recommend this game. I bought it for four other people at once and all of them got some sort of combination of bored and frustrated for various reasons and stopped playing after a couple of sessions. 

I think Beasts of Bermuda would greatly benefit from adding other gameplay modes or tweaking survival. Maybe something along the lines of if a player loses in combat with another player they would still drop gore and respawn somewhere else on the map. But instead of having to start over a pvp loss would result in a small negative hit to genetics, and enough losses could add up in a big way to result in some sort of negative traits. Perma-death would still come from environmental factors and starvation/dehydration, with the addition of old age. I think this would make growing more fun and being an adult a more meaningful experience while making sure survival retains its edge, as well as promoting a more positive pvp experience among players.",1592637619,1597217931,False,36,4,0.746497273445129395,0,True,False,True,76561198384046106,15,2,6543,0,2745,1600404832,,

98,73237862,english,"Overall, this game is very entertaining and offers a lot of unique mechanics for a dinosaur sim. Things such as weather, talents, inherits, and abilities make's BoB's game play exciting and replayable. Although I would recommend this game, it does have it's flaws and it is up to the player if they want to invest in it in it's current state. 

PROS:

- Fun to play with friends (playing alone is still fun and viable)
- Insane level of skin customization
- Infinite growth (PRO and CON): Your dinosaur does not stop growing and this can be a great challenge to see how big you can grow. If you get lucky and reach big sizes you get very powerful and it is very rewarding to be that strong. Anything smaller than you is usually not a threat and when you are big, almost nothing can kill you. However, as you grow so does your hunger/thirst and this provides a challenge even at high growths.
- Most dinosaurs have special abilities to make them unique from each other
- Talent tree allows you to spec into a gameplay style suited to you
- Random inherits can give you an advantage or disadvantage over other's (PRO and CON)
- Complex nesting system: having children gives a growth buff to the parents, being nested has a chance to inherit the parent's talents, skin mixing provides unique skins, incest debuff discourages incest
- Offer's marine, airborne, and terrestrial playstyles
- Weather system is unique and provides a survival challenge not yet seen in other games of the same genre

Cons:

- AFK heavy at times (although the devs are working on making the game less reliant on this)
- Bugs/Glitches that can ruin the game at sometimes, however most gamebreaking ones get fixed rather fast
- Infinite growth: If you are new to a server or just want to spawn a new dino there is a good chance that you will die over and over again to people who have grown their dinosaurs to extreme sizes. On almost every server I have played on there has been people of every species who are way bigger than anyone and can basically not be touched. If you run into them, there is a good chance you will die as their stats are better than you in every way. This can be very frustrating for new players as it really makes trying to grow anything feel impossible. 
- Inherit system: When you spawn in, you have a chance to have positive/negative inherits. In my opinion, this system is very fun to mess around with, but can be very unfair. Positive inherits can give you a very big advantage over others, while getting negative inherits can ruin your experience by giving a disadvantage. You could spend a couple hours growing something only to get a negative in a stat that your dinosaur needs. It is up to you whether you want to live with that disadvantage, or just respawn your dinosaur. 

When your dinosaur is nested, you get a chance to have a ton of positive inherits while having a low chance for negatives. This can make certain dinosaurs ""OP"" as it makes them very powerful even at low growths. A nested dinosaur is usually a lot better than a spawn as they will usually have way more inherits. 

- Balance between dinosaurs is very fragile, infinite growth causes balance issues
- Can be hard to survive alone
- Disadvantage if you are not apart of the dominant groups
- Graphics need work
- No in-game recording system, usually need an outside program to record in case of rule breaks 

Conclusion: 

Beasts of Bermuda is a game that I have gotten a lot of enjoyment out of despite it's flaws. It is worth $20 in my opinion and even though it can be frustrating, it is a fun and unique experience at the time of this review. There is a lot coming to the game and the updates are coming fairly regularly.",1595642655,1597189164,True,23,1,0.697525143623352051,0,True,False,True,76561199020931070,7,1,18377,0,18082,1598339413,,

[i] I love this game, the mechanics are pretty nice, and I personally find the current graphics as a nice breath of air from the usual hyper realistic graphics everyone seems to be obsessed with nowadays. The roster of currently available dinosaurs are pretty diverse, containing 15 playable dinosaurs in total, with 2+ coming soon. The roster contains aquatics, semi-aquatics, herbivores, carnivores, and currently 1 flyer, with another in the works. [/i]

There's a lot more I could go on and on about, however, I'll keep the rest as a simple pros & cons list, with some side info.

[b] [u] Pros. [/u]

[/b] 

- A diverse selection of dinosaurs

- Many mechanics [i] (weather, comfort, stress, etc.) [/i]

- Developers are working hard to improve the game, and are quite friendly

- [i] Generally [/i] friendly community [i] (some servers are more toxic than others) [/i]

- Talent trees

- Isn't really such thing as a 'weak' dinosaur [i] (with the right builds, skill, and number of players, anything can be killed) [/i]

- Fully customizable skins

- Most dinosaurs have their own unique ability/purpose [i] (megs can see hp percentage, mosas can grab, kronos can lunge, etc.) [/i]

- The graphics, despite what many seem to believe, [i] can [/i] be beautiful

- Game breaking bugs usually don't last long


[b] [u] Cons. [/u]

[/b] 

- The graphics aren't very up to date

- Game isn't the most polished, usually CPU heavy and a strong gaming computer is recommended [i] (it's mostly the shadows and shaders; turns those to 'none' and 'low' and you should be good. Also, try giving it more resource priority via Task Manager) [/i]

- The animations can look odd on some dinosaurs

- The 'infinite growth' mechanic can cause some issues with the ecosystem, even with the severe loss of growth speed as one gets bigger past 1.2 growth.

- Gameplay can rely heavily on having lots of free-time [i] (those with lots of free-time can find themselves with a huge dinosaur, and those with not as much free-time have trouble competing with them) [/i]

- Not the most beginner-friendly, you'll likely be asking for help within your first couple days of playing

As an early access title there's still plenty of time and room for the developers to tweak the major weak points of the game, its pacing and user interface.

With several keys having major impact on gameplay, it would be useful if some indicator to when these have been pressed would do away with a learning curve to aspects of the game that just should not exist.

The ""6"" key turns on auto walk, useful for a game in which traversing the beautiful landscape will most likely take up the majority of your gameplay when you aren't walking.

The ""I"" key turns off group icons, leading you to lose track of your herd/pack/teammates at inopportune times and wondering if you've been booted from the group.

[strike]The ""P"" key turns on screenshot mode, which in effect makes it impossible for your character to move with any coherent direction. Some indicator in the UI would vastly help these stumbling blocks to the controls become complete non-issues.[/strike]  This UI issue has since been resolved.

Shadow quality being set to anything other than none renders aquatic gameplay impossible as tunnels become amorphous black voids on one's screen, and any reasonably coloured creature becomes impossible to trace.

The gameplay loop consists of spawning in as a juvenile dinosaur, or as an egg from a player character that has made it to adulthood. Nested spawns are more powerful on paper, but at the cost of spending a literal hour in a state that is incapable of exploring, defending itself, or surviving. To be honest, being a fresh spawn is absolutely no different. All gameplay settles into waiting for your character to grow, maintaining several resources to make said character grow faster, under the promise that eventually you'll be able to actually survive a hostile encounter with another player. This is, essentially, a matter of luck and waiting. Combat is clunky, with no feedback if you're doing it right, and the game's biggest selling point, the ""comfort"" resource, rapidly diminishes the moment this pile of coding approaches a game.

If you are looking for a game about dinosaurs fighting, keep looking. Long wait times for growth, slow movement speed,  cumbersome combat, resource management with poor reward mechanics and more ruin a gameplay concept that every person has ever fantasized about: playing a dinosaur in an open world, and getting into battles to the death with other dinosaurs.

Update as of approximately 240 hours of gameplay: After attempting to surmount this game's considerable learning curve, and seeing gameplay on more populated servers, I can say that this game improves slightly under the conditions of the server one plays on, or if you have a group that you can consistently join up with, however, balance issues pertaining to several species and the map itself keep the gameplay very static.",1591747081,1596910425,False,1,0,0.496688753366470337,0,True,False,True,76561198053464420,107,3,28457,4352,1567,1602050588,,

The game itself is wonderful, the mechanics are great, the textures are awesome, the customization is wonderful, the only thing I think the game itself needs a little work on is hitboxes, as they tend to be rather big and a little wonky, and animations, which is purely a visual thing, and possibly more objectives than just ""have babies! grow!"" being the only real objectives. However. The community and servers that are currently available, make the game almost unplayable, or extremely boring, without much in between.
-
Now since that's out of the way.
There are very few large servers, 3-4 at peak times have 100-125 players each. All of these servers have extremely strange, unforgiving, and somewhat difficult to follow correctly, rules, that aren't actually part of the game, but the community itself. In my opinion, the only real ""rules"" a dinosaur game such as this one should have, is no mix packing, and pack limits. However, when you involve things like body down, mix packing, baby snatching, egg snatching, gore protection, territory claiming, etc, this game gets almost unplayable. I'm going to try and do this from the perspective of an herbivore, and a carnivore for better understanding.
If you're an herbivore, life's pretty okay, you can claim your territory, with most servers have 9-14 other members in your herd, and just have a great time with them. However, if a carnivore approaches, with most server rules you have to warn, step away, or threaten them to a fight instead of simply running, or standing your ground and immediately protecting your territory. 
As a carnivore, the games completely different. Say you're starving and happen upon a small herd as a large rex or meg, you decide to kill a few of them to fill up your hunger before moving on. But whoa there bucko! The server rules say you can only kill One of them, and then you have to wait between 3 and 5 minutes before you can attack another. You have to stay with your gore, and protect it during that time. I don't know about you but that doesn't seem like something an actual wild animal would do. 
There are so many rules on PVP in this game that it just genuinely makes the game un-fun.  and a lot of the time the rules aren't followed, or aren't enforced, with little inbetween. Either half the server doesn't follow them and the admins don't care, or half the server Does follow them and the admins still chew them out over extremely tiny things, like only calling twice instead of three times before engaging, or using caps in global chat.
I've had instances where multiple pteras were harassing me, following me around, breaking several rules, but they got nothing and were defended because the admins were friends with them, and I've gotten instances where I did something very similar to a lesser degree, on the Same server, and got banned for it.
I'm not here to complain about being banned from a server that had rules written like a lawfirm intentionally writing them in a way that made them difficult to follow, I'm here to say the community makes this game extremely difficult to play. The only servers that have a player base whatsoever, have rules that make it so even more of your time in the game is just laying around in one spot. Because theres so many rules on territories, migrating as a herd, roaming as a solo, rules for scavengers, rules for carnivores, rules for herbivores, rules for gore you find laying around, rules for being """"too friendly"""" or """"not friendly enough"""", rules for people that do or don't have scents, following herbivores for too long, etc. Not to mention most of them being so vague it's hard to tell if you broke the rules or the guy you were fighting did.
-
I would certainly say this game was far more playable once there are better community servers, or even official servers with an actual player base and less rules. This won't stop me from playing it, but I don't recommend buying it unless you're aware, and prepared, for how boring it might be to deal with rules about every little detail with how you play the game. I will edit this review to be positive if the game gets better servers, or single player with AI creatures to fight.

The good :  for the good there is alot like the skill tree where you can go survial where  you won't die from stress and wont need food as much but with speed and damage you can become faster or stronger in fights.The aquatics and flyers are really cool  like for example the ptera is a fish and eats fish and can steal eggs from herbivores like parasaur and apato groups and kronosaurus can dart with its second attack ability   darting it into its pray for massive damage .Floods and storms are awsome they can boost growth  but cause the map to flood for 1 hour put there are even  stronger floods that can engulf almost all of the map these are called  extinction storms .



the bad. the growth system is real flawed  due to its seemless growth  and  balancing aint the best . growth is cool but there is no limit  and the bigger the dinosaur gets  more food it needs causing it too (for carnis ) go on a killer rampage  for food which causes smaller dinos to stay small and the balancing is garbage im just going to say it here  a apatosaurus a neally 75 tonne sauropod dies to a turkey sized rapter , a trex can  can murder any megalo no matter what size it is the rex will just destory it  apato will destorydue to its hixbox unless a velo because its a fucking velo

51,47794402,english,"In the past my review was very Negative. That being because of how buggy literally everything was. Since I have repurchased this game, I can honestly say that it has tremendously improved.

The game is very fun, literally a week has gone by after purchasing and I was still discovering new features, mechanics etc. day after day. I would actually go as far as to say that it has actually impressed me and this game stands very well with it's competitors.

The only 2 bad things I would have to say about this game besides the cannibalism is, how brutal and punishing death is... Understandably you get what you pay for but I've never understood grinding 2-3-6 etc. hours of play time when on the other hand it only takes a few seconds to delete all of that progression away, it's a mechanic that almost seems like you don't want people to play your game :)

The second OP being the nesting system, if your a new player and you think like myself that you can jump in and just grow your character from the selection screen well your kinda wrong, you can do it sure but it's much smarter to get nested in because you can get powerful/helpful boost in many of your stats which of-course will rely on the stats that your nesters have. That being a major factor of this game it kinda becomes the situation where, your more powerful if you know the right people. 

However this community has one of the most respectful and open armed people I've ever seen on any game before, so even though there are no tutorials or immediate tips/tricks, the global chat is almost instinctively on any question you have, so that has had a huge impact on my experience with this game, because it's easy to meet nice people and just have a good time and in almost any case but to make it relevant, the community pretty much makes the game.

Imo BoB is the more fun game, because the survival mechanics are a bit more in depth, and there is an RPG aspect with skill trees that allows you to customize your gameplay more and gives you some end game goals to work for, where as in the Isle once you are fully gown there is not an actual inherent benefit from keeping that dinosaur alive any longer. In BoB you will continue to get stronger, and earn skill points as you age even after you are fully grown, but you also must work harder to keep yourself fed and satisfied. Though, on the official servers there is no actual growth limit, so this can cause some players to become way OP. BoB is also not as visually immersive or realistic, as the Isle. The graphics feel much more cartoony and a lot less polished. The textures, models, and animations are not as detailed and it can cause a loss of immersion, but I feel that the gameplay mechanics really outweigh this downside for me.

I tend to play on a few chill servers at the moment, which is both great- you won't get killed after spending several days growing. However it's also boring. Nothing to keep you on your toes, you just eat, drink. Maybe wonder around a bit and chat with everyone else. Half the time i'm barely playing the game, just afking and going on the internet. But at least my beautiful dino i spent what feels like four million hours growing shouldn't die.

On the not chill servers....... it's hit or miss. If you manage to snag an egg then your chances of survival are so much better. You'll have parents and possibly older siblings to care for you. You'll be in a nice group who'll look after you and not wondering around on your own as a baby dino that cannot protect itself against anything larger than it. If you do end up on your own, you might be okay till your bigger, especially if you do manage to find a group to take you in. But your almost as likely to find a group who'll kill you. Depends how active the server is at the time. Sometimes i've played for a while on my own, other times not.

But honestly, i think i have probably met more friendly people than not friendly people. Or maybe i was just lucky.",1581090425,1594939004,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True,76561198029114255,59,10,13083,0,1992,1599864069,,

69,72527041,english,"TLDR: After ""several"" hours of playing this game over a year, sadly I have to give it a NEGATIVE, due to only one problem:

[b]The developers refuse or unable to fix the only major problem in this game: [spoiler]the toxic servers/admins[/spoiler][/b]

----------------------------------------------------------------------
While the game itself gives a wonderful environment to walk/swim/fly/eat/nest as a dino, this immerse experience will fade once you play more and more. Due to an inability (or intended?) decision from devs, as the only server options are the following:

[u]1. if you want EU ping (lower than 200):[/u]
- Russian servers, where you get killed/exiled just because you can't speak russian
- Empty servers to experience the environment just by yourself
- And toxic servers, which comes with or without rules, aka [b]loopholes[/b]. These are made by server-owners to overwrite the game-mechanism for their own taste (hunt limit, pack size, mixpack, etc). While server-rules have good intentions, they are mostly made in a shady way with several loopholes, which benefits to the side what admins choose. This can be really-really situational, but as you know, the house always wins. If admins says their friend not rule broke, then they did not, and you can piss off, no mater what your lawyer says. If you kill an admin or his/her friend, you will be targeted by a ""mixpacked"" or ""boost growed"" group, just close enough to not ""break a rule"" and hunt you - and just you - down. This won't end even if your dino is dead and you make a new one. Your name will be a target just because you pissed off the ""maffia"". If you had this problem, then you know which servers I talk about. And just to not stop here, if you know what direct/indirect Pay2Grow means, then you know which servers I talk about. They ignore and support unfair gameplay for own fun, causing terrible social-environment in game, and if any problem comes up in chat, it just getting pushed to ""post it on discord and leave from global"". Try to resist or say anything against it, you are free to leave ""their"" server AKA banned.

[u]2. if you are fine without EU ping (200 and above):[/u]
- Teleporting AKA ""rubber-banding"" dinos. Bite twice, damage none. Ofc, no real help with this, ""just record it"", report it, wait few days/weeks for a ""review"", and might or might not you get back your dino, just to die like as you did before. And I not even mentioned those proxy/VPN chineese players with minimum 500 ms ping. You see something heading to you, then you see your health jump to half from nowhere, and suddenly now those guys are behind you.
- Don't be silly. Do not think toxic servers are just with EU ping, but now with extra latency.
[u]3. bonus option:[/u]
- Make your own server and pay monthly fee to play alone! Because who would play on a new/weird server where there is no corrupt admin. Don't joke with me.


As long as the developers not take out the control from admins how their game should be played, whom are responsible for toxic environment, I [u]do not[/u] recommend to buy this game.",1594507198,1594512034,False,13,1,0.618198752403259277,3,True,False,True,76561198987079439,6,3,38745,0,37667,1599586880,,
70,72529350,english,"When I initially started playing this game, I found myself in awe of the mechanics and fun gameplay it provided. In contrast to it's competitors, Beasts Of Bermuda provided those things we all wanted, but unfortunately, it has one thing sorely lacking for  it; 
Community. I have never in my life seen such a toxic community in one game. 
Whereas The Isle certainly gave me a run for my money, this game is on whole other level.
This game has some kind of potential, but it needs multiple dinosaurs to be rebalanced.

If you are to be playing this game, please look for chill servers unless you want to be surrounded by nothing but utmost toxicity. Steer clear of Lost Beasts. While a popular server, the admins appear to be nothing but tools to the clans or main killers who rule the servers. In the pursuit to cause less drama, they have created a server that is nothing but a complete circlejerk of admins patting the worst people on the back, and people getting on their knees and sucking the dicks of said admins and horrible people. If you speak out against the wrong people on servers like this, the entire chat will turn on you, beginning to call you names and act incredibly childish. Let my mistake of allowing myself to play on a server like that be a lesson to everyone else. 

If you are going to buy this game, do extensive research on whatever server you enter and avoid all servers without rules/semi rulefree servers. The freedom they offer players are nothing but a cheap lie, and giving them even a second of your time is too generous. 

Apart from the horrible community, this game runs horribly slow. Despite owning a gaming rig, my computer gets way too hot, in comparison to when I run a game like The Isle, which has significantly better 3D models and improved graphics. 
Currently I would say a lot of issues lie in this game. The infinite growth system- While fun, promotes small groups of people growing giant dinos they can use to essentially bully all dinosaurs not in their friend group into submission. 
If one group is ruling a server with mosas, then mosas are unplayable unless you are part of that friendgroup. 
The same goes with multiple other dinosaurs. It needs to be looked at. An interesting concept, but I really think you should be able to max out your dinosaurs in less time, and have less worry about your size. Time spent should pay off, but if your payoff makes you unbeatable to anyone who has not managed to grow bigger than you, it makes the game impossible for new players, should admins not wipe the servers. 

It really comes down to ""who spawned first"".
To summarize, this game currently has three issues: 

A quite toxic community.

A growth system which promotes toxicity and group ruling.

They even add user made skins and do events for special shimmer skins.

It's a bit stressful worrying about losing a creature you have spent weeks on growing, but if you have a good community/server with great rules and mods, then it's really just fun to hang out with and make new friends. I've seen a lot of people complain about the ""cartoon"" like design of some of the dinos, but honestly I think it adds to the charm.

You'll fall and break your legs, or get caught in a storm, get drowned by a sea creature, get gobbled up by a carnivore, or just get stomped on by a big herbivore what didn't like the look of you. And you'll notice that your dinosaur is permanently dead. And you'll be sad.

The next 10+ dinosaurs you make all go the same way. Play for a bit, get killed by something, start from scratch. Again and again. Sometimes it's a pack you simply could not hope to beat. Sometimes they talk smack in chat about it afterward. Sometimes you get angry and log off for the day. But it's overall a fun and tense experience, as long as you can be chill about perma-death.

And if you accept that this is your fate, on maybe the 15th attempt you manage to get into a pack yourself. Now you have the safety of numbers, and your dinosaur starts to get big. And pretty soon people are running from you, and now you're having a really fun and unique experience you can't get in most other games.

Overall, Beasts of Bermuda is pretty good. But it's one of those games that is (so far) unapologetic about being inaccessible and user-unfriendly.

------------

You're expected to invest time into improving your creatures skills and to breed with other players to get a lineage of animals with better skills.. But the developer has decided that having character profiles is not something this game needs, forcing its player base to make multiple steam accounts. Not only that, but upon getting your hard earned OP creature, you will end up being too scared to fight. Why would you want to die now when you've sunk in 5+ hours on this creature? Especially since you're set back to wild spawn stats once you die, with no way to get back anything you earned. The creatures are all incredibly slow except for a few, even the 'speedy' creatures feel quite slow and clunky. The models and animations are.. models and animations. There's nothing special about them and they all resemble something out of a bad phone port game of the same genre. They don't look horribly ugly, but theyre not very pretty either, with a lot of the animations being very unpolished and awkward.

Overall, The game is not developed enough or polished enough for me to recommend it. I tried, I put the time in, I wanted to like it.. but the game makes itself hard to like. Money well spent I suppose.",1571256425,1593265309,False,23,2,0.639634191989898682,2,True,False,True,76561198018343501,168,6,4017,0,1942,1593430719,,

4,57443701,english,"Can't recommend the game in it's current state, it's quite buggy and the graphics are really hideous.

Pros:
Good price
Couple hours of fun gameplay at least
Lots of interesting people to meet and talk with
Interesting weather system that I haven't seen in other games

Cons:
Often a lot of hackers (a lot more then I see in other games of this genre)
Bad graphics
Bad animations
Buggy UI and game in general (you can lose your progress and growth by just logging in)
Slow updates
Takes a bit too long to grow
Most servers are a toxic mess

Conclusion:
I'd say if you really like this genre then this game *might* be worth full price. I'd suggest waiting for a sale though, or a good update that patches most of the bugs. As for the animations, if you're really fussy about that kind of thing don't get this game I'd suggest Saurian or The Isle for graphics and animation.

In reality a hit from any of the other dinos would insta kill that little rat, I understand the attempt to balance it and i know its not reality, but there is literally forum after forum of how velo is to OP and ruins the game. Its currently broken and not balanced at all, its a scavanger not a fighter there is no need for it to be able to kill anything short of maybe pteras and other velos, but rexes, apas or w.e it see's..... Come on now, please balance this asap. The flying rat (Ptera) is incredibly weak because it is a SCAVANGER, so why is the land rat so strong?

53,70264217,english,"TL:DR; i usually dont make serious game reviews but this is by far the best dinosaur creature simulator game out there rn (IN MY OPINION, OBVIOUSLY, THIS CAN CHANGE IN THE FUTURE) if you can get past the ""cartoony"", colorful graphics (which i personally dont mind, you dont have to be brightly colored if you dont want to) and occasional drama between children who probably play the game all day and never log off lol Beasts of Bermuda has great game mechanics for its genre which will never leave you mindlessly afking in a bush for hours on end, i strongly recommend this game if youre looking for a break from the isle or interested in refreshing, interactive game play from the dinosaur role-play game genre

pros: weather/natural disaster system (tornadoes, floods, lightning storms as of this review), the nesting system is absolutely fantastic and feels rewarding at times as both parent and baby, TALENTS (FINALLY, A REASON TO GROW FOR REAL TIME HOURS ON END IN A CREATURE SIM), flying and aquatic game play that has decent and pretty fun controls, buff/debuff system which can boost/hinder your dino's quality of life forcing you to actively seek out fresh food or herbs to keep up comfort, some dinosaurs have combat abilities (sai or anky has a shield reflection ability that reflects bite damage back to the attacker for example) which makes combat more interesting, active developers with an active discord that posts development updates 

cons: this community loves drama and making a big deal out of their pixel dinosaur dying so be prepared for toxicity as always, there arent a lot of active servers (maybe ~4-6 active servers with at least above 40 people on the daily) and you may see many of the same faces which could be a negative thing with the somewhat toxic player base, again this game is relatively new and thus lacks a lot of graphical and audio polish so if youre looking for ultrarealistic dinosaur simulator 2020 id suggest finding a different game lol, also no allosaurus in game yet come on devs, pls <3",1591234845,1591234845,True,6,2,0.558657288551330566,0,True,False,True,76561198040981157,83,4,16109,1104,7339,1602056889,,

60,69932206,english,Honestly I tried this game a long time ago. Played for like an hour was not too keen and put it back down kept playing the isle. More recently I installed it again to give it another go and I’m glad I did. What it lacks in let’s say graphics compared to The Isle as let’s face it that’s what people will compare it to it makes up in so much more in depth. The isle might be prettier to look at but BoB has more of a soul. There is weather. Not talking ow it’s raining or sunny. The weather actually matters. There are floods droughts. Your favourite water hole might dry out and force to to move a very long way. You might have to share a cave at top a mountain with other species as there is an extinction flood happening. Your spend hours messing about with the traits even making multiple dinos of the same species not one being the same in colour and stats due to the traits you pick. The game also rewards you for staying alive. The longer you live the more you grow and traits you unlock. Then those of you who like breeding. Your offspring inherit your stats/colours making your kids potentially stronger then yourself and so on so forth making breeding very important especially multiple generations down. But be carful of incest. Yes that’s a thing. There is also so much more also. Honestly I can’t praise this game enough. The only bad thing for some is the slightly silly at times skins like unrealistic and maybe the map being a little too colourful or harder to see far compared to let’s say the isle.

Pros:
+ Introduces some cool gameplay mechanics, including talent trees and natural disasters
+ Highly customizable skins
+ Textures don't look bad on high settings
+ Maps are fun to explore

Cons:
- Not actually a game yet
- P2W servers turn into P2P servers, making the game unenjoyable 
- Generally toxic community (lots of favoritism, from both game devs and server admins)
- No tutorial, not even a basic one like The Isle has
- Lighting system is very wonky, and can be hard on the eyes
- Little to no foliage/environment, making hiding very hard
- Players can use gamma to combat the wonky lighting, making hiding VERY hard
- Reported/Known bugs from over a year ago are still unfixed
- Grossly unbalanced combat/growth systems, leading to close knit groups of mass murder apexes

BoB is a brightly colored game that introduces some cool concepts and ideas, but unfortunately, it tends to fall short everywhere else.  BoB is nowhere near balanced enough to be an actual game, and in all honesty, the only fun I've had on BoB has been on peaceful servers where everyone is generally friendly.

BoB has an unlimited growth system, meaning that if you grind hard and long enough, you can get dinosaurs of ungodly size and potential.  Combine this with growth/comfort/nesting boosts from being in large groups, and you have a recipe for disaster.  Across the PvP servers, you run into groups of apex players (mostly close friends in VC) who spend their time grinding for growth and purging servers, killing off anything and everything they can catch.

For reference, a Pteranodon reaches 1.2 (adult) in about 2 hours with high comfort and stats.  A Mosa reaches 1.2 in about 10 hours. After 1.2, dinosaurs grow the same rate (godawfully slow), meaning after 1.2 it takes literally hundreds of additional hours to get to growths like 2.0 and 3.0, both of which I see far too often on popular servers. Imagine being a new player to the game, and being pitted up against that.

This also means that dying can cost you not just a few hours of progress, but HUNDREDS of hours of progress.  The stakes are a little higher now, no?

Dinosaur tiers are already very unbalanced anyway, with apexes being grossly OP, meaning a group of 3-4 large apexes is basically untouchable.  Most players, even veterans, have no chance against these groups, as it takes WEEKS, MONTHS of dedicated growth and playtime in order to even get close to their size and potential.  At least when I play The Isle, I know that once I'm a full grown rex (about 7 hours growth) I am at least evenly matched with any other full grown rex in size and strength.  On BoB?  You will never surpass that 3.0 rex, bud, and definitely not that group of four 2.0-3.0 rexes.  Sucks to suck, doesn't it?

Overall, it's a fun game if you want to play on a small, peaceful server with some friends.  The maps have some interesting areas to explore, including vast cave systems both above and underwater.  Skins are hugely customizable, and it can be enjoyable sitting around and nesting people in just to see the different combinations of skin colors and dinosaur inherits.  I plan to keep casually playing it and see where the development goes.

If you are looking for a balanced dinosaur survival game, however, with good playability and fair combat, then I'm sorry to say that is definitely not this game, at least not right now.

The basic idea of the game is very interesting, I mean who wouldn't enjoy a game where you get to be the dinosaur, grow and obtain skills, etc.? There is unfortunately a number of reasons of what I hope a potential customers being aware before purchasing this game. However just like any game it is perfect and understandably will have problems of its own. Which I wish to explain within this preview to hopefully help potential customers before buying and launching the game the first time.

1) There is no proper tutorials about explaining the talent tree system and many players, will get easily overwhelmed by the amount of icons appearing in the screen. Understandably the first five attempts will be the causes of a player choosing the wrong skills; many players do not realise the importance of [i]wheather resistance[/i], which is the most common cause of death. Unfortunately even if you did add 1 point into weather resistance, you are not guaranteed to survive if you spawn in the middle of a storm. This inexperience is not helped by various numbers of communities, who are generally very unforgiving for first-time players and new members in general.

2) The game has quite a lot of old bugs that have yet been fixed after months. While many compare this game being better than other dinosaur games, such as The Isle that is far more demanding with graphic cards regarding higher detail in its environment. Beasts of Bermuda trades it for lower detail with more talent and customization features. Do not take me wrong, as an early access game it is understandable to experience variety of bugs, I'm simply trying to say that there still exists almost year old bugs within the game, that have yet to be fixed and corrected in order for the game to perform better.

3) May 2020: penalties of using admin commands and community restrictions. With the most recent update arriving in May 2020 that is supposed to feature a new systems into the game, the developers announced new rules that bans Beast of Bermuda communities from trading in-game goods in exchange of currencies and Discord points. Server admins will have most of their admin commands removed and will no longer be able to growth boost others, without causing player penalties to breeding and inherits. This in resulting communities no longer being able to host events that would involve in-game goods, such as growth boosts, special skins, etc. Most servers being punished by this effect are supposed chill (PVE) servers, that used to be the first recommendation for first-time players to join, so they could get to know the game and talent trees. This is just my personal opinion but trying to forcefully restrict communities and thus, every single player to play a game in an exact same style is not healthy in the long run of things. Especially if you have to make methods for prevent certain types of servers from appearing at all.

4) I personally have not had had bad experiences with the developers, thought I have heard and witnessed couple bad performances from them. What goes to official Discord staff and other community servers thought could be further argued. Some official Discord staff pick and choose favourites. This includes some testers being treated poorly and even bullied out of the testing team. As I stated earlier most communities are not welcoming to new and first-time players. You are often made fun of and sometimes even in the official Discord, some people will purposely make you feel stupid for asking what certain feature does.

[h1]Overall View[/h1]
Despite having its issues in both game and player base, I do still think that Beasts of Bermuda has a lot to offer. It is a decent product and has a lot to discover, even if there is yet to see any lore related features or traits. While I do not personally recommend the game until it has received more attention with performance and bug repairs. I can understand and appreciate the game for what it is. If you want to walk around gathering food and waiting to receive new talent points, so you do not die from weather and other phenomenon, the game still reminds you of other players still being a threat to you as well. I do have to note that I particularly like the alliance and enemy statistics, where a carnivore of a different species cannot group together without admin commands.

Beasts of Bermuda has lots of room to grow and while its not the game for me at its current state. I'm sure and happy that some other people can find enjoyment from it for hours on end.

[b]Background[/b]
I wanted to support this game from its inception. The developers' receptivity to their community - well, community leaders - was promising as someone coming from The Isle. I purchased this game 1 January, 2019, meaning I have been patient and optimistic (less so of the latter as of late) with its development for 1.334 years now.

[b]OBSERVATIONS[/b]
[u]I have neither seen any considerable progress in the stability nor ""playability"" of the game. Bugs and exploits over 6+ months old remain in the game (despite frequent reports of them, including many from myself during my time as a tester) and the inexperience is often glaring. There are periods the game will crash servers and the development team does not know the cause. The time at which I am posting this is the beginning of another one of said time periods.[/u]

[b]Opinions[/b]
- Any game with ""classes"", more specifically apex predators, purposefully stronger and unbalanced against those not considered apex predators, is bad design for what is essentially a competitive PvP-survival game.  While I can understand them dealing more damage, their lack of weaknesses shows as they typically overrun servers.
- I have kept this private until now, but quit the tester team due to the haughty-hostile attitude of certain testers who seem to feel themselves staff towards players considered ""beneath"" them (i.e. not testers) that was and continues (up until this review) to be left unchecked or brushed off. Why this is, I do not know.
+ The intricate customization is nice for creating your own perfect creature skin.
- Pay to win servers were not strictly forbidden. Instead, development went in the direction of destroying all nesting events. Let me stress that in this game, P2W becomes P2P. If you have not purchased Growth, you are at a disadvantage to those who have bought Growth increases. From what I have observed, P2W/P2P groups actively hunt down those smaller than them (naturally), which is an issue when their PvP power is not genuine. In other words, if you do not purchase Growth you are guaranteed PvP loss in these servers. Servers with more healthy play styles slowly die out as those who have invested money in P2W/P2P feel obliged to play where they have spent money, even if they do not enjoy said server anymore.
+ I still prefer it over the more-popular The Isle game, simply due to the existence of more game play mechanics and a variety in play style (i.e. playable aquatic creatures).

[b]I have lost my patience, but perhaps you are willing to lend yours. For how long, I cannot say. I only hope this game improves as the complex gameplay still has the ability to entertain me, however frustrated I may be.[/b]

91,67993843,english,"The game is full of high school bully victims sitting on discord voice chat with each other. This applies to most admins as well, they're usually friends with those people and protect them by banning people they dislike or by simply giving them already grown dinos. This is how the game looks:

I join a server and pick a dino. I roam around map to look for water, food, maybe some flowers for faster growth. Of course the chat is full of those people sucking up to the admins. And I can see herd full of large, cross species dinos. (which isn't meant to happen, there's a stress mechanic for that reason) Those are the teamers abusing game mechanics to get an advantage over you. Since my friend was with them, I find a shelter to rest nearby and try to be friendly, I alt tab to watch something while my dino grows. I come back a bit bigger, get food and rest again. After an hour one of them starts messing with me in a ""friendly"" way, because this is THEIR game. They need to power trip in a virtual world since they got bullied IRL. Ofc I told him to stop and he got offended? I walked away from them, but a bird from their pack starts flying up to me and starts biting me like a spiteful loser he is. I bite him back and leave them. I do the usual food, rest, alt tab and repeat because this game is so boring. The next day I find out that my friend with a large dino (who was friendly with them for a long time) was killed, because of ME saying a mean word to one of people in their group. Lmao. On top of that the admins were bragging about reading people's private messages. Fun.

This is literally the whole game and every server is like that. You afk and watch youtube for hours to grow your dino. Then you waste all that time after getting killed because you weren't submissive to a random furry on the server. Combat? Good luck finding anyone that's not a large dino and isn't in a big group. You don't even stand a chance against one of them since they are so big. They spent whole days or weeks growing it. Lots of servers offer dino growth for irl money as well or they will force you to join their discord with point shops. Those point shops use currency you earn from typing ""!work"" on a specific channel every some time or you get it from ""contests"" if admins like you enough. Why would I want to buy a game, then have to grind text commands on some discord server every 2 hours for weeks just so I am not completely behind? Those shops offer dino growth or already nested dinos with buffed stats which give you a huge advantage. Another thing is that you are REQUIRED to record at all times if you want to be safe from rule breakers. Admins will tell you to ""record it next time"" if you report anything. So if you can't do that then prepare to be treated like a second class player. And it's about easy stuff like your own herd killing you or spawnkilling which should be easy to log.

Rain can quickly turn into floods as you and other players online scramble to stay on dry ground. Lack of rain can turn into droughts, that make water increasingly more rare, forcing players to trek across the map to to compete for dwindling water sources.

26,67331255,english,"Beasts of Bermuda (or BoB as I will call it in this review) has its charms and is by no means a bad game. But I would not say it is an amazing game either, nor would I pay the full price for it. I also do not think I would entirely un-recommend this game, but the limitations of Steam do push that narrative. I'll give a brief history of my understanding on how people are taking to the game, but that is not going to be the core of this review. 

There is a whole other essay I can write about why assuming products in a genre are inherently inferior due to a lack of, or addition of, content is, generally, a massive simplification of what is often a very nuanced and complicated issue especially taking different development teams and their personal situations and history into consideration, but this is not the place for it. It is important to look at these products standing on their own two feet rather than comparing them as a means to try and sell one as better or worse than the other. Preferences aside, I'm going to be looking at BoB as a standalone product for the rest of this review, rather than try and compare it to other titles of the genre (for better or worse) to remain as fair to all sides as possible. 

So. BoB has a rudimentary stress system, weather, and drumstick carrying. Cool. These are all well and good. But when one's only take on why BoB is a superior product is due only to the fact it has more mechanics is shortsighted at best as one has to take into account the flaws as well. These features are very obviously rushed, tacky, and in some aspects surface-level. Beyond some cool quirks and features, it is very difficult to enjoy solo and becomes very boring, very fast. The animations are janky, optimization is poor, and it can be quite frustrating losing a dinosaur you spent weeks growing to a mosasaurus who decided to jump into orbit with you in its jaws, then drop you while you are utterly helpless. This is a survival game and you should expect to die and be frustrated. This is not a dinosaur FeralHeart. But it is silly to assume these odd situations would not warrant a bit of criticism on account of how balance functions in the game.

Once again, BoB is not a bad game. But it is not a fantastic game, either.

So, what does BoB do well? For a game that's still trying to find its footing, the models are not all that bad. I dislike some minor things (their Allosaurus having a massive bulging vein running through it, and the new Utahraptor having some oddly placed foot feathers) about their art, but as a standalone product, they are far from the worst in the world. This is not a strictly realistic game and I'm of the opinion that if you can make it mesh well with the aesthetic of your game, you should be free to take creative liberties and I feel BoB has a fairly decent foundation with this. Their raptors are sufficiently feathered for mainstream media, and many of their animals are also pretty nice and meaty. Are they perfect? No, but not an utter abomination against nature either. The remodels from some older creatures are looking promising, as well.

In addition, BoB comes with a large skin customization system that allows for limitless color choices. Yes, this means you will see neon dinosaurs running about, if that is not your cup of tea then perhaps this is not the game for you. I personally think it's nice to have a degree of freedom, but I don't especially enjoy having to look at creatures people make for the express purpose of being an eyesore on account of personal health problems that exacerbate my irritation with it. Not a total dealbreaker to be sure, but there is a point where I feel limits should be in place to give a more user-friendly and accessible experience. 

There is an interesting, if basic, ""class"" system in place that allows you to pick perks based on your desired playstyle. You can be a battleship or an endurance runner. Breeding allows you to combine perks to make a very strong animal as well, giving a bit of purpose to nesting. You can carry eggs and babies around but only as static props. Sniffing lets you see what build other players spec into based on the color they appear as, allowing you to pick your battles more wisely.

Weather is also a major part of gameplay and is honestly the one thing that makes me favor BoB over other survival games out there, simply for how absurd it is. You can have upwards of four tornadoes at once, lightning strikes that will kill you if you do not have shelter, and floods that swallow the entire map and allow aquatic creatures to wreak havoc. Sometimes all at once! It's stupid, it's cheesy, but it's also a lot of fun watching servers panic.

So the models are pretty good. The customization is very diverse, and there are some small slice of life features available to encourage you to explore group gameplay and make encounters with other players interesting.

But no product is without problems, and unfortunately, BoB's issues are hard to ignore. The animations are where these little ""things"" start. There are few better examples of this than the Saichania. The animations do not mesh very well with the model at all, causing it to err on the tacky side. Dinosaurs move stiffly and certain positions just do not look good on them at all. 

Sound design is... alright, but there are a number of stock sounds that have been heard many times before with very little adjustment. While stock sounds DO exist to be used freely, it can be a turn-off regardless. Certain sounds are much louder than others and the quality of certain sounds varies. I mentioned earlier that BoB has a number of mechanics such as meat carrying and stress. On paper these are nice little things that make traveling interesting, as finding a pile of gore means you can freely scavenge and take it with you for a road-trip snack. However, I find myself wishing there was more to it. Bodies turn into generic piles of meat and you seem to take chicken leg after chicken leg from it, and they seem to rot very fast regardless of their size. It feels very basic at its core and does not seem as polished as other systems. 

Stress is one of the more interesting features, but it is not without issues as well. While it discourages cross-dietary niceness among animals, when it hits with bad weather you can essentially kiss your dinosaur goodbye. If you spawn on an island and it starts storming, you have no shelter and must cross the ocean to reach larger landmasses. But rain, wind, and deep water swimming can all but kill you if you're a smaller animal. Add this to the stress (heh) of other creatures stalking you, and it can feel rather cheap. Once again, survival is unforgiving and you should not expect games to hold your hand all the way through. But, for new players who are still trying to learn how to play, a constant cycle of death and respawn gambling can be incredibly offputting. I feel that a tutorial mode would help alleviate this.

Pros:
-Decent models with updates to old ones on their way.
-Wide range of customization allowing people to stand out from the crowd.
-Goofy mechanics that add a degree of charm.
Cons:
-Several basic, rushed gameplay features.
-Poor optimization and a problem of tonal harmony (good models with bad animations and eye-burning colors).
-Very little world-building and interpersonal activities available, making solo gameplay a bit of a drag. Group play is required to survive and thrive.
-Lack of a cohesive campaign or tutorial mode, as well as very few accessibility features, may alienate certain players. I find myself wishing there was more of a story to the game as well, as it has potential with some of the artistic features in loading screens and the use of ruins in certain maps.

So, overall? No, BoB is not a BAD game. But it is not a particularly amazing game, either. I would not recommend it at full price, at this stage in its development. But it is certainly worth keeping an eye on.",1586911400,1586911413,False,32,0,0.726474583148956299,0,True,False,True,76561198080691296,35,13,8490,0,8490,1565292896,,

28,67221728,english,"BoB is a promising game if you're looking to playing as a prehistoric animal. Just be aware that it is still in Early Access and so there are the occasional bugs, glitches and server wipes. While it could use more content and some polishing, it's in a state that I think you can still enjoy it.

What's good:
- Skill tree, you can choose what skills you want to focus on
- Skins, they're beautiful and there's a lot of variety, you can customize your dino's looks from a very natural look to bright rainbow colors. You can also change the skin/colors to a certain growth point which is nice
- Every creature has it's own set of skills, making the gameplay feel different for every species
- Comfort/stress system is neat
- Weather system is cool, has an actual impact on the gameplay

What's not so good:
- Combat feels clunky and could use some balancing
- Performance issues, changing the graphics doesn't seem to do too much about this and the rubber banding can be really frustrating
- There's not a whole lot to do in the game, about 30% of the game time I've actually been afk playing on my phone or something while waiting for my dino to get the next skill point
- On that note, there's not really a pay-to-win mechanic but pay-to-skip-the-grind where you can buy growth on some servers. If ppl are paying NOT to play the game, it's not really a good sign. The pace at which you grow and get skill points could use tweaking

What I hope to see in the future:
- Balancing of some of the skills, Health/Sturdy/Slippery feel pretty underwhelming if not useless atm
- More consistent lighting
- More AI animals would be nice, not only as a source of food but also to make the map seem more lively. I've played on servers with 70+ ppl and yet only ever seem to meet like 10 of them
- Reverse walking for all (terrestial) creatures would be nice, less walking accidentally off cliffs
- Some sort of info sheet with the creature's abilities and favorite food would be great for new players/when trying out different creatures
- Cannibalism debuff or some other form of punishment. I get it being an option because you gotta eat when you gotta eat, but I just hope it would be a poor option
- Have the option to turn off chat, or to set it to pack/local only. If ppl want to do Dino-Tinder in the chat go for it, but I'd prefer not to have to see it",1586775913,1586789848,True,1,0,0.502712488174438477,0,True,False,True,76561198018591509,149,4,20920,1151,17372,1602000912,,

I particularly love Icthy and Lurdu, having to switch between water and land for survival is exciting.  The game is glitchy, there is occasional server lag that prevents you from moving or rubberbands you.  I've seen several blades of grass or gore just floating in the sky.  But overall those are minor.  The player list for the server does not yet have a search function or a sort function by dinosaur, which I would prefer, but those are the kinds of things you expect early on.

Overall there's a reason I've put over 100 hours into the game in the past couple weeks.  The community is small, but a lot of the people running servers from The Isle have come over and know their shit.  Admins are lacking but that is okay, as it gives some breathing room to learn the game and grow; the server size compared to The Isle is generally about half if not less, and the population seems split among 5 of the most popular servers and spill over into probably about 10 servers that are populated with at least 10-30 players at any given time.

This game always relaxes me. The developers are very kind, this is a project of passion and heart! They are always working to add new game elements and new dinos.

PROS
- Simple intuitive controls with a customizable layout of the screen
- Beautiful Skins with a plethora of color combinations to make your dino unique
- Herbivores, Carnivores, Flyers and Marine Dinos (NO HUMANS YAY)
- Diverse maps with different atmospheres all which are stunning (nights are not too dark)
- Maps aren't too large, just large enough so that you don't wander alone for days
- Survival mechanisms such as stress, comfort, and the elements that will challenge you (wind, storms, tornadoes, flooding, and in the future even wildfires will be added).
- Breeding and the ability to inherit skins and talents from your parents
- Ability to pick up and carry food and other dinos (babies too)
- Cool Skin mutations can happen!
- A Talent Tree so you can level up your dino and have different strategies of surviving
- Growth! The baby dinos actually change as they grow which is so neat to watch!
- Make your dino belt out a variety of roars and calls which mean different things (Call, Friendly, Aggressive, Submissive, Alarm).
- You can use Steam Share Family account in order to get multiple dinos on one server
- This game is just beautiful and a true work of ART.
- A large array of servers are available including official each with their own unique rules.
- Devs are always working on improved models, you should keep an eye out on their official Discord or Facebook. 
They offer contests and take suggestions from players, they really do listen to us!
- This game is 100x better than The Isle. I insist if you enjoy playing The Isle to give BoB a chance and you might just fall in love too.

Cons? Nah... not any in my eyes. This game is BETA so it is bound to have a few glitches, all of which the developers are working hard on perfecting. Most of the time server admins can help you around glitches or offer methods to prevent them in the meantime. :) Obviously not all the dinos are finished or available yet. I personally cannot wait for the Utahraptor!

 The first thing you should be aware of before playing. The game is in Early Access. This means there are many unfinished parts to the game. 

 The second thing that you should be aware before playing. Many of the servers have unofficial game rules that have to be followed or you will be banned from their server. I found most of these rules to be game breaking in a way that may lead players playing the game in a way which can end in frustration, and possibly just end up with you quitting the game. 

 The last thing you should be aware of before playing. The game is addicting and will have you coming back for more! Just remember to join a group of fellow players as playing solo can be the greatest hardship in the game.

I ave not played much, what 10 minutes and already hate the game. It does look like in sometime it will be good. 

What I think is so crap:

UI: Looks like it was made years ago with basically no effort. Like come on, the developers are using UE4 which is so good for indie games. 

Servers: Hardly no pop, most in russian. 

Models/Animations: It like the developers thought fuck it we'll release it now. The game is hardly done, and shouldn't even be in early access or anywhere near that. The animations are off so much, and the models honestly suck a## doesn't even feel like your playing survival dino game at all.

I know the graphics are not everything but the developers have access to Unreal Engine, and megascans. Like come on, worst game so far and getting full refund o this poorly made game.

61,64829827,english,"TLDR: This game is in my opinion a waste of time because your progress is completely reset upon death. 
Infinite growth sounds cool till you get devoured by a 2.0+ and have your progress completely reset. Thats probably my main gripe with the game is that the moment you die all your time is wasted on the dino you were playing and I felt that pretty much everytime I died in the game. Most deaths felt pretty bad to me especially because they often were not due to what I would consider to be legitimate combat/hunting. The deaths that would make me feel like I wasted my time typically included dying to rulebreaks, frustrating game mechanics, and just rediculously large dinos. Rediculously large dinos killing you is part of the game and this one I probably feel the least cheated by since most of the time that person worked hard to get that large dinosaur and I dont play on the servers that let you buy growth for dinos since thats just pay to win. 2.0+ dinos are pretty dang op I have made it to that size before on a pachy and you can basically fill out the entirety of your combat and speed trees which would nullify any advantadge a smaller player would have over you. Some 2.0s are obviously worse than other but essentially if you have the misfortune of encountering one it is typically game over for you. There are a couple of frustrating game mechanics that really annoy me in this game mainly fall damage and extinction floods. Fall damage in general feels incredibly overtuned to the point where taking a wrong step off a slight incline can break your legs or even kill your dino outright. I have never enjoyed fall damage in any video game so it is not suprising that it annoys me although this mechanic obviously has easier workarounds so with game experience this becomes less of an issue. Extinction floods are exactly what they are called if an extinction flood is happening you should just log off because entire islands will go under water and even some mountains. Extinction floods feel poorly designed because they are so punishing to players and yet they do not accomplish any gameplay goals in a more meaningful way compared to other weather events that I can see. Regular growth storms and minor flooding all accomplish extinction floods gameplay goals in a more meaningful and less punishing manner. Growth storms even provide a benefit to the player in increased growth for the trade off of needing to seek shelter/higher ground. Tornadoes and severe flooding on the other hand severely punish the player for playing the game when you encounter these weather phenomena the safest option is just to log off especially because even if you go to higher ground MOUNTAINS can go underwater. Tornados always seem to chase the closest player and slower dinos will be unable to outrun a tornado so they just die. Now if Extinction floods true gameplay goal was to act as a sort of server wipe to prevent overly large dinosaurs from dominating a server they do not accomplish that goal very well since they can just be avoided by logging out and NOT PLAYING THE GAME. Why would you EVER want a mechanic that encourages people to not play your game? Rulebreaks are also annoying to deal with these happen all the time and rules vary from server to server and are admittedly difficult to implement. If you seriously want to play this game consistently you have to record every little bit of gameplay in case someone breaks a rule and kills you with the advantadge that player has gained by not following the mutually agreed upon rules. If you have proof about a death to a rulebreak then most servers will be willing to regrow you on a new dino but there is no garentee that you will get the same inherits you had previously which means you can still end up losing progress from the restoration process. I dont know about other people but I dont feel like we should live in societies were we have to record everything we do in case something bad happens to us that sounds to tedious for me. Time to grow on this game also slows down exponentially especially after getting to 1.2 which can be easily achieved in one to two days of gameplay on any dino. After 1.2 growth growing becomes so tedious that people will often just afk and again NOT play the game this problem is more common amongst herbivores than carnivores as they do not have to go in search of food as often. I dont mind that people go afk while playing the game but when over half your herd is not playing it creates a lot of long stretches of flat out boredom. 1.2 growth can easily be achieved in one or two days but 2.0 growth takes litterally about a month of consistent gameplay and for some of the bigger dinos it might even be longer than that. The true balance to infinite growth in this game is hunger but that only causes massive carnivores to voraciously devour every player they can get their hands on. Honestly I would probably play this game again if growth was reworked in some way that allowed you to accomplish some sort of progression because as the game is now it is just stressful for me to play why should I play a game were all of my progress could be EASILY reset when I can just go play some other game that actually respects investments of time and gameplay by offering meaningful progression. For people who think that proggression would defeat the whole purpose of the infinite growth system their is a pretty easy way to solve that just give a player half of their growth upon dying to the same dino they were playing as previously thats honestly a small amount of growth return when you think about it. 1.0's would just become .5's and 1.2's .6's which are tiny but at least bigger than brand spanking new spawn dinos. A return on progression would also allow people who manage to get to 2.0+ a sort of safety net in that at least they wont have to start from scratch all over again this type of progression gives people gameplay goals and would help with people playing overly safe because they do not want to waste their time.",1583873439,1583875729,False,12,1,0.551053941249847412,8,True,False,True,76561198086007738,89,12,111678,8349,19634,1602052965,,

Pros:

+Lots of mechanics in game (comfort, ability tree, nesting, etc) that make the game feel more immersive instead of an afk in a bush and wait simulator.

+Varied skin customization. You can have more natural, earthy colors (e.g brown/gray), or you can make a neon pink skin that everyone else hates. Some may consider this a negative due to bright skins possibly throwing off the immersion and realism, but personally I think its a nice touch.

+Special skins are quite enjoyable (specifically getting nested in as one). Personally my favorite are chimera skins, they're just so good and alelkgsmgfldsmdglmsdsvmlkdsvckml

+If your growth is below 0.8 (mature age) then you can change your skin. If you were nested in, you can change the colors based on the color scheme you were nested in with.

Cons:
(mostly just nitpicks bc i love this game and akejgfdkfgdmkmgdmkfgdkfghm)

-Pteras in general tend to be mostly toxic with baby snatching and scouting for other, larger carnivores.

-Terrain is a bit wonky is certain areas, usually leading you to be inside the ground or above it.

Better than The Isle in terms of gameplay, more mechanics and feels less boring to sit around and wait, especially fun to be nested in or to play with friends. 9/10

But the biggest change was the map, and the new map runs a MILLION TIMES BETTER. Don't play on any maps but Rival Shores, unless you're okay with iffy performance. 

Each dinosaur is unique and has their own playstyle, so far I love apatasaurus, but a lot of people don't because it is painfully slow. I just find it fun mowing down forests lol. 
As someone that loves The Isle, I wholeheartedly recommend this to people who also do. You can like both, and competition is good for the players because it drives both teams to try and one up another, and hopefully end in a very good games for us, the customers. This is less just eat and drink survival like The Isle, it has breeding, comfort mechanics, floods, tornadoes, water hole drainage, water creatures, flying creatures, breeding. Although The Isle will likely have such mechanics in the future, this game does them pretty well right now. I love the storms, they're awesome, it's immersive and fun <3
There's also a skill points system, and inherited skills through breeding, and sometimes when growing from spawn, so each time you die and try again, your dinosaur can be more focused in something you might find better, it also might randomly inherit skills. Like one of my first apas only survived because I inherited and added some for water survival. I would have been dead otherwise. 
The game allows for a lot of player customization, some dinosaurs have feathered options and featherless, so far only the rex, but in the future more will. I personally prefer making more subtle skins or realistic, but you can make them however you want, want to be super bright? Want to be literal eye-cancer? The game won't stop you lol. And if you breed your skins can be passed down, or combine with your mate, along with the chance of mutations.

You can definitely have fun time playing the game how ever it has few really bad problems.
Problems I noticed with the game are:
-Steam profile name is your character name. This creates problems because anyone can impersonate anyone and you really cannot keep track on who is trust worthy and who is not. Creatures need a permanent name badly because without it any kind of tribe formation or even social interaction is tedious and pointless because you cannot keep track who is who. Isle had same problem so this is really nothing new to this kind of game.
-Most server admins require video evidence if bug kills you. Requirement that you are forced to record every playtime is ludicrous. I suggest when you die game should have a kill camera that records few minutes before you die so if something absurd or buggy happens it is easy to prove.

Yay.

If you're an old school fan of The Isle like I am, but now see The Isle for what it is (let's not get into that) then Beasts Of Bermuda is for you. Beasts Of Bermuda (or ‘BoB’) is everything The Isle has been promising for over three long years now, and they accomplished more in the span of 7 months than The Isle has in years. In my opinion, the only thing that The Isle has over BoB is the graphics. Apart from that one thing, it's no comparison. But I'll compare the pair anyway, because hot chips aren't the only thing I like to add salt to.
The developers of Beasts of Bermuda have had the luxury of watching The Isle make mistake after mistake, and therefore have been able to avoid travelling down the same road.
For instance:

-The updates are regular and large in size, with many improvements within each one

-The developers are extremely transparent and openly communicate with the community at all times

-New game features are teased and then actually released

-Developers don't p**s away their time by removing old features that you love for seemingly no reason and with no explanation (features that took, I assume, hundreds of man hours to create in the first place)

-Old maps that are loved by the community aren't removed for seemingly no reason and with no explanation (see above point)

-Developers don't spend precious time and money designing and implementing huge overpowered fictional monsters that only they can control (because f**k the community and the player-base that made all of this possible, right?)

-Developers actively listen to the community and act accordingly, based on what their fans would like to see

-Lead developer doesn't call his fans ""useless"" or openly say things like ""they don't know what they want"", ""they're idiots"", etc.

-Not a single server is run by Anthomnia and his brigade of (some) power-crazed moderators

-Community is genuinely a great place to be for the most part


If it feels like I'm comparing the two, it's probably because I am. The Isle was supposed to be 'the' dinosaur game, and for a while it was heading that way. But The Isle let me down, more than once, and BoB was there to rekindle my hope for a great dinosaur game. 

(TL;DR)

Great game with cartoonish graphics, longer you play the bigger and stronger you get, actual benefits to working with other players, massive advantages to nesting and joining herds/ grouping up, and countless other positives – Buy BoB.

The game has a lot of great features; the tier tree is neato and they just updated the megalo model. It looks clean. 

However, this game is virtually impossible to actually survive in solo. You're constantly competing with people  who are 1.5+, or even larger at 2.0+. Megapacks of acros and megalos are a never ending on maps that are fairly small in size. You'll have a single group dominating an entire server that genuinely ruins what could otherwise be an entertaining time waster. 

You can say ""Git gud"" but balance is a huge problem in this game - not everyone can dump 50+ hours in weekly to get to unsustainable sizes and be a powerhouse on a server. 

I'll come back when the game is balanced out and more private servers with less admin corruption are around.

Not in its current state. The game has a lot to offer, but its essentially a giant time sink at the moment - and not in the good way. 


What's good about it?

The tier tree is great and adds a unique way to diversify your personal gameplay style

The skin customization lets you go as neon rainbow or earthy camo as you please ( Kind of a con, but good in terms of player customization ) 

Playing with people will boost your growth and help with inherits, this can be seen as a con if you prefer solo gameplay, which this game does not favor

The developers have put a lot of thought in to how to make the game interesting by adding comfort flowers, crystals, and other goodies across the map for you to seek out. 

There's more good than that, of course, but like I said I can't recommend this in its current state. It isn't that its a bad game by any means - I enjoyed it for the time I played, but the balancing issues are a huge factor in putting me off. I'll come back in a few months to see what has changed. 

I'll happily change my review to reflect my personal experience when things change. Like I stressed, it is NOT a bad game, but it definitely has things that need to be fixed and carefully taken into consideration in future updates.",1580620725,1580620961,False,39,0,0.776448905467987061,0,True,False,True,76561198274251292,21,2,5634,1556,2136,1601782596,,

-you can get struck by lightning
-raptors are airbenders and can jump into space
-there's no growth limit

-there's a sleep button
-ptera is fun as heII

This game have a decent array of customization not only for dino skins, but also growth progression where you can give yourself talents e.g. run faster, more health etc. And different dino have slightly different skill trees, megalosaurus can detect enemy condition, acrocanthosaurus can roar that gives debuff.

I watched a tornado throw trees all over the place. Also, water sources like ponds are not an infinite supply. I was very surprised when I realized the pond that the herd I had joined was using for drinking was getting smaller and smaller, and with no rain, it just about ran out. Pretty interesting stuff.

- eating, drinking and attack animation can be improve.

At it's current point, there feels like theres just more content in BoB than there is in The Isle. let me just give a quick run down of what I think.
Pros:
-Functional weather that affects players
-awesome dino selection: land, flying, marine, semi-aquatic you name it. 
-on that note, also many different styles to play for each dino.
-interesting stats to maintain and keep track of other than the basic food/thirst/health
-you never stop growing
-abilities you can invest points in and eventually pass on to offspring
-functional nesting system requiring both genders to perform
-Completely customizable skins!
-You can pick up your babies!

Cons:
-Very buggy, but not unplayable. hey, it is early access after all.
-might feel too slow paced for some
-some mechanics may be confusing to new players based on lack of any sort of tutorial or info panels besides the one you get only once when you enter a server for the first time after playing for the first time.

For an example for the mosa grab. Say your arnold schwarzanegger at his prime, this will be are mosa. Now we have a cinder block and that will be are apato. Ok so what will happen if are arnold grabs the cinder block and try's to swim off with it? I think you know where i'm going with this.

96,60615731,english,"The game has quite a long way to go to catch up to it's competitor The Isle, but it has set itself apart from them in a few notable ways early on - primarily the focus on aquatic and airborne dinosaurs and a heavy emphasis on environment shaping your objectives rather than just the need for survival. Water and food sources can become scarce, or sea levels can rise and cause flooding which forces a migration. It's a fun little exercise, but ultimately it becomes tedious and boring once you've found a spot that can meet all of your food, water, and shelter needs, or if you can manage to join a large herd or pack to hunt with.

If you liked playing The Isle and you are curious about this game, I recommend it - it's not any better or worse, just different. 

If you're on the fence because it's Early Access, I do not recommend it - there are still bugs aplenty and the dinosaur roster is woefully inadequate. The gameplay for piscine dinosaurs is really in a poor place right now with fish being difficult to find without the aid of a flying dinosaur to scout for you, like a pteranodon. Scent also seems to glitch out occationally and not properly highlight food sources or other dinosaurs properly.

The graphic visuals are decent, you could get some very nice screenshots without any editing. Though, they may not be realistic, which may turn some people away.

Gameplay: 8/10

The gameplay is FULL of features, giving a ton to do to the average player. If you prefer gameplay, this is the game for you. Though, it does feature some long waiting and a decent amount of bugs, so that stops it from being an absolute 10.

Community health: 9/10

The community is generally friendly, depending on your experiences. I've personally never encountered toxicity, but the toxicity of the community seems to be a vocal minority. Developers aren't all out there, unlike the developers of games like The Isle.

27,48059849,english,"I've decided to go ahead and revise my review to be more accurate to the game's development recently, plus my additional playtime.

I would say Beasts of Bermuda is now absolutely, 100% worth the cost. The game is still in its early stages and, as with all games, a portion of the community can be rather toxic. But, the gameplay you'll get out of it is worth putting up with all this.

The game has come a long way since release, with servers having once struggled to support more than fifty people to almost able to support 100 people with no more than the occasional hiccup, allowing for much more diverse gameplay as more people are able to fill up the ecosystem.

The new dinosaurs and the reworks that have been released are nothing short of beautiful, and show the potential for some of the more outdated dinosaurs such as the Parasaurolophus down the line. On that note, the graphics have gotten a noticeable upgrade. It's not quite on the standard of what people compare this game to, being The Isle, but it's far better than what it used to look like at release.

For the most part, many of the animals are well balanced and fill their roles. The Pachycephalosaur is a speedy battering ram that must be confronted with caution. The Lurdusaurus is like a seal, slow and helpless on land but capable of a speedy getaway once it's in the water, where it can even stand up to some of the large marine predators if built right. Rexes and acrocanthosaurs constantly vie against each other for limited resources, keeping each other's populations in check, while Megalosaurus and Icthy are more capable opportunists, waiting in the wings for any potential prey to slip up.

The game still has its glitches and problems though, in its young age. Fish are currently, as acknowledged by the developers, only barely functional and exist more as a resource that's just there rather than an actual, engaging aspect of gameplay, something they have said will be fixed when the for it arises. Some of the dinosaurs don't match up well at all. Apatos often cause turmoil for hungry predators looking for a meal, and recently Parasaurolophus are rather hit or miss in survivability.

These are all problems the developers are dutifully looking to fix as the game evolves and they're (sometimes) open to feedback from the community for glitches or balance issues that may be encountered. Overall, I enjoy Beasts of Bermuda, it's certainly the best game of its genre that exists for the time being and I hope to see how it changes as development progresses.",1546489254,1575565756,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True,76561198064308252,245,11,27589,0,22060,1599686811,,

That being said, I bought it hype as HELL to play with some friends that already had it. I had a blast learning the ropes and trial-and-error-ing my way through some number of poor dinosaurs. May they find peace in dino heaven after dealing with my dumb azz. 

THE GOOD NEWS IS:
•	The potential! It’s a unique game out there right now. Nothing else is doing the things these devs are trying to do.
•	The completely customizable skins, talent trees and specs, random inherits and diversity of dinos to play makes every creature you grow unique. For example, if you get lucky with inherits you can have a nested krono that can run along the beach with the rest of the land-dwellers! Or an acro that considers itself a shark!
•	The maps, environments and weather systems make for an interesting challenge and keep players on the move, along with constantly shifting tides.
•	Sniffing! And scent! It’s a really handy way to keep your wits about you and learn the map as you go. 

THE BAD NEWS IS:
•	The social aspect of the gameplay is very cool. So cool that playing on your own is pretty miserable.
•	Nothing is taken for granted in this game. When you first hop in, absolutely no information is given to you other than one-liners on the loading screens. Even looking at the controls and keybinds doesn’t enlighten you much.
•	The combat leaves a lot to be desired. No matter what my ping is, it always feels clunky and I’m rarely certain a hit has even landed, let alone the times I’ve timed out of a server mid-fight and came back to my dino being dead as a door nail.
•	The communities in this game are abysmal. Any servers with a decent playerbase either have admins that are stretched thin and never get around to managing reports, events and crashes, causing players to get more wound up, or they have admins constantly abusing their roles and bending all rules to suit them, that can do no wrong and are held to godly esteem by the common players, leading to a very stagnant playerbase.
•	The graphics and performance. My god, my pc HATES this game. With the lowest settings it starts screaming at me after about 20 minutes. That being said, even with the highest settings BoB doesn’t look good either so like, if you’re running on economy graphics you’re really not missing out on much.
•	The BUGS. And GLITCHES. There’s too many to count, and like other reviews have said, with every update there just seems to be more. Each one more game-breaking than the last. The menus and options don’t work properly. Each time you get disconnected from a server, you can’t rejoin until the second try as it will automatically time out. Sometimes you’ll just log in and your dino will be gone. Sometimes another player from across the map will pick you up with it only showing on your side, so you'll die from intimidation unless you log out. I get that it’s an early access game, but I really wish we didn’t all look at every update like “oh here we go again”. The community feedback seems to be a moot point too, especially after the patch to “fix” gore spawns by disabling every server’s ability to modify their frequency and size. I don't know what the devs' plans are for BoB in the future I can only hope they fix the booboos they made along the way already before adding anything new.

44,58446455,english,"Beasts of Bermuda is a beautiful, unique survival game. It has features that you won't find anywhere else and will keep you hooked for many hours

""Dynamic"" is the best way to describe BoB. What the game currently lacks in graphics or in optimization (Early Access), it makes up for with rich gameplay mechanics and replayability. These include:

- [b]Talents[/b]: As your creature grows it gains talent points. You can spec these into talents that make your creature faster, or stronger, or more resistant, etc. This makes every dino you play feel unique, and lets you choose your own playstyle

- [b]Tides & Weather:[/b] The maps have a high tide/low tide system. Sea levels will rise up and go down again on a half hour cycle. This will cut off or expose parts of the map - and requires you to plan your travels/migrations carefully. Storms also occur as a sunny day could turn into a hurricane. Storm floods may submerge the map and will have you desperately search higher ground, while Mosasaurs and Krono's are swimming through what used to be land!

- [b]Comfort:[/b]. The comfort system is a big part of the game. Having high comfort will help you grow, but being stressed can hurt you. Being in a herd or pack improves your comfort, being near hostile creatures lowers it (unless you specced some stress resistance talents). If a bad storm is stressing your creature out, use your surroundings to find shelter

- [b]Nesting:[/b] Nesting and breeding is very rewarding. Children may gain [i]inherits[/i]: permanent bonuses to a dino depending on what Talents their parents specced! On the flip side, the game keeps track of who is related and incest will punish your offspring with negative inherits making them weaker 

- [b]Infinite growth:[/b] Creatures do not have age stages - instead you just keep growing until you die. As you grow larger, growth gain will slow down and you will go hungry faster. Do you want to become a horrifying, monstrous giant? You can! It will take you literal [i]weeks[/i] of in-game survival, but the reward is worth it

The game has a friendly Developer team who - despite making the occasional bad decision - work hard to improve their game. Bug fixes, optimizations and new content gets released often, every 3-4 weeks or so

The main issues with the game are the bugs (frequent, but being worked on) and balance problems. Servers without pack/herd limits are especially annoying, because you'll find overpowered cliques of Rexes and Aquatics. I highly suggest playing on a (semi)realism server for this reason.

Sections of the community I can tell you to be wary of would be some aquatic players and also many herbivore mains on so called ""semi realism"" servers, as they can be quite toxic if you ever play something that is not a herbivore, and have the audacity to hunt them to survive. Other than that, the community is one of the best I've seen for such a multiplayer based game!

As an Early Access game there is a lot of bugs and a few exploits in the game in any given patch, however they are actively being fixed and this is an early access game, so please be patient.

With new dinosaurs coming out every few months, and performance ever increasing with both bug fixing hotfixes and large patches, one can only imagine how far this game will be along by the time it hits the original 24 months it said it would be in early access!

They seem to hate individuality, whether it be the various different unofficial servers or the players themselves. If you like to nest or be nested, well ♥♥♥♥ you, all of your children will be carbon copies of their parents because they removed the ability to change your dino's appearance if you are nested.

They also hate any kind of peaceful gameplay. If you host your own server and advertise it as a chill, fun server, well ♥♥♥♥ you. Food that spawns around the map have been reduced drastically, so you HAVE to go out and kill other people. Either that or the poor server admins work overtime spawning food for people who want to play their favorite dinosaur without worrying about getting killed every 5 minutes.

What really sets this game apart from The Isle is the growth system. The longer your dino is alive and played, the bigger and stronger it gets. Do you strive to be a big dino? Well ♥♥♥♥ you, growth rates have been nerfed 6x.

God forbid they allow any kind of server settings so admins can tailor servers to what they want, no let's just turn every server into an unfun killfest like the official servers already are.

7,55433813,english,"First things first: Early Access games are subject to change, bugs are present here and there, and Beasts of Bermuda is by no means perfect, but its Dev's are very much in love with the project they are working on, and they are always excited to bring forward new things in the hopes that the public will love them. Let me tell you a little story.

Before I came to the community, I was looking for a dinosaur survival game, as I was tired of games that always involved humans. I saw two that took my interest, The Isle, and Beasts of Bermuda. I had heard a decent bit of negative things about The Isle, but I knew NOTHING about Beasts of Bermuda. That day, I decided to give these unknown Devs a chance. Boy, am I glad I did.

Beasts of Bermuda is a dinosaur survival game that takes place in the Bermuda Triangle, with that touch of mystery in the environment that makes you wonder ""What happened here?"" such as ruins or plane wreckage of times that have long since past. You have generally free selection to play any dinosaur that is available in the roster, and there is a decent variety currently, with many more planned to come. There are terrestrial ones such as Parasaurs and Rexes, you can take to the sky as a Pteranodon, or swim in the ocean as creatures such as a Mosasaurus or Kronosaurus, and those aren't even the full list of whats already in the game.

There are many mechanics such as weather, eating and drinking, grouping up in a pack or herd, or choosing skins for which you want to become, and customizing its colors to your liking. You can grow your creature bigger over time, and there is a talent tree from which you can make your creature faster, stronger, and survive easier. You can nest, and lay eggs, and raise children, and you can pick up those children, eggs, or even food items.

From the day I came in to the community, I was loving the game and what it had to offer, but then I fell victim to a bug. I soon discovered that they were seeking QA testers, and decided to try to help. This is where I learned about the Devs more than I expected to.

[b]This game is a passion project. They aren't in it for the money, they want to CREATE a world, a survival world in specific, and they just hope people will enjoy what they're making as they make it.[/b] This does not mean they do not listen to the community, however, as they do observe what people say, and consider their options when trying to balance things, and some ideas people come up with are rather exciting to them. Coding is one of the hardest parts of game development, and there are only two coders working on the game. They are human, not robots, they can't make it perfect, they have lives too and need a little bit of time to rest every now and again, and many of the negative reviews that are spouting such aggressive comments do so seemingly with the idea that they are robots, and should be perfect. Thats not how that works.

Atleast 80% of the negative reviews on this game are for one of the following reasons, which are not good reasons to completely avoid buying the game ever:
- They got caught and banned for hacking.
- They died to another player that played better than them (and therefore giving the game a bad review because they aren't good at it)
- They lost a dinosaur to a bug/balance issue which is in an Early Access game. (Don't buy the game quite yet if you worry this will ruin it for you).
- The Devs changed a game mechanic to better fit their actual design intentions, and the negative reviewer did not like it.
- The negative reviewer had an admin do something to them on a non-official server (valid or not), which is not the game Dev's fault.
- They like another dinosaur survival game and are trying to skewer the reviews on this one to ruin its reputation unfairly.

All in all, this game deserves credit. They do work hard, do try their best, and the game does have a lot of nice features to it, with the Devs spilling their blood, sweat, and tears into making it better in all ways that they can.

I have bore witness to admin abuse\bug abuse and players being teleported to be murdered for food even but nothing is done. I STILL enjoy playing this game with a group in game though but be warned,this game is definitely frustrating for the wrong reasons and I suggest expecting to lose your hard work at any given time,but if you are casual about it it is still fun to pass the time for sure.


EDIT: After continuing playing and trying different servers due to massive packs of Meglos constantly killing everyone,I had finally joined the main server where the Mods and Admins focus and prefer to play. This map for some reason does not spawn food effectively for carnivores and people tend ot play herbivores in giant packs,where if you remotely get close even as friendly you will be instantly stomped to death. When bringing up the bug along with five other people on the map experiencing the same,we all had two moderators laugh at us and say tough luck,that since they were finding corpses (Not the spawned meat,but those left by players dying,mostly of the lack of spawn of food itself) that our bug was not a real issue,we all reported it anyway to where it needed to go in the discord with no response. 

I have not played the game much since this experience,though still fun it just really sucks when voices are not heard.

Been playing this game a few days with my husband,so far it is amazing fun and the developers keep up to date on it and pay attention to the community very well.

Being an EA game it is in a better state than 99% of them out there,although there are still some bugs,most of which though do not seem game breaking,except for the occasional (But absolutely hilarious) Ptera deathwheel bug.

Every few days they add new bug fixes for these problems.

CONS 
SPAWN CAMPING IS BECOMING A REAL ISSUE IN this game.
are it is best to have a friend or friends to play with,otherwise survival seems to be difficult.
Huge packs of Carnivores who eat other Carnivores
Hackers are finding this game but devs keeping up
Herbivores are able to single stomp any carnivore if big enough and have the right build

37,54523111,english,"This game is the dinosaur game I've wanted since I was a little kid.

Beasts of Bermuda takes place in the modern day somewhere in the Bermuda Triangle. You take control of a dinosaur or other mesozoic animal and attempt to survive in the face of hostile weather forces and other players.

There are three game modes. The main one most people play is Life Cycle. You begin at 0.4 size with 5 talent points, and gain an additional talent point every 0.04 points of growth. Every species has a different growth rate until 1.0, or adult size. Your growth then begins to slow down until 1.2 (elder size), after which all species follow an identical growth formula. Growth at this point slows down exponentially; you can reach 2.0 size in a couple weeks worth of gameplay, but 3.0 takes months. Much of how you survive the late game will be determined by the talents you took as a juvenile and adolescent, simply due to how slow growth (and by extension acquiring more talent points) becomes.

The second mode is combat. In this mode everyone is stuck at adult size. You start with 5 talent points the first time you join a server, and all talent points thereafter are acquired by surviving, eating blue crystals, and killing other players. You lose a few talent points if you respawn, die naturally, or get killed, and the latter will also give those lost talents to your killer. The talent tree in this mode is the same as in the other two modes, so some talents are a bit useless as a result.

The third mode is free roam. Once again everyone is stuck at adult size, and you get 20 talent points to spend as you please. You never get anymore. No one plays this mode.

Weather hazards include high winds, tornadoes, lightning, and floods. Particularly bad floods (known to players as extinction floods) can rise to cover nearly all of the land including tall mountains. Floods only occur during lightning storms, and your reward for surviving said storms is increased growth in the life cycle mode.

The talents I've mentioned take the form of a perk tree like you'd see in Skyrim or Witcher 3. There are three branches which can be roughly categorized as power, mobility, and survival. Every species has a slightly different set of talents geared toward their respective gameplay, and every talent can be invested up to three times (provided every prerequisite talent in invested by at least the same amount). Many players go deep into one branch with little or no points spent in the others, though some do elect to spread points out more. The survival tree is mainly oriented towards resource management, mobility towards speed and stamina longevity, and power towards damage and durability.

No two species play exactly the same, even without talents. Even similar animals will have differing special abilities to ensure that they do not feel [i]too[/i] similar to the player. Megalosaurus, for example, is a fast growing predator with the ability to view enemy stats. A pack can quickly grow large and mob targets, and can do so with little to no communication thanks to everyone being able to view detailed information on their target and each other. Contrast to Acrocanthosaurus, a much slower growing predator with the ability to inflict bleed damage and temporarily weaken enemy attacks. Packs will be small and slow to grow, and the players will prefer to take their time coordinating with each other and whittling down a target's health slowly over time.

It's a damned fun game, and though not without its share of hiccups it is definitely a worthy addition to any dino lover's gaming library.",1565296490,1565296490,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True,76561198044477043,206,23,67632,1804,15208,1601969580,,

40,48006948,english,"Definitely a buy worth making... if you have the patience for the bugs and glitches along the way. I can't believe how far this game has come; I remember seeing youtube videos where it looked like a cheap phone game you'd buy for $0.99 but it has since become a very complex dinosaur game with upgradeable stats, weather, stress/comfort, and other features. I think it has the most potential over any dinosaur-simulator-type game that I've seen, the only problem is technical issues. Every update has some sort of bug--for every one that's fixed, another will appear--but I have a lot of hope and trust for what it'll be come, and in the meantime it's still worth putting hours into.

The main gamemode is Lifestyle in which you start as a juvenile and grow larger. Different species grow at different speeds and you can continue growing past adulthood--eventually becoming a total chonkus--though more slowly and slowly, nerfed by increased hunger. All the creatures have a very unique gameplay and balancing them with each other is a high priority (though one patch or another inevitably leads to some disbalance that's eventually fixed). Some fair better in poor weather, others have to take refuge in caves or they'll die from the elements, and more are at risk if the world starts flooding or a tornado appears. The surge of the tide hides and reveals land bridges at different times, and you have to wait for low waters to cross some islands or risk the monster-infested seas. A comfort system encourages players to be with friends and punishes mix-packing. 

Carnivores are currently Velociraptor (small, fast, and can climb trees/rocks, though climbing is very glitchy), Megalosaurus (middle-tier who you can put stat points to go any direction), Ichthyovenator (small spinosaurid for land & sea), and Rex (you know what tf that is).Herbivores include Parasaur (fast meatsack), apatosaurus (slow tank), and lurdusaurus (land/water).  Sea beasts are mosasaurus (heavy, can drag prey), kronosaurus (currently unbalanced mega strong beast man), and a fast noodle who's name I forgot but it's a noodle and it's fast. In the air is currently only Pteranodon but others are coming.

Many glitches have already came or went so I can't accurately say what the state of the game is when this is being read. Pteranodon for a long moment was almost unplayable due to frequent and fatal glitches. Rarely you may lose a massive creature by stepping over a tree and being launched straight into heaven. Mosa was very wrongly powerful and ruled the seas for a while, but for a moment that has switched entirely to Krono. Yet again I've seen devs kicking out fixes by the dozen, and I know these problems won't exist for long.

At the moment though, I don't think this game is best played seriously; it's not a realistic simulation that'll immerse you into a dinosaur world, but it's a lot of flopping around and having fun. Sometimes the real quality of a game is weather you can run up to a stranger and jump and sometimes they'll jump back. This is a rare game where there's so many more goals to aim for instead of being the best, like nesting or building a herd. It's not the kind of game where you have to grind away for some reward because the gameplay itself is rewarding, whether you're a tyrant rex or a harmless velociraptor bolting around at breakneck speed and constantly screaming.",1546328743,1564623262,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,True,76561198132234290,27,6,30204,0,15962,1597105829,,

43,54339512,english,"I for one would highly recommend this game for the sheer fun that it brings alongside great mechanics and the awesome talent screen. 

Positives: The survival mechanics are incredible. You don't just eat and drink, you also have a comfort meter to take care of alongside that. Food also spoils and there is changing weather like droughts and floods. Overall, the survival is actually fun and really makes the game more fun then just your basic survival game (Like another crappy dinosaur game that will be mentioned later)

Positive#2: The combat is actually fair and realistic. You don't get hit unless the hit actually connects with the model of your creature. The unique abilities of every creature also make the game's combat system realistic and fair. For example, a parasaurolophos is a creature most carnivores would think are easy prey, but it's ability: revealing the location of the creature the ability is used on, means that it can all for help. Alongside it's good stats, it can fight fairly against creatures like megalosaurus and younger acrocanthosaurus.

Positive#3: The talent screen adds so much variety, every person has a different playstyle and build. The talent screen means you can modify your creature to whatever you want. Want to be a fishing pteranodon? Just pump points into Aqua affinity and mobility skills. Want to be a ichthyovenator that can survive through thick and thin? Put survival talents in to help you stay alive. Want to be a all rounder? Just put talents into a few of every skill tree. This makes the game SO much more fun then it already is since you can play it how you want to play it

Positive#4: The skins are all vibrant and unique by default, but you can colour then however you want! You can make any colour of patterns or skins. The colour wheel and ability to colour each part of your skin how you want means that you can also make a skin bright or dull. Once again, every player probably has a different skin so you can create your own unique dinosaur masterpiece of a skin.

Positive#5: The creatures are all fun in their own ways due to their unique abilities and lifestyles that can be expanded by the aforementioned talent system. All of the creatures are fun to use and are different and varied. As well as that, all the creatures are well balanced. A herbivore can actually fight off a carnivore fairly in this game and T-rex is not a stupidly overpowered creature (Unlike another good dinosaur game). Everything is balanced as it should be.

Positive#6: The game is actually realistic with it's survival and models. I mentioned the survival earlier. But all of the models are quite realistic and nicely done


Now for the only negative I have with the game


Negative: The game is a bit glitchy at the moment, and this can often make the game a bit annoying at times. Some creatures also get boring over time if you don't like the way you play them. These 2 issues are not that big of a problem as server admins will often handle the glitches that affect players and you can just respawn if you are done with a creature you were using.

45,54300681,english,"Beasts of bermuda is personally to me, a great game for any dinosaur fan or anyone who likes survival games in general, it has a wide variety of creatures from aquatic sea monsters to flying pterosaurs, carnivores and herbivores. The same can be said for mechanics, every dinosaur is unique with its own mechanics and gameplay style, like tree climbing as a velociraptor or grabbing prey as a mosasuarus. Another thing about mechanics, the games environment is always changing, with tides, tornado's, and floods. It is still in early access and the devs develop the game fast and efficiently. Its graphics are good in my opinion, although it is in early stages of optimizations so the system requirements are slightly high, but that is really the only negative thing i have to say. One last thing, it is not the same as the isle as some people may think, in fact they are quite different

It isn't even that the game itself is the issue so much as the community which seems ill-managed, even on their official servers. Few other games rival the toxicity I've experienced within this particular community (and I've played a lot of multiplayer games). Other games deal with the issues within theirs much better than what I've experienced playing BoB. Not many servers rival the player population as the officials do, but when you delve into them you are more than likely going to end up rage-quitting due to the plethora of childish behavior and downright griefing that goes on a near constant basis. Don't even bother asking for help against this toxicity or expecting those who go out of their way to make the game horrible for others to get punished.

Just because you cant figure out the controls since the main developer accidentally gave his left-handed controls does not mean just to give up and refund. And don't go looking at the bad reviews, if you have discord join the official discord. It has screenshots of the awesome game-play. Yes, there's bugs, but that does NOT mean its a bad game. The Isle is just as buggy, and I'm sure you're all aware apparently anthomnia was paid by Dondi to diss this game. Give it a shot, try it out. It's a great game where you don't have to press a button to grow, and you incubate inside an egg when its laid (for non aquatics, aquatics give live birth) and the game lets you choose from 3 different trees to spec into. Survival lets you go longer without food or water, combat lets you have a stronger defense against hunting and predators, and speed lets you be able to catch up to prey and run away. But most importantly, is 99% of the servers have NO growth limit! Which means, you can grow to 4.0 if you can survive! And it has a variety of different skins you can freely choose the colors of and such, where with the isle you have a set color palette for each dinosaur. As you get bigger your meant to become louder and eat and drink more, making it more difficult to maintain such a large dinosaur. You can invest in most dinosaur's into a talent called Sneaky, which makes you quieter. However, the only dinosaur that doesn't have this so far is Apatosaurus, because it is the largest dino in-game and will always be noisy.
And you benefit from being nested in, too! However, instead of you sending out the nest invites, people come to you for egg invites! And not only that, you get inherits! Sometimes you get bad ones, yes, but these can be prevented with a talent known as Good Parent, which helps 'stress' (comfort) on your dino that it gets when gestating eggs. Sometimes you can get inherits from a spawned in dino, but you can only get a max of 5 inherits from spawning in. And not only is THAT a benefit, but you get inherits based off what your parents are speced into! Such as combat, speed, or survival. So after reading this, tell me if you'll give it a shot in the comments. And whats better, as well? You can make skins to suggest to be added to the game, or better yet, suggest dinos!

Negatives:
1) The sounds are terrible. Walking sounds are too loud for the distance another Dinosaur is from the player.
2) The controls are bad. Even after I modified them in the menu they didn't respond well. This game does not use the standard WASD set-up, make sure you go into the menu and change it unless you don't mind learning a new movement set-up.
3) Game spawns you anywhere it feels like it (even deep underwater, making you die before you can reach surface).
4) The Skin menu does not always work (changing colours with the sliders did nothing on some skins.)
5) It's mentioned already by countless others, but the animations are poor. Animations also do not match up with their sounds.
6) The graphics are low quality, even if you tweak them.

Positives:
1) Good ""Comfort"" system makes Griefers lives harder.

73,48540249,english,"game was great...but its becoming severely unbalanced due to feedback from a VERY SMALL playerbase, aka the fanatics of the game. The herbivores in the game stand no chance the majority of the time to their counter parts which normally wouldnt be a problem if the servers u play on have no rules. 

Here is where the problems start arising. 

Offical rules are under populated most of the time, and if they are populated, it will usually be one server of 40ish people (not alot).

Unoffcial servers have a higher population on average, making it, obviously, a safer server to play on considering you want to play a game with other people, BUT, they have very strict rules. For example Herbis cant outright attack carnivores etc.

The problem here is, you can accept the balancing for the game based on OFFICAL rules ONLY.  Where basically if you are a big carnivore, you are killing EVERYONE, since you probably had a head start, and no rivals.

If you play on UNOFFICAL servers, there are rules restricting your game play based on what you pick and being a Herbivore is downright painful at these times since theres literally no incentive to play them vs a carnivore.

These balances, or nerfs to the weaker dinos only exasperates the situation to the point where you are now playing on servers where 99% of the playerbase is a carnivore, and where , if you are new, the entire server has a head start on you.

What this boils down to, is if you are a fan of lets say Parasuars, or Apato (brontos) etc, you are basically wasting time grown a dino that will not last very long, and depending on the herbivore you pick , you will alway be at a disadvantage when fighting a carnivore at the same size as you...nevermind the giant carnivores that will stomp you flat in a one bite.

The last comlaint I have of this game is the favoritism the DEVs have on their discord, this being their main source for giving out information and taking in opinions on how to change the game. If  you mention or try to spark a debate on what could be changed, you will have the DEVs contradict you, cause they think since they created the game their opinons are more important and then the fanatics will follow and gang up on you. Not a good feeling and definitly not a feeling of open community.  THe devs are a SUPER SMALL team of two people who actually have a real life job, this game NOT being it. So if you expect your opinion to change anything, forget about it, unless you are one of these lil kids who spends 100% of their time in their main discord brown nosing...so goodluck with that.

The games in early access and it shows. Bottom line...servers are split between no rules where u will be playing a futile game of catch up, and eventually die, or playing on  private servers where you are restricted, and the nerfs they include will be an even greater detriment to your game.",1548415079,1560269532,False,1,0,0.474582046270370483,0,True,False,True,76561198006680017,183,29,50670,0,14530,1598178481,,

89,50464923,english,"First thing to get out of the way: if you are unwilling to deal with potentially game-breaking bugs, then do not get this game yet. 
This game is amazing fun - especially with friends. The mechanics built into the game create a dynamic experience - the best example of this is the talent tree. There are 3 branches (survival, power and speed), and you can use scent to find out which of those another player has gone into. Depending on what build they are, you decide how to hunt them - if you hunt them at all.                        
Comfort helps go combat things like mix and mega packing in order to help balance the game. Comfort decreases when nearby other players who are not in your party, in a storm, or if you are on land as an aquatic or in deep water as a terrestrial. Talents can be taken that reduce the comfort loss from these things. When you have low comfort, you slowly start to die.

Combat is very skill dependent - I wont go into detail, but anything in this game can kill anything else - if they play well enough (the exception is ptera v apato - pteras cannot damage apatos as they used to be able to attack and the apato would be unable to hit them).

I find the best way to learn is through playing - but if you find something that you think is unbalanced or bad, you can give feedback - and that feedback will be listened to by the devs. The devs themselves are friendly and communicate with the community

Infinite growth - it gives a lot of motivation to keep playing, and rewards people for surviving well. However, it is a bit unbalanced. Larger creatures can dominate a server if they play well enough. Solutions to this have been suggested.

6,49884766,english,"I'm going to be completely honest here; When I bought the game, I had a neutral opinion on it. I had seen very few gameplay videos, and I thought that if I ended up giving it a negative review it would be because it was a poorly made copy of The Isle. However, within the first hour of playing it, I realized that it's not really as similar to The Isle as everyone makes it out to be. Of course, the game does have a lot of good features that are overlooked, but with how the game is currently doing, the cons heavily outweigh the pros.
This game does really have a lot of potential. It has a ton of fun mechanics and features. The variety of different playable creatures makes it quite a bit more unique. And I don't specifically mean the species, I mean the types of dinosaurs. There are flyers, aquatic dinos, carnivores and herbivores. Each have their own unique skill trees suitable to the label.

I noticed right off that the game was really glitchy and bugged from the start. As a land-roaming dinosaur, I would run in to invisible walls on random parts of the map that others wouldn't run in to. Once I ran in to one, more started to appear out of random, and it would get so bad that I couldn't move from one spot, and my game would crash, or freeze, to the point where I would have to open task manager and force close the game. As a flyer, even if I barely touched a wall or something while in the air, my dinosaur would lose all animations and freeze up, and hit the ground and I couldn't move. Again, I would have to relog, and sometimes that wouldn't work, so I would have to respawn completely. Even now, these bugs still happen but not as often after the updates. Even compared to The Isle, which has A LOT more detail, textures, bigger maps, and more players on one map, I can run that game on all cinematic graphics with 30-50 FPS. This game however, with only a small amount of players per server, smaller maps, less details and textures, and even less foliage, I can hardly get up to 30 FPS on low graphics.

The developers also are a bit of a con in this game. I've noticed multiple times that they would announce an update that was suppose to come out the next day, but when the time came, the update wasn't there, and again an announcement that the update would be the NEXT day. Again, still no update.

The community itself is pretty toxic, as I've seen a lot of other reviews stating. Admins for servers usually encourage the behaviour, or, just don't do anything about it, making it seem to other players like it's completely fine to do so. If this were the only con to this game, I wouldn't be giving it a negative review, because the community shouldn't affect the overall review of a game. I thought that this should just be mentioned.

The game is also progressively unstable. Updates have made some of the maps completely unusable, and the maps that are still able to be used are extremely small. Even the biggest map in the game is painfully small, but bearable since servers can only support up to 50 players currently. I suspect that this will be changed later on since the game is still early access, but more work could definitely be put into the maps, regardless of their size. They're extremely bare and stale, with nothing that really makes them unique. Even the ruins that are found on a few of the maps are exactly the same. The ruins on one map has the exact same layout, details and even textures as on the other maps. Somehow, even though there isn't much actually to the maps, crashes are still extremely common and random, usually for no reason at all. I'll have great FPS, no lag, and without warning or even a drop in FPS, the game just closes itself out with a crash message.

Last but not least, the animations for pretty much all of the dinosaurs are stiff. There's little to no fluidity in the movements of the dinosaurs when walking, roaring, eating, etc. It seems as if minimum effort has been put into their models and animations. This also goes for the sounds that each dinosaur makes. The audio track for the roars don't blend at all with the rest of the sounds, and for some dinos, like the Pterodon, every sound it makes sounds almost the same. You can't tell which sound is friendly, aggressive, etc. Dinosaurs that have been in the game the longest are the only ones that are at least a little decent, like the Megalosaur. It has more calls than the other playable creatures. I believe it has 5 different calls, maybe 6, while other dinosaurs only have 3, or at most 4. 

Overall, as I said, this game does have a ton of potential, and I hope that in the future, the updates help it rather than make it worse. I definitely don't hate the game, or even dislike it. I just get very frustrated with it. I definitely don't plan on playing the game anymore until there are much more updates to fix it, so for now I'm going to uninstall and hope that it gets better sooner rather than later.",1554076943,1554077156,False,17,1,0.681774318218231201,1,True,False,True,76561198093363439,124,12,535,0,505,1561261900,,
7,49881425,english,"Fun game, but flawed. Rewards players who pay attention to details. Has a lot of promise for an EA.

Good things:

Nesting: Fun and rewards players for sticking with their dino and herding. Also is well balanced with you having to put some points into Good Parent if you want your babies to be able to do well.
Comfort: Makes it impossible for people to do one of the worst things that plagues multiplayer animal survival games- Carebearing. Also forces you to act like a dinosaur would and seek shelter. Makes storms especially tense.
Tide: Adds more difficulty to being a mosa (unless they're a land mosa). Makes people have to pay attention to the tide and to escape to other islands while they can.
Bonding: Rewards players for forming herds/packs. Also makes it so you have to be in a herd/pack with another player for a while before you can nest.
Updating: This game is getting better constantly. While I would like to get The Isle as well, I saw gameplay of BoB and knew I had to buy it. It's updating so much more than The Isle is and is fulfilling promises it makes instead of making them and forgetting about them for two years.
Underwater tunnels: Tunnels allow mosas to sneak into lakes unseen, making drinking from the water especially scary.
Herbivore gameplay: Herbivore gameplay is both fun and terrifying. Unless you make your way into a huge herd, you're always scared that you might get killed. Even when you do get into a huge herd, the conflicting needs of every species in it keeps it difficult, as there's always a time where you have to leave the herd alone to get food or water, leaving you vulnerable to predators.
Weather: The weather in this game makes it so that basic needs and avoiding enemies aren't the only danger. Weather picks off players who haven't put enough points into resistances or haven't been traveling to find safe places. The different type of weather: Tornadoes, rain storms, floods, and thunder storms make it impossible to be prepared for everything, constantly keeping you on your toes.
Fishing: Fishing is actually a thing you can do, making it rewarding to put some points into adapting to fish.
Player Freedom: Despite the confines of comfort levels, there is still a way to have plenty of freedom in the game thanks to perks. You can be a velociraptor that takes down much larger prey, or a battle-ready parasaurolophus, whatever you want.
Perks: Sadly underused in these types of games. They make you have to work for certain things on top of all the other challenges.
Iridescent feathers: A small thing, but I love how a velociraptor's black feathers are iridescent.

Bad things:

Glitches: This probably won't last forever, considering this game is EA and they are working on patching bugs. But it is annoying when you lose high-level dinosaurs to falling through the world or getting stuck in rocks.
Land mosas: Thanks to perks in the game, they can become so OP that they can crawl inland as far as they please as long as they take a dip every once in a while. They need to be much more difficult to unlock and need a way to counter it. They are very fast on the ground and resistant to drying out.
Fleshgrazer pteras: Again, perks in the game. A ptera with fleshgrazer can easily kill anything, and there's not exactly anything you can do to kill it thanks to how fast they are. They need to have a damage nerf to things in higher weight classes  and to slow down after biting something (since a ptera can't just vacuum the meat up, they'd have to carry it and make sure they don't drop it). Or, maybe another flyer (quetzalcoatlus?) that specializes in hunting them, similar to kronos specializing in hunting mosas, to make it so pteras aren't pretty much invincible and don't have to worry about getting picked off by other flyers.
Customization: I love the customization in this game, but it's annoying to have to endure eye-bleeding dinos. Maybe if players have especially bright colors or too many of them, they are more likely to get sick, or give the dinos around them a morale debuff? There should be some way to discourage it.
KOSing: There should be a way to discourage KOSing and spawnkilling in life cycle servers. Maybe players who KOS are much easier to detect, or louder?
Community: I know this isn't exactly the devs' fault, but there should be some more admins in official servers to keep people from constantly insulting each other. Kinda annoying for the first thing you see in the server to be people throwing slurs at each other and anyone who intervenes getting yelled at too.",1554061030,1554061030,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,True,76561198799172348,13,5,5656,0,1162,1585406179,,

Game has not even been out half a year and ALREADY people are engaging in cancerous/ bad behaviour such as camping (usually with intimidation on), KOSing and similar things. 

Even the devs are starting to be undesirable people as a couple of months ago or so, I posted a thread about a strange bug I was having with the game where it seemed to work fine but when I joined a server and the creature selection screen was about to load, I would suddenly get booted back to the main menu without even a disconnect message. A few forum mods (IDK their names were yellow) were helpful with the issue but it seemed like a few others were having the same problem (Did manage to fix the problem but only for a short time.). 

HOWEVER some time later for absolutely no apparent reason at all, I was hit with a community ban with the false accusation of being toxic in the forums. You can imagine I got annoyed at this as I was no way toxic in the forums at all, so in response I joined the Discord server as I was pretty sure this was either a mistake or a false positive. I went ahead and contacted Predatoria being polite as I possibly could in hopes I could get the ban removed.

Boy was I wrong! Instead of professionalisim I was met with immediate anger and hostility, with Predatoria even saying ""The ban stays. You earned it."" Excuse me? This just goes to show that the game is already going down the shitter, and should be avoided since the devs and forum mods are starting to be needlessly hostile over people asking for simple bug fixes. Even if they do so politely might I add!

15,49531236,english,"So, here is the thing; I love this game. I really do. Just look at the amount of hours I have put into it so far.

But I can't give it a thumbs up.

The overall game is sound. Albeit, a bit glitchy with a good number of bugs to work out. But the developers are working on that.
The graphics are decent enough. Not as good as The Isle, but still decent.
The gameplay is fantastic. If you like survival games and dinosaurs, this is definitely one to have in the library!

It has all these fantastic things going on for it and yet it is marginally let down by the community who play it.
Admins have complete control over the servers (and rightly so, admins should have complete control). But they often abuse their positions and if you are not on their friends list, expect a hard time getting anywhere in game. Most come across as spoiled children.
You will always have a group of 4-5 people (Usually close friends with the admins) who have huge dinosaurs, are always online and kill on sight. Expect to die a lot (They often use the excuse that they need to feed, but I have had large dinosaurs myself and it is not hard to keep well fed on random spawns). You will really need to be a patient person and not care too much about progress to enjoy this game.
Roleplay and realism servers often preach huge amounts of rules in order to make it more enticing for those (like myself) who enjoy the realistic aspects of playing certain types of dinosaurs, having a realistic lifecycle etc, and who like the idea of playing a ""dinosaur life sim"" but the admins rarely follow these rules themselves and there is a good number of people who abuse the bugs in the game purely to ""get bigger"", ""more growth"".
There is no growth cap. So you sometimes get very weird things happening, like a dinosaur that is meant to be tiny but manages to kill a T-Rex because it has lived for such a long time that it is bigger than one. A growth cap for all dinosaurs would probably be a good idea. Please take note developers. You guys are doing a fantastic job so far ;)
Servers often crash. Once every few hours on the ones that I frequent. Which can be annoying if you have stashed away food only to have it all wiped away each time a crash happens.
I have noticed a lot of people have complained about the ""Comfort"" mechanic. Personally I think it is awesome. It makes people very aware of the shifting weather and challenging when trying to find shelter (Saying that, you can just stand next to a large rock for partial shelter, so I really have no idea why people are fussing over this so much. It is not hard to survive the storms and it is a fun addition to the game which I think makes people more attentive to the survival aspects rather than just a ""whoever is the biggest wins the fight"" kind of feel that it so often has currently.

I have no idea what the future holds for this game. It is currently unbalanced and It is still being worked on. But it seems to be slowly trundling in a good direction and I doubt I will stop playing it anytime soon, despite how often I take a step back from the game due to frustration with the admins or the few individuals who seem hell bent on trying to ruin everyone's day.
But I highly recommend getting it if you enjoy this sort of game. It really is an awesome game. But I also recommend going into it with the idea of possibly investing in your own server. Because playing on other peoples servers tends to be a bit crap when you take into account everything I have mentioned above.

The KOS, Targeting, Insulting, and especially Griefing ( <-- SEARCH THIS, SERIOUSLY). Ruining player experience because people find it funny and fun to do. 

The game has good mechanics, yes. It has good sounds, yes. Decent graphics, somewhat bad meshes, and textures, beautiful skins which i love with all my heart. But the community makes me stop there and quit this game, i occasionally run into nice people but in which case is EXTREMELY RARE. Game needs some work.

In every server i've been in there is ALWAYS rule breakers, i mean alot. Selfish children who KOS for the fun of it. And once again another copy cat game of the isle where Isle's community follows up into this games community. Full of toxic griefing brats. 

In short, the people seem to focus mainly on survival than sandbox modes for here. I find survival to be a huge waste of time in toxic communities such as these. You spend 5hrs or longer growing and just have someone bigger come around and KOS you. Or have someone chase you across the map. I'm just really sick of people these days, everyday in each and every game i play for hours i spend to get away from school and life seems to not help anymore with how bad people have grown with these type of dinosaur game's, KOS this, KOS that. In all honosty, i want a refund. But i love the game itself if it wasn't for the people.

There are quite a few bugs present in the game, such as the crashing, but that's to be expected from an early access game, and I can overlook them relatively easily. There's also some slight balancing issues with some of the creatures, but again, that's to be expected from a relatively new game, and I'm sure they'll be sorted out in the future.

In my opinion, the game does a good job of offering a variety of play styles with each creature, and is pretty good at encouraging players to explore the world, either it be to find food or to find shelter to escape natural disasters like heavy storms and tornadoes.

Customization is very cool. 
Talent trees are neat and give you something to look forwards to when you die and start over.

Cons:
Lag is pretty bad while fighting sometimes and servers are crashing pretty regularly after 2-3 hours.
Group comfort bonuses are a tad on the strong side. 
Unofficial servers don't have a lot of rules, while unofficials might have ""weird rules"".
Glitches can and will kill you. People will break rules and kill you on unofficials when they shouldn't (not everyone reads the rules, most servers keep theirs on discord).

You can be a Birb and its working fine not like in an specific other game

[ Engine : Unreal Engine 4 ]

- Performance : Needs some Attention (Better CPU & GPU Usage)
- Latency : Needs some Attention (Some players just Teleport or have lags/ruberbanding)
- Bugs : couple of
- Models : They are OK but an Overhaul/Update would not be wrong  (This Means Map & Dinosaurs)
- Foliage & Map : Needs to get a bit Updated some places have Invisible Water, Trees & Stuff. Some Terrain is to Sharp so you also stuck on that (abit more Using of the Smooth Tool) 
- Admins & Mods : Always Online on Official Servers, answering Questions and Take Feedback & Bug Reports aswell 
- Features : For being out Roughly 10 Days and having this kind of Features is a good start, hopefully Devs will not Stick on it and keep it only this way

The perk system is a really nice mechanic that allows you to really build yourself to your playstyle, with three main arms - Combat, Survival and Speed/Utility, you gain perk points as you grow and you only stop growing when you are dead (though you will have increasingly diminishing returns as you grow past full size).

Obviously it is early access so rough around the edges as the devs focus on content / balance over optimisation and I am greatly looking foward to the new dinos to be added to the game (have a look at the suggestions sticky on the community hub for the list of confirmed dinos).

Yes, Isle has better graphics but the advantage ends there.
Bermuda > Isle in every way besides graphics 

Also BoB is ran on Unreal engine it has good graphics (turn ur graphics settings up bro)
The Isle is still a GREAT game and you should still play it (i have nearly 1,000 hours played on isle) 

Don't want to die on the Isle? Growing never stops on BoB, you'll want to live more than you did on Isle
Somewhat bored of land? Be a Pteradon and fly around or be a giant fish and swim around

Swim into low tide get stuck in puddle then get killed by a T rex
Be a giant fish that can grab dinosaurs and pull them into underwater caves to be eaten

Underwater caves are everywhere on the map, explore and learn where they go.
Unlike The Isle semi aquatic dinosaurs actually swim faster in water (real suchomimus)

That should be enough examples to prove Beast of Bermuda is the better game.

They put their focus away from the bells and whistles and attempt to focus on keeping the community and game stablization in check. So let's got on with this review, I guess. Sue me for it being in a bad format, for this is the first time I have reviewed the game.

[u][b]Positives[/b][/u]
[list]
   [*]Game is fairly stable with some lag and map glitches, though those are actively being looked into.
   [*]There is no limit to customization when it comes to skins. While you have a ""template"" to work with, preset markings, they can be any colour. Realistic or neon. However, neons don't often survive save for Apatosaurs and Pterosaurs.
   [*]Pretty big variaty. You not only have herbivores and carnivores, but also flying and aquatic creatures. More creatures are actively being planned, and paid for, for implementation into the game.
   [*]The better people in the community are willing to help and talk.
   [*]That staff is generally kind and understanding so long as you keep yourself from becoming a problem. If major issues arise, they are willing to listen and deal with the situation.
[/list]

[u][b]Negatives[/b][/u]
[list]
   [*]There seems to be people actively jumping onto the game in an attempt to ruin it for others. This leaves many of the official servers, and some non-official, to become toxic cesspools. It's best to steer clear of those servers if you can and join non-official ones that are actively being patroled with an heavy hand.
   [*]Bugs can sometimes be common, though they are often patched as soon as the develeopers lives can allow them to do so.
   [*]There seems to, sadly, be a void in power. There are no rules on official servers, even though not everything is there to set up mechanics to keep things such as Killing-on-Sight from happening. I would strong ask that rules do be impletmented for these things. (Note: that being said, there are rules about hate speech, slander, and the like.)
[/list]

So here are some final things.
[olist]
   [*]Don't get up in arms because someone happens to colour their skin in a way you don't like. Move out and ignore it. There is no point in complaining about something that is not in your control. If you cannot handle that, do not buy this game.
   [*][u]At the time of this review[/u] do not treat the game as a final product. Do not treat the game as a Triple-A release. It is neither. It is an indy game made by a small group of people that is still in development. There are going to be flaws, glitches, and crashes. If you cannot handle that, do not buy this game.
   [*]Do not come onto this game to spread lies and slander because someone told you that BoB stole code/skins/etc. from -insert other dinosaur game here-. It's slander. It is lies. If you honestly believe this slander, then don't buy this game.
[/olist]

As a kronosaurus I kept dying due to my oxygen bar never filling up despite going up for air among other bugs and problems I've constantly encountered which makes the game not very fun or enjoyable when constantly dying to glitches or being bugged out.

To be honest, if the game lags so bad you can't even move you should probably refund and get better software, the games state is no reason to leave a bad review because of your system specs. It works just fine for me and I have an average computer. Also, The Isle has worked out their lags and glitches much better because it's been around for 3-4 years now while as Beasts of Bermuda only about 3 weeks. Give it time before leaving a bad review because it's ""too laggy"".



It has a lot of things to do but is punishing at death, fair, but punishing. The growth times are fair enough and the reason, mind you, why death is punishing is to actually make players care about their creature and actually want them to live. It's fair. What isn't fair are the mix packers in this game, the game GREATLY prevents mix packing but it's still a problem. Ptera scouts, land and water creatures teaming up, heck, I've even heard of semi-aquatics teaming up with ACTUAL aquatics which makes some deaths unfair and non-avoidable. People camp, as well of course, but spawn-camping has been prevented, THANKFULLY.

The game's good, the community isn't, the game tries its best to provide you the most efficient play-experience and I appreciate that and it does work for the most part, everything's fair, yet it's not easy. Grab it if you like dinosaurs & sandbox games. Many different playstyles to experience not just with every creature but with the talents and builds you set up. Also super fun in packs, not so much large herds, however.

You can fix this by putting talent points into weather resistance, while also becoming vulnerable to literally everything else on the map. I can understand if there were buffs to go along with stress but it shouldn't take health away because you'll probably die anyway to LIGHTNING. If you don't want to put points into weather resistance, you can find a cave to fix your stress if you're lucky. But there are hardly any caves within a reasonable distance of any drinkable water source, and ALL of them are filled with larger carnivores anyway. And even if you do find one that doesn't have a full grown rex in it, it'll get flooded by the rain anyway. But not just the cave will get flooded, the ENTIRE ISLAND will get flooded. And with the flood, come the mosasaurs who can leap out of the water to the tiny patch of land that's left, grab you, and pull you in.

Plus it kept telling me to update which didn't make sense since I just got the game so it should already be up to date. So I refunded.

Then I started browsing the net n youtube n found BoB. I was really on the fence about getting the game since they just released. Fresh out of the oven. Or still cooking (since it's still early access).

Same problem for me since I'm in SEA, all the servers had high ping but I tried joining one of them anyways. To my surpirse, this game actually allowed me to play it. Yea it can be a bit laggy for me but it worked!

About BoB itself...

It has more features than the other dino game, it lets you customize your color, and people are kind enough to noobs like me.

Yes, the game isn't as pretty as the other game but it works. I haven't encountered any game breaking bugs and I think for an early access game, this is pretty good.

I hope in the future the devs will continue to update, bugfix and improve the game because I see potential. 

I recommend you try it n see for yourself.

Update:

I got kicked out of a server by the admin for protecting my herd.
So we were 2 Apatos (I'm one of them) and 4 Paras (1 adult) and we were attacked by 2 Rexes. The adult Paras was blocking the bridge to prevent one of the Rexes from crossing to get to us and the other Rex attacked my fellow Apato. So me, being the bigger Apato proceeded to attack the Rex. I whipped the Rex real good (could hear its bones crush).
The other Rex (the one who was blocked by the adult Paras) turned out to only want water so they let him through. Me, not knowing that and being in the heat of the moment (not reading chat) went on to attacking the other Rex that attacked first. I wasn't gonna kill it but weaken it enough to make sure it doesn't attack again. Turns out, something happened in the chat (I didn't really see cuz I was focused on protecting the herd) that led to me getting kicked. So the Rexes were crying to the admins telling them I was bullying it. I mean, it attacked first, how was I bullying it? So yeah, I lost my Apato.

96,48000835,english,"Beasts of Bermuda, a passion project by a group of dev's taking their first steps into game making. This game shows much promise and is pretty ambitious having been released with so much content right out of the gate. All this is mind it is unfortunate that i simply cannot recommend this game in its current state.

My reason for not recommending this game stems from a few problems that i'm going to try and explain in a brief but constructive manner, starting with how the game runs.

I have a pretty hefty computer to say the least, i can run pretty notoriously taxing games in terms of graphics on mostly high settings such as Ark or The Isle (I apologize for those of you who dislike hearing that name) but this game jugs along so terribly i'm afraid of crashing just trying to move even with everything graphics wise set to the lowest setting and playing on servers of 30 ping or lower. I am aware a update recently with SOME optimization changes but I feel future updates need to focus on this. Personally i think a big first step is changing the scent system, decreasing the size and overbearing-ness of the cent clouds as well as may be decreasing the range at which things can be sniffed out as rendering every object, water source, and creature on the map definitely makes the frame rate drop even greater.

My next big problem is combat, it's pretty awful i must say. Creature balancing is off as even when playing a full grown animal i was taken down by a tyrannosaurus half my size (granted i was a ichyovinator but i still feel a fresh rex should not be able to kill an adult animal.) I also feel that having your only method of defence if you are a slower animal being attached to a bar is, redundant. Suppose you get attacked by another player, you know you can take them so long as you land your hits, but you miss that one attack and now you don't have the power to save yourself and by the time you can attack again you've been killed, or instead of missing you straight up do not have enough of this meter to finish of the animal who may very well be on their deathbed as you've landed every hit. I am okay with the ability bar, but i feel like attaching your method of defense to it is a terrible idea and would instead work better with say, special attacks. Attacks that do tons of damage upon hitting your ability key (listed as q in the controls menu) but have a limited use before they can be active again, allowing players to have a use for the ability meter but not having to rely on it for defence. They don't even have to be attacks! Give animals a speed boost when they hit that button or temporary armor but having it attached to your primary defense leaves you with only three guaranteed ways of survival:

- Never play anything but rex so you can kill just about every other animal
- Always play with a friend because playing alone is a death sentence 
- Always play ptera and just avoid fighting things going full scavenger mode, flying around until you find a abandoned corpse to steal.

My final problem with the game is the stress system. I feel it's too finicky. Now, I am aware there are ingame upgrades to reduce your animals stress as well as plants and crystals you can find and consume but there is a problem here. Firstly, the upgrades are almost useless, as accumulating points takes FOREVER unless you are killing other players, which as mentioned is impossible to do unless you are a rex or have at least one friend with you every time you play. And the aforementioned anti-stress edibles are either hard to reach or very rare, making them practically pointless. Again this is a situation where I like the idea but the execution is poorly done. I feel that instead of death by stress (though more realistic to modern animals yes) you should instead receive debuffs after your stress has reached a certain level. This gives players the chance to find area's or way to relieve there animals stress while still making it a notable danger. Now how do you keep it dangerous? Well a few examples may be;

- Certain animals do less damage the more stressed they become
- Being too close to a potentially hostile animal for prolonged periods decreases your stamina, giving you reason to keep your distance so you can run if they turn on you
- Stress via bad weather can make you slower giving you incentive to find shelter and stay dry.

These are just my opinions, idea's, and suggestions. As negative as this review may have seemed I still want to see this game become better, I want to see less store assets and more original, hand made assets, I want to see better and more optimized graphics, I want to see more polished mechanics that aren't skin related. I have hopes for the future of this game, the dev's, despite being new to development, have the potential. I want to see the best Beasts of Bermuda that this game can be, but right now, I cannot recommend this game.

3,47733677,english,"Obv this games EA so all this is WIP and the games changing:
The Good
BoB has tips explaining how things work, such as the comfort system
Theres decent diveristy among the playable creatures. You can be 3 herbivores, 3 carnivores, 1 flying animal (eat fish), and 2 aquatic animals (both eat meat). 
Theres a skill system where you can get points to spend on developing skills, which is useful for focusing on specific playstyles 
You may also customize specific parts of the color of your dinosaur's skin (though not all dinos are set up for this at the moment)
There is also a comfort mechanic which punishes players for doing things a dinosaur shouldn't do (like be a rex and hangout with herbivores for no reason)
Also I'm pretty sure there is locational damage (hits to the tail will do less damage than to the body or head) but I didn't get to test this much. You'll find out why below

The Bad
Players can set their skins as ugly colors such as neon green and pink, which kills immersion if there was any to begin with. I think there are servers that only allow natural colors to be applied to dinosaurs, but I didn't find any so maybe they aren't in yet? Also you can color specific parts of dinos, but some of the parts don't seem to affect anything.
Also good luck finding people, I hardly could. A lot, if not all of maps are very very large, so even with 80 people you won't find much action. This is why I couldn't test if locational damage was actually in, because i only had one fight, which isn't enough to tell off of
The Deathmatch gamemode (Combat) is for people to fight in ""small maps"" for the fun of combat. Death has little consequence. However, one map for this (I don't know how many there are in total, I didn't have time to check that out because I wanted to stay below 2 hours in gametime so I could refund if I wanted to) was actually decently large for some reason. I spawned in and was greeted to a sizeable island with many parts and pathways. There was even a bridge in the ocean leading to an island with a giant temple on it. It definitely wasn't the small arena map I imagined/was promised on the store page. Perhaps the other maps, if they are in the game currently, are better though
As mentioned before, you can play as a flying animal (pteranadon) and two marine animals (kronosaurus and mosasaurus). These both have their own problems: pteras seem to be almost unable to land safely, doing so depends on your precise skill, the phase of the moon, the direction the wind is blowing, your own karma, and the will of God. What I'mn trying to say is - it's nearly impossible. I've carefully landed my ptera on perfectly safe terrain, only to consistently break every bone in my body. I only managed to land safely once. Taking off again also seems to be very strange. Didn't matter what I did, sometimes it worked,  and most times I just hovered on the ground for a few seconds before landing again. As for marine animals, it's just... Very boring. The only thing you have to worry about is other members of your species, and the other marine species you share the ocean with. You pretty much just eat the same prey over and over again, or hope and pray that some fool swims acrossed the ocean for you to attack. They aren't worth playing as
The game is also pretty ugly at every corner, the models look low quality and have crappy animations, the maps look like they were made by a kid, the sounds are unfitting and/or just stock sounds, weather changes dramatically in the blink of an eye, the UI is very intrusive and ugly, looking like something out of a mobile game (actually, this entire game looks like a mobile port to PC)
Other players don't render in until you are closer than you should be. It isn't close enough to be exploitable or risky to survival, but it's definitely too close. Also, I don't know if this is a bug or intended, but marine animals seem to render in from even less distance, which is actually pretty game breaking. I was an apatosaurus with my feet in water, not very deep. All of a sudden a mosasaurus renders in from about 10 feet away and starts biting me. It' pretty lame. You can hear other players from much too far away though, which is also odd and offputting. It sounds like they are about twenty feet away from you, but alas no players are in sight. I know they come from other players, because they are stomps and roars tht originate from a specific direction. Who is the sound coming from? We shall never know
There are also some weird desgin choices, which I'll list below in bullet points

- theres a mechanic that slows you down if you go uphill (moreso on the heavier dinosaurs) and speeds you up if you go downhill. It sounds good on paper, but its actually quite annoying to deal with. A parasaurolophus is advertised as an herbivore that uses its speed to get away form threats, but if its on even a mild incline it will go ridiculously slow so good luck surviving the way it's meant to, as the terrain is commonly uneven. You can level up a skill to mitigate this, but it hardly did anything when I maxed it
- Parasaurolophus it can hop into the air not once, not twice, but a full five times before running out of stamina. The fact that it can even jump at all struck me as strange, since it's obviously a very large, heavy animal. It can hardly make its way up a mild rise in terrain, but can hop around like a kangaroo? It's just bizarre and backwards
- You can smell the air to see herbivore food, drinkable water, and meat across great distances. Perhaps too great. Also, the button to sniff is bound to A, which is also the key to move left. This means that if you want to move left, your dinosaur will also start loudly sniffing rapidly, and if you want to sniff, you will start to wander off to the left unless you also hold D (the key to move to the right)
- Ptera has a 120 second cooldown timer on it. If you die as one, you have to wait until 120 seconds have passed to be it again. I tested all the other dinosaurs, and not even t-rex had this. Im not sure why the devs put this in, but boy is it annoying. Don't quote me on this next part: but I'm pretty sure this cooldown timer is also in the Free-Roam gamemode, which is even more odd because isn't that gamemode supposed to be for messing around, with no restrictions?

I think the strongest negative thing about this game is that it completely fails to measure up to its competition: The Isle. This is the game that Predatoria - the lead dev - was inspired by. Both games have the same gamemodes. A survival gamemode where you pick any dinosaur you want, and go through its life and grow up to be an adult, and a sort of ""free for all"" gamemode where you can just spawn as any dinosaur in the adult stage without having to work for anything, and death has little to no consequence. In The Isle they are called ""Survival"" and ""Sandbox"". In this game they are called ""Life Cycle"" and ""Free Roam"". This game does however feature a deathmatch gamemode, which is purely for fighting and action with little consequence in death, but that is easily simulated in The Isle on the sandbox gamemode with a small map. All it's missing is the skill system

I guess what I'm getting at is that both games are pretty similar, but one pales in comparison to the other. They're both trying to fill the same/similar niche, but one beats the other pretty hard (in my eyes anyway). The Isle, while lacking aquatic and flying animals for the time being, is MUCH more polished, pretty, farther in development. It has less mechanics atm, but that hardly matters when BoB's are all half baked. A good analogy is that The Isle is a nice, well-cooked meal while this game is a big buffet, but all the food is kinda gross. Quantity over quality is BoB's current state. The devs shoulda developed it more. The Isle also costs less atm, at 13 dollars. When it's not on sale its 20, the same as this game. A much better use

5,47873926,english,"I've been really trying to enjoy this game but after 14 or so hours all I can say is it feels like this game was designed to be as unenjoyable for a solo player as possible. Rather than just riff on the game though, I want to offer some constructive feedback. Lets assume you want to play as a carnivore, this is usually how gameplay goes; you spawn in, and you need water. You go to water. If at the water, or at any point along the way you are seen by any other dinosaur that has lived longer than you, it effortlessly runs you down and murders you. If you are lucky enough to avoid detection by another dinosaur (even a herbivore), you now need food. You don't deal enough damage to actually kill anything as a fresh spawn, so you probably have to scavenge. That means whatever killed the prey is probably still in the area, so you either starve to death or try to get food and get murdered (again, often by a herd of herbivores). That said, you will probably see carnivores when you play. So what's going on? Every single carnivore player I have met that wasn't a fresh spawn was in a pack, these range anywhere from a pair to over 5 or 6. The combat is horribly laggy and unbalanced, so if you are outnumbered you are guaranteed death. What this means is as a solo player, your only option is to be a herbivore, or play an aquatic and hope that there isn't a mega pack of mosasaurs near you.

Even if you play a herbivore, the game has a storm system that stresses you out. The only way to not be killed just by existing outside during a storm is to find a cave. There is no way to find a cave if you don't already know where one is, and I have never found one. These storms last as long as two hours, so for the entirety of that gameplay you are sitting in cave doing nothing. In addition, on official servers the devs/admins regularly abuse their powers. A user called 'Terror Panda' has created cyclones ontop of players who killed him to get revenge, and once when I killed him (not knowing who it was), he respawned ontop of me with a giant mosasaur and one-shot me (I was also a mosasaur at about 80% health), then dissapeared. I have even heard from the discord that the devs ban people from official servers just for killing them, but I would take this one with a grain of salt.

Aside from the obvious problems like lag, sever disconnects, crashes and bugs, along with the generally bad models and HORRENDOUS animations that look like they were taken from a mobile game, the gameplay seems designed to support armies of players who just have their buddies spawn as apatosaurs and feed them so they can dominate the server. 

I think a lot of changes need to be made to make the game actually enjoyable for a solo player, but I only listed the two most important ones here.

#1. Make Growth 'Stages' instead of staying as the same 'type'. Right now if you spawn as say, a t.rex, you are exactly the same as any other t.rex of any growth except you are weaker in every stat, -including- speed. This means if a bigger dinosaur sees you, there is noting you can do to get away, and you are too weak to fight it off. To combat this, I suggest having unique growth stages with set stats. So instead of getting, say, a 1% increase to all stats per growth tick (Not sure what the number is, this is just for example), you spawn as a 'Juvie' or 'Stage 1' Rex with flat stats, and once you have lived long enough you could advance to a 'Adolescent' or 'Stage 2' rex. This way, fights between dinosaurs of your size is fair, and more importantly it could be set that juvies are automatically faster than adults, or at least configurable by the developers. So a juvie rex, while far too weak to fight an adult, would be faster and able to escape. This is probably one of the biggest changes that needs to be made.

#2. Groups need major nerfs. Right now all that matters in a fight is how many buddies you have, and as such being in a group is purely a better choice than solo play. To combat this, I feel groups need some serious balancing. For a start, groups need a max cap. I have often seen mega packs of five, or six, or even more trexes. Such a number is impossible for a single rex player to ever combat, or even escape from, so rather than giving groups such a gigantic advantage, limit their numbers and apply stress/discomfort when more than the limit are present. However, this in itself doesn't fix the main issue, the pure power advantage of a group. Two rexes will still always beat one rex, no matter how skilled the solo player is, and two rexes will always have an easier time getting food than one rex. My solution is such: Tie growth more closely to feeding; this way one rex will get, say, 100% of the value of a carcass, and grow faster. Two rexes can only get 50% each (assuming they share), and so would each grow slower than the solo player.


*New Edit*

Apparently the apatosaurs in the game is literally worthless. It's stomp attack has such a long wind up that literally any other dinosaur can effortlessly defeat you just by staying in front you and biting, then backing up a few feet , then running in again. There is literally nothing you can do about it. The tail whip has such terrible collision that even if you attack from behind you aren't going to hit anything either.

*New Edit 2*

As of the current patch, the Pteranodon can do a metric shitload of damage which means swarms of them are going around and spawn killing everything. Once they see you they are too fast, laggy, and small to accurately hit and they easily two or three shot even larger dinosaurs like the Lurdusaurus.

8,47927392,english,"So first of all, I dont write a review quickly and I dont want this to come off as a rant as this game does have potential.

The concept itself is great and I was excited when this came as I followed it for a while now, sadly I cant say I have been enjoying it a whole lot.

So yes, this game is early access and there are alot of bugs and glitches.. and with alot I really do mean alot. Not to forget the whole thing gets rather laggy if you are on a crowded server. Now these are things I can get over because these are all things thats not uncommon for an early access game.

Some of the good things about this game is a well done skill system, day/night cycle, weather system with tides and storms, comfort system and you can play in the air, on land and even in the water.

That being said, the graphics are mediocre at best, the world feels empty, there is no AI and there just isnt much to do at all... And one of the biggest things that annoyed me is the sounds.. Good lord they suck HARD. And you will hear a dino's footsteps like they are next to you even though they might be a mile away from you.

Your journey as a lone player will probably go like this: You start out as an infant, hope there arent bigger guys camping the spawn point and move on in the search for carcasses laying on the ground and a puddle of water to drink for using your scent. Then most likely after wandering around in a lifeless enviroment for a couple of hours hoping you'll grow soon you'll meet a gang of carni's you cant possibly outrun and be dead in seconds. Then you start over.. and repeat. 

Thats been my experience so far besides one time where I grew up as an adult megalo. Logged back into the server one day to find me rezzed next to a t-rex 5 feet away who again killed me in seconds.

So I doubt I will be playing this game anytime soon again but I'll keep an eye on it, but as for now this game is just not worth spending 20 euro's on and I cant possibly recommend it to anyone unless you can see past all the negative and have a few hardcore gaming friends to team up with.",1546094591,1546094944,False,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True,76561197968086960,96,1,1491,0,1491.0,1546091404,,

10,47913864,english,"So, I bought this game with excitement and pride the day it came out, and the first few days of playing it reminded me of the old days of the isle. Everyone was running around killing each other, it was a load of fun, I spent several hours just obsessing over BoB and telling everyone this game had the superior gameplay.

The good
- You can fully costumize your dinosaur with a selection of skins, for some people it's a double edge sword because I have come across dinosaurs that are bright pink, purple, blue, which could be said ""ruins the immersion"". That being said most bright colored dinosaurs are the big strong ones like apatosaurus and a fully grown trex, things that don't really need to hide. You never see little animals as glow sticks because they are quickly eaten since they are a dinner plate beacon as well as defenseless, giving a reality to the phrase ""natural selection"".
- The enviroment changes are stunning, I myself, prefer to play a marine animal to enjoy the cycles of the tide. There is nothing more satisfying then swimming into a forest that would otherwise be dry land, as dinosaurs are struggling to keep out of the rising flood while a twister is flinging players through the air in the background.
- The pvp is a lot more relaxed and less constricting compared to BoB competitor (the isle), occasionally I have actually come out of a pvp situation where I am a the disadvantage, which is always a terrific feeling. Even dying is dare I say... more relaxing? Because you're not always at a massive disadvantage if someone is a little more grown than you but you are still able to play better than them.

The bad
I'm disappointed to write this part, because on release the game was really fun, and I wish it would have stayed that way.

- Your dinosaur never stops growing. At first, your thought might be, how could that ever be bad? You continue to grow, your stats continue to grow, you become a powerful almighty. Well your stats keep growing with your dinosaur, which means your food and water needs continue to grow. For example lets say a food source gives 100/100 food before it's depleted, as a baby trex your food will start off as 50/50, so you can eat half of a dinosaur before it's depleted. As an adult with 100/100 food you must eat an entire dinosaur to fill up. Well as you grow, suddenly your food bar is 200/200, which means you need to consume 2 full dinosaurs or 1 large dinosaur to fill up. 500/500 you'll need to eat 5 dinosaurs or 2 very large dinosaurs to fill up. While you're a powerful almighty, killing isn't much of an issue. Unless suddenly the whole server starts playing little dinosaurs or something that isn't terrestrial. Suddenly your dinosaur has a garenteed expiration date. From what I've heard from players who reach super big dinosaurs they have to have their friends spawning in as the largest playable dinosaurs to feed their friend, until eventually nothing fills you up.
I feel I know why this mechanic is in, I believe it's so that you don't see groups of super power players running around running a server. In other words there's always a bigger fish. But I feel like group control would be a better solution and make things overall more enjoyable.

- The comfort meter. This mechanic is a double edged sword, it actually does its job very well. Too well is the problem. The comfort meter, as I understand it, strengthens and weakens your stats depending. If your dinosaur is super comfortable, your stats are normalized, if your dinosaur is uncomfortable, stats are reduced accordingly. 0 comfort and you start dying.  The comfort meter encourages a lot of pretty good game-play. If you're out of your element, if it storms, if you overeat, if you're near an enemy you lose comfort. All stuff that encourages you to do natural behaviors to gain more comfort. For example you don't want to swim too long, you don't want to be out in a storm, you don't want to be buddy, buddy  snuggling with a trex if you're a large and juicy hadrosaur steak. These are all good things the comfort meter has done.

The downside to the comfort meter is it promotes large groups or (mega packs). The more group members you have around you the more comfortable your dinosaur becomes, and rightly so. What threat is there to a group of 4 large trexes? Or 6 large mosasurs?
Mega groups are immediately the worst problem a survival game could have. The elements are already against you, but if you're a solo player looking for friends, and no one's volenteering (which has been me plenty of times) then there's nothing you can do, you have no chance at growing if there's 4 large groups of dinosaurs who won't allow you into their clan because they only view you as a food source.
And as if the number disadvantage alone isn't already a great enough disadvantage, because the mega groups are grouped, they sit at max comfort all the time, with maxed stats growing faster than you do and ever will.
This problem is the worst for the marine dinosaurs, because most of their food is each other, since marine animals can't go on land and there's no other food source for them unless you happen to catch a lucky break and food becomes available during high tide or you happen to find a terrestrial dinosaur crossing the ocean.
But this problem otherwise completely removes you as a competitor in the game, you never get an oppertunity to grow, you're either forced to play as an herbivore since herbivore groups are much more inclined to take in any plant eater, or you quit the game.

And honestly the mega groups problem is the whole reason I'm even writing this review. The game is otherwise pretty fun for me, but it's no fun being forced to play as an herbivore because everyone runs around in groups and joining with them is an impossibility. So, I suppose my review won't mean much if you have a lot of friends and are good at making friends, but BoB is just another survival game suffering from 'biggest group of friends rules the server'.

Aside from constant death from greedy players (you know the type) my experience was to avoid everyone be the most reclusive thing possible until hopefully nothing kills you off.  Aside from the cannibalism and death youd have to deal with the massive ammouts of glitches from everything the game itself will break causeing you to get stuck and be killed or just for you to relog in which you log back in dead or about to die. I know we all know the game is very new but i think its clearly overrated given the animations and buggyness the UI is a mess aswell as most of the mechanics its fun but its not something id rush to play given how simple it is.

it maybe jumped the gun to fast the base game is there but it shouldnt be praised like its full and ready it clearly need ALOT of polishing. Im not disreguarding the fact that i didnt enjoy it i did im just making a point that the game just isnt as great as everyones making it seem and being unrealistic about it.

soooo there is alot of comparing this game to the isle, which is nonsense. but i highly reccomend this game to anyone who got bored of the isle.
the thing that makes this game stand out to me, is the many unique gameplay functions that neither the archotek project, nor most dino sim games have. you can play as a flyer, an aquatic, and more in the future. one herbivore will be able to BURROW, one like quetz will probably pick up small dinosaurs, velociraptors can climb trees. so many different gameplay mechanics, and not just stats. it really makes playing each one enjoyable, plus the skin customizing feature (which the isle will have in the future) 
though it sucks to see neon rainbow dinosaurs, you can make a very diverse set of colours, and you can even use your skin to your advantage. 

and stress, depending on lonleyness, hunger, storms, and being around different species will affect your health, which gives a real kick to survival. 
the community is very freindly and accepting, and the devs seem to listen to their community and give them what they want, or suggestions like gameplay features ect. instead of what the devs think are good for the game.

some negative aspects are there though here are some below:

1. lag can be a problem sometimes, if theres too much food.
2. kill on sight players who kill everyone, this isent as common on life cycle/survival
3. some glitches like the ptera glitch, you cannot stop flying at a high speed, and you cant take damage from hitting into things.
4. and some like a velo being able to take down an adult rex due to turn cycles. the velo can eat your ass without you being able to kill it. this can be fixed with having smaller creatures doing little to no damage to large creatures.

all of these things can be fixed, with nice devs like BoB's :)

30,47792180,english,"Hi everyone,

I am now playing Beasts of Bermuda since the release and I have to give a review for it. First of all the game is extremely fun to play. My main quickly became the Pteranodon, because lets face it, it's just quite amazing to be able to fly and explore the map from the birds viewpoint! I love the Ancestral Plains map, the mechanics of certain events that make surviving a bit of a challenge, speaking of: Tornadoes, Floods and Tides, Draught of lakes, until rain fills them again etc. 

Of course not to forget all the dinosaurs! Most dinos (players) I encountered were rather kind and did not KOS. But if you use the same skin on each Respawn, people get to recognize you, as you have your own unique identity for the time of life of your dinosaur. So some people such as a pair of Mosas came to befriend me, because I am the kind of Ptera who does not attack anyone for real. I fed them and they leave me be :) But there is of course also the other side! You could potentially make enemies and those will recognize you and try to hunt you down. Which is fun and challenging!

Now for an Early Access game I have to say, I am impressed, because BoB truly has so many functions, mechanics etc. that are a joy to play with! I did not get bored at all in the course of playing this game for the days after release. Yes there are bugs, glitches and fixes still needed to make it all work out perfectly. But this does not take the fun away from this game!

Graphics: If you played other games, you may need get used to BoB's graphics, in my opinion the graphics and environment is exactly what BoB needs, it's beuatiful and engaging! From decaying Carcasses, to draughts and floods! It all is so amazingly intervined! Love it!

Dinosaurs: BoB has tons of dinos you can play as, Flyers, Aquatics, Herbivores and Carnivores. 
More dinosaurs will follow and we will definitely get more flyers as well! 

My verdict: For an EA game I highly recommend it to new players! BoB has a bright future, those who can see this, will stick with the game, because the potential is definitely there!",1545695885,1545695885,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,True,76561198080624665,37,1,13879,0,1982.0,1600495071,,

You have to worry about weather, comfort, other dinosaurs, finding food, etc... all in all it's just a very fun game and will never fail to keep you interested.

34,47769434,english,"This game blew past my expectations honestly. I was scared that it might have server problems and crashes(which it did at times), lag(when over 50 players enter), and bugs(which is common), but overall it wasn't a bad game or a good game. It is a great game. 

You can play as  a Herbivore, Carnivore, Marine dinosaur or a Flyer, each with pros and cons behaviors and what they eat. What makes it so great is that you can select a skin that was made by the dev team or customize the colors of your own which I spent time on XD. I played mostly as a rex and the first thing the game throws is a tutorial which explains how to eat, your comfort, stamina, and attack ability. What blew my expectations was that the game had talent trees which I thought it was useless, but all of them were. For example, you can max out weather resistance to reduce chances of you getting struck by lighting, increase companionship which increases comfort, makes you grow faster and get talent points faster. So many possibilities you can throw on it. I can make my rex a tank, a speedy predator, a damage dealer, provide stress to any enemy dinosaurs I meet. And believe me, the comfort meter is very important, probably the most important thing in the game. If your comfort meter is low, you're more vulnerable to injury, stress, do less damage, lose stamina.

I tried the marine animals and my goodness the difference is night and day. The feeling of swimming around and killing other marine dinosaurs as a krono to being a mosa and just mimicking Jaws as you can just grab a land dino and drag it under the water. You can go through caves and find yourself in a lake and grab up poor souls that you catch drinking. It has happened many times when I was a land dino, seeing another drink water next to me and see a mosa speedily swim up and just grab one and drag it back in.

The best I loved about the game is the natural disasters like the flood and tornados. Predatoria whispered me about what it will be like and this blew me away. Like when the rain comes in and causes floods, forcing you to move to higher ground other wise you're a free meal for the marine dinosaurs. Or when the low tide kicks in and you see a marine dino beached in the middle of the land. And when the winds kick in and you see trees flying and landing near you and turning around and see a tornado targeting you. One spawned near me and I thought it was going to take me when it took a sharp left I just rand dodging trees and hoping it doesn't get me.

And finally the flying dinosaurs(mostly pteranadon). Is it a bit laggy, yes. A big bugged? Yes. But it works. The controls are great once you get it and I felt like an X wing fighter, pecking all the rexes. The funniest and golden moment of flying is the crashing. You wouldnt believe how hilarious it is to be flying at the fastest speed and crash into a tree, killing you and hearing every bone in your body break. Or moments when you body breaks in front of any dino and watch it end your suffering.

The problems with the game is of course rex gang/mosa gang/mega gang. I mean like it was to be expected, but once you have certain players grow to the highest level they control the server. They know the spawn points so they will camp and kill any unfortunate soul that cross their paths. And with talents that can increase their smell, you stand no chance of escaping the gang. But as I said it was expected since the Isle had the same thing with rex gangs/trike gangs/giga gangs/etc, and only hope was a group capable of taking them down or a server wipe. Another problem is of course the bug where the servers claim to be full when it isn't so you have to refesh it a couple of times in order to get the right number and when you get it the game would crash or freeze, so you either had to restart the game or restart steam. But it's to be expected becasue this is a Early Access game.

In conclusion, Beast of Bermuda so far IS better than the Isle, and most of the players cannot deny that, even most Isle players. Which is the sole reason why they slap negative reviews on this game, because they probably admitted that is better, and want to find excuses to hate on the game, and you can see how they write paragraphs on graphics, animations models and why Isle is better and how it's a ripoff. All they do is show how much hypocrites they are and how desperate the Isle dev team is. I mean they even threw a sale on The Isle, the day on release of this game! Most of my friends have played for 3 hours and 1 cant stop playing it, and most of us said that so far it's better becasue there is much more content than the Isle. The growth is great compared to the grueling boring growth time of the Isle( 6 hours to grow a rex?). Even this game throws crystals to boost growth on the dinos. Best part of it all as that there is so many choices and so many options to do. And B.o.B did what the Isle failed to do: Make a fun dinosaur game. And yes the Isle graphics are better, but B.o.B proves that graphics doesn't make the game. It's definitly worth the $20 bucks, and I can easily say that you can put 1000 hours into this game and still not get board. Hats off to the B.o.B team.

It's quite fun, at times, but it is very punishing as a solo player, especially when it comes down to playing something big. Regardless, I still enjoy it - even after successive failure to thrive as Rex. I've switched over to Ptera in an effort to grow as big as possible, and I've had some fun with this. Heck, I even turned into a plant. 

(I play on a server composed of rules for the sake of avoiding the troubles of killing on site/spawn camping which totally kills first time gaming experience)

Rex:
> Stam is shit
> Turn is decently shit compared to megalo 
> As a solo player, you will get shit on by packs of other players constantly
> Hunger/thirst is literal shit, drains too fast - you are constantly in need of food, more exposed to get shit on by packs this way too 
> Comfort is easy to turn to shit - if it starts storming your comfort HUGELY drains, you are forced to avoid it by going in a cave and letting yourself starve out/dehydrate through the process (unless of course you get lucky and have food already present)
> Spawns can be shit - if you spawn in a storm, well, your comfort just went to shit because you spawned in that place at that time. sucks.
> Recommended to play with friends, if not, you will suffer this shit in a cycle until you tire of playing rex because you just dont get anywhere ultimately. Friends however, it will become much easier that way. But. well im a solo player all the time pretty much. 
> Don't play rex alone (it's fun.. but like you just waste time being alone, find someone)

Rex can be fun in its own way, but when you're constantly forced into situations that result in a cycle of deaths because you always end up in contact with packs of players who have an advantage when you're by yourself you just waste time even trying.

Playing literally anything else is more forgiving in its own way. Ptera, for sure, is really easy to survive as.  Despite being easy, it can be pretty enjoyable and is very useful for learning the map. 

The idea of infinite growth sounds tempting to challenge, in a desire to see just how big you'll get before you die. Goals to become the biggest sound really fun.

Still though, this doesn't solve the god damn nuisance of weather and it's severe affects on comfort - this becomes especially problematic when you're literally JUST spawning in which means you are forced to waste time searching for a cave and letting yourself starve out (as well as coming in direct contact with packs/other players who can kill you with ease as a fresh spawn).

There's a lot that needs improved, but still there is a system in place, there's something to follow. I feel this game has great potential for success and I hope that the devs live up to it. Hopefully updates stay consistent and QoL changes come among with other things. It seems promising. I hope there are adjustments made in regard to hunger/thirst draining, footstep noise, and comfort's relationship with weather (it sucks big time) soon.",1545560700,1545560700,True,2,0,0.541666686534881592,0,True,False,True,76561198052369727,39,10,102611,9917,5339.0,1602090076,,
43,47735475,english,"As of writing this, I played about three hours of BoB and those three hours were a single setting. 
BoB has a lot going for it and is far less buggy than I expected it to be as an early access title. Most bugs can even be fixed (for the moment) with the ""unjam"" button it offers.
IF YOU WANT TO HAVE A SPOILER FREE EXPERIENCE, GO NOW.
If not, read on.

I've played quite a lot of dino games, heck, I think I might even own the most of them on steam and so far, BoB is the only one to make it actually feel like I am playing a dino and not a complete, boring mess.
Every dinosaur has a completely different feeling as to how it plays, offering a multitude of different lifestyles and actually building up an interacting ecosystem with players.
Here are some of the noteworthy things the game does:
-Nesting: with new players able to be ""born"" into the world as one of the parents eggs. This comes with genetics that can pass and parents that can care and bring food to their young, creating a unique way to interact with others.
You can even see the world a bit whilst in the egg! 
-Stress system: This right here is one of the best points. Being near other species or predators stresses your dinosaur, making you WANT to get away. Being near your own species raises your comfort and makes herds something you actually want to be a part in.
-Food isn't just food: As a predator, you need to find fresh food. You can eat rotting meat, but it might poison you and weaken you. It makes you look for the freshest meals or hunt your own! Herbivores meanwhile need to eat the plants meant for them or just as much suffer food poisoning. It makes you naturally migrate and search for the best food sources.
-Scent: Finally done right, you can smell where to find water and meat, as well as how fresh it is. You can also smell other players and even if they are male or female via scent. Sniffing for water has saved my butt a few times in my short playtime!
-Speaking of water: Water fills natural pools with rain and flooding and depletes when drank from. I really enjoy this mechanic because it dynamically changes the landscape, keeping you going.
-Weather: Tornados and storms cause flooding, stress and possible death. It's scary but that makes it fun.
-Land, Water, Air: You want it, BoB has a dino for that. Every type of dino is fun in its own way. Dive for fish as Ptero or pull other dinos into the water as anything aquatic and beasty.
-Skilltree: Offers you the ability to better your dinosaur and tweak it to fit your idea of playing even more.

Overall: BoB has a huge promise and I have seen the dev team (which is rather small) move forward swiftly and with a lot of effort put down. What they made is already amazing and I can't wait to see how it evolves in the future.

44,47729444,english,"Purchased this game on day one for myself and two close friends and do not regret it whatsoever.

There are bugs, of course-- it's early access! There's already a hotfix being worked on to iron out the major gamebreaking issues as they're reported.

Compared to other dinosaur games I've played, this blows them all out of the water mechanically. The graphics might not be fully realistic, but the game doesn't TRY to be realistic. There's an element of fantasy with portals and crystals, which is a nice hint of mystery regarding the maps and Bermuda as a whole. The dev team is truly talented; there were some mechanics that made my friends and I stop and watch in amazement, and we continued talking about what we found impressive from a gameplay standpoint on and off during our entire play session.

One of the first experiences I had with the game was being a Para with one of them and trying to cross a land bridge that was covered by a high tide. She made it to the beach and climbed up without issue. However, right before her front legs touched the sand, she mentioned she saw a shadowy figure in the water behind us. I felt my heart jump when I looked behind and saw the blurred dark figure of a mosasaur approaching, and juuuust as I touched land, it actually grabbed me and pulled me further out into deep water. When my dinosaur struggled free from one mosa, one of its packmates surged forward and pulled me back out again as I was trying to paddle back to shore. All my friend could do was watch helplessly as they dragged me through the water twice, the event soon turning into a feeding frenzy.

A later experience I had was climbing up a steep ledge with my friends (yet again as Paras), but struggling. It was steep enough to slow our momentum to a crawl, and it almost felt like our poor parasaurs were going to slide backwards on the terrain. I was curious about something though and decided to test out the crouch-walk, where the para goes down on all fours, to see if it'd give any more traction compared to walking on two legs... And it did!! We were able to climb the slope on all fours much easier than we would have if we walked up on two. Simple things like that really make the game feel nice to play.

Other things we marvelled at include storms, the dynamic tide system, how water actually drains when you drink from it, the fun skin customization and how it let us identify players by looks alone, how entering sleep mode with certain dinosaurs actually rests their heads where you're currently looking (nice touch!), how meat visibly disappears on carcasses the more you eat, how smooth, fun, and easy to control flight feels (despite the occasional speed glitch), how it's relatively easy and simple to find your friends in the world, and so on.

The skill tree is also super fun to play around with-- one of my friends seems to like maxing out comfort and resistances, whereas I prefer boosting my speed and stamina. You can play as any dinosaur the way YOU want and not be punished for it in any unfair way.

Closing thoughts: This game is everything I missed about The Isle. Some might see the graphics as a downside, but I personally find them charming and nice to look at. The game is colorful and landmarks are plentiful (so long as there's no fog) and it's such a refreshing change of pace from gritty realism where everything is brown, gray, and black. I'm glad I could purchase day of launch and I can't wait to see where this game goes from here.",1545534106,1545534106,True,6,0,0.55163043737411499,0,True,False,True,76561198117848855,69,1,6093,0,1406.0,1597950496,,
45,47728047,english,"Let me start by saying I'm a paleontologist, and I own and/or have played almost every dinosaur and paleo game listed on steam. This game is full of bugs and broken models/systems/etc, isn't optimized whatsoever, and even at the highest graphic levels looks flat and undetailed, more becoming of an early-gen PS2 game or mobile game than a PC developed game. Its broken, difficult to play and the experience when you DO get to play isn't anywhere near rewarding enough to justify the frustration and roadblocks encountered in normal play.

The game is currently in a state that isn't anywhere close to release-grade into EA. The framerate never goes above 25-30FPS even on a machine that's nearly double the requirements. The animations are very awkward and unrealistic, resulting in broken necks/tails and bow-legged gaits that make the dinosaurs appear totally weightless or toy-like. The sounds of the animals themselves are almost entirely unedited stock sounds and some seem to have been lifted from other sources (JP Rex roar, etc) that's ripe for copyright smackdowns. The sound system in general is extremely low quality; there's no directional hearing, sounds seem muted and muffled even when the source is extremely close, and for a game reliant on audio cues this makes for a terrible and frustrating experience.

Most of the models are decent enough, but a few (like the Icthy and ptera) are of sharply lower quality than the rest. Sounds and actions/animations aren't properly synced on almost every animal. Keybinding is difficult and only works half the time. The servers are highly unstable and crash repeatedly even when mostly empty. The lag is very, very noticeable. Half of all of the actions a player can preform come with no context or introduction, leaving to a confusing, conjested and disorienting experience that can span from the first few hours to longer. The maps are large but resources are spread thin and the topography is jagged and extreme to the point of annoyance; its insanely easy to fall and die or fall and get stuck resulting in waiting for death or a respawn that wipes the character.

The skin system is neat but there are so many choices that its confusing and intimidating at times. There are color options for parts that are completely invisible on the selection screen which makes customizing annoying. Bright neon colors are neat in theory but are jarringly out of place in a survival setting, and the lack of dimorphism makes grouping difficult. The different systems surrounding comfort are interesting and unique but can sometimes be so wildly out of the player's control as to be infuriating. Players can't control weather and other environmental factors, and for slower dinosaurs this means a long, drawn-out pointless death of vague ""discomfort"" just from being out in the rain or wind for too long.

The camera is jittery and results in breakneck swings and snaps that can make combat impossible. The flying and swimming cameras are particularly terrible and result in accidental drowning or fatal crashes often. The larger dinosaurs are so slow that playing them isn't particularly rewarding in the survival game mode. Scent is functional but nearly useless at night and uses up ability that can leave a dinosaur bafflingly vulnerable. Sure, carrying food and forming packs is easy enough and useful, but keeping an animal within a ridiculously razor-thin band of optimum ""comfort"" takes so much effort and sheer dumb luck as to greatly diminish the overall fun from playing.

There are very few dinosaurs and marine/flying reptiles to pick from and there are far less herbivores/prey than carnivores, leaving the player environment disasterously tilted towards the predator. Again, herbivores could be fun if they had more to offer from gameplay than a near constant need to eat and drink and few choices for socialization, interaction or goal reaching to reward the long, exhaustingly drawn-out playtime to grow them.

Comparisions to The Isle are inevitable, but I'd rather keep that kettle of fish well out of the home. There's obvious copying and mimickry of The Isle present, but the game isn't solid enough on its own to offer much of a unique experience besides the ""comfort"" quantifier that is completely unexplained, vague and nearly impossible to fullfil. Just having more systems to keep an eye on doesn't make the gameplay more exciting or fun, it just makes keeping track of everything harder and survival difficult and unrewarding.

The complete lack of an introduction, tutorial or other key to ease new players in leaves most confused and disoriented and easy pickings for other players. It makes for a frustrating, unrewarding experience. Some of the dino models are okay, the foliage looks okay in places and horrible in others, the tide and monsoon/drought cycle is neat but can be annoying, scent is jarringly oversaturated and impossible to keybind off of key movement keys. The skin system is cool to a degree but then becomes wildly unrealistic, and there aren't any in-game rewards to favor players acting in natural or environmentally building ways.

Its been a little over 24 hours and there's always room for improvement, but the game doesn't deliver on the promises it made out of the gate. It should have been released later in a more stable, complete state, as playing for 30 minutes only for the server to crash and take all progress with it?

50,47716985,english,"Firstly I want to point out that this game has so much potential, If the developers make right choices, I believe it will be so fun to play in the future. 
But right now, sadly to write this negative review; I am unable to enjoy. 
In this state the game is only enjoyable if you have more than 1 friend to play with you. Because It is so hard to survive from gang attacks. 

I can’t describe the excitement for this game I had several months ago. 
And in this week both my friends and I went literally crazy and couldn’t wait. 
The game released, we sat in front of our computers, watched the game download, counted minutes and every megabytes. We were like little kids waiting to get their birthday presents. 
My game finished downloading first, I managed to play alone. Theres a sound problem I will explain later. But other than that I didn’t encounter major issues, got killed by 7 T-rexes’ pack when I was almost an adult. I didn’t go mad at all. I got used to this thanks to The Isle. 

After this my friends joined the game and we enjoyed A LOT. We loved the mechanics and everything about it and couldn’t stop complimenting! 
But what now?
I had thought at that time this game is relaxing and fun, till today. A day after the release. 
I know its so new, but I felt like I have to write review. 

Lets start why I don’t recommend the game:

Rex, Icthy and Megalo gangs exist. They are generally groups of 4-8 players. What is worse, they always camp at spawn places. 
Once they spot a freshly spawned dinosaur, that dinosaur is as dead as a fossil. No way of escaping because of the scent system. (It’s not like on The Isle, the fog directly shows where you went and are hiding.)
Even if you hide in bushes or under a tree, they will see you because the foliage is too slow to load, even if it does for you, players will see you anyways because it won’t load for them if they are a little away from you. 
Also since you start as a very young adult, you are not fast enough nor have enough stamina to escape. 
In addition to this even when you are crouching your foot steps are as loud as when walking/running.

Speaking of sounds, even if a player is 1km away from you, it sounds like its near your butt. When I first encountered this, made me paranoid I kept running and looking around but couldn’t see anyone. This still freaks me out lol. 

Spawn areas: they are the biggest issue for me. Somewhat reason the game loves to spawn you near the groups or maybe its because people know where the spawn spots are and camp there like I mentioned before. Today, I spawned 7 times (no kidding) right next to adults and/or mega packs. Every damn time I respawned I was ALWAYS NEAR THEM. 
3 times I thought I finally had got a good spawn, but I was wrong, since I walk too loud, They found me and killed me 2 minutes after. 
You can’t grow because of this. The adult dinosaurs are the ones kept killing everything spawned and camped near unlimited drinkable water source areas. 
It gets so annoying when you are keep dying before you could even move a muscle. 
I am known as a calm gamer, I have never in my life rage quitted, never ever. I always defended BoB development and was very optimistic about it. 
But today I really wanted to quit and delete the game forever. This isn’t my first EA game so I am actually very patient. So, congratulations for making me mad. 

Controls: Well this isn’t a big issue, I recommend you to set the keys if you are launching game for the first time because its mixed. 
Also I should mention, on first day Roars, Specials and food grabbing were working, but now they are bugged and not working for most of the players. Only 1, 3 and F roar is working right now. 

How do you fly the Pteranodon? To fly you have to press Shift+ Space at the same time. But no matter how many times I and some players tried, we couldn’t take off. 

Aquatic Creatures: Well, They are so boring to play. All you can do is sit and pray for someone to swim across the sea. This might take HOURS. 

Lag issue: I am not going to complain about this. Yes, it is true combatting is so hard because of extreme lag but the game is just out and there were around 50 testers tested BoB before the release. We had about 900 players playing first day and developer didn’t expect to have that many players. 

Comfort: Rain stresses you. Then your health drops, you need to find a cave and hide. Good luck on this. Even if you find one, there is %100 a rex pack waiting for their unsuspecting walking steak to enter the cave. 
I recommend adding big trees for this. Make them so they can protect you from rain or simply, lower the raining rate and damage. I realised that almost all players exit the server once they die from stress (caused by rain). 

I hate cartoonish games in general, but I am in love this game’s graphics. They are so cute and pretty in my opinion!
Love the color customisation but sick and tired of seeing neon pink, rainbow dinosaurs...
I can’t compare the graphics, models and maps of this game to The Isle’s. The Isle has been developing for so long. It has so much profit to hire experienced developers and buy models for at least 10k USD each. 
While BoB has just came out and developers dont have much money yet they are still doing their best. 

There are other minor bugs, but they are easier to fix and doesn’t ruin the gameplay. 

So, you should buy BoB if you are a patient player and okay with the things I mentioned. If not, I recommend you to give it some time.

Another good point is that the Progression Skill Tree is nicely fleshed out and easy to understand, can be used to create unique experiences with the same dinosaur if you survive long enough to max out the appropriate skills, it also opens up the market for specific builds to deal with specific things allowing niches to form.

67,47695490,english,"I was excited to get this game. I could even say I was hyped for it. I hate that I have to do this but I can't leave a positive review. I would list some positive things about the game but I can't. Like not a single thing. So I guess here goes the bad things:

- First thing I noticed was the game looked very mediocre at best even with the settings turned to epic. 

-You'd think if it looks just okay it would atleast run pretty good right? Not at all, on medium settings (Which looks awful) the game runs at best of 60-80 fps. Keep in mind I have a GTX 1080 and an i7 six core processor. and sometimes the game would even drop down to the 30-40s range for no appearant reason.

-Next is the Dinosaurs themselves. A few of them look decent. Like the Velociraptor, The Trex, The Mosa, Apatosaurus, and a few others. But alot of the creatures look like trash. Especially the Megalosaurus, and the Para. They just look gross and not modeled well. The quality of the animals in this game seems very inconsistant. 

-Next the animations. Probably the worst part of this game. Only a few had good animations, some were decent but they were mostly bad. They feel stiff and unrealistic. The animations made gameplay feel gross alot of the time.

-Speaking of gameplay there isnt any. I wondered around this map for about 30 minutes with different creatures and the only time I came across anything was when I played as a pteradon flying over everything.

-The servers are bad and you constantly lag. Combine that with the bad animations and you have yourself some very choppy and stiff gameplay.

-Not only are the servers bad but they only host 50 people at the most.( One of the reasons I never found anyone most likley.) 

-There is obviously alot of things this game copied and pasted from the isle. Except The isle has better graphics, models, animations, framerates, less lag, and more gameplay. And for the same price. 

I really wanted to like this game, but I can't recomend it. The quality just isn't there. I might check this game out later down the line, in like a year or two. But as for now I refunded the game and will not be playing it until the quality is atleast half of what most other games are. Don't buy this game.

It is everything most people wanted from a dinosaur simulation game and more. It has only been out for a little of course so there's a few bugs here and there and some dinosaurs are currently unavailable, but in my experience the pros definitely outweigh the cons. It is unique compared to most other simulation games I've played and I am excited to pay and contribute to where this game is headed. The devs seem very courteous and very helpful and actually seem to care in the direction their game is going and it doesn't feel like it's going to stay in the shape it is in for very long, as in it will only improve with what I've seen so far.

I think it is worth buying now to give the devs/etc more money to work on their game, but that is my opinion. There is lots to do as both a herbivore and a carnivore. The playbase is so nice compared to that of the Isle and the toxicity is not nearly as prevalent.

There are currently 3 different maps to play on each with it's own unique areas and caves to discover, but be careful! You are not alone in those caves sometimes.

Sound is a bit loud (stomping, calls etc.) but turning down your game volume help with that. It is a bit too dark for marine creatures right now, so you don't see too much unfortunately but alone with all the mechanics Bob has already it's gonna be a lot of fun!

Explore, fly, swim, hunt, survive fluds and storms, mate, lay eggs, raise offspring, choose from different premade skins and change their colors completely to your taste, go solo or pack/herd. You can literally do whatever you want to do here.

If you think of buying this game seeing the trailer, I would recommend to wait until this game is more updated.
Beasts of Bermuda is not in the state in which it would be playable as of the public early access release date.
There are simply too many bugs for this game to be viable. If you want to play a dinosaur simulator, there are plenty of others besides this one.
I suspect the reason why this game is buggy is simply because the development team was too ambitious, trying to include everything from the start, while the base game has a lot of problems. I'll give a short pro/con list below:

Pros:
- Terrestrial, as well as aquatic and aerial species
- Large amount of player freedom
- Balanced gameplay
- Good community
- A choice of near first person perspective

Cons:
- Bugs. A lot of them
- Some features are in the middle of implementation during release
- Rough animations and the transitions between animations
- Odd, glitchy physics
- Extremely loud sound effects

The maps are great and designed well
the models are very well done I can see that a lot of put into them
the fact that you can play as a sea creature and a flyer is what sold me to get this game, I love flyers and playing it is a joy 
So far the playbase is very friendly and helpful 
I very much like the modes, espcially the growth mode it's cool seeing your creature slowly grow and that egg state is super cool

Now to some cons: 
There's some bugs, mostly to the flyers, they tend to bug out quite often. like getting stuck after taking out and the debug doesn't work 
I really don't like the fact that you have to wait over a minute to respawn, it makes being a newbie at this game hard since you have to wait so long just to respawn, I really don't see a use for it (but that's my own two shoes) 
the sound design needs a bit of work I found the constant sniffing and the ear bleeding wind sound very annoying
