Using Yolo mouse is as easy as downloading it, launching it, launching whatever game you want and increasing the cursor size (which increases the in-game cursor, so you don't have to use one of the pre-installed cursors that don't match the game's aesthetic). 

Even better, Yolo mouse automatically keeps separate profiles for every game you use it with. So my desktop cursor remains the same size I want, then I can launch a game like Dawn of War and the cursor will automatically change to the last cursor size I set. Then when I'm done and exit the game, the cursor reverts to the normal desktop cursor.

I first tried yolomouse about a year ago.  I was in fits of laughter when my housemate showed me this great big glaring mouse pointer and just had to try it.  It has completely changed my experience of playing Path of Exile.

I used to have trouble seeing where my mouse was but now I always know where it is because it is big and bright and pink and kind of like having an elephant in my room - hard to miss.

One of those simple things that makes a big difference.   All it does is make the mouse pointer absurdly huge and colorful, but it makes game playing so much more fun being able to see the cursor.

I had a few problems with it early on in Harvest league.   According to the dev, that was a temporary POE thing, but it seems all sorted now.  If you had problems early Harvest league and put yolo away, it might be time to pull it out again.

Kudos to the dev for a great and simple idea at a fair price.

After having the old Yolomouse from the website for about 1 1/2 Years I would recommend this. But after deciding to buy the software to support the developers, I now  have to restart the software randomly during games because the Program just stops working.

New Review: I got a answer from the developer that there will be a update out soon. Meaning he said about 5 days. This was on 12.May.2020. I cant recall that I ever Updated the Software  and it still behaves the exact same way. Randomly when I start a new League of Legends Game it just wont work and I have to close it in the Task Manager because it wont respond when shutting it down with the Steam client. 

It also completely crashed sometimes random during other things and just painted the whole screen white, burning my eyes out at night, and then proceeds show the standard windows crash screen where you can choose to close the program or wait for it to respond.

Just tested with DAOC. This is one of the few games that require YM to be run as administrator. You can enable this under yolomouse taskbar icon -> Run as Administrator. Afterwards revisit DAOC and hit CTRL ALT 1 (or 2) again.

There is one bug noticed here is that you should see a message telling you to do this, but it doesnt show up in DAOC, which I noted and will be fixed.

Note that currently run as admin does not persist between reboots. We're working on adding this next patch
