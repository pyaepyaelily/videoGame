Zombies is really the most remarkable out of all modes in this game for me.
From the custom maps to the 14 maps that you get by owning all DLCs, the mode is rich with content! You get 8 remastered maps from older games, all of which are all really great remasters, and also 6 base maps which are all mostly top-notch (Excluding Revelations, which is a bit duller in comparison, but still very good).

The multiplayer is really decent at best, the micro-transactions really do ruin the gameplay a bit; a ton of weapons that you can only unlock from supply drops and a system which just encourages you to spend money. Apart from that, though, the multiplayer is good fun. It doesn't really compare to the likes of Black Ops 2 but it  can still be enjoyed, especially thanks to the specialists which I actually liked.

The campaign shouldn't be something to get too excited about, to say the least. It's an absolute mess, they completely strayed away from the story in previous BO games and it just turned out horribly, characters are forgettable and the story is confusing.

Overall, I highly recommend this game to CoD Zombies fans mainly, as it is simply remarkable in this game. Others would probably still have a good time playing MP but you're really much better off playing the BO2 MP or something similar.",1517940302,1601554677,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198157252944,112,42,36210,1838,35523,1601922385

This is the best version of ùòäùò¢ùò≠ùò≠ ùò∞ùòß ùòãùò∂ùòµùò∫ ùò°ùò∞ùòÆùò£ùò™ùò¶ùò¥. The map you get by default, Shadow of Evil, is incredible. It has so much depth but even as a new player, you do not need the knowledge to have fun with the map. If you have some extra cash for the DLCs, I would recommend getting any of them except the Zetsubou No Shima. It is just a very dreary map and it is the worst one.
If I elaborate further on the ùòäùò¢ùò≠ùò≠ ùò∞ùòß ùòãùò∂ùòµùò∫: ùòâùò≠ùò¢ùò§ùò¨ ùòñùò±ùò¥ ùòêùòêùòê ùò°ùò∞ùòÆùò£ùò™ùò¶ùò¥ being outstanding, it is the last version that sticks to the core formula. It takes the established formula from ùòûùò∞ùò≥ùò≠ùò• ùò¢ùòµ ùòûùò¢ùò≥, ùòâùò≠ùò¢ùò§ùò¨ ùòñùò±ùò¥ ùòê, and ùòâùò≠ùò¢ùò§ùò¨ ùòñùò±ùò¥ ùòêùòê, refining it as much as it can. This version really feels like the most refined classic zombies experience so far. It may not be as ""pure"", but it is still very much the classic formula, just with some newer elements.
You have old maps ported to ùòâùò≠ùò¢ùò§ùò¨ ùòñùò±ùò¥ ùòêùòêùòê in the Zombies Chronicles DLC, any map you can dream up through Steam Workshop, and an overall modern refinement of the ""classic zombies"" formula.

The campaign is frustrating to me. It has several individual moments with awesome ideas or cool concepts, but none of it ends up amounting to anything. The whole campaign essentially ends up meaningless (no spoiler). There are quite a few neat ideas, like walking through virtual recreations of memories, but those same ideas have so many oversights that ruin it. Quite a few ideas fall flat and do not work, despite the presence of some ideas with great potential.

Multiplayer is also uninspired. It feels like the devs took a look at Titanfall and did the bare minimum to capture some of the magic of that game's movement system. The only problem is that it barely works and feels out of place. The weird ""hero"" abilities also do not feel like they fit. It is almost like they made the ""Call of Overwatch"" instead of a unique title with its own identity. The multiplayer sincerely fails at carving out its path and feels like a mix of other popular games.",1480265734,1600967250,True,1,0,0.502899765968322754,0,True,False,False,76561198041361517,96,12,48665,0,48665,1588630807

Speaking of the campaign, I personally found it was dull and it followed the shadow of Black Ops 2 which was disappointing but then again BO2 was one of the best COD experiences along with MW2. I was really disappointed when I got to the jet mission and found that you had no control of where you fly which was disgusting to see since there was a jet mission in BO2 that allowed you to do all the flying and shooting which was amazing. I wish they had more zombies maps that you don't need to pay for in order to play because it was annoying that you can't play an official zombies map with your friends other than the one they included. The only other option was to download some workshop mods that sometimes don't work. The weapons were really different and I didn't really enjoy any of the weapons other than the sniper category. I think that they should reduce the pricing for this game since its 5 years old in the time of writing this review.

So Overall if you want a game with a meh campaign, a decent multiplayer, and one of the best zombies experiences, then go ahead and buy the game. Should you buy it on sale?

Map after map there were endless little things to do with amazing environments, weapons, and detail. For some, this game might turn you off due to to things like having to look up videos to do certain things EVERY game (soe pack, kt4 build+upgrade, soe sword) but to me, Its those things that I always love to come back too and do every game. Without keeping this review too long, for anyone slightly interested in cod zombies, this is the best version imo.

Pros

-Incredible movement system. Very fun, lots to learn, Awesome to watch.
-Tight controlls as every CoD
-Matchmaking is fairly fast, low pings

Cons

-Matchmaking is latency based, not skill based. Low skill players will have a steep learning curve to start.
-Controller usage gives aim assist, which in some cases is a very unfair advantage.
-Cod Points: Micro transactions. Yes, this game has microtransactions even though you are paying full price.
-Random package loot system. Lots of cosmetic items and new weapons. All are locked behind a fully random system. Some players who have played since release are yet to get one.
        +Addendum: There is now guaranteed weapons and they are stepping up the package frequency with contracts.
                               To be honest kinda too little too late. We'll see what happens when it's fully implemented.
-DLC packs are EXTREMELY low content. Four maps and a zombie map. For ~15 bucks. 
-This game desires to latch on to your wallet and never let go.


Overall, good game but poor practices mean the entire CoD franchise is becoming a waste of time. Shame.

Update: Just came back after a while away, was tired of controller aim assist and cheaters being all i see. First match back: blatant cheater, not even hiding it. Do not waste your money on this game. I'd even say don't waste your money on this company.",1462737455,1599670790,False,9,0,0.564904510974884033,0,True,False,False,76561197983122110,491,8,139618,350,33978,1602006619

-Verified the game files
-Tried Safe Mode
-Reinstalled the game
-Restarted my computer before launching it
-Tried both Windows 7 and Windows 8 compatibility mode multiple times
-Both put the game folder and the exe itself on my allow list
-Disabled my anti virus entirely 
-Done a Clean Boot multiple times
All the other things I could find on the Official troubleshooting guide that I haven't tried are fairly specific causes of issues (multiple monitor software, using a controller) don't apply to me.

I used to play on Xbox One, so coming to Steam and seeing all these custom maps was an exhilarating experience.

I still think $100 dollars for the game plus all the DLC is way too much for a five-year-old game, even $60 for the game plus ZC is too much, so I'd wait for a sale. But if I'm being honest, because of how mediocre the DLC maps are, and with all the custom maps out there, I'd just get the base game. It's worth it solely for the custom maps.

TL;DR: It's worth it for the Zombies alone.",1599456781,1599456794,True,41,0,0.730636715888977051,0,True,False,False,76561198368396191,263,23,1187,0,1187,1597795762

16,75374678,english,"[b]TL;DR: [u]GET [i]WHILE ON SALE!!!!!![/i][/u][/b]

Okay, but seriously: the Zombies in [i]Call of Duty: Black Ops ‚Ö¢[/i] is good, at least in a conceptual manner.[list]For example:[*]In Pack-a-Punching a weapon more than once, you receive what's called an Alternative Ammo Type (AAT for short), and this makes killing zombies a lot easier. (To make this more balanced, it only ‚Äúactivates‚Äù every so often‚Äîperhaps every 30 seconds or so.)
[*]The maps in this game have [u]a lot of detail and content[/u] in them; they're vast and expansive, while actually still having ‚Äústuff to do‚Äù in all the various nooks and crannies. (At time of writing, I've only done one Easter-Egg so far‚Äîthat EE being the Flytrap from [i]The Giant,[/i] which per step literally the same as on [i]Der Riese[/i] in previous games.)
[*][u]The maps are designed well,[/u] in terms of general layout: a fair amount of challenge, but not too terribly difficult. (It's not quite [i]casual-friendly[/i]‚Ä¶[spoiler]but neither is the price [strike]even with sale[/strike]‚Ä¶[/spoiler]but I feel as though the learning curve isn't absolutely [i]terrible[/i] for anyone who's serious about having fun with Zombies.)
[*]On that ‚Üë note about maps, this is the [u]first Treyarch-made game since [i]World at War[/i] to natively support mods.[/u] Still currently the [i]only[/i] one, actually. Slowly, but surely, the classic [i]World at War[/i] maps are even being ported to [i]Black Ops ‚Ö¢.[/i] (It takes time due to the newer engine not having much backwards compatibility, but it's happening.) Community-made custom content‚Äîespecially maps‚Äîis [i]great![/i] [spoiler]Modders are being hunted to extinction by devs and their ‚Äúproprietary software‚Äù and ‚Äúend-user license agreements‚Äù![/spoiler]
[*][u]Each new map also feels truly unique[/u] in an aesthetic sense. With regards to [i]Zetsubou no Shima[/i]„ÄÄÔºàÁµ∂ÊúõÂ≥∂„Äê„Çº„ÉÑ„Éª„Éú„Ç¶„Éª„ÅÆ„Éª„Åó„Åæ„Äë„ÄÄ„ÄåIsle of Despair„ÄçÔºâ„ÄÅ„ÄÄfor example, you would think by the Japanese-sounding title that it's some kind of [i]Shi no Numa[/i]„ÄÄÔºàÊ≠ª„ÅÆÊ≤º„ÄêÃ™„Ç∑„Éª„ÅÆ„Éª„Å¨„Åæ„Äë„ÄÄ„ÄåSwamp of Death„ÄçÔºâ„ÄÄclone. However, [i]you'd be sorely mistaken[/i] with such an assumption: it does indeed have Imperial Japanese zombies and lots of [i]Kanji[/i] on various signs throughout the map, as well as a tropical climate and even a quasi-‚Äúsymmetrical‚Äù layout, but Treyarch really tried to make it unique in most every other way. [spoiler]You'll just have to see it to believe it.[/spoiler][/list][list][b]Now with as much praise as I give this game on a conceptual level, [u]things are different when put into practice.[/u][/b][*][i]Black Ops ‚Ö¢[/i] has [u]absolutely [i]terrible[/i] graphical optimization:[/u] my FPS goes from 150 down to 120, all the way down to the 70s, [i]literally several times every minute,[/i] without any apparent rhyme or reason as to why this even happens‚Äîand the graphics [i]don't even look that good[/i] at max settings. (The textures and models are pretty good-looking, but the shadows and ambient occlusion are frankly [i]lacking.[/i]) [spoiler]In that manner, [i]Black Ops ‚Ö°[/i] & [strike][i]‚Ö£*[/i][/strike] [b][i]‚Äú‚Ö°‚Ö°‚Äù*[/i][/b] do it way better. ([b]*Note:[/b] [i]Black Ops ‚Äú‚Ö°‚Ö°‚Äù[/i] has actually amazing performance, as well as spectacular model details, but a lot of textures are [strike]extremely[/strike] [i]so[/i] low-res that it's [i]visible at 480p,[/i] even at max settings‚Äîparticularly DLC/Black Market camos‚Äîbut I digress. Still way better optimization, however, even if low-res textures are the least of that game's issues.[/spoiler]
[*][b][u]#@$!ing [i]terrible[/i] sound design![/u][/b] I will hear the zombies at all times in [i]Black Ops ‚Ö°,[/i] [i]Black Ops ‚Äú‚Ö°‚Ö°,‚Äù[/i] [i]Black Ops ‚Ö†,[/i] [b]and even [i]World at War[/i][/b]‚Äîthey'll either be walking, or at least groaning‚Äîwhereas in [i]‚Ö¢,[/i] you have zombies [i]literally sneaking up on you [b]in full and absolute silence[/b][/i] half the time!!!
[*]On that ‚Üë note about audio, there are [u]a lot of recycled SFX/jingles[/u] from previous games, but in a pretty [i]tasteless[/i] manner. Like, you hear the lock-jiggling ‚Äúround end‚Äù cue from [i]Mob of the Dead[/i] on‚Äî[i]guess which map?[/i]‚Äî[b][i]The Giant,[/i] of course![/b]‚Ä¶and you don't even hear the MotD ‚Äúnew round‚Äù cue‚Ä¶
[*]While numerous plot-holes were introduced in [i]Black Ops ‚Ö°[/i] with [i]Origins,[/i] these [u]plot-holes were opened up[/u] [i]even wider[/i] just so [strike]Blundaddy[/strike] Jason Blundell could milk the ‚Äústory‚Äù with a bunch of ‚Äúmultiverse‚Äù nonsense and actually turn it into something, even if poorly-written.
[*][u]Campaign is forgettable.[/u]
[*][u]Multiplayer is trash[/u] and honestly has been since [i]Black Ops ‚Ö°.[/i] [spoiler][i]No, I didn't suck at it.[/i] It's just really boring in comparison to the OG [i]Black Ops,[/i] a game also developed by Treyarch (mind you that); or‚Äî[i]hell[/i]‚Äîeven to the new [i]Modern Warfare,[/i] which wasn't developed by Treyarch but [i]was[/i] published by Activision, who publishes all [i]Call of Duty[/i] titles‚Ä¶and InfinityWard cooperates with Treyarch on a regular basis, namely for teasers/full trailers etc.[/spoiler][/list][b]So with that,[/b] I give [i]Call of Duty: Black Ops ‚Ö¢[/i] about a [b][u]7.2/10[/u][/b] in terms of rating it. If you're serious about [i]Call of Duty[/i] Zombies, you should get this game‚Äî[i]but wait for a sale![/i]

With over 39.6+ large quest style maps, it's no wonder that call of duty fuck ops 3 has recieved nothing but critical acclaim all across the board. Shadows of Weevil was Satan's trick to get us all to enjoy Hentai as a tentacle can't help but be in every fucker part of this dooky peenor ass map. Takes place in 1726's Toronto Canada during Donald Duck's Candidacy. What an incredible experience, so tight!!1 

Der Eisenhower is a map where you play as a man in the winter time. craft over 4 bows that take a youtube guide to learn how to craft. Build the ragneroks which were ported from the multiplayer experience and take 2 hours to charge. Die on round 12 when the Panzer spawns and your elemental wonder bow is somehow ineffective.

Zetsishrek no Peta is a map that takes heavy inspiration from the popular video Game, ""Stardew Valley"" as there is a lot of plants to water. The fun comes when you are required to do 40+ minutes of setup in order to play a casual game of call of fucky zombies. The fuckery does not stop how ever as the thrasher will come in to eat those cheeks up.

Fishing Rod Kody is actually just a blu ray copy of skyrim that is included in the season pass so that must have just been some sort of glitch. They did however add an all new firearm to the mystery box so that makes this map as classic as it gets. 

If the fun didn't stop there epic still has one more map in the dlc cycle, Elevators. This map is so fresh and innovative that it took parts from actual good maps and just taped them together to create this fantasmal experience that is so dick fuck easy that I have to check my self for urine as sometimes my bladder bursts when I get too sleepy. 

If you thought epic games was going to just bitch out on this game to make Fortnite shitty royale, buckler your cock into your boxers because they gave us one final blast with Zombies Chronicles of Reddik. This is a pack of 8 maps that they have recycled from the other games. The creativity here is astonishing. Play maps that have already been remastered 3+ times, explore maps that are buggier than the cracked amazon firestick versions of the game. Break an already broken map so hard that round 100 is easier than getting a 18 year old pregnant. 

Moving on to campaign, the writers in this one were clearly sipping some of that silly juice if you know what I'm saying. The charaters are gripping and interesting the way that Little timmy that I went to Kindergarten with was. The awesome twist ending was so awesome and unexpected that you have to look up some fucker youtube video that explains how sick it was only for you to get angry at how actually stupid it was. Gameplay is like a regular call of  duty but this time the game shark dvd was left in the console from the last session of Crash Team Racing. What an Experience. 

Fucker hitler multiplayer is stupid. Watch your uncles spend thousands of dollars on supply drops to cope with the loss of their niece which happens to be your 6 year old sister. Supply drops destroyed my village in the jungle, fuck you black ops, fuck everything you stand for.",1588895732,1598926815,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,76561198354623107,56,10,17255,572,14143,1601729641

As a whole package, Black Ops 3 is absolutely stuffed with content, while some content may be better than others, it's still content that helps this game remain fresh. Not to mention that Black Ops 3 has many features that are unique to it.
Some being:
- 4-player Campaign Co-op
- Steam Mod Support
- Fully customizable campaign experience, vanity and gameplay elements
- Entirely separate game modes that enrich the experience (Nightmares, Dead Ops Arcade 2, Freerun)

Treyarch really wanted this CoD to be something and it clearly shows that. Multiplayer was probably the smoothest of the advanced movement CoDs and it was also pretty fun, having plenty of unlocks kept giving me reasons to come back and grind. Zombies was the absolute best in the series, releasing some of the best zombies maps of the Blundell era and then later adding the Zelinski golden age with Zombies Chronicles, that's not to mention the plethora of content available on the Steam Workshop.

My only major complaints about this game are the campaign making absolutely zero sense in any way (though the gameplay loop remains fun) and the multiplayer dlc maps going overboard with the whimsical settings (viking village, medieval magic castle, mortal kombat-esque island).

Unfortunetly you have to dish out about $100+ to get all of the content even to this day. The $60 dollars base game gives you Shadows of Evil which has a mind boggling amount of content for one map. This is great for people that are really into easter egg hunting but less so for casual players. All the other maps are the same way, but done in a way to make them more appealing to casual players. If you are a casual player I would definitely recommend the chronicles pack. $30 dollars may seem like a lot, but you get some of the best maps in zombies history.

Campaign- 2/10 - almost no connection to the previous entries in the series as well as bad gameplay and storytelling makes this one of the weakest in the franchises history. This game's campaign simply pales in comparison to BO1's and BO2's Campaign.

Multiplayer - 6/10 - Progression and gameplay is very good, however the fact that there are as many weapons locked behind supply drops as there are in the base game, as well as an almost dead multiplayer community prevents me from rating this any higher. 

Zombies - 10/10 - 14 maps, a compelling story, refined gameplay, a passionate and thriving community as well as endless hours of fun in custom zombies makes this the definitive experience for any zombies fan and anyone looking to get into zombies.",1597719325,1597719325,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198179017014,44,2,45840,2823,40509,1602049726

[b][h1]Overview[/h1][/b]
This game is a first-person shooter mode that is great like the previous Call of Duty series.
It can be said that after 5 years from the release of the game, it still has its own online players, but! Less time it takes to find a game server that is not annoying.
The offline part of the game also has a relatively interesting short story, which we will discuss its strengths and weaknesses

 üü© [b]CAMPAIGN[/b]
So... you liked the story of Alex and David Mason? You liked the way those characters were built and the intense narrative? You want more of the soldiers you know and love? Lol, no, ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• you. Treyarch decides to throw all of that in the trash and start anew with a story that has absolutely no link to the previous Black Ops games. I'm gonna be 100% honest with you here, I didn't understand a single bit of Black Ops 3's tale that it's so desperately trying to deliver in an interesting way. Spoiler alert, it's not interesting at all. While the other games were engaging and had deep, beautifully constructed plots, BO3 is a story about... ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• if I know. You basically play as a custom character (don't expect any depth to the level of customization, it's about 3 faces and 2 caps and that's it) which loses his/her limbs in an operation that goes terribly wrong. Then you get on a mission to destroy...the...Illuminati or something. Honestly it's quite twisted. What I'm trying to say is that the campaign isn't in the last bit memorable. Not the characters, not your motives, not anything. It's just a big mess. That's probably why you see so many ""Train go boom"" memes and ""Black Ops 3 ending explained"" videos on Youtube. But the gameplay of the campaign in itself is alright. The new thing is that you have some new, enhanced abilities which are actually pretty fun to use.



  üü© [b]ZOMBIES[/b]
 This is the part where Black Ops 3 shines the most. This is, without any doubt the best CoD game for zombies mode. Yes you have the classic 4 dlc formula for unlocking the current zombies maps, but there's also a dlc called ""Zombie Chronicles"" which allows you to play better, remastered versions of almost all of the zombies maps in previous CoD games. That is just awesome. Besides the fact that, in the age of Steam Workshop, you have hundreds of user-submitted maps at your disposal, maps which are pretty damn good most of the time. Even if you don't buy any dlc, the user maps and Shadows of Evil (the zombies map you get by default) are still gonna ensure you have a blast if you buy this game only for this mode. My respect to Treyarch for this amazing, top-notch zombies experience.


  üü© [b]MULTIPLAYER[/b]
 While many people don't take this game seriously because of the new movement mechanics, I can tell you the multiplayer here is quite solid. Unlike other CoD games, here you have specialists you can use in multiplayer instead of random/perk specific character models. These specialist have some abilities which give you an edge against other players, for example a bow with explosive arrows, invisibility, traps with nano-bees that kill any enemy that steps in them (it sounds ridiculous, I know), or some portable seismic charges that insta-kill nearby enemies (it may sound overpowered but you mostly get 1 or max 2 kills with it because of the short range and the fact that sometimes you don't even get to use them since you have to jump to trigger them and the enemy can kill you in mid-air). The new movement system with sliding and thrusters which allow you to glide or jump higher is actually well-implemented and smooth. It can make for some interesting plays or can be very frustrating at times, depending on the situation. But overall, it's a nice experience.

41,74155806,english,"First off, two things.

1. Don't buy this game if you're looking to play multiplayer or the campaign. They're both garbage.
2. GET THIS GAME WHEN IT GOES ON SALE! It usually goes on sale for ~50% off every summer or winter sale.

Those two things out of the way, Call of Duty Black Ops III is in my opinion the best CoD zombies experience there is. 
8 classic maps (9, if you include The Giant) beautifully remastered, all fun as hell, with 5 original maps (4 of them are DLC) that are in my opinion the best part about this game. On top of all that, the modding community is amazing. There's so many quality maps, some that even match the quality of the official maps. 
There's something for everyone. New CoD Zombies players can hop on the easier, more casual, simpler maps, such as Nacht, The Giant, and Kino. Or, if you've played zombies before, you'll love the more complex maps like Gorod Krovi, Origins, and Shadows of Evil.

However, it does have some negatives I would like to comment on briefly.
1. The game can be buggy as all hell. Like holy shit. The easter egg on the final DLC map, Revelations, the second to last step is so buggy that it can fuck up your whole run. So you can waste 2 hours, unless you down yourself to unglitch it, and that only works once as far as I'm aware. Origins is also glitchy as well, as my friends and I were doing the easter egg and it glitched and we just wasted several hours.
2. The zombie AI can be absolutely ridiculous. I see people saying that this zombies game is very watered down in difficulty due to the inclusion of Gobblegum and the 3-hit down system instead of the 2-hit, but that is completely negated by the AI in this game in my opinion. You can get hit up to 3 times by one zombie in a second, which can down you if you don't have the Juggernog perk.

And with all that being said, I still say this is the best CoD zombies you can play. It took the crown from Black Ops 1 in my heart (which is insane I never thought that would happen because I love that game to death), and I highly recommend this game to anyone.",1597181296,1597181296,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,76561198055237696,358,21,23931,0,19897,1600468694

if you're comin here from an older game with no f(riggi)ng clue what changed, or if it's your first cod game, keep these in mind:

- the campaign is a lot better when you dont consider it to be tied with the older black ops games (including waw)

With how old the game is, its almost impossible to get in a multiplayer lobby, although you kind of have to expect this when the game is like 5 years old, with newer games out there that have better multiplayer

I only recommend buying this game for the Zombies mode. Zombies mode is amazingly fun. I love to hop on with my friends and try to survive to really high rounds in zombies. Havent played the campaign before, not really interested in campaign. And even when you get bored of the normal zombies maps, this game has a good modding community as well.

My only complaint is that the game is priced a bit too high for zombies being the only mode I and others seem to enjoy. However, this is why I bought it when it was on sale.

66,22625779,english,"As a long time COD Zombies fan, I only feel good about reviewing the zombies side of the game, so here it goes. 

Black Ops 3 delivers an interesting Zombies experience with its season pass DLC alone. I describe it as interesting because it really wasn't the best set of maps in my opinion. They were awesome in their own ways but they didn't give off quite the same feel as the maps in the past 3 Treyarch games.
That being said, this is still an amazing buy for an ultimate Zombies fan... If you are willing to shell out about $150. If you can do that, then you can have a great Call of Duty Zombies experience. Between 4 season pass DLC maps, The Giant DLC, and the Zombie Chronicles DLC, you are getting every single map that has featured the original 4 characters.
It is true that you won't get your favorites like Call of the Dead, Mob of the Dead, Buried, or Tranzit (lol), but you will still be getting a lot of content.
To say a little bit about the remastered maps in Zombie Chronicles - They look absolutely amazing. Treyarch has gone all out to push the limits of the newer resources they have in order to make each map glow with beautiful new lighting and even some new sound effects. The maps are extremely detailed and feature even some new easter eggs to discover.

So who do I recommend this to most? People who are new/interested in getting into COD Zombies. It's a full bundle with a ton of maps and even though $150 sounds like a lot, it would cost a ton more to buy all of the COD Zombies games and their DLC. Of course if you're a long time Zombies fan you will really appreciate the effort put into the remasters in the DLC.

Overall I give the Zombies section of this game a 9/10.",1461571320,1596182167,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198019225117,385,16,12570,0,11591,1596182131

76,73372375,english,"[h1]!!! FOR THE ZOMBIES MODE ONLY !!! [/h1] 

 I only purchased Black Ops III for the zombies mode with [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/581450/Call_of_Duty_Black_Ops_III__Zombies_Chronicles/] Zombies Chronicles[/url] and only play it for zombies. There's 14 maps to choose from and a workshop open to the community with over hundreds of hours worth of content. Great for beginners to CoD Zombies with the unique Gobble Gum system and a slight health boost compared to the other games. Immense fun with friends and randoms, even by yourself, but not worth the full price with or without DLC included. [b] Do yourself a favor and pick up a copy during a sale! [/b]

 So... if it's a mostly good experience besides the price tag, why the negative review? Crashes, soft-locks, bugs and the classic 5-hit-in-1-frame zombie attack unfortunately hinder the game's potential. Some of the remastered maps from the Zombie Chronicles DLC, such as Origins, can be broken from doing something as simple as going to the wrong place on the map at the wrong time. For a game that can cost up to $80 it's unacceptable to run like its been put together with tape and bits of string. [b]Black Ops III Zombies is not unplayable but can be frustrating when things behind the curtains go haywire.

I also liked the inclusion of the Split Screen mode where you can also do a trick to make split screen in 2 different monitors. Further optimization and modding support were implemented from time to time. A console version should be a must buy instead of the PC version, unless you're willing to play A BUNCH OF custom content and mods. The current gen consoles version is the best option to enjoy the optimized original content and multiplayer servers are full of ppl playing many different game modes.

42,71917848,english,"Call of Duty black Ops 3 was my 1st call of duty game. It will always hold a special place in my heart. But this is a review so I have to be unbiased thus. I will look past my personal feelings and just look at the pure gameplay and feel of the game.

 Campaign wow what a shit show I cannot even begin to explain to you why this is a bad camping but I'll try.  OK for starters the story doesn't connect to the 1st 2nd game well enough which is already a bad sign. But that would be the least of our problems if that was the case and they made a good story it could be ignored but not only did it not connect to the previous games but it also had a bad story.  And I can't really explain the story to you because I don't know the story. It's bad that I have played this campaign 5 times. If I could go back and stop myself from playing this campaign I would but I played it for you so that I can write this review. After playing it 5 times I still can't write this review. The game play of the campaign missions was very linear. So over all a 2/10

 Now the multiplayer how does it hold up. Not that good to be honest the advanced movement kind of broke the Call of Duty formula that it established over the years and this is also around the era of loot boxes and heavy microtransactions I think that there are more DLC weapons then free weapons in this game. The maps are also 3 lane garbage And the leveling up system of the weapons doesn't feel extremely rewarding. Overall I give this multiplayer a 5/10

 Now how does this game handle Zombies? My God it is my favorite zombie out of all the Call of Duty games All the DLC maps are great.  Shadows of evil amazing map. der eisendrache arguably one of the best. Zetsubou no Shima is hated by most of the community But personally it's my favorite map of all time. gorod krovi Great map. Revelations good map for beginners really easy. Chronicles 8 remastered maps from the other games imported into the B03 engine. 3 from world at war. 4 from black Ops one. One from black Ops 2. And then you technically have the giant which is a world at war map but that's not Chronicles. Then there is custom zombies which opens up unlimited doors and upon purchase of the game you get the free mod tools to create your own maps. Overall I give a 10/10",1593740559,1595723739,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198397845652,34,10,2477,74,693,1601933320

56,73269395,english,"Regarding the campaign:

1. The 'player's' body dies halfway thru the second mission, when your training with Taylor's squad.
2. From then on, the player is a DNI backup of your mind, living on in a simulation running (at first) in John Taylor's DNI / Brain, created by the CORVUS AI. CORVUS is the infection.   
3. In that simulation, each time you interface with one of Taylor's team via DNI, that member DIES in the real world. Sarah Hall is particularly confused when this happens, but realizes whats happening just before she dies. Each interface also spreads the infection, which has been incubating in the running simulation.
4. In the final mission, you play IN TAYLOR'S BODY in the real world, however the player grabs control of him. That's why Kane is confused when you say ""You didn't leave me"" or something.
5. Taylor guides the player into Coalessance HQ and tricks him into 'purging his DNI'. The player does this, not realizing he IS the infection at that point. 
6. The infection having been purged, Taylor, now back in control of his mind, greets the arriving troops. The voice sounds like the player because all thru the simulation, Jon Taylor wore the players face, and you wore Jon Taylors :)",1595696575,1595696674,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561197970502802,286,22,24007,0,23818,1596380949

It takes alot of time to get them, then the game forces you to make micro transactions to even get them! I only recommend this for zombie players, Multiplayer is very annoying with all the new futuristic movement types. Some may like these features, but i personally hate them. The class's idea was okay. Now i got this game for zombies, And i was not disapointed!  The workshop gave unlimited maps to play on and the community maps some time feel like real Tryarch maps. If you dont have the game yet.

Between the fun times I've had with friends playing zombies, canonical or custom, and the exhilarating Mirror's-Edge-Simulator that is multiplayer, this experience offers fun-filled ingredients in a tightly wrapped tortilla.

[h1]Campaign[/h1]
The campaign will never be as good as the first two black ops campaigns, but it's not as bad as people have made it out to be. Albeit I had to do outside research to figure out what the heck was going on (especially the ending). If you are into getting all achievements, then go crazy; However, the missions didn't leave a lasting impact on me, so if not, then don't play it.
5/10

[h1]Multiplayer[/h1]
I personally love the multiplayer. It's dead except for soft-core TDM. But back when the game first came out, it  was on fire. Running into the same people was kind of cool and the dlc weapons were not only exciting but overpowered. The camos are incredibly beautiful, especially the dark matter camo.
My favorite part of this mode was the melee. The comical variety that the melee weapons offered, like slashing up people with a samurai sword, or backhanding people with a mannequin arm, the combo of parkour and smacking people around provided some great laughs and salty reactions to people getting killed.
[b]Beware:[/b] there are alot of fake level 1000s in lobbys due to bought accounts and some hackers here and there nowadays.
8/10

[h1]Zombies[/h1]
This mode is the only real reason to buy this game in 2020. This is the peak of zombies in my opinion. Each dlc map was innovative and exciting and never boring in it's own way, and revelations is one of my favorite all time maps.  The custom zombies maps are not to be slept upon either, some of which are just as good as the canonical maps.

21,73010913,english,Best call of duty zombies system hand down. Everything from movement to AI to aesthetic. I really wish they would've remastered every map because that would've been amazing to see in this game. Not a huge fan of the remasters they made in BO4 as far as i can tell they could've easily done that in BO3 and they should've stuck to the new story they created in BO4. Only complaint is I feel like the ending to zombies should've been planned out to end in this game instead we got a rushed ending in garbage BO4 because treyarch sadly never knows where they want to go with they're own story so everytime we get something new its pretty much made on the spot out of no where. This game is great (zombies) The multiplayer in this game ruined call of duty for me but that's another story. But honestly i think not remastering every map leading up to this game was a huge mistake.

23,72847559,english,"Campaign - Campaign is really not that good compared to older Black Ops games. I would say it has the worst campaign in Black Ops. 

Multiplayer - Multiplayer is really fun. My all time favourite. The guns are balanced (except for brecci and xmc) the movement is really fun with thruster jump. The specialists are not overpowered. This game has the best skins in all of COD games after and they are worth the grind. As a bonus, this game also has gold character skins but the grind for that will take you a good 200 hours. This game also has black market, where you open cases to get dlc guns and cosmetics, do challenges and unlock mercenery contracts. The maps are good. BO2 Nuketown is the best and this one comes after that in my oppinion. This game has 10 prestige levels going up to level 55 in each prestige. After prestige 10 you unlock prestige master going up to level 1000. 

Zombies - Zombies is extremely fun. The only downside is the games can last really really long (once went up to 102nd round and it took me 10 hours). All the maps are fun to play and my fav is ascension. I recommend zombies chronicles edition.

83,42452568,english,"I have mostly positive things to say about Black Ops III. I surely do love BO3 to this day, and always will. I don't see as many hackers but people using controllers can be really annoying. I have been playing BO3 in the Middle East on European Servers and I would usually have a decent to terrible ping of 150-250 ms, where 150 ping is the best I have gotten. I believe Activision need to invest on dedicated servers in the Middle East/Asia because there are a majority of players in Asia that are forced to join EU servers and have their experience ruined from the terrible connection. As for the gameplay, I have little problems with the advanced movement in MP and the weapons feel very satisfying to use. Map design is overall good with my favorite maps being Nuk3town, Combine, Fringe, Outlaw, Skyjacked, Micro, Empire and several more.

Graphics in BO3 could still hold up today, and it is fairly optimized for mid-range players. The soundtrack is also great, from SP, MP and Zombies. Treyarch did a really good job in this department.

Zombies in BO3 is personally my favorite in the COD franchise. I'll just summarize my favorite maps here:
- Shadows of Evil, a great map at launch. A visually appeasing map, and one of the most annoying mini-bosses of all time. And let's not all forget the ending cutscene on last gen...
- Der Eisendrache, one of the greatest Zombies maps of all time. Awesome gameplay, overpowered Wonder Weapons, an intense boss fight and an easter egg cutscene that is very touching. I have actually visited the place of inspiration for Der Eisendrache which is in Werfen, Austria and I truly will never forget that moment.
- Gorod Krovi, just like Der Eisendrache it remains as a top map among the players. Dragons and fire everywhere, another awesome easter egg and what is believed to be the last 'actual' map in the Aether story before Revelations.
- And speaking of Revelations, a map that takes you across memory lane. Returning Wonder Weapons, a dope-looking Pack-a-Punch camo and probably one of the easiest maps in Zombies to go for high rounds.
I think we should all appreciate that Treyarch then dropped Zombies Chronicles which then basically revolutionized CoD and some consider it the best game in the series, including me. Some Gobblegums in BO3 are too OP, but they are quite useful when speedrunning easter eggs or high rounds. 

In here, I wanna talk about the Black Market. The Black Market is terrible, but I can say that BO4's adaptation is now miles better than BO3. All weapons are locked behind Supply Drops, old players will know about Triple Plays and how weapons could be earned for free. I had put a lot of money into BO3 (~$600) and despite the 'effort' I now have all weapons from the Black Market, and I promised myself not to spend another Dollar on a Supply Drop. I'm not gonna let the Black Market undermine my thoughts of BO3 because at the end of the day, I'm not gonna spend any more money on it.

BO3 is just overall great. It's the most populated CoD on Steam and still is. It has been the longest supported CoD post-launch, mainly lasting for over 2 1/2 years which shows how much people truly play BO3. From my experience with Call of Duty: Black Ops III, you can theoretically expect endless playtime, however for some people that move on to different games can expect 500+ hours assuming that you are playing MP and ZM only. Definitely worth my purchase with over 2,000 hours on BO3.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Call of Duty: Black Ops 4 review: Guess I'll have to do my review here...
Being Prestige Master in MP and ZM, this is a game that I have enjoyed despite some people's negative thoughts. I am now fully adapted to the MP and as a proud owner of Dark Matter on all modes, it definitely is one of my main achievements in my gaming career. Customization is now better than BO3 with awesome looking animated camos, outfits and weapon variants. But where do you get most of these?

The Black Market! I suppose you didn't need to guess if you read my review of BO3. 
But as I said in it, this Black Market is significantly better after November 12, 2019. This day marks the fact that Activision is making change to their monetization for future games. With the recent update to the Black Market, it will now be possible to obtain ALL items by grinding the game. 'All' as in previous items that could only be purchased. I believe this to be a huge win for all of us as I would have continued to keep on spending, and luckily enough I've only spend $250 in a single year (From April to October). I just don't know why this was implemented long before when Reserve Crates were introduced. But yeah, another year of grinding to completion.

Blackout is indeed fun to play. My favorite limited time modes are Ambush, Alcatraz Portal and Hot Pursuit and Heavy Metal Heroes. I really enjoy stalking up to people and knifing them with the Bowie Knife! Never gets old... My only minor issue was that Blackout seemed to be getting more content than MP and ZM. I understand that Blackout is the pinnacle of BO4, however there has to be an equal amount of content added to all modes. 

Speaking of modes, Zombies has somewhat changed from BO3. Some people say it is significantly harder than the previous game and I agree to a certain extent. The health system is weird and annoys me every time I go down. I am very glad that they added camo progression as soon even though it should have been on launch. And again, I got Dark Matter in Zombies since July 2019. Here's my verdict on my favorite Zombies maps in BO4:
- Blood of the Dead, the remaster (or should I say re-imagine) of the fan-favorite Mob of the Dead. This is my most played map because it's very easy to set up and of course I know the map like the back of my palm. For some players, looking back at it now it seems to be a little bit disappointing on what was done, but I digress
- IX, one of the most immersive maps I've played. Cheers everywhere, tigers in Rome and gladiators constantly coming for you. IX has a very simple map design and good graphics.
- Classified, another reimagined map from ""Five"". My personal favorite map cuz it's another map that doesn't take long to set up and an easy camping spot.
- Ancient Evil, a visually pleasing piece of art. Excellent gameplay and plenty of space to train zombies. Also the map takes place in Greece FTW ;)
- Tag Der Toten, the last map in CoD Zombies as we say goodbye to our beloved characters. This may be a reimagining of Call of the Dead, but I feel that it looks/plays different to be its own unique map.

I'm kinda sad that Treyarch confirmed that Operation Dark Divide will be their last major content drop in BO4 as they have moved onto their next Call of Duty game in 2020 (or 2021), but nonetheless they will continue supporting BO4 with playlist changes and Double XP. Back in March 2018 Treyarch said that BO4 was supposed to last for years but promises do eventually break. I'll be taking a momentary break from BO4 as I've got no other choice than do delete it as it takes up too much space, and I find myself not coming to this game as often.",1527962986,1594409208,True,2,0,0.549071609973907471,0,True,False,False,76561198333764689,29,10,135467,0,100592,1598955056

The way they took out the fun and replaced it with tedium is disgusting. Who the f**k wants to go through 30 convoluted, needlessly tricky and completely unexplained steps just to last a regular amount of time? I just want to turn on the power, get perks, get guns, pack a punch the guns. I don't want to be forced into a giant, pointless easter egg in every single map just to do the simplest things. It's absolutely insane that they thought anyone would want the game centered entirely around easter eggs when they were only ever simply a novelty that some people liked doing sometimes. Now, EVERYONE is FORCED to do at least some of their garbage, unintuitive steps in every game. This is clearly because they inserted too many overpowered perks and weapons that they needed to make the game actually hard again. 
Not even gonna mention the cheap Gobblegum garbage they injected to rake in extra money from Zombies.

Has some best zombie maps in zombies, although complicated yet still fun when you know and remember how to setup in certain maps as well completing the EEs.

Gobblegums are a neat (overpowered) addition, although it takes away the challenging feeling, it is still possible to play without them, either way it's still a neat addition to the game.

Der Eisendrache is just as great as Origins, Zetsubou is pretty good, Gorod is one of the best and Revelations as well. Shadows is at least decent.

Zombie Chronicles is the best DLC by far, playing those maps again with newer graphics, new weapons and BO3 features while maintaining the nostalgic feel of the map is just
PERFECTION.

Multiplayer is neat, but it's almost dead sadly. Campaign is meh, Nightmares was better.
(Dead Ops 2 is amazing, love playing that over and over again with new features!)

The way you unlock attachments as you kill zombies as well unlock weapons to add them with your favorite camo, good attachments and paintjobs is just amazing. The XP and level up system in Zombies is just a great addition, It's so worth it grinding here.

Although BO3 is not that neat, you can't tell me that the Zombies here are not good. The release of mod tools made Zombies even more fun or so.

While WaW and BO1 was a masterpiece and BO2 had a good zombies, this one has the best and the most I had fun in the entire zombies series.

BO4 was fine, it was just rushed sadly by Activision.

6/10 Campaign, meh it didn't have the ""Black Ops"" feeling anymore but it's story was somewhat decent.

8/10 Multiplayer, a good multiplayer with good new additons, sadly it's almost dead now.

i have yet to enjoy a seamless multiplayer mode, given how i can NEVER CONNECT TO A LOBBY, despite good internet connection and open NAT. and given how this game really REALLY wants to syphon your money with microtrasnactions and map packs and shit , plus a token campaing of which i forgot everything the moment i finished it , id say 30 bucks is worth it, DECENT, GOOD zombies mode, but thats it.


the moment i can log in and find a game like i can in FUCKING GHOSTS, then ill recomend this game.

no issues with any other game. ONLY. with call of duty games. my now much better connection tells me one thing for sure. it's not my NAT (which is always open) or my speed. 

so given that i am still brown, gay and not rich, i assume this game doesn't use your location of speed to matchmake, it decides if you get to play it depending entirely on your privilege .

I bought the Zombies Deluxe edition and aside from an ongoing glitch where I literally can't change my gobblegum, its great. The colors are vibrant and the maps are fleshed out, and if there's an old map you want to play chances are its been remade in the workshop. The game runs smoothly for me with mostly ultra settings and I don't have any issues.
Aside from the aforementioned gobblegum glitch.
I looked online and the only two answers i've received were: Reinstall the game, or install the multiplayer. I installed the multiplayer only to find that the gobblegum will still reset after customization, and given the size of the game I don't feel like reinstalling it.
I will edit this when I find a solution.

Gorod Krovi - another amazing map. Not as good as DE but definitely a must play

Revelations - a nice map that will treat older fans of the series. Is a bit easy (if you know what's on the map) but still fun af

97,71957833,english,Bought this in the sale for zombies exclusively. It can have some problems? I've been kicked out of solo matches when I played online for absolutely no reason that Activisions incompitence which is annoying but this has not happened with friends yet and is recomdied by going offline? I dont get it either? Moving on. I only have zombies installed as its all I care about and the extra content from the zombies chronicles is fantastic. The old great maps remade with some minor changes to keep it feeling fresh. After playing those and seeing how well crafted they was I then caved in and got the DLC maps. In the sale specifically this was probably a very good move but at full price I struggle to see the reason why a 5 year old game without the extra content is worth it. If you get the chance to pick it up (Assuming its the zombies your interested in) I can recommend it.

But, you get whiny-ass people on zombies who either leave the lobby when they see people who don't have the exact same high rank as them, or leave in-game when they keep sucking and going down. Plus, it's already hard enough to find a good lobby as it is. 
Despite me playing on a $1400 custom gaming computer that is very powerful, the frame rate lags occasionally. It turns out the game uses more of the RAM in your computer with a recent update. 
As for multiplayer? I've never been too good at PvP type of games, and the multiplayer maybe too fast paced for some casual players. 
If you want a game that is broken and with people who will ruin it more, this game is for you.

UPDATE:
As it turns out, the game doesn't even launch properly now. I have to run it in a ""safe-mode"" which reduces the quality of the graphics to an exceptionally annoying image quality. The game won't even start now without safe mode, and I can't get a refund on this game due to me playing more than 2 hours.

65,71887793,english,"Since Black Ops III is on steam summer sale and I bought it a year ago on sale and made a review, I thought I'd make a rehashed review, since at the time of making my old review, I was a filthy casual. Black Ops III is a possibly one of the most flawed call of duty games of all time, with a shitty micro-transaction system, terrible map-design in multiplayer, horrible campaign, and so much more. But past those flaws is the best modern call of duty game of all time, besides the reboot of modern warfare. Lets climb ur way up from bo3's worst content to it's best

Campaign:
Needless to say it's horrible, the main reason you'd want to play a campaign is it's story, and bo3's story is awful, it has a good premise if you know what's happening, but it's impossible to understand without looking up a guide, and even with it, I was still confused looking into it. To add even more insult, there isn't a branching story like bo2, so there wouldn't be any good reason to revisit the campaign unless you want achievements. The gameplay is questionable, challenges return from bo2 which is great, and there are a lot more to do, but not many people would replay missions to complete challenges unless there is a reward, which bo3 has none of in it's campaign, bo2 at least gave extra customization, such as new weapons and perks if you do the challenges in the campaign, bo3 however doesn't which is just upsetting. The new realistic difficulty is pretty cool, albeit very unfair, like it's suppose to be, as it's harder than veteran, of course they're gonna make it very unfair, although, even after completing a mission on realistic, I didn't feel correctly rewarded, unlike when I completed a mission of bo1 or waw, or even bo2 on veteran. Either way, the campaign is terrible, and you shouldn't buy bo3 if you're looking for an interesting or fun story to play, as is most modern cod games.

Multiplayer:
Now being honest, I don't have too much of a say in the multiplayer side of things, as I don't really play multiplayer that often, but I do play with friends on private matches, so I'll start by discussing how I feel about the gameplay. It's great! The boost jumping feels smoother then advanced warfare, and there is an actual cool down to the boost, unlike advanced warfare, meaning the combat will mostly be boots on the ground whilst the boost jumping can be used as extra movement. However, people who have mastered using the boost jumping would be able to use it to their advantage in combat, which can be quite annoying, but those are usually your prestige master people which I don't believe I encountered often. The class customization is awful, there is a pit full amount of secondaries to choose from and the pick ten system. although great for helping diverage into mid-maxing abilities and weapons, does limit choice, so it's sort of a win-lose situation with it. The worst part about the class customization is most of the weapons are only unlockable through unboxing loot boxes, which i'll get to. Either way, class customization doesn't feel strong, plus some weapons aren't balanced very well, such as the brecci, which is still supremely overpowered even without the jitter mods. The grind in bo3 is absurd, but amazing, there are so many things to go for such as dark matter camo, and level 1000, which is why people are still playing this game to this day. and then there are those damn loot boxes. Lootboxes can be opened for free with cryptokeys and completing challenges like winning 75 matches, you also get free weapon bribes which are nice, but it's an insanely long grind which highly encourages one to spend money, which you shouldn't on a game you already payed 60 dollars or less on sale for. There is a supposed 0.8% chance to get a new weapon from supply drops, which is less odds of getting a ray gun mark II from die rise. This system should've died a long time ago, but unfortunetly it would be on bo3's reputation forever as a stain of this great game. Multiplayer's map design is lack luster, there are very few maps I remember besides maybe exodus, but that's because it's a campers dream. The maps were designed to be for boost jumping and wall running, and since i'm more of a boots on the ground call of duty fan, I have not too much say in this, but I do think most of them are boring. In terms of buying dlc, i wouldn't really buy a dlc for multiplayer specifically, as they only come with 4 maps, and I barely played any of the dlc maps, besides maybe sky jacked, they all seem way more boring compared to bo2's dlc maps, which were way better. Bo2's dlc maps had hazards in the enviournment that would make then engaging and add a new level of awarness to the player, for example the map magma, which woould have lava rising on one level and touching it would result in one's death. Again, this was a huge oversight in the developers and the map designers, so with this, I wouldn't reccommend buying bo3's dlc specifically for multiplayer. In conclusion, don't buy bo3 specifically for multiplayer really, as the only thing noteworthy is the grind for cosmetics and levels, but being honest, it's the best advanced movement call of duty multiplayer out there.

Extras:
I can't dwell to deep into this, as some of them I haven't played very much but here's my take. Treyarch put a lot of effort trying to pack bo3 with so much content on disk/without dlc which I loved, a problem I had with bo2 is that they didn't really have any extra modes, while it didn't discount bo2 that much, it did make it a little bleak even compared to bo1. Starting from the worst of the extras is a mode called nightmares, which is bo3's campaign with zombies and as the title implies, it's the player's nightmares, again I didn't play it that much but after the first couple missions, I found it boring and with barely any plot, so in my eyes it's not really worth playing. The next one is free run, which is a nice time trial game where you can help improved your ability to use advanced movement, it's a neat side mode The greatest of all of them would have to go to dead ops arcade 2, it returns from bo1 in glorious fashion and is an absloute blast to play, it feels way better than the original, as it has tons more features than it. I would highly recommend playing it at least once. of course these are small side modes wouldn't merit purchesing a whole game, but they're great distractions and they're fun to play once in a while.

Zombies:
This is bo3's masterpiece, what I would purchese a sixty dollar game for just to play. I mentioned before on how I was a casual player when making my first review of bo3, I sort of only gave huge credit to chronicles and custom zombies, but I didn't talk about bo3's original maps which I'll go in order from
Shadows of evil - A true masterpiece, it's pretty new player friendly if they look out for visual cues, but for the most part, hardcore players would find a lot of enjoyment from this map, I truly find it to be one of zombies must play experience, I love the jazz music as a jazz musician myself, it's awesome to hear it in a zombies map with ancient evils lurking around. The theme is absloutely amazing for a zombies map and there is a lot to work with, there is also a lot of unsolved ee begging to be found in soe, which to this day still need to be solved, which truely makes this map a masterpice. My only gripes are the setup process can be quite tedious and the 4 player required ee, which as a solo player, is a disaster. but if you can get over those flaws, you would find a zombies map that many would consider a top 5.
The giant - This was a great launch map, although I should've been on disk as well, shadows was quite complicated and the giant was great for being it's opposite as a simple recognizable remaster. Despite the fact it was paid, it made a great launch date map to cover for any foils soe might've had with how complex it was. Plus treyarch being the absloute gods add some extra ees",1593705639,1593705639,True,0,0,0,7,True,False,False,76561198401974451,46,3,17580,0,16869,1597165846

1. Campaign Story. 
Even though it strays a lot from what the series has done in the past, the story is really well written and deep. It grips the player right from the start and the way it comes together, piece by piece towards the big revelation, it just works.
2. Gameplay
Lots of new additions here. The gunplay is great as expected from Treyarch but the other things is what makes BO3, the specialist abilities, the skill trees and the freedom to use it however you see fit.
3. Co-Op.
Not gonna say much about this, It's like l4d2 fun but in black ops. Working together your abilities is just next level fun. Treyarch really gave this all a thought before making the game unlike Bo4.

Multiplayer.
Boots on the ground with futuristic gunplay. It just works. At the end of the day, it feels like Call of Duty, (in a good way).

Zombies
Pretty much the reason to buy this game, if you haven't already. ""One game to rule them all"";  ""This one is here to stay""; ""GOAT"". -- These are the phrases that come to mind when describing this. With custom maps, and a community that has delivered, this is the best zombies experience. Having played the entirety of COD Zombies and having over 2k hours on them combined, I can confidently say that this is the best COD Zombies till date.

Just talking about Bo4 maps. The maps are well thought of and aren't remakes of the old maps (well, technically, Der riese is remade but it's so good that it makes up for the fact that it's remade and even then that's just 1/5. The 4 maps which are new are amazing. So detailed and each with an easter egg and map design that is top tier. Out of all zombies maps, these 4 straight up make the top 10 list. Add Zombies chronicles and custom maps to the mix and you have an unending zombies marathon weekend.

30,56462332,english,"Call of Duty: Black Ops 3 offers a lot of content for the price. The most notible things being the multiplayer, singleplayer, and the zombies. The single player is very weird. It is decently enjoyable even though I have no idea what is even happening in the story anymore. It might not be the best story. It might not be even good, but the solid gameplay makes up for it, and makes the campaign at the very least bearable. The multiplayer I will skip in this review as I am very inexperienced in it. The few times I have played, it was very easy to recognise the potential for fun, but I never really got into it. The zombies is probably the main reason why most people would buy this game nowadays, and it doesn't dissapoint. The zombies is very fun. The progression is awesome, and opens up for customizing weapon kits. The mod support is also very well implemented, and gives nearly infinite amounts of replayability to the game. Now one of the most underrated features... The paintshop. This is the perfect way to personalize your weapons. I wish every game did this. It is so much fun to make skins, and opens up for endless amounts of opportunity, and creativity in making skins, and emblems. The way you make them is intuitive, and never too complicated, but still has enough to make complicated skins. The graphics in this game are really good, and hold up very well. one thing I don't like is that if you have a complicated paint job on your weapon, sometimes the game doesn't display all the layers, and makes your gun look like a half completed skin which is kind of dissapointing. There are also a few extra game modes which are just icing on the cake.

79,70817380,english,"Call of Duty: Black Ops III is a great game! 
The thing that makes it so great is obviously the Zombie-mode and its many maps. 
If you buy it from Steam you also get the Chronicles edition with it wich lets u play older but reworked maps from mostly Black Ops and World at War. 
You get the most out of it playing with friends but if you don't have friends you could just go into public and find people who also don't have anyone to play with.
You do also get the Zombies map Origins from Black Ops II wich is to many people one of the best Zombies maps in Zombie history. 
One more thing is that the Easter Eggs are so good in this game. I can't speak for every map because i don't have every single one but it's very fun and gives a tough challenge.
The maps you get are as following:
------------------------------------
World at War:
Nacht der Untoten
Verruckt
Shi no Numa
--------------
Black Ops:
Kino der Toten
Ascension
Shangri La
Moon
-------------
Black Ops II:
Origins
--------
If I would summarize the game I would say that if you love Zombies you should get this. But if you are in for Multiplayer just don't buy it because the servers are very bad and there isn't so many players aswell.
Some downsides with the game is that without a sale the game costs 60 dollars and on a sale the game is 30 dollars. the game would be bought more if they would make the game like 40 dollars normally and 20 dollars on sale. Also the DLCs are also very expensive, around 8 bucks per map. But if you have some spare money on your steam account you should definitely buy them. 
The cost of the things wouldn't be a big problem if the game where new, but the game came out 2015 so it is around 5 years old. 
But if we only focus on the Zombies mode its already worth 20-30 dollars. The Campain is boring and not so much to talk about. The multiplayer is fun if it works, but it dosen't.
The graphics isn't so bad either but is definently outplayed by Black ops IIII. But come on, it's from 2015.
Summary:
Buy the game if u have spare coins and do not buy the game if you don't have enough money or if you're just in for the Multiplayer nor the Campain....    Because it's really bad.",1592210152,1593271059,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,76561198205027825,66,1,8420,321,5831,1602009877

26,71427099,english,"Campaign: Terrible. I played the campaign in its entirety when this game came out 5 years ago. An admittedly cool premise gets gunned down by a confusing, muddled and overall pointless story. Completely skip it.

Multiplayer: ...eh. Apart from the advanced movement plaguing the multiplayer, its fairly standard Call of Duty fare. You might have a better time with it if you like advanced movement.

Zombies: The best. This is the best part about this game bar none. The workshop is almost entirely dedicated to custom zombie maps, guns, powerups, gameplay changes... anything you can think of, this game and the workshop probably has. Its a zombie players wet dream and its done to damn near perfection and is the primary reason why i picked up the game on pc, and is why im giving this a recommended review.

Apart from that, the game has some type of parkour speedrun minigame where you use the advanced movement to run on walls and sometimes shoot targets and get to the end as fast as you can. This was one of the minigames you could play if you were installing this game for the first time on a ps4 or xbox one, but doesnt really serve much of a point on PC, and even on console you would never pick it up again after the game fully installs.

theres also a mini campaign that has zombies. it basically just takes levels from the campaign and adds a totally different story to it. Its... eh. If you play through it, youll probably forget the story within seconds.

TLDR, Campaigns utter ass, multiplayer is eh, and the zombies? Oh yeah, doesn't get much better than this.

Edit: Oh, microtransactions are n this game too. Fuck microtransactions",1593198950,1593199501,True,1,0,0.519999980926513672,0,True,False,False,76561198160741843,230,45,2677,0,370,1595080620

28,71425491,english,"You're only buying this for the zombies. Admit it. 
Campaign is the worst out of the 3, and multiplayer isn't home to a lot of players.

Zombies... Where do I start? 
If you buy the Zombies Chronicles Edition, you're getting SOE, [b]ONE OF THE BEST MAPS OF ALL TIME [/b], and some of the best maps from WaW, BO1 and BO2, including Kino Der Toten, the classic, f****** Origins, [b] ANOTHER CONTENDER FOR ONE OF THE BEST MAPS OF ALL TIME [/b], and a lot more (like Nacht, Ascension, etc.)
If this isn't enough for you, you can buy the Deluxe edition which includes DE and GK, again, two of the few best maps ever and ZNS, which is also pretty good. It also comes with Revelations, but this one isn't as good as the other 3.

82,71340180,english,They should just make a standalone zombies game. That's the only reason I have ever bought any of these games from WaW back in the day to BO3 now to play Zombies. I've never been interested in Multiplayer but from the day I was first introduced to WaW's Nazi Zombies at a friends house I was instantly hooked. Black Ops 3 does not disappoint when bringing back old classics like Der Riese with new perks and guns although sometimes I do wish there was an option to use older guns instead of the futuristic weapons. The community workshop also has some very nice map submissions designed to entertain you when you get bored of the classic maps. If you're looking solely just to play Zombies then you should definitely buy this game  but it's probably a better idea to wait and get the Zombies Chronicle on sale.,1593116109,1593116109,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198046114045,247,25,6059,0,5565,1593921447

67,67608367,english,"Here I am in 2020 writing a review for Black Ops III. I bought the Xbox version of this game back when it released and spent my entire senior year of high school getting my cheeks clapped in multiplayer. I ranked up all the way through master prestige before I realized that this multiplayer was buns and that I hated specialists in Call Of Duty games. I would do many things to get that 14 days of my life back. 

Enter the present day, and here I am as a college student. I am displeased with the poor execution of Infinity Ward's Modern Warfare, and I am insulted by 343's existence as a whole. I long for the days of Halo 3/Reach custom games, or maybe for the classic Call Of Duty ground war lobbies full of children screaming racial slurs. Or hell, even a good ol' fashion game of zombies on Der Reise would be enough for me to relieve my adolescent years. You know what would be even cooler? Zombies - in Bikini Bottom. Or Zombies - but in Andy's room from Toy Story. 

To be quite honest, every aspect of the steam version of this game is 100% useless outside of zombies. Multiplayer isn't the most populated thing in the world, and honestly who has paid attention to  a COD campaign after Modern Warfare 3? Yes, the game is listed at FULL PRICE. Its Activision. It's Call Of Duty. Don't act like you're surprised - because unless you have been living under a rock for the last 10 years you shouldn't be. 

If you can get over that pesky price tag, what you will receive is a zombies experience that brings back some of the creative elements that made Zombies great in the first place. This is accomplished through Steam's workshop full of custom made maps that are downloadable for free. Getting a map is as easy as clicking the BIG GREEN BUTTON THAT SAYS SUBSCRIBE and then launching the game after it's finished downloading. 

What is really great about this is that there are countless maps to choose from. The people that design these are so incredibly good at what they do. You can tell that these people actually have a passion for zombies and want to provide players with something fun to play, just like zombies used to be before introducing 423157896 sub plots and stories to the mode. I've downloaded a handful of maps, such as Bikini Bottom Zombies, and Backlot (COD4 map) zombies. There are even Easter eggs that allow you to leave some of these custom maps. Many of them come with objectives that play out just like any other Treyarch zombie map would. The amount of effort that was put into some of these custom zombies maps is absolutely incredible. Lighting, perk placement, sounds, hitmarkers, prices, pack a punch - literally crafted to (sometimes) perfection. It's like the workshop brings you back to World At War and Black Ops 1 era zombies and lets you have fun again. With a group of friends this is 100% a blast. Just imagine you and your homies fighting zombies in a friggan' toilet stall - just awesome!

 I understand that the game is 4 years old and is still full price and yes I think this is stupid too - but look at the opportunities for fun here. You are given the chance to explore so many different maps and modes that you have not played before, while at the same time revisiting some of your finest memories of Call Of Duty zombies. If you are looking for something to take you back to that ""golden age"" of zombies or just gaming in general I would honestly suggest that you and a couple of your buddies give this a shot. It brought a smile to my face, and it also made me realize how the COD series would benefit from a ""Forge"" mode of some sort - we can dream right?",1587278924,1592866208,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,76561198189421378,60,8,483,0,307,1592262089

This game still has people playing it till this day. Multiplayer is a meh. I barely find people in there but i do find them in Zombies because of how well the gamemode is. This game unlike the other black ops games has 6 zombies maps that they made for this game and their all fun. They also have 8 remastered fan favorites from WAW all the way to BO2.

The transition of the level counter looks so cool, the power ups are great and so many perks to choose from. The maps, especially the remastered ones are amazing and great to play. Everything about how the arcade style pulls you in. Knowing you can't win, but the rounds are rather fast and fun. Maybe except the first few rounds where the zombies are REALLY slow and take their time to get to you. All rounds about 33+ get rather hard with the amount of zombies coming at you at once. My only complaint is how the remastered maps don't have the WaW (WWII) weapons on the walls. You can obtain a few of them in the mystery box, like the MP40 or STG44. I also like the progression system added, such as leveling weapons and your overall rank for the different campaigns, such as: Campaign, Multiplayer and Zombies. Weapon camos unlocked in the multiplayer black market can be used on the weapons in Zombies, so that's actually pretty cool. The perks being sodas, and having the machines all over the maps are a neat idea.

Zombie Chronicles just made this game 10x better.

[b]Cons:[/b]
- The ""Animal Test Laboratory"" doorway in Der Riese causes you to get stuck sometimes on the little concrete floor outside the door. You either have to jump or strafe around it as you can't run over it. Causes you to get stuck sometimes if you're not lucky, and could potentially be a bad thing when kiting zombies.

[b]Update that I've recently had to add, since I just now figured it out[/b]

When playing on Tuesday during the steam weekly maintenance it will kick you from the game you're playing when it DCs you. Steam forces you ""offline"" during this and will boot you from the CoD services and boot you to the main menu.

Only reason I mentioned this is because, I was doing so well to set-up a high round Der Riese run when it happened. I was so pumped till it booted me. Ugh. XD",1497588355,1592452554,True,2,0,0.504727602005004883,0,True,False,False,76561198063562131,489,17,15167,0,1403,1600039317

Sure there is still boosters/jetpacks and things like that, but this multiplayer is straight forward and quite balanced. Zombies is even better, I would even say close to the best iteration of it in COD. Right off the bat, with ZC you will get 8 maps, one new map that is the default, but also 7 maps from previous zombies, including Kino Der Toten, Ascension, Nacht der Untoten, etc. Plenty of great maps and modding support is present in this game.

Krueger clearly explains that Corvus was a programming bug in the DNI and turned sentient or something and dr. Salim's did what he did to the test subjects, because he was being threatened.

Which brings me to the next point... What the hell is up with DNI? Everybody knows this corvus bug is inside the DNI, which causes 100% probability of death, but still Taylor insists I get the DNI in my brain. Why?? Just because i should have been dead from the robots in the first mission anyway? Hendricks even lays besides me volunteering to get this chip in his head for no reason at all... Hello?? it causes you to die!

But what makes least sense of all, is how at the end, it turned out I was Taylor all along - but didnt realize, because DNI already hacked my brain. Seriously? What are you on about?

Dont buy unless you just wanna play zombies. Multiplayer is dead and Activision site shows PC servers are perfectly fine...

55,70651944,english,"Call of Duty: Acid Trip is a game truly unlike any other. Some games have ""WTF"" moments, where you're not sure why something happened or why the story took the turn it did. Black Ops 3 goes above and beyond. It is a ""WTF"" game, in which you will spend as much time shooting things as you will trying to figure out what the hell is going on. You're on acid. The game world is on acid and so is your character, and between all of this, you'll manage to get your shit together just enough for your FPS gamer instincts to kick in and shoot your way through the hostiles on each level. But it's a challenge. I spent more time frowning while playing the campaign than showing any other expression as my lore-obsessed mind struggled to put together the pieces of how we got from Black Ops 2 (which canonically precedes this) to this chaotic ball of madness.

You start by being thrown into what seems to be a war-torn Earth. The world's population has gone down. Way down. This much is evident from the scenes of carnage and debris all over the place. World War 3 came and went at some point. How else could the environment be explained? There's probably a back story here somewhere, but it's no easier to find than the sanity of the characters, which, due to events in the game that I won't spoil, steadily declines, and your character is no exception.

Yes, there is a story here, and you technically can follow along. That's not the hard part. The hard part is grasping why the hell any of this is happening in the first place. It makes you wonder what kind of drugs the story writers were on. Potent stuff, to be sure. It's a total fever dream every step of the way. Normally, the sheer number of non-sequiturs in a story would automatically mark it as bad, but Black Ops 3 manages to avoid this by dragging you along on a massively immersive experience where you and your character can't tell what's real and what's just going on inside someone's head. In the end, it doesn't really matter. The levels are varied and interesting, and you'll need to use a variety of tactics to make it through in one piece. Hell, there are even boss fights.

From a gameplay standpoint, there isn't much to complain about, leaving your mind to focus on trying to understand the big picture. Perhaps ""trying"" is too generous. Struggling perhaps, flopping around like a fish out of water as you explore a world where nothing seems to be happening for any logical reason, and rational thought has been replaced with raw instinct and crippling mental insanity trying to work together inside each character's head, including that of the main villain. This meshes pretty well with what you'll be going through as a player, so somehow it all works out, adding to the immersion of the game.

In conclusion, I highly recommend playing this game. There's nothing else quite like it, and the closest thing I can compare it to is if an ordinary first-person shooter and the movie Inception had a baby, and you have been thrust into that baby's head while it does acid, overdoses on nitrous oxide, and probably does half a dozen other drugs that I haven't even heard of. Play it. Enjoy it. Constantly ask yourself what the writers were thinking as the story devolves into a psychotic episode, then shrug as you realize that at the end of the day, what really matters is a good shooting experience. And Black Ops 3 delivers.",1591919665,1591919665,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198071530426,102,1,1915,0,1231,1592022891

85,70614780,english,"Zombies 10/10 - One of the greatest zombies experiences out there. Not only does this game have some of the best base DLC maps ever seen in zombies (Gorod, Shadows, and DE), which are already amazing, but the game went the extra mile to add in ZC. Now that the greatest maps of WaW, Black Ops, and Origins are remastered in their best virions yet. The game goes a step further and adds in modding? Without a doubt, this makes the buy worth every penny. That's if you play only for zombies

Multiplayer 6/10 - I'm not a multiplayer guy, the loot boxes and lack of interesting maps have made this mode even more off-putting for me. I don't care to unlock skins unless it's for zombies, but even then the jet boost feels off and not right for this game style. It's more of a gimic than the other CoD Exo suits, but I still feel games like Titanfall did it way better. Don't buy this game for the multiplayer, just go buy MW2019 on Battlenet if that's what you're looking for.

Campaign ?/10 - To be fair, I haven't played the mode mainly because I've heard its not worth even trying to get through it. Somehow it connects to the zombie's mode by having group 935 logos and zombies in a nightmare mode, but it never got my interest to play unlike Black Ops 2 which has an amazing campaign and Black Ops 1 or even WaW. I'd say don't play it, but hey I can't rate it if I didn't play it. 

I did move from Xbox to PC recently to use the mods in zombies and I have to say I had around 400 hours on there while also finishing many of the major easter eggs, Now I just play the game for modded maps and creating them as well.

I also have done multiplayer on the PS4, and let me say this, fuck the DLC guns. The dlc guns are direct upgrades to the stock weapons and give whomever uses them an insane advantage. However, if you find a lobbly where someone doesnt have a bugged class or too many dlc guns, its a pretty well rounded multiplayer. But If you like golding guns like me (I got demascus camo from golding all guns on MW) this game might not be for you. Golding takes a long time to get done and requires 100+ headshots before you can start the challenge camos like 5 kills in a life.

99,70508492,english,"This game is truly one of a kind. Im only going to cover the zombies part of the game today as thats pretty much all people play this game for anyway. Let me start off by saying if you havent bought this game yet do it right now because this has to be my most played and one of my most favorite games of all time. I have sunk thousands of hours into the game on multiple platforms and will likely put hundreds more. yes im vaced on this account so how about you get down and suck my balls. Anyway where do i even begin, If you were looking for a non traditional fast paced high intensity zombies experience well my good gamer you just found it. The game sadly only offers one map on the base game without dlc but my god has this map got to be one of the goats. Shadows of evil is an amazing map that offers many new game play mechanics and story. Now before I go and trash this game let me get out of the way whats so good about BO3. The perk system, double pack, easter eggs, map selection, multiplayer, leveling system, gobble gums, weapon levels, and nostalgia. This game hits all those points near perfect. Well if youve read any of my reviews before then you know I hate all games that exist and this one is not an exception. Here we go, Pre patch gorod krovi ee was by far the worst thing to ever exist next to bad rats I played this ee and completed it 5 f-ing time yes 5 f-ing and yes every time at the same point in the cut scene it would crash. Not only did this bug go un fixed for 1 year but 2 whole f-ing years this dumb cock sucking company decided that they would be better off working on the absolutely cat shit in a litter box we call bo4 then fix a crash on bo3. I went to hell and back trying to complete this ee and i was damn close to quitting the game all together over it. Next the crashes and oh boy does this game crash harder then pubg after fortshit came out and cummed in everyones mouth. The absolute worst crash I had on this game was while i was playing origins. I was on round 76 I completed the ee solo got all staffs setup my ice staff camp spot and was just settling into my strat to get round 100. and then the game said yea nope nibba hahah YEEET. I crashed.....I waited for a couple of seconds as i stared blankly into the dark abyss that is the crash screen seeing my reflection knowing what the f uck just happened...oh yea then i grabbed my keyboard slammed it on my desk about 10 times and just after it was done shattering into a million pieces i picked it up and threw it outside. I was done and just like tense would say now me throw the match, fack you. Lastly perkaholic thief. Dude the fact i never broke anything over this guy boggles my mind. Back story perkaholic thief is an invisible zombie that has an extreme amount of health that can be killed with traps and nothing else. I was on round 86 of der eisendrache when all of the sudden blam invis re tard comes out of nowhere and steals all my perks. i was stunned at what just happened i got up quickly used the teleporter on the map and killed him but heres the thing i had no perks, and it was panzer round, so now im running around the map with a panzer on my ass no bow cuz it was my mule kick gun and barely fighting for my life all over an invis zombie. you see how fast that shit went down hill like 3 seconds of him being in the game just ended my 6 hours if game play. well sure enough i died cuz i had no ammo and no guns and at the end of the i whipped my mouse at my window and im amazed it didnt break. all in all bo3 is a masterpiece a work of art and should be used as a stepping stone for a better future of zombies. I hope trearch can fix what they did in bo4 in the next game because that shit was like fnaf meets bad rats meets gentai police. also f uck plants vs zombies bro i payed 99 cents for the f ucking game and it wont even run on my computer anymore i turned off 2 settings 2 settings and now the sh it wont run wtf am i doing that this sh it happens to me man how can i be this unlucky f uck you pop cap games take my 99 cents that you scammed me out of and shove it down your fu cking d icks cuz im DONE WIT DIS SHI T!!!!",1591653042,1591653042,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198145273576,104,10,599,0,599,1518729264

89,70267653,english,"Alright, so I played this game on both Console and PC. Personally a PC player myself, but going to Console to play was a bit better in terms of playerbase and matches. So, to start, the campaign wasn't awful, but it certainly wasn't good either. You could REALLY tell that it was not crafted to be a good experience, and was not made to be a ""play it over again to relive"" type of campaign, like other CoD's have been in the past. Moving to multiplayer, since Campaign just makes me cringe talking about it, was really solid at launch. Most of the weapons were decently balanced, maps were pretty good and fit the advanced movement of the game, but I personally don't like the specialist system too much. Maps were crafted to fit both the advanced movement AND Botg gameplay, which is fantastic. After the DLC weapons released, balance started to decline due to DLC weapons being absolutely overpowered compared to the Stock weapons, and I guess this was a move on both Treyarch's and Activision's part. It has gotten better balance-wise, but it's still pretty bad. Supply drop system was and still is a cash grab system. Yeah, spend some of your in game currency to roll loot boxes, and HOPE to get something really good, or just spend money on them because getting Cryptokeys is a bit slow. Constantly rolling duplicates plagues this system, at least WW2 got it right in that department. Sort of. I did really like how they would add a new gamemode for people to try out, and it would eventually stick, thank you devs. Now, onto the Zombies. Most of this will be personal opinions and gripes, which are not representative of what others think of it. I also want to point out that I have only played SOE, DE, and all of the Zombies Chronicles maps. I also want to point out, that I don't use Gums due to the fact that I'm more adapt to the original experience, if you catch my drift. SOE, I felt like it was really ""veteran zombie player"" heavy, with emphasis on completing the EE and going for high rounds, and the layout was very weird to get used to. The characters didn't really have any, well, character to them. They felt bland. Dumb boss rounds and very annoying dog-type rounds with the flying bugs was a turn off for me personally. Since I haven't really played much of DE, I want to personally say that the layout is okay, and I liked the return of the ""original"" crew. Zombie Chronicles, is the most I have ever played zombies. Reliving these maps in a better engine is just fantastic. A few gripes though. I really did wish they added some of the classic weapons onto those maps, since the BO3 ones after playing through all of the DLC was just ""Yay, another weapon that I have already used for the number'th time"". Playing Nacht again on a better looking engine was just a dream come true. I will say, Gums makes this map wayyyy easier than it truly is. The double PaP system is very handy, but I feel like some of them are just gimmicks to make it seem like they are doping something, and some make the game downright easy, Turned and Dead Wire for example. Now, the meat and potatoes, the mod support. THANK YOU TREYARCH FOR FINALLY BRINGING THIS BACK! This has been an absolute godsend, and is probably the only reason I got this game on PC in the first place! Custom maps, custom player models, you name it, they probably have it. With all of the mods that are on the workshop, you will NEVER get bored, especially Zombies players. But yeah, that's my review, I have the comments open if you guys want to drop your own opinions on my review, or if you have something that I missed.

My only compliant is that you can't use any of the leveled gobble gum and not all the maps allow for unlimited perks. Overall I won't say it's any better or worse than World at War Custom Zombie Maps except for that unlike World at War it isn't plagued by multiplayer issues like being unable to join while on the same internet. The base game is okay but this game has the worst campaign out of all the COD's. It's still pretty expensive though and the cheapest I have seen it is $30.

Played a single match of multiplayer, top fragged with default loadout and still despised it as A) It's too unfamiliar with all the movement craziness for a COD boomer like me. B) Unsatisfying guns. The future setting doesn't lend itself to raw, and powerful mechanical feeling guns like a Deagle or AK from COD4. Most guns end up feeling like rapid fire pea shooters. Campaign's first mission is hot garbage and had to end it there but I guess it is something. 

The gold is the nostalgia that zombies brings to the table for people that grew up on it and the great community mods and maps that are available to play for free. There are some seriously talented mappers with some rivalling Treyarch's quality. As a result I will cautiously recommend for this reason alone when on sale only.

Considering I've played when the game was out in 2015, 
It was one of the first I ever got into from the beginning. 
Multiplayer was fascinating using the equivalent to exo suits to jump, and wallrun.
Interesting concepts that felt appealing and sped up the game pace.
The Zombie story line continues into towards its finale of the Aether Saga, with new perks and wonder weapons. 

I genuinely enjoyed the remastered maps for the DLC.

However, in current year, 2020, the lobbies are barren and dead, it takes a hot minute to find a match,
in addition, if you liked any other mode, too bad.
No one else is playing anything other than team deathmatch.

Zombies on the other hand holds up somewhat, people only playing Origins, Kino, and Der Eisendreche.

The game from my perspective was underrated, I think its a solid 8.5/10 experience and worth.
However, due to time passing, it's more of like a 3/10 for prominent hackers, bad connectivity, and overall dead lobbies.

I will solely recommend this game to friends so I can simply have fun with a big lobby like we used to.
If we had more people in here, the game is worth.

Just a heads up, never pay full price, wait until its as low as $45 ish during a sale for the whole game, and all its DLC.",1591137649,1591137649,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198850446842,33,1,12642,929,1610,1602037274

I played the multiplayer more on console, so I don't really have any nostalgia for the campaign, and I started playing it on PC and I have to say, it isn't really that great. The multiplayer on PC as I speak is having an odd issue with filling up a lobby with players, the commencing a load for the match/map, but after the bar at the bottom of the screen fills up all the way, people sit in the lobby for a bit longer, and then it boots you to the main menu. Not sure what's going on there, but that's where the multiplayer stands for now.

His name is Richtofen, he's a crazy Nazi scientist


Hear him in my head, people think I need a therapist
Place is new but situation is the same
When zombies blow up I get hungry and insane

Gotta stay focused, let's make a plan
Unlock the door for the drunken man
Party it up, Leroy's boozin' all day
When he's nice and drunk he'll clear the barricade

Did someone say drunk 'cause I wanna play
I'll win 'cause I been wasted since yesterday!
Crack the mystery box, can't believe what I seen
The Paralyzer's got me higher than I ever been

Getting us into the armory
Leroy's larger than life like a VIP
Once I don't have any ammo at all
Use the magic chalk to draw weapons on the walls

We're BURIED! Deep underground
BURIED! In a western town
BURIED! Run if you hear the sound of the crazy b*tch who flyin' around

We're BURIED! We gotta follow the plan
BURIED! Of the German man
BURIED! He only cares about our worth using us like puppets to control the Earth

Throw a house party let the music sound
'Cause there 'ain't no clubs this deep underground
The crazy flyin' b*tch tried to shut us down
So I roofied the ho, her a** I started to pound

Misty should do this, don't it count as housework?
Much rather spend my time out lookin' for perks
Richtofen's helping me on my quest...

You must be my pawn that's my final request!
Do not help Maxis whatever you do
You must power the tower, I will talk you through
Build the guillotine found next to the saloon
Then power up the orbs, they look like balloons
Acquire the purple lantern, decipher the code
Use the power of the wisps to make the guillotine flow
Hit the switch in the future and the switches in the maze
Then make a magic wish and prepare to be amazed!

Tramplesteam's a bore, I've seen it before
But this Head Chopper's fresh and I just can't ignore
Like a lumberjack turnin' limbs into stumps
But if the zombies get passed, run like Forrest Gump!

Completely overwhelmed, fall back to the Jug
This alley's so tight we're nice and snug
Crack a Timebomb, go back to Round 2
There's so many f***ing zombies, nothing else we can do...

We're BURIED! Deep underground
BURIED! In a western town
BURIED! Run if you hear the sound of the crazy b*tch who flyin' around

We're BURIED! We gotta follow the plan
BURIED! Of the German man
BURIED! He only cares about our worth using us like puppets to control the Earth

Buried, we're buried, so buried, deep underground
Buried, we're buried, so buried, zombies all around

LEROY! (Drum Solo)

We're BURIED! Deep underground
BURIED! In a western town
BURIED! Run if you hear the sound of the crazy b*tch who flyin' around

We're BURIED! We gotta follow the plan

I think it has nine maps in total, not counting the return of Dead Ops Arcade. My only complaint is that it doesn‚Äôt include more Black Ops 2 maps. That being said, incredible custom map makers have at least partially recreated most of the classic maps left out of Chronicles and created countless more original maps of impressive quality. Additionally, the introduction of gobble gums adds interesting gameplay mechanics, a surprising amount of replay-ability and a host of new strategies.

Hello guys. I got this game at a discount as well as zombies cronicles. Lets be real, anything but zombies in this game is trash. Zombies is the only mode that i can recommend. Campain is meh. Multiplayer community is toxic. 

So lets get to it. Zombies cronicles bring back classic zombies maps slightly reworked with new guns, perks, powerups and gobblegums. some maps are very tricky for new players . But there are more than enough tutorials and strat guides online. If you are bored there is a ton of community made mods and maps for free of course. In general zombies players will help and carry your ass (happened to me plenty of times) to get easter eggs. However you better play with friends because the lag is huge . Unfortunatelly i cant get many easter eggs on solo because they are for 4 people.

Overall good game if u want to play classic or new zombies maps.However definitellly NOT worth this price tag. Try to get it on discount if possible.

Last thing you will notice the global achievements are ridiculously easy. you can get a 0.8% achievement  in like 2 tries on a solo run.",1590851438,1590851438,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198097707554,71,4,5144,0,2570,1597680795

Overall if you're a Zombies fan this has the most for you.

19,70028313,english,"One of the main reasons why I purchased this game is to play custom zombies. Once that was announced I was totally sold. I played a ton of World at War custom zombies and I love the better graphics and the simplicity of creating and uploading to the steam workshop. That aside, I own this game on xbox with all of the dlc besides zombie chronicles and I really want to purchase the zombies maps and zombie chronicles on pc. I know the mulitplayer mode of this game is not as big as it used to be so that is why I do not want to purchase the entire dlc packs but the maps individually. I played this game on xbox and the multiplayer is amazing and same on pc but there are more hackers now a days (downside of pc) which sucks but it is whatever. I beat the campaign on xbox as well which was fun but not the primary reason I would ever play this game. I am a firm believer that black ops 2 is better than this game in multiplayer but now with custom zombies makes this game equal to black ops 2 zombies. I really want to play mob of the dead, buried. and nuketown zombies on black ops 3 and I will be satisfied. Though that is unlikely they will make it for zombies (but maybe workshop could have it soon). Overall great game but would not recommend to buy on pc unless you are a huge zombies fan or you have a bunch of friends to enjoy multiplayer and zombies with (hackers on public games suck).",1590818529,1590818529,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,76561198131251944,95,5,14412,0,5673,1599181005

As for the Campaign, man what a weird disappointment. Starts off pretty well, but the story makes no sense. It's trying to be something metaphysical, almost like it wants to be a Deus Ex game or something. CoD Campaigns are reliably stupid and this one can't even get that right! In the first third there are these moments of tension but by the end, there's so much technobabble and unexplained story beats that it's tough to know what's going on.

Reading about the ending on forums and stuff is interesting, there's bones of something really cool but the execution is lacking. Environments get pretty repetitive.

Okay, so originally this review was negative for its various gamebreaking bugs and pay to win gameplay. but as time progressed I say its unfair to negatively rate a game that I hold dearly all because of 1 gamemode: Zombies.

Seriously if you want to have a fun time with call of duty zombies, BO3 is your go to game (only if you have a beefy computer, if not, go play WAW), as the DLC maps are really fun, especially Zombies chronicles.

yes there are still a few gamebreaking bugs and theres a few hackers that are easily avoidable, but behind that, this game IS fun and easily replayable. Its also a plus that theres modtools allowing everyone to download maps from the workshop. even though 90% of the maps are test maps, clickbaity maps, and straight up garbage, there are plenty of diamonds in the sulfur mine.

So after 3 years later do I suggest buying BO3? Yes for zombies, Eh for campaign (only played once) and maybe if you are a multiplayer fan who likes online slot machines.",1478920984,1590539640,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,1,True,False,False,76561198088140004,68,15,25933,158,13045,1602027595

28,69821204,english,"BO3 is a god tier Zombies experience. With Chronicles, as well as the steam workshop/custom map support, you can play almost every previous map from previous Zombies games (World at War, Black ops 1, and Black ops 2) all in one title, along with the new maps that debuted in Black ops 3. The modding community has yet to waver, even after mod tools being out for almost 4 years. With support for mods as well as maps, you can relive experiences such as Town and Kino Der Toten, while even using weapons accurate to the titles these maps appeared on, instead of the vanilla BO3 weapon selection. 

Multiplayer and Campaign are hardly worth talking about. As with many CoD games, the multiplayer is usually dead after about a year of release. The Campaign mode is hardly playable as well, due to the uninteresting story that fails to capture the player and entice them to complete the story. 

If you like Zombies, this game is a must-have for your Steam library. I have this game on Playstation 4, and have over 20 days played in Zombies alone. I recently picked it up on Steam because it was 50% off and I wanted to play custom Zombies, and over the past few weeks, I have found it difficult to walk away from the game for more than a few hours, unless it's to sleep or eat food.

If you are thinking of buying this game, do it only for the Zombies mode. That being said, you're going to need the ""Zombies Deluxe"" edition if you want the entire experience, or at the very least, the ""Zombies Chronicles"" edition. I recommend waiting for this game to go on sale again if you are interested, unless you have $100 to blow.",1590473414,1590473414,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561199057986828,1,1,11486,187,2916,1601339565

I'll keep campaign and multiplayer short since few people buy this game for those gamemodes anymore.

Campaign:

Arguably the worst in COD history. To give you a perspective: 9% of the people who ever played camoaign, actually finished it. The story is weird and doesn't make sense overall. If you liked BO2 or BO1 you are going to be very disappointed since there are zero similarites between those two games and BO3.

2/10

Multiplayer:

Actually ok. Yes i know it has exo movement and all, but they really found a good combination with the concept of old COD and new COD. The weapons and maps are well constructed and the specialists are actually a fun addition to the game,  The real problem is that the playerbase is largely dead or dying. The concept of black market weapons is a scummy Activision business model, but the weapons are not that overpowered. Whoever made those cringy victory dances deserves a few years in the gulag though.

6.5/10

Zombies:

Now this is where the fun begins. 

First let's talk about features that singles out BO3 from previous Treyarch zombies games.

The movement system has improved from BO2. The sliding is actually pretty helpful when you want to get around a large map. Double pack a punch has been named overpowered, but has made high rounds much more accessible to casual players. The gobblegum system is also fun and extremely helpful. Some gobblegums are definetely overpowered, but are useful for the BO3 easter eggs who have been increased in difficulty. Yes the complexity has been increased. Especially compared to BO1 maps. The specialist weapons also make going for high rounds a lot more fun

Now come my recommendation for map packs

Shadows of Evil:

Yes this map has a high learning curve. Getting to pack a punch and unlocking the specialist weapon may seem like the Da Vinci Code for new players, but is done without a whim by those who know the map. The story behind the map and the playable characters is very unique and interesting. The wonder weapon is very effective and easy to build. Going for high rounds is pretty challenging since the streets of the map are narrow and hard to train zombies on. The easter egg is ok just not that special. It also requires 4 players which is ridiculous

The Giant:

Very fun and simplistic. Getting to pack-a-punch, the power and the wonder weapon is easy. You can get setup on round 7 and even earlier if you use mega gobblegums. Going up until round 40 is fun because of the camping spot called ""the catwalk''. After round 40 your weapons (except double pack a punch) are useless and you have to hoard zombies. 

Der Eisendrache:

PERFECTION. I would say that this map is appealing to every type of zombies players. Turning on the power and going for the pack-a-punch is easy. The buyable doors on the map are not expensive which can set you up very quick. The wonder weapon bows are PERFECT. It makes the map unique and very replayable. Going for high rounds is both possible for people who like to camp with their wonder weapon and people who like to train zombies. The specialist weapon is easy to unlock and the easter egg is fun and made challenging with a boss fight at the end. 10/10 would buy

Zetsubou No Shima:

Scroll further if you are a casual player. This map requires you to build a ton of buildables which can take 1 hour for beginners. And when i say ''required'' i mean that. If you want to go for round 100 you are basically obligated to go for the easter egg(easter egg is not hard though). This is because the only training and camping room is the easter egg boss room. This map punishes casual players but rewards those who are willing to invest a lot of time in a zombies game

Gorod Krovi:

Very simple and fun to get setup on this map, but an absolute challenge to go for high rounds. The wonder weapon is useless after round 40 and there is no good zombies hoarding area except for that annoying bunker.  It is fun and not too hard to go for the buildables and pack a punch on this map. The easter egg is hard but a good and healthy challenge. And PPSH.

Revelations:

If you don't mind a huge recycling bin of a map where 90% of the content has appeared on earlier maps, then this is your map. Very easy to get setup, very easy to get the wonder weapons, and very easy to go for high rounds. I think that another map appealing to casual players was needed though. 

Chronicles:

Basically a huge remasteer of old mas. It contains maps from various degrees of size and complexity from earlier COD games. It is once again filled with nostalgia and very fun to revisit solo or with friends. I definetely recommend buying this. 

10/10

Overall zombies (why you probably are here) is filled with 14 of COD zombies finest maps. The price is high i agree with that, but the content that you are getting is SO GOOD.

Sorry for the long post

TL;DR

Campaign: trash
Multiplayer: ok
Zombies: nice

20,69632299,english,"Black Ops 3 is probably one of my most played games of all time. There's a solid chance I had over a 1000+ hours on Xbox One. While many didn't see it back then, I do truly think this is a worthy follow-up to Black Ops 2(other than Campaign but I don't really care much about that part). The multiplayer was a lot of fun when it was still really active, though they got a bit greedy with all the micro-transactions. Some of the DLC weapons were abit much, but not impossible to counter. Dark Matter was also a really fun thing to try and achieve, and there's plenty of weapons to master and challenges to beat here. The side modes in this game are fun, I didn't care for Nightmares though. Dead Ops Arcade 2 is a great follow-up to the first one from Black Ops, and Free Run was a fun distraction. 

Then there's Zombies. While there were some balancing issues, like how double Pack-a-Punching in tandem with certain Gobblegum made it ridiculously easy to get to really high rounds, I personally think Black Ops 3 Zombies is better than Black Ops 2 Zombies. All the maps in this game are great in their own ways, then once Chronicles came out that just made it even better. Some of the remastered maps still don't have the Pack-A-Punch machine which is unfortunate, but atleast that gives those maps some challenge. But now that you can get Chronicles and the base game for the normal retail price, it makes the game even more worth it. All that and I still haven't mentioned the Custom Maps. Easy to install through Workshop, and there are some really good maps in here. Not all of them are great, but that's what you get with fan-made content. This game is definitely still worth buying in 2020, in my eyes this was the last great Call of Duty game, up to this point. I recommend it to any fans of Call of Duty, or shooters in general. Its more than worth re-buying on PC if you had it previously on Xbox or PlayStation.",1590189045,1590189045,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561199006103920,193,5,2636,0,1751,1594025940

94,69570112,english,"Having played this game for countless hours on PS4, Xbox One, and PC I can safely say that for the past 5 years this game has brought me plenty of enjoyment. While the campaign lacked on many fronts the multiplayer was astounding. Back when I first heard about the advanced movement system I thought it was going to make the game not as good like in Sledghammer games's 2014 release Advanced Warfare, but I was corrected by the polished movement system and underwater warfare. none of the guns felt underwhelming in multiplayer and I felt as if the specialists fit nicely in the mix. The microtransactions and DLC weapons where you had to gamble with the cryptokeys until you finally got 1 of the way too many guns that were hidden in these boxes made the game slightly unfair in favor of those with money to spend on the game. The Zombies mode in the game was also very unique and enjoyable. The original map that came with the game took some getting used to, but now that I have learned some of the fasted ways to set up and understand the map more it easily slides right into my top 5 maybe even top 3 maps of all time. The experience was a blast and I still find myself playing not only the maps made by Treyarch, but also the ones made by the community. The game had an amazing easter egg storyline and even with the negative feedback for the revelations ending, I felt that it was nice to see what our previous actions led to with the restarting of the cycle. The guns on zombies feel a bit too equal making guns like the raygun feel like all the rest really taking away from the special feeling of having one of the wonder weapon. The community part of the game on PC is outstanding, with all the new creators and veteran creators the maps on here with the mod tool client are coming out amazing and some even feel like genuine Treyarch experiences. Once again the Liquid Divinium paywall blocking you from a major part of the game, the mega gobblegums, was a huge kick in the rear. While your friend pops perkaholic every game making him god tier on round 1 you're sat alone with 1 or no perkaholics just trying to grind for the diviniums because you don't have money to just toss at a game. The ""Bonus"" games were amusing fun and can occasionally be fun. The ""Free-Run"" addition was a good idea since it helped people learn how to use and improve with the movement system. ""Nightmare"" was cool, but like the campaign it lacked some so I never played it through. And finally comes the return of ""Dead Ops Arcade"" with its sequel ""Dead Ops Arcade 2"" which kept the original game's glory while adding some interesting features which either didn't matter enough to require attention or made the mode just a bit better. All in all I would give the Campaign(s) a solid 1/5, Multiplayer a 3.7/5, and the Zombies a 3.9/5.",1590101313,1590101313,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561197968686735,105,9,27372,41,25183,1601334635

25,69530852,english,"I don't want to be one of those people who absolutely loves the game and still doesn't recommend it but unfortunately the constant stuttering in this game forces me to. I absolutely love this game to death, i have around 35 days on xbox (probably about 90% of that time is in zombies) and i loved every moment of that time. Seeing this game go on sale i instantly jumped at the opportunity to own and play everything again and now with the addition of custom zombies which is something i wanted to play so badly when i was on console and didn't have access to it. I booted up the game and tried to play DE when i was met with a barrage of both general stuttering and micro stuttering, constantly. The micro stuttering happens so often to the point where it becomes infuriating to play the game and hurts my eyes from the constant dips in framerate. Before you ask, yes, my computer far and away meets the recommended specs for this game and yet i was still suffering from this issue which limited my experience to one that made me wish i was blind and seeing the game as some sort of hallucination in my blank empty eyes. If the game doesn't stutter, it's a masterpiece. Zombies in this game is the best (Call Of Duty) zombies experience to date with some of my personal favourite maps (SOE, DE, GK) and on top of that includes so many beautifully done remastered maps in chronicles, and to make this even better, custom zombies offers unlimited replayability, with mappers still making amazing experiences to this day that rival the quality that treyarch themselves put out. Overall, this game is great. Is it worth $90 (aud) for the base game + chronicles and $140 for the whole experience at full price? No, not 5 years after launch. Should you buy the game if its on a heavy sale? Absolutely. The game is golden, however, if you get constant irritating general stuttering and micro stuttering like me and try everything to fix it to no avail, i would suggest you refund the game just like i did.",1590050985,1590050985,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198312942353,92,2,92,0,92,1589781519

The only saving grace this game could have is a decent zombies mode and they even failed to deliver on that. You get a whopping 1 map to play! Shadows of Evil.... quite possibly the most drab uninspired zombies map to date. So your probably wondering why I even play this game or so should you?. Wait until it becomes available on sale to buy it. it comes with ""Zombie Chronicles"" (All of the Black ops 1 and World at War Maps) this makes zombies bearable with a variety of old throwback maps that you can throw yourself into (Or even with friends). And that brings me to my last point, If you plan on buying this game purely for the zombies, custom maps is the way to go It brings so much to the table that I even considered giving this dreadful game a thumbs up.

65,69370570,english,"Call of duty black ops 3 is split into 3 main parts which are Campaign, Multiplayer and Zombies. Starting with campaign it is awful. First the campaign does not have any thing to do with the 2 previous black ops games. It makes no sense and the missions are a huge let down of what they could be. Multiplayer is decent. Multiplayer in BO3 gives you an element of fun with the wall running and jump boosts. In my opinion the futuristic style of multiplayer is not that bad since it is well balanced compared to Advanced warfare and Infinite warfare. However, a lot of the DLC weapons are the top guns in the game which would be fine if you could actually earn them. But. you cant it is very rare you can get a contract to open a case for a DLC weapon and the only other way to get the weapons with a high chance is paying a lot of money towards boxes. It would be better if the cases were kept to cosmetic only so everyone could earn the guns they want. But overall the multiplayer is a fun thing to play every now and again. Where do i start with zombies. Zombies is Amazing. In zombies you can have the original BO3 maps like Shadows of evil which are great maps. Then you have the option to buy the Zombies chronicles map pack which gives you Shi no Numa, Origins, Nacht der Untoten, Shangri-la, Moon, Ascension, Kino der Toten and Verruckt. All of these maps create the best zombies expierence to date. All of these maps give you such variety to make the best Black ops zombie game. Lastly, custom zombies. What an amazing thing to add it gives you even more of a choice of fun maps to play with your friends as well as mod packs for weapons which can give that element of fun when playing zombies. So overall you should buy this game just for the zombies in my opinion this is the best call of duty game to play zombies, Not only that the multiplayer is not awful but can do with some work so its a thumbs up from me.",1589815118,1589815118,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,76561199002860492,27,3,11272,0,1013,1599246639

The price of this game is ridiculous as without the sale the game is 60 dollars!!! The only good side to this though is that zombies chronicles DLC is included however you must purchase the other maps DLC to access them. The DLC prices for the game are also crazy as I question what activision was smoking when there DLC prices never lowered after 5 years it costs more that 30 dollars for the zombies DLC plus another 15 if your game didnt already include the zombies chronicles. There are other DLCs but I dont feel they are worth it as it can make the multiplayer almost seem pay to win. However other than the fact that the game is overpriced this game is actually really good. Zombies has there old maps like nacht and kino while adding refreshing spins on them that make them look amazing.

Before anyone mentions, yes my PC meets the specs.

Finally got this game to run after the 3rd ""clean restart"".  I still have no idea what the route cause is and I don't have the patience to eliminate things to find out right now.  I love this game and for 80%+ off the original price I may have minded less all the digging through the internet to figure this out.

Pros-
---nuketown 
---very fluid movement , jumping and boosting feels so natural and adds so much more speed and skill to the game (in tdm most cods have 75 be the goal but in bo3 it's 100 because the everything moves faster, thanks to the jetpack)
---a great connection and high fps rate usually 
---there are 6 modes to play: campaign, multiplayer, zombies, freerun (short 'how to use the jetpack' tutorial stages) , nightmare, and dead ops arcade
---a variety of camos and outfits for you to personalize your gun and character. (camos earned one mode can be worn on another, applicable to campaign, multiplayer, and zombies)
---the zombies mode is amazingly well done and there are 14 unique cannon maps to play (if you buy all the dlc)
---mods are available and there are tons of them

Cons-
---the community 
---lots of modders in multiplayer 
---the campaign story is weird, but if you really look into it it makes sense... somewhat 
---a LOT of grinding is required to get all the achievements
---practically impossible to complete all the games challenges since they require you to win in different multiplayer game modes but everyone only plays tdm",1506236957,1589449185,True,4,0,0.51536935567855835,0,True,False,False,76561198118699782,111,11,70927,80,61560,1601702657

I have not spent too long on the campaign but have over 4 days on playtime on multiplayer and 2 days on zombies.

19,68870133,english,"(TLDR at end) BO3 is probably one of my favourites out of the series, not just for the zombies (which is what a good percentage of all players still play it for) but also just how smoothly the game plays and how good it looks. The mechanics (ie enhanced movement) are nice and easy to get used to, but not easy to master as well, which can often times scare other players off. 

The multiplayer is still fairly populated, and can be fun at times, but the enhanced movement can get annoying with players flying up and down while you try to shoot them. The microtransactions w/lootboxes are another greedy way to get money in my eyes, and I don't quite appreciate it. 

The zombies mode is the pinnacle of what the series has hoped to achieve, with a massive fanbase, tons of maps and a seemingly endless replayability factor, the entire mode is perfect. 

The campaign isn't the best, story-wise, as it is confusing, and kicks you in the head at the very end of it. The implementation of the advanced weaponry and battlefield view seems OP in my opinion.

Multiplayer: 7.5/10
Zombies: 9.5/10

The Zombies Chronicles Edition has very much bang for it's buck half off. I'd even go as far to say, get the Zombies Deluxe Edition. It will still be well worth it. I played this game a lot on Xbox, but kinda stopped because it got pretty tiring. Now on PC, there are endless things you can to with the mod support.

Now saying that, there is still a lot for people who like multiplayer, with many maps to pick from, lots of weapons to fight each other with, and to top it off the modding community for this game is fantastic so again if you like zombies, its going to be pretty hard to get bored of all the maps in the game.

The campaign is alright, good fun when adding mods, however not worth buying the game solely for the campaign.

13,30453599,english,"My personal favourite Call of Duty game, if you're buying it now do it for Campaign or Zombies.

The campaign, while extremely divisive and controversial, is in my book one of the most engaging and thrilling stories ever told in this series. It's not like Modern Warfare where there are explosions in your face 24/7 and ridiculously huge scale events going on all the time. This story is thought provoking, disturbing, gritty and actually has characters I give a shit about. While it has very little to do with the original Black Ops games, it's still a gem in a sea of forgettable campaigns this series has had (Looking at you COD WWII).

Zombies is likely what everyone is buying this game for now, and I can't blame them. BO3 has the best zombies the series has ever had, with a total of 14 maps to play on. You get 5 original maps with 9 remakes, and they are all a joy to play on. The original cast of Richtofen, Takeo, Dempsey, and especially Nikolai still make me laugh, and the maps will hold you forever. There's also custom zombies which is pretty hit or miss, but can bring you a lot of fun if you know where to look. Don't worry about population, you'll pretty much always find a game if you're in a dense area (NA East), if not, there are places to find players everywhere.

Multiplayer has passed its heyday, and to-date has one of the worst microtransaction systems I've ever seen in a multiplayer FPS. That still didn't prevent me from sinking serious hours into it. The map design is great, the weapons are creative, the specialists are all unique, it looks gorgeous, and there is so much stuff to unlock and have fun with. Sadly my favourite maps are all in the season pass, which you'll never get to play since no one plays them anymore. I feel privileged to have experienced the beauty of Spire, Knockout, and Empire. I'm so glad they got rid of the season pass in Modern Warfare, along with the supply drops, that plague this game. Weapons are locked behind supply drops, not just melee weapons, but genuine fan favourites like the M16, Galil, Famas and countless others. It's disgusting and taints this once beautiful mode. Don't bother playing multiplayer now, but it used to be something great.",1489257804,1588909113,True,1,0,0.48835340142250061,0,True,False,False,76561198043471187,512,40,6657,0,5505,1598817135

Both were great map with Shadows being a bit more complex than The Giant but great nonetheless. Its first DLC map was Der Eisendrache (The Iron Dragon) witch is a banger with zombies content creators having it be in they're top 5 favorite maps of all time (Honestly staffs where better than bows dont @ me). Second map 3arch made was Zetsubou No Shima (Island of Despair) and its the only map that bombed. Its entire set up process is mind-numbing boring (only good thing that ZNS did was adding the marshals and razorback). 3rd and my personal favorite map is Gorod Krovi (city of blood) WITCH HAS DRAGONS! Who in they're right mind doesn't like dragons? Also ray gun MK3 and THE GLORIOUS SOVIET HAND CRAFTED  PPSH-41 CHAMBERED IN STALIN APROVED 7.62x25mm. And last but not least Revelations and it was a collage of old maps. Quite disappointing for some, but i am nostalgic for it since i waited weeks to play it and i got sick so i had to stay at home and then i played the everloving crap out of this map. The easter egg was quite disappointing aswell but u can get a apothicon serpent from the box witch is good for people how didnt do the easter egg for Shadows of Evil (me). There is also a 5th dlc that i wont write here since im gonna make a seprate review on its store page called Zombies Chronicles and it is a must buy if u like the other Cod Zombies maps. Also BO3 has custom zombie maps that are really well made and free (personal recommendations are Rust, Dome, Terminal and Town since they work great with the UGX gun game mod).

Campaign: TL DR; Wasn't great not the worst though, inventive game play, but a mishmash feeling to it. Like a glorified tech demo.

The Long Version:
The Campaign isn't great, its playable and has multiplayer, which i'm assuming would be more fun, but my friends wont play it, so not available from my perspective. But from the levels I did play, both on console and PC, its playable, and can be enjoyable, just not my cup of tea. (For Context, I loved the AW campaign, It felt more *solid*)

Multiplayer: TL DR; Still fun, but not very populated. Play BO2 and find an unhacked lobby, its worth the wait.

Long Version
I've played every COD since BO2, while my personal favorite gameplay was AW, BO3 felt more refined, but the massive amount of micro-transaction BS they force into the menus makes it a very hard game to pickup, its overwhelming at best, and a complete turn-off at worst. As well, there is no way to transfer data if you played on PS4 or XBOX previously, having played on PS4 and putting *quite* a high amount of time in, I unlocked a solid 2% of the games cosmetics, It would've been nice to use them here, where the game is still playable with fresh content thanks to the modding community.

Zombies: TL DR; Not BO2, but beats BO4. (Didnt play BO1)
Long Version
Second favorite zombies experiences to date, movement is smooth, zombies are freaky, and the maps are phenomenal (Not Zetsubo, we dont talk about that map)
Continuing from where origins left off in the giant, and continuing the mob storyline with shadows of evil, (which does tie into the origins timeline after the EE) you get the one shadows experience with the game, and its the only map from BO3 that requires 4 players to complete the easter egg, so it does feel kind of weak. but all of the DLC, with the exception of DLC 2, are worth it. Even if the story did end kind of weakly. Its still a very satisfying gameplay, which can be done by yourself, or with friends. Its much better with friends.

TL DR; Its a bland game, that's kept alive by fond memories of playing it, as well as the mods that you can get from the workshop. But if this is your first, or at least your first on PC, skip it.",1588716885,1588716885,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198069962916,215,5,9038,0,4597,1600195737

7,32555908,english,"Wow, this is the best Call of Duty in the franchise, in my opinion.

Treyarch did an amazing job with both the Zombies and Multiplayer modes. People may argue that Activision adding in supply drops is a move to make money, but I'm perfectly fine with it. Activision is a company that does need funds to continue to create and publish these games, plus you can get supply drops by actually playing Multiplayer.

The DLC maps, for Zombies, in particular, were amazing in my opinion. Treyarch made five challenging, fun, and replayable maps for the community, and they swung it out of the park. You may call me a fanboy of this franchise or this game in particular and all I have to say back is, play the Zombies mode.

Shadows of Evil brings an interesting turn to the Zombies storyline by introducing our four main characters to creatures named the Keepers and the Apothicons.

Der Eisendrache brings us a hint and 'flashback' to a loved map, Origins. You go through four different challenges to upgrade four different bows similar to the four staffs in origins.

Zetsubou No Shima, even though it isn't a community favorite, brought a challenging but simple easter egg to add on to the Zombies storyline.

Gorod Krovi, another community favorite, reveals the secrets still left behind the now known Doctor Monty and brings back the memories of past characters in previous zombies maps.

Revelations, the ending. This map received a lot of criticism from the community like not having the stuff on the map, not having a longer cutscene, and many more reasons. But all criticism behind, it was an amazing ending to the greatest story ever created in a side game mode.

Treyarch recently released a new 'Zombies Chronicles' DLC and it just made this game even better. They've brought back and remastered the most loved eight maps and new incredible Gobble Gums into this already amazing game.",1497841723,1588661860,True,2,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False,76561198274774908,142,11,27394,0,16630,1588740500

I did NOT enjoy the Zombies, and greatly regret purchasing the Zombies Deluxe edition. The Gobblegum, floating skulls and ammo boxes, barricades you build back up for them to get torn back down in seconds, etc. isn't what I expected. I thought it would be a somewhat realistic zombie survival map but they just keep randomly spawning 2 feet from you, tearing the barricades down, and The Beast? WTH... Anyway it wasn't what I expected and despite being a huge horror movie and game fan I just found it... Well... Stupid. 

Regrettably I played 75 hours of Campaign before requesting a refund (ONLY for the DLC, not the base game) which will probably be instantly denied so don't make the same mistake I did, watch some YouTube play-throughs and see if this is really what you think it is before you plunk down the extra $40.",1588441684,1588441780,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198894724631,61,21,4655,0,4500,1599417353

41,20854321,english,"This review is mainly for the zombies as I'm not a huge multiplayer fan.

MULTIPLAYER

 That doesn't mean the multiplayer is bad however. It's fast, leaves a lot of ways to outplay your opponent all with that cood style gameplay we all know. Its movement system, albeit good, is kinda like titanfall's but not as cleanly added. 

ZOMBIES

This is probably the best zombies in the Treyarch lineup, although only by a little. This is coming from someone who has played every single zombies map (Most on an xbox 360) and loved all of them. Mechanically, The new features in the zombies is the sliding and gobblegums. The sliding, when mastered, is a great way to get around without stamin-up which is great as some of the maps are pretty big. Gobblegums are a mixed bag for me. Don't get me wrong, I love them. They make easter eggs and high rounds really easy, but thats also why they're a problem. Since you can pay for packs of gobblegums they become a sort of pay-to-win mechanic. Although, you're not really playing against other people and you don't have to use them. This still inflates the leader board though. Shadows of Evil is one of my favorite maps of all time, Great PAP quest, great weapons, great wonder weapon, great side easter eggs, and great main easter eggs. The theme and music is absolutly stunning. It is a bit hard for newer players but I'm sure they'll get around to it eventually. Der Eisendrache (or however you spell""The Iron Dragon"" in German) is looked upon as one of the greatest maps of all time and while I'm not quite as in love with it, I still love it. Great Wonder weapon and Wonder weapon quests, great layout and theme, great boss, and great easter egg. A perfect map for beginners. Zetsubo no shima is considered to be the worst of the bunch but it is by no means bad. Its got an interesting mechanic of watering plants every round with specific types of water to produce some really crazy results. Its wonder weapon is a little derivative but still good. Its easter egg is alright and even has a pretty cool boss fight. Although the best part of this map is its creepy, unsettling atmosphere. Gorod Krovi is another fan favorite. Its very reminicent of older maps as it brought back the ppsh and the PAP isn't that hard to get to. The easter egg is a kinda hard so watch out on that but overall the map is great. Revelations has gotten flak for just being a giant hodge podge of parts of other maps but that doesn't mean it isn't good. It brings back the SOE Wonder Weapon and the Thunder gun but unfortunately doesn't have any new ones. There is a lot to do, side easter eggs and such, which is good as I personally enjoy that stuff. The PAP quest was actually pretty cool and I enjoy doing it everytime. Overall a pretty good map. 

What really tops this game off is the mod tools that come with it. This allows people to make their own multiplayer, and more importanty, zombie maps that you can download off the workshop. The whole map creation is really confising personally but ill get it eventually. 


TL/DR 
The multiplayer is alright. The zombies is the best. Custom zombies exists, and its really good.",1454178986,1588349555,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198110944084,56,2,6824,0,2708,1592191647

74,67539087,english,"I'll be straight up. I would only purchase this game if you are heavily interested in Zombies and completing Easter Eggs. If that is you, I think you will have a fantastic time. I personally got the Zombies Chronicles Deluxe Edition for 100 US Dollars, and I will admit that the price seems rather steep for a game that came out in 2015. Hopefully I can describe my experience well enough to determine whether or not it's an experience that matches that price tag. 

[h1] FINDING PLAYERS [/h1] 
First of all, I think it's important to state that it is not easy to find public lobbies to play Zombies. If I queued for a public match on a map that was not Origins, Shadows Of Evil(the base map), or Der Eisendrache(first DLC), it was very unlikely that I would find another player at all, and if I did it would be someone in Europe with no mic, meaning it would be a very poor gameplay experience. Worry not, for there are still people out there playing this game, I just had to locate them manually. I had to join about 3 different discords and constantly look for players about an hour before I found players on PC that were willing to play with me. Despite the difficulty of initially locking down players, typically they will have the same goals as yourself and willing to stick around and play more in the future. Overall, I would say that one would have a very tough time playing this game if they're unable to network around a bit and make groups to get things done.

[h1] GAMEPLAY [/h1]
It's Zombies, and it is some damn fine Call of Duty Zombies if I've ever seen it. Having not played much Zombies since the initial release of Origins on BO2, I came into the game just wanting to experience the maps that I had literally no knowledge about before loading in. In general the gameplay is much more complicated than anything before, basically forcing the player to complete quests that involve the entire map in order to acquire powerful weapons to get you through higher rounds. Some of them are a wee bit too tedious for my liking, but add an interesting wrinkle to the gameplay that helps with the monotony of killing zombies round after round. There's also a lot more ""boss"" zombies and monsters that occasionally fill into your hordes, that are for the most part well balanced compared to the rewards you receive for killing them. They also add another section to the learning curve, giving you one more skill to perfect as you keep playing through the maps.

[h1]MAPS[/h1]
Keeping it spoiler free as to the context of the maps and their conclusions, I must state that I am in love with the maps that you receive for buying the Deluxe Chronicles version of Black Ops 3. They all feature intense learning curves in finding all the landmarks and other relevant locations, as well as finding the best training and general rotations around the place. Some of the maps feature skill curves as well where your general sense as a zombies player isn't necessarily enough to tackle some of the end-game content and requires a lot of trial and error to perfect. The Easter Eggs are well designed and doable for the average player, as long as they take the time to learn the steps and not die in the process.

[h1]MODS[/h1]
I personally was surprised to find that there is a massive amount of custom zombies content in the workshop for this game, whether it be replacing player models with Kermit the Frog or having an entire map based around the player sitting in a bathroom stall while the zombies charge at them, there's lots of variety and new stuff is coming out all the time. As a modded experience Black Ops 3 only expands in value for me and makes the community for this game feel alive despite the empty public lobbies.

[h1]OTHER MODES[/h1]
I tried the campaign, and I was asleep by the second mission, and the weird game mechanics like wall running have kept me away from multiplayer altogether, so I can't offer a full opinion on them, but I felt like the zombies was more than enough content for myself to enjoy.

[h1]FINAL THOUGHTS[/h1]
I purchased and downloaded this game on April 6th, 2020, and completed all of the Easter Eggs in the non-Chronicles Maps by April 17th. This game completely engrossed me in all its content and I'm excited to get to the other maps and explore what they have for me. It's not very often I pick up a game with completely empty public lobbies and no more developer support and play 10+ hours a day because that's what I want to do. I do understand that $100 is an enormously steep price tag, but there's so much offered in this game that for some it makes up for it's lack of price drop. If at any point it goes on sale, I would say this game is an instant pick-up, but for the time being, I would just determine how valuable zombies is to you.

-Very boring and confusing campaign
-Broken and laggy multiplayer which includes broken gun, specialist and team balance + hit detection straight from 2008
-Pay to win microtransaction system
-Everything cool is literally locked behind RNG lootboxes or paywalls including overpowered weapons
-No meaningful rewards for playing or prestieging
-Super grindy challenges
-The playerbase is full of tryharding kids who exploit the most annoying features of the game making your experience mostly toxic and frustrating.
-One free zombie map(enough said)
This game provides an overall bad experience. You may have fun sometimes if you are lucky enough. If you really don't feel the need to play CoD just forget about it and it's not worth it to buy it for the zombies either. The only reason many people still play this game including me is because it's the only newer CoD game that isn't dead on PC thanks to poor descision making and shitty business schemes.

3,36744436,english,"The negative rating has mostly to do  with the issue im having at Zombies and also a little bit with Multiplayer.

Zombies  
- This was the main reason why i purchased this game. I really love the story behind every map and doing the Easter Eggs. At the moment i cant play this mode anymore because of an lobby issue that im having. 

When i join a group of random players, the Ready Up button doesnt respond. When i host a public match, players cant Ready Up and i get delayed lobby messages.
When i try to host a private match it immediately kicks me out of Zombies and back to the main screen.
Before this problem occurred i didnt had any problems and everything worked fine until now. Also ive been playing this game for years with the same Internet connection and settings.

This is by the way the second time that im having this problem. Somehow when it happened the first time it fixed it self.

Campaign 
- This was also one of the main reasons why i purchased this game. I really like the gameplay and to me the  the story is really great . You will experience some bugs from time to time when playing this mode.
In my opinion this is one of the best Call of Duty campaign out there.

Multiplayer 
-Seriously dont even think about trying this one out. In every TDM you'll find a cheater or a group of cheaters. 
One time i played Nuke Town, i was camping inside a house and suddenly i was killed by a guy who was outside, at the far end of the map and he was shooting at the sky...
- Most of the time im just looking for enemies and as soon as i find an enemy i get killed with 2 or 3 bullets while even though i have the necessary attachments it takes for me more than 3 bullets to kill my opponent
- The maps in my opinion are not easy to learn (except Nuke Town) for developing strategies.",1511378028,1587113769,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561197999561308,236,23,87148,0,82718,1595121175

Edit:
After gathering more time to play the game, there is a lot of abuse with DLC weapons and the P06 (3 Round burst sniper rifle). These are mainly used by people that have 0 skill and is somewhat easy to counter if you have skill.

The multiplayer of this game is heavily dependant on the movement mechanics but is easy to master after some time. Cheaters are somewhat common but most of the time they tend to be really bad.

If you like Zombies, this game would be your dream, the best zombies in any COD game in my opinion.

Each of the maps is crafted with so much love and care, Treyarch even decided to bring back a bunch of BO1 maps in 'Zombie Chronicles' as well as Origins for those who played BO2. Black Ops 3 maps are a lot more complex and difficult to set up on than any previous game, but once you've actually set up, it is fairly easy to survive. Each map is unique, has a unique setting, and provides a unique gameplay experience. Easter eggs are prevelant, like always, but they're a lot harder this time around. You'll have to practice. The Zombie Chronicles remasters were incredibly effective at bringing a last gen level into next gen, (Shangri-La is my personal favourite, design wise), and they all still feel just as fun and distinct as they did in Black Ops 1 or 2.

Overall, if you have friends, who are rich, get this game.",1582434939,1586836533,True,22,4,0.723866462707519531,2,True,False,False,76561198237535790,73,13,27419,461,4780,1602040301

there brought back 8 old maps which they rather made them worse or made them different from the original maybe its good or bad its kinda just your opinion on that, one of the reason i say they could be worse is because some maps it takes the immersion away and difficulty example gobble gum and wounder fizz so in that regard it makes it worse also the guns look like toy guns but if you like a easy and boring experience you will love zombies haven't really played campaign or multiplier but iv heard campaign is just terrible and multiplier is descent

48,54790513,english,"The tl;dr is that Black Ops 3 has good gameplay, but terrible storytelling, and the multiplayer map design isn't all that good.

- The campaign for this game is an absolute mess. The first mistake is the lack of a real protagonist, just some soulless vessel named ""Player"" (something along those lines, I haven't played the story in forever). Everything after that is bad writing. For the optimal story experience, go look up the fan theory online, involving the player being on their deathbed reliving Taylor's memories. Obviously this is just a theory and not part of the game, so I still can't say that it's good.

- Multiplayer is good, save for the terrible, overpowered specialists and the usual 3-lane map design. The weapons are nothing to write home about, but they function, which is all you can really hope for nowadays.

- Black Ops 3 is arguably the peak of Zombies. Both the workshop and official maps are pretty good. If nothing else, buy this game for Zombies (it's the only mode I actually have installed onto my hard drive atm). The storytelling is admittedly all over the place. Seriously, the writing quality severely plummeted once Origins happened. The Primis crew is well written and their growth throughout the course of the story is endearing, but the overarching plot is the most nonsensical thing ever. But the gameplay is still the best it's ever been for zombies.

- There are also a few bonus modes. Nightmares, which is basically the campaign all over again, but there's an actual protagonist, the levels are reordered, and there are zombies + the mystery box + powerups. Dead Ops Arcade 2 is a thing, and is still as good as always. And finally there's the underappreciated Freerun mode, which uses Black Ops 3's movement system to it's fullest, it's a shame there aren't more maps beyond the main 4.

- Finally there's the Black Market, which has lootboxes, with weapons in them. Enough said.

So in conclusion Black Ops 3 is all around a meh game. The storytelling is terrible but everything else is worth checking out, Zombies especially. The Black Market is trash though.

But if you like Call Of Duty for the zombies. Then you cant go wrong with bo3. The base and dlc maps are some of the best zombie maps(Shadows of Evil, Der Esindraich, Gorad Krovi) And you got zombie chronicles(8 Remakes) which is a love letter to the zombies community.Plus you got custom zombies so if your bored of the official maps(or don't have the DLC's) Then there are thousands of awesome custom maps,Remakes,Mods. They are in the steam workshop therefore making downloading and playing the maps a lot easier than getting maps for World At War. (the game does not run well on potato trust me i know)

This is a solid buy with a lot of content to play

48,66655559,english,"Call of duty black ops 3 was a pretty good game back when it first came out but after a few years it doesn't get played as much as it did. I'll break it down to you on what is good and what is bad (this is my opinion about the game so don't hate.) Lets start with the campaign, the campaign for this call of duty wasn't the best as there was a lot of things that didn't get explained and the characters to me felt more robotic then human but it still had some interesting parts. The part that I hate the most was the second mission. What was probably 20 minutes felt like a hour just to finish it but it was needed if you didn't start with the multiplayer to see how the game feels and how it moves. Next lets go to the multiplayer, I think this was the start of the pay to win systems in Cod as you would spend 100 maybe thousands of dollars just trying to unlock one of the new guns that might be one shot kill or a gun that takes a couple of shots to kill someone but was annoying to go up against. Last lets talk about Zombies, I would have to say that Zombies was one of the best things in this game as each DLC they brought out felt like a completely new map. The only DLC I would suggest not to get is the second DLC as it wasn't a great map and the new wonder weapon they brought to it was trash. They best thing is even if you get bored with the maps they brought out there is a steam workshop so you can get custom maps and you'll be surprised on how good some of the maps can be.

Campaign isn't that good and Multiplayer is completely dead (I can't find a single game), so your only real option here is Zombies. But, I'd say that makes up for everything else because Black Ops III Zombies is outstanding.

The map you get by default, Shadows of Evil, is amazing. It has so much depth but even as a newer player, you don't need to know how to do everything to have a fun time with the map. If you want to spend some extra cash for the DLCs, I'm very confident that they're all worth it except for Zetsubou No Shima. It's just a very tedious map and it's the worst one of the bunch.

3,66604183,english,"This review is based on the impulse purchase I made, because I really wanted to get back into the Multiplayer TDM's of COD that are always so popular. I originally purchased BO4 and game to find out that their TDM is more like Rainbow Six: Siege in the idea that you get one life and that you need to eliminate the enemy team, and it just wasn't cutting it for me.

After getting that refunded, I did my research on BO3 and found out through SteamCharts that it does have a decently sized playerbase (in accordance to bo4, WW and MW being out). I logged immediately into the Multiplayer and got right into a game, it was great!

However, all that fun came to an end after that match. Everyone had left that lobby so I searched for a new match to no avail. It was switching between finding 50 lobbies and zero. To pass the time, thinking I was maybe just at that time where people arn't really online, I played campaign. I would stop playing it every hour or so to see if I could get into a lobby and the same occurrence would happen, no lobbies. I used the ""search"" option to try to find a server. There was one open, it was a ffa, 6 players and they were all bots but for 2 guys and it was a strange server, in the sense that nobody could die, but you could if shot by an actual player and not a bot, but you couldnt even differentiate who was a bot and who wasn't because nobody was talking.

I continued to try to find a multiplayer lobby over the 2 days I've had this game and I haven't gotten into a single one since that first one. I'm sure the game was fun back when it had a player base, but it definitely doesn't anymore. I personally think their $60 price tag should be dropped down to at least $30, but Treyarch isn't known for doing that. If you want the campaign, although I dont think the cost fits, buy the game. if you want it to get multiplayer but not the kind that BO4 offers, then do not purchase this. You will not find a lobby unless you play the game with friends.",1586017719,1586017719,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198085677736,70,2,1116,0,921,1588385759

9,21478264,english,"I figured that i should update this review after the releases of other COD games. So, i will finally give my in-depth review on this game. Nearly four years overdue, but still well deserved.

To start with, the campaign is... confusing. I didn't understand it at all until i looked it up. To be deadly honest, the campaign is easily the weakest part of this game. It has little to no relation to the former Black Ops games. I have not played them, but I know their campaigns. After this, it is no shock that Black Ops 4 didn't have a campaign, but that isn't what I am reviewing today. If you want a story, this isn't the game for you. While i appreciate the thoughts behind it and the complexity behind it, it was poorly executed.

Moving on to the Multiplayer, i couldn't play too much of it due to its... issues. The Black Market is a shady marketing practice that i dont think should be incorporated into future games. The weapons in them mostly ruin the balance of the game. On the plus side, it is still possible to compete in the multiplayer with out it. Well... if the multiplayer was still alive. From my experience, it took me 4 hours to get into one match... only to be obliterated. The core multiplayer is fun if you have friends to do custom with. Most people dislike the enhanced movement, but I personally enjoy it.

Finally, we move on to the Zombies. To me, this is the best part of the game. Custom maps and mods increase the lifespan of most of the game. However, i would rather review the official maps. Shadows of Evil is a great map to get started on. While it is complex, the style of it is one of the most unique of the entire COD franchise. It is a great map, but difficult for new players to start on. All of the DLC maps fall under this list, excluding Zombies Chronicles and The Giant. 

Speaking of Zombies DLC, Zombies Chronicles was a shock to many player and was a remaster of eight different maps. As a fan of zombies, i just HAD to get a hold of it and i wasn't dissapointed. In regards to zombies, this is the best zombies mode in ANY COD game. The Aether story is wrapped up here for the most part, only to be made more confused by BO4. 

There is much more, but i was trying to keep my review brief. I am not a professional critic, but i feel like this is a basis for you gamers out there. If you are a fan of campaigns, steer clear. If you have friends for Multiplayer, go for it but wait for the sale or something. However, if you are a Zombies fan, then this game is a MUST. The DLC are amazing and the community will always keep it alive. Well, use this as you will",1456505856,1585997413,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198205373020,92,5,22868,82,281,1600997755

Zombies is by far the best in bo3. We have mod tools. 9 old maps. 5 new maps, all of which are amazing (even zns)

The zombies is amazing but to get the full experience with all the maps It will cost you $130cad
WHY IS THE SEASON PASS STILL $40? FFS ACTIVISION.
anyway, if you want customs go nuts. It's an amazing experience and I recommend it fully. But I cannot in good conscience recommend a game that is so grossly overpriced 5 years after release.

I recommend zombies, the DLC maps are pretty much worth it (or you can get season pass when it‚Äôs half off) and the chronicles maps are awesome as well. Der Eisendrache is visually amazing so is Zetsobou No Shima. Maps such as Origins from Chronicles are absolute classics and any long time black ops/waw player will love chronicles. If your looking for new content and an incredible map (free) I say play Shadows of Evil. Absolutely amazing map. Not to mention you can also play custom zombies which is also great. Multiplayer can be somewhat raw at times and the game is somewhat dead but with a few friends multiplayer can be a blast. The campaign is also pretty dry and kind of sucky but either way the game is still worth it. I also like the gobble gum feature in zombies (makes for a fun and interesting game :))

Shadows of evil (the map you get when you buy the game) is a master piece and ive loved every second of it. Zombie chronicles has some amazing remasters. One thing that drags this game down is the multiplayer. Multiplayer is very fun only if you don't have snipers in your game. The majority of people use snipers with red dot sights making it a very mundane and unfun experience. 

Over all I highly recommend this game to people.

My only issue is the jumping, it feels odd, and personally, i dont feel like it needs to be there. And finally, the story mode, its ok, mediocre at best, but at least it has one, to add on to it, theres also a zombies story mode, besides the maps, but i feel the more futuristic the games got, the worse the story modes were given, but still, the story is meh, but at least it has a story, unlike black ops 4, where theres no story to be seen unless you buy it for extra, which i only know so few ammounts of people who would actually pay for it.

84,65127721,english,"I've played both ps4 and pc and I only mainly play for zombies but I have played the other modes.

Campaign  3/10: I like the abilities and how you can use your own guns. However, the story is absolute s**t. I just skip the cutscene because it was so boring, and there's poor character development. There is co-op though which is pretty fun with a friend, but other than that campaign is BO3 weakpoint.

Multiplayer  7/10: It's a big grind. Like every other games nowadays, there's microtransaction and you can pay to get better guns. Some of the guns are okay, but some are just stupidly good. The maps imo are decent, and they fit well with all the jumping and wall riding. You're either in a lobby with lots of sweats or just some people who want to chill (from my experience). Customization is alright, but the specialist abilities. Even though rewarding, is just really annoying and not what COD is suppose to be. Once you get some good guns, and grind. Multiplayer becomes pretty fun to play.

Zombies  10/10: So much content. Literally all the BO3 zombies map and chronicles are amazing to play. The 4 DLC maps are all fun and look amazing. All have their own unique EE and wonder weapons. The chronicles expansion is an absolute throwback with some of Zombies OG maps such as all the WAW maps, moon, origins, Kino, and more. The gobblegums tbh are absolutely gamebreaking. There's one gobblegum that basically makes you invincible. Me personally, I think the gobblegums are really fun to use, and it made what was impossible in Zombies possible. One thing that cought my attention was custom zombie maps. It is f***ing fun af especially with a friend. Treyarch did a really good job in BO3 zombies as I personally think it's slightly better than BO1 zombies. 

Conclusion: There's plenty of content in BO3 which will never make you bored of this game. 5 years later, and this game is still enjoyable to play.",1584333040,1584333040,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198853876327,23,6,7227,273,2632,1601853271

96,65106299,english,"TLDR: If ya like zombies, BO3 is probably the best singular game to have, mainly including the DLC.

Pretty much a purely Zombies perspective. This game is awesome for people who loves the zombies mode. So many maps. Most of the new ones are just awesome and the old ones like the Giant and the Zombies Chronicles are faithful remasters with updated features from Black Ops 3. Assuming you have all the DLC you can get so much mileage out of it. Like a simple experience? Kino, Acension, The Giant, Nacht, Gorod Krovi even. Something more complicated? Shadows, Der Eisendrache, Origins. Something for everyone. Microtransactions with gobblegums are semi-annoying, but they honestly implemented in such a way that I don't really feel like its an issue. Through normal gameplay I've gotten plenty of Divinium for the factory and I'm comfortable using a few Megas here and there when I feel like it. Even just the normal gobblegums have enough use that you don't really need megas anyways most of the time. Overall, probably the best COD Zombies game ever so far. The pure quality and quantity is unrivaled. BO4 was a big disappointment for me and probably the first time I've ever fully regretted the purchase of a game. BO3 is the opposite. It's what zombies should be for the most part. BO1 and BO2 had their own merits, but come nowhere near the level of pure content on offer here.",1584299839,1584299839,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198065365977,124,11,8958,21,8570,1601187228

79,55895257,english,The game is fun when it works. However it has issues letting you connect to friends and it seems to get worse the older the game gets. Treyarch and Activision don't care about their old titles. The only thing they care about is milking their fan base dry of cash when and where ever they can. Its a real shame. I used to be a huge fan of Call of Duty (mainly the zombies mode) however they have ruined the franchise with greed. They Charge you $60 for a game and design it in a way that makes the game unfair and unreasonably difficult unless you give them more money through paid micro-transactions that make the game go back to the way it was before. They now nickle & dime you for things that in previous titles were just part of the game. Treyarch and Activision are scummy companies who have ruined a beloved franchise. I will never purchase another Call of Duty title or recommend it to anyone ever again.

98,64781237,english,"I recommend this game and I will tell you why! (TL;DR on the bottom)

This is by far my all time favorite Call of Duty. The exhilarating gameplay spans across all three aspects of the game (Campaign, Multiplayer, Zombies).  I have played this game across a couple of accounts so the hours played at this time are not indicative of the time that I have spent playing this incredible experience (2,100 hours in total).  I will be analyzing each aspect of the game and going over the pros and cons of each.

[h1]Campaign[/h1]
I don't really get the negative light that this campaign received.  As long as you seperate this campaign from the campaigns of the first black ops games, I personally think that this is not bad.  It can be very confusing if you don't pay attention and even then I had to look up videos on YouTube to figure out what exactly was going on.

Rating: 6/10

[h1]Multiplayer[/h1]
There really isn't much to say about the multiplayer here. I mostly come back to it because of the jetpack/parkour aspect of the game. There's something really satisfying about headshoting someone just after running on a wall suspended over canyons.  It really isn't active however; I usually run into the same 50-100 people on a given day and it has sort of become a community of the same people and I like that. It has personally been my favorite multiplayer experience

Rating: 8/10

[h1]Zombies[/h1]
THIS. IS. THE. BEST. EXPERIENCE. I'VE. HAD. WITH. ZOMBIES. EVER.

Each map is unique in it's own way, with its own twists and turns, Pack-a-Punch weapons and  new characters to enjoy; With celebrity cameos and new secrets to unlock, these base maps are incredible to play and a look at.  That's just the new maps.  Zombie Chronicles releases with many old school maps to deliver a nostalgic tone to the new age of call of duty zombies.

Rating: 10/10

[h1]TL;DR[/h1]
This is a great experience if you love zombies mode, but if you are looking for a multiplayer experience, I would suggest you look elsewhere. It won't be long before there isn't anyone in the servers

71,64607304,english,"Hola to the few random people scrolling down into the comments and reviews. Im home from school today so ive decided to write a review on one of my favorite games. Im gonna be breaking this review up into different categories on the three main gameplays and the bonus ones, Zombies, Multiplayer, Campaign and the Bonus mode. Also i just hit my 300th hour on the game so i think im somewhat qualified to talk about this game. Also this is my first review so i would appreciate some criticism

Zombies:

1.) Gameplay
Call of Duty Black Ops is notorious for zombies, they revolutionized with every new installment and took a different turn with the release of Black Ops 3. Black Ops 3 included two new main additions that carried over with every map (Gobblegum, and Double Pack a Punch) and each map had their own unique features. Gobblegum was a contreversial addition for the reason most people thought it made the game ""too easy"" and wasnt necessary but i beg to differ. Gobblegum adds another path to take with the game, another way to approach your run. You could either play without the gums that carry you throughout the experience or you could do my personal favorite and complete the easter eggs in 1hr. Moving on to the next addition, Double Pack a Punch. Pack a Punch was a staple of all zombies and treyarch took a turn and said ""Lets make it even better"". DPP allowed for infinite damage making high rounds attempts effortless and much faster inscentivizing the player to continue playing and trying out different abilities that best suite their gameplay style.

2.) Map Design

The map design of every map is similar in the fact that you can go either left or right to reach your objective. Like i mentioned before each map has its own unique features. For example, Gorod Krovi, my personal favorite. This map has Dragons, Manglers, Drones, More dragons, Robots, Drunk Russian, and a Flying Eyeball? And thats barely scratching the surface. You dont need to be a veteran to understand or interact with the features of the map.

3.) Easter Eggs

Every game has their own little easter eggs that you can do to maybe get a secret weapon or some bonus currency but Black Ops 3 says ""Fuck you, look at what i can do"" Every ""DLC"" map offers some sort of easter egg that you want to do. Shadows of Evil or commonly seen as SoE, is the base map, the one that everyone starts off with. This is a four player easter egg and the objective here is to defeat the ""Shadow Man"", repent for your sins, and obtain the ""summoning key"". You have to perform for rituals, collect souls, get a sword, kill ""Margwas"" which are based off of HP Lovecrafts Cthulu Mythos. Then after that you have to defend a flag while meatballs go at it at full speed. Then the final step is a bossfight with the shadowman himself. You pour 100's of bullets into him hoping to defeat him only to fail and have to try again. The easter eggs are so interesting and each deliver some sort of small message to the player. 

4.) The Story

The story is by far one of the most interesting stories ive seen in a videogame which is saying a lot. This story isnt some carbon copy thats used in every game, its its own new idea that Jason Blundell made and a story that i think everyone can appreciate. The four main characters are Takeo, a japenese warrior that cares only about honer, Dempsey, who loves to tell you to drop the chips, Richtofen, basically hitler if he was a scientist, and Nikolai, who is on his ninth wife. These heros go around from dimension to dimension attempting to restore reality.

5.) Replayability

Yes. This game keeps you coming back for more. You always want to improve your time in easter eggs, always want to find out how to optimize certain routes and wanting to go for higher rounds. If you get really good at the game you also can join multiple discord to help people that just started.

6.) Cons

Zombies is an overall great experience but not everything is perfect. One major downside of zombies are the graphics in some areas of maps. Sometimes a map will look phenomenal but then you move 5 feet to the right and it looks like a potato. Another BS thing in some maps are the dumbass mini bosses that come every few rounds, tedious easter egg steps and Zetsubou.

7.) Final Verdict

Call of Duty Zombies is amazing, i didnt mention custom zombies because thats not part of the main game like what treyarch made, thats more community fueled. I would recommend this game to everyone for its great story, good graphics, and overall fun gameplay. Its fun on your own but even better with friends, granted it has its flaws but what game doesnt?

Multiplayer

1.) Gameplay

Me personally, im not a fan of Bo3 multiplayer. Its super pay to win so in any encounter whoever has the better gun will win. This is a lot less skill based and the meta rarely changes. You could call me bad at the game and i would accept that but there are a lot of over-powered weapons that really ruin the experience. But one ""new"" addition to the Black Ops series was Rocket Jump/Boost. If you double tap space bar you can fly up for a short time, the downside of this is it makes noise and alerts others to your position.

2.) Map Layout

There isnt much really to say about this since every map is mostly formatted the same way. There are two lanes, one on the left and right and there's a middle part with some obstacles on all three paths. Your spawn changes throughout the game to prevent spawn camping and most maps have a window in the middle to camp in.

3.) Specialists

One new addition that was in Bo3's multiplayer was the ability to have specialists. Specialists each grant you and ability that fills up throughout the game. With each specialist you can choose between one of two abilities, usually one passive and one that more for attack. You can also customize the appearance of your specialists with crates that come from the black market which i'll talk more about later.

4.) Black Market

The Black Market is how you get cosmetics and DLC weapons. You can either spend money to earn crates faster or you can just do missions and play a lot. You can win either common, rare, epic, and legendary. You can get emotes, skins, camos, paintjobs and emblems.

5.) Final Verdict

Multiplayer is personally not my favorite but ive heard mixed review on it. You can load into a game and have the best time of your life destroying everyone else in the lobby, or you can get unlucky and walk into a prestige master level 1000 and start throwing things. If you get Bo3 i would still recommend giving multiplayer a try, maybe thats your style or what youre good at.

Campaign

1.) Gameplay

The campaign is the worst out of all of the Black Ops, granted thats purely subjective but its just bad. The only positive thing i can mention about it is that its fun to screw around with it but only with friends. The bots are super easy to kill unless youre playing realistic, theirs no incentive to go for collectibles, class selection and loadout is pointless because it takes so long to level up your guns.

2.) Story

Horrible. Just bad. I couldnt follow it at all and honestly i just couldnt give a crap about any of the characters involved. The person you play as isnt likeable and isnt relatable. And i gave the story a try but i couldnt follow it, there are just too many things going on.

3.) Map Design

The map design is different every time but the layout is the same. Theres an open area outside the you go inside, the after that you have to go outside again, maybe take control of some robot then go back inside just to go outside again. 

4.) Final Verdict

I dont mean to cut this short but i reached the world limit lmao. Overall Bo3 is an amazing experience and i would recommend this to literally everyone to give it a shot. If you made it this far, thank you and i would appreciate some criticism on my review. (Also i didint have room for the bonus review but just know that its fun)

Pros

* Great zombies gameplay.

* Solid multiplayer, provided you were able to find a match that is.

Cons

* Demanding game engine, very very GPU intensive.

You can skip some of them, but not all of them and then there are large portions where you're just following around the NPC and you can't skip those parts. So you end up replaying a mission that takes 30-45 minutes but provides you with maybe 10 minutes of actual game play. I thought that it would be fun to try to get all of the various achievements, but got tired of waiting around doing nothing just to be able to try.

I bought the game long after its release, so there aren't any PvP servers with enough players to get regular games going.

The zombies experience in Black ops 3 is the best you can ever get in a call of duty game, as it has a very nice looking and full action first map with a very interesting story in Shadows of Evil. The bonus map the Giant or ""Der Riese"" Remastered is a very nice map for those who want to chill and kill zombies like the old days. The DLC season was very strong, as it has a lot of memorable maps like Der Eisendrache and Gorod Krovi. The last map ""Revelations"" is just pure nostalgia and Zetsubo no shima, although with it's flaws, still can be enjoyable. Last DLC pack is zombies chronicles which is a must buy, as it has the best maps of zombies like Kino der Toten and Origins and all of these old maps look very nice in the BO3 engine.
The gobblegum system exists, it is where you can make the game easier for you butyou can play without gobblegums. Campaign is bad and multiplayer is kind of dead on PC but the game still ahs zombies and custom zombies, where the community make their own maps, and there are a lot of good custom maps in the BO3 steam workshop. all in all 7/10 just because of the zombies experience.",1581641821,1581641821,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198275666084,10,2,29180,294,12159,1601982830

CALL OF DUTY 3 Zombies: is a very good game idea and plays very well but if it was not for the modes used on this game allowing you to survive an reach a win point by using money to escape the zombies thru a door called the buyable ending door.  If it was not for this then black ops zombies 3 would be like black ops One and Two both are done very poor because the game designers decided it would be a good idea or should i say a dumb idea that make no sense that the same zombie types get stronger and take 3 to 4 more bullets each level to be killed.  Adding more zombies was a great idea as you go but this bull shit of zombies of the same type getting stronger and stronger every level is such a poor idea. 

IT SUCKS WHEN PEOPLE/GAME DESIGNERS GET GOOD IDEAS BUT DON'T KNOW WHAT MAKES A GREAT GAME TO PLAY...
If you what to add a different type of zombie stronger one each level making it a little harder would of been cool but not this bad idea of same type.  So i give black ops 3 a thumbs up for the modes, no thanks to designers but those who build the mode a BIG YES... THANK YOU FOR FIXING A BROKEN GAME:::

Multiplayer issue with no anti-block for gaming mouse used is whats destorying online play today.

Multiplayer issue of all the added special gaming mouse features that add quick draw and fast target these and more cheats and with this added tools and the type of pc mouse you own. This is what‚Äôs destroying the multiplayer games all together.

 I never could understand why the hell would you have over 75% of its guns  usless and on top of that most of the poor guns spawn in every map, that it makes the game su@k.

The gameplay that's there is great, and I love the support for custom zombies maps, but I can barely play any zombies at all because every time I get into a match, solo or multiplayer, it crashes. Really frustrating when I put over an hour into a game and it just suddenly decides to crash. What a shame.

Update 2/2/20: Activision seems to have patched these issues. I have little to no issues with crashing at this point, and I've changed nothing in my build (but my PC case and some peripherals).

I gotta say, Black Ops 3 is the goat of all Treyarch games. The gameplay mechanics are cool. But the stereotypical futuristic bull crap is there. But I don't give a hell about it. This is by far the best Black Ops game ever.

CAMPAIGN

The campaign storyline was the worst of the Black Ops storyline, but who cares?

MULTIPLAYER

The multiplayer mechanics are awesome with the double jumping, sliding and wall climbing, and the specialist abilities then makes the game completely overrun with spammers, great mechanics though, the weapons introduces us some new stankin' weapons. And even some throwbacks that we can recognize from older Call of Duty titles.

ZOMBIES

The most exiting part about this game is the zombie storyline. This storyline follows the Aether multiverse. In which Richtofen unleashes a ""Great Evil"" according to Takeo, then the multiverse is broken and they are up to restore it. But that should save it for Black Ops 4. It features some new maps, and remasters of our old and favorite maps from older titles, along with Steam Workshop support, this can support custom maps.

OVERALL

This game is a perfect Call of Duty title to pass the time, either finishing that horrid campaign, or playing with friends in Multiplayer Or Zombies.",1475370933,1580560393,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198136565487,24,2,5292,0,1052,1580562804

Black Ops III has, in my opinion, the best zombies experience, just due to Zombies Chronicles alone. Brings mostly everything good from the previous zombies, as well as innovating things that were very welcomed to the community. Gobblegums make things easier-ish, but they increased the difficulty of the mode itself to balance it out. For me, zombies is an 10/10. Campaign is eh, didn't play it much anyways. 5/10. Multiplayer is exceptional, but due to exo jumping, it's not as good as it could be, but it makes sense considering it's futuristic. 8/10.

69,62045484,english,"Oh man, it's time for the best of the best when it comes to COD Zombies. I just want to start by saying Zombies Chronicles is a great DLC if you don't already own those maps but I will not be talking about this DLC in particular. Anyway lets talk Shadows of Evil. This map is pretty average when it comes to Bo3. the rituals can be annoying at times but overall that doesn't change the overall good vibe this map has, whether that be from the OP wonder weapon or the bomb easter egg. Next we have the Giant which is basically just Der Riese on the updated engine, really not much else to say. Next up is Der Eisendrache and oh my god I love this map. It's basically a love letter to Origins with a great easter egg and upgradeable bows. Next is Zetsubo No Shima and I can't say I really like this map. It takes way to long to setup and the atomsphere of a swampy jungle just doesn't work with me. Next is Gorod Krovi and this is another map that can be very hit or miss. If you love running around Soviet ruins then this map is for you but if you don't then there isn't much this map can offer you. Lastly is Revelations which is an overall good map but the easter egg was quite disappointing when the game came out but if you aren't doing the easter egg the map is quite a fun experience.",1579373277,1579373277,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198138189083,133,31,13385,0,5397,1597891575
