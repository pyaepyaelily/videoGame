32,76555239,english,"Story's nothing special; just your typical Mary Sue/Gary Sue protagonist from humble beginnings and his rise to power. There's a running gag that the guy is short, but honestly it's exaggerated and played more for humor than anything. 

A few story arcs stand out, such as the guy's love affair with artillery to the point where his entire army is just Howitzers and 8-lb Foot artillery. The filler arc with the hot air balloon was hilarious, especially when it kept getting deployed in the middle of the battlefields. Personally, I found the Russian Winter Attrition arc overrated. It's fine the first time but this story has been told several times over and for that alone I prefer the Egyptian arc more, even if it's essentially the same but hot deserts instead of snow.

35,76046258,english,"Since Creative Assembly forgot they were allowed to make games that take place after the invention of gunpowder It's interesting to take a look back to their golden age of 2006-2012. If that thematic bad ass trailer of Napoleon reminiscing about ""Winning"" in Italy, Egypt, and Russia doesn't convince you to buy this game then its not like I will, but alas I'm still going to try.



[Minor Campaigns]

Italian Campaign - Fight the Austrians and their Venetian pawns across an expanded map of the Italian Alps. Its Meh but as a tutorial campaign it's not to bad. 

Egypt Campaign - Fight the Ottomans, Mamluks, a bunch of Berber tribes and the occasional British fleet in Egypt and Israel/Palestine. It's a good campaign more to do than in the Italian campaign that's for sure. 

Peninsular Campaign (DLC) - Play as an occupying France, an on the back foot Spain, or really trying to stay relevant British Empire as you fight to liberate........ or Control the Iberian Peninsula. This campaign adds a new mechanic based around propaganda to maintain support in regions you control on the Iberian Peninsula. Overall its pretty cool.




 [The European theater wide Campaign you're actually going to be playing]

Play as Prussia, Austria, the British Empire or Russia in the Campaigns of the Coalition or as France is last last France Campaign (It uses the same map). And this map is massive, It's Europe but with all the regions broken down into much smaller geographic locations. IE France isn't just one region you can control if you take Paris like in Empire Total War.
 - Liberate nations
- Fight Navies
- Ally with France or declare war on them after a few turns in, the game doesn't care if you want to keep it historical or not
- Those of you coming from Empire will be pleasantly surprised by how much faster the AI turns are.



[Multiplayer Campaigns] 

- Every campaign can be played co-op with a buddy. It's a little buggy but I'v gotten a lot of fun hours out of a multiplayer campaign. (But still save regularly just in case it goes and crashes on you) - You have the option to fight as the AI when your partner gets into a battle, If you two are on the same side you can share units or both vote to auto resolve. 




[Actual Battles] 

- AI is improved from Empire and they will utilize more complex tactics on higher difficulties. 
- Unit Sizes can be super large (Ludicrous with mods) if you have the right PC....... This game came out in 2010 so you should have the right PC by now. 
- The Campaigns might only have 5 nations to play as but just for battles there's a lot more. available minor factions for battles include, Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Spain, Ottomans, Portugal and the large ones like Russia, France etc. 



[Multiplayer Battles]

- People are still playing them, not a lot but a dedicated amount ensures there's always games being played. 
- Join massive 4v4 battles or sieges with each individual controlling a large army. 
- Multiplayer Naval battles are a thing...... no one really plays them though but if you find a friend to play with you they can be fun.




 [Overall]
The campaigns are thematic and fun, the AI is much improved, the combat is great, the unit designs and diversity are great, only issue I have with it are in the Europe Campaign you can't play as some major nations like Spain, or the Ottoman Empire. Mods can fix this and make all nations playable with I just thought I'd put it out there.

The only side note I would offer is that when infantry get closer, the damage of a volley should be much higher and much less at longer ranges. Because that's how it was at it would encourage players to hold their fire tactically and to charge more often. Additionally as powerful as cannons are, they need some form of additional ability to be moved around and used in different ways. IE splitting the guns up and giving one each to an entire infantry unit. While getting a big nerf in damage and accuracy. Because that's more accurate to how it was.

Musket warfare may not be interesting to most TW players and it is quite rare to find someone in real life that is interested in such game as I've only found one(recently)

The multiplayer is much more alive than the 3 recent TW games(ToB, 3K and troy). The Italian and Egyptian campaigns are very engaging and requires different strategies and the grand campaign leaves space for creativity. Lots of game mechanics are either not explained or doesn't work, and it would be better if there is more regions to make a game longer as it only takes a few years to win domination for grand campaign.

Still, good game.

Very historically accurate, engaging campaigns, beautiful ship designs but some bad game mechanics.

The gameplay is, as you might suggest, equal to ETW but what bothers me is that nearly the entire interface is exactly the same as in ETW. The graphics did by no means advance, either.

The only mentionable ""innovation"" it features compared to ETW are the 4 comprehensive campaigns of Napoleon which would be fun to play if you didn't have to use French units.

But you can play as Prussia and the other coalition powers. And you can experience how it must've felt for the real Europe when the Prussian General von Blücher and Arthur Wellesley, the Duke of Wellington crushed the revolutionary French forces at Waterloo.

Compared to the higher end of Total War games, this game is buggy and underwhelming in content. You can pick up mods to improve and enhance the experience but I would personally not recommend total overhaul mods. The bugs are mainly in sound and multiplayer syncing, it's still very playable however.

Looking at this you're probably speculating why I've left a positive review, well this games greatness, like a lot of mediocre Total War games, comes in your dedication to the great Napoleonic era. Where this game lacks the innovation of other games, it makes up for it in fantastic naval combat pioneered in Empire: Total War, historic battles and regiments and of course the classic great campaign. This game's creative summit in my point of view however comes in the smaller campaigns focused around one territory such as Egypt and Spain. These campaigns provide much more dynamic objectives and really lets you fall into journey of Napoleon quite comfortably.

All in all, I recommend this game to people with an existing interest in the era, not to those that are exclusively a fan of the series although if this is the case, then I'm not sure how you haven't played this already.

69,74324859,english,"This game is miles better than Empire.

I recently did a review on Empire outlining a lot of things I thought could have been done better. Napolean takes those things, and makes them better, while not perfect, they are a ladder improvement over Empire.

In Empire, one of the main thing I noticed was that Line Infantry were the end all be all unit, all you had to do to win was just spam only that one unit, however due to a few research changes that don't exist in Napolean, that is no longer the case, you are forced to have a more diverse army as a result. This results in not just line infantry, which is still the backbone of your army, but you also have to factor in a fair chunk of cannons now, which would be historically friendly. The one downside is that cannon units have unlimited ammo in this game, so they can just fire 100% of the time. This is certainly to the attackers advantage, because if the defender doesn't move, they will eventually just be killed by cannon fire.

The map restricts itself in this game to just a singular area rather than three, it feels though as though there are a lot less settlements in Napolean, but each region is much more detailed than it is in Empire, where in Empire France is just one territory, while in this one its a bunch of territories.

The french seem over powered in this one, although that makes total sense seeing as its Napolean who lead a rather successful conquest.

98,73777943,english,"One of the best strategy games I've ever played, and I've been playing quite a lot.

It is engaging to the point of total immersion, the single-player is wonderful, altough it can be boosted with some mods such as the Darthmod to fix some issues/bugs and gain a more diverse range of units/formations.
I'm not saying that it doesn't have some certain bugs that can break the experience for you, such as in Empire. Sometimes troops won't do what you want them to, sometimes the mechanics seem broken, but overall it seems to me that it's far more better than Empire when it comes to that.

Single-player:
Lots of campaigns to choose from, engaging storylines and objectives. If you set your game on easy or normal, you should be fine, but if you go higher than that (on Hard or Expert), it comes close to impossible and thus, every single won battle feels different. Also, when it comes to managing your cities/towns/villages and so on, the Hard/Expert experience is concomitantly outrageous and exciting. I'm no great administrator, so I struggle with them every single time; the diplomatic element is quite good, alliances tend to be what they're meant to and if you treat your allies with respect, you shouldn't be betrayed. Even though, keep in mind every country has its own interest and sometimes these very interests may cross yours, but that's basically just how human interaction worked since the dawn of time, so I'm not mad. It seems to me that this way, the game feels more realistic. There's no ""Allies forever"" in real life, just common interests.

Also, the battle mechanics are just wonderful. Again, if you're set on Easy/Medium, you should do fine, but if you really want to taste the game I suggest you go to Hard/Expert. You really need tactics, you can't just march 1000 troops straight forward. You need to focus on terrain and opportunities as often as you can and even then, no victory is certain until obtained.

Land battles are really a playground for any history/strategy/military tactics passionate. The variety of troops that most countries have really gives you free hand on which tactics you should use. There's no ""best tactic"" or ""best troop"", but rather ""best troops and best tactics according to context"", which for me personally is exactly what a game like this should have. Forget about marching with Great Britain in AO3 with a load of musketeers and OPing anything in your way. Here's the game where you can lose despite having every single advantage in a battle.

Sieges are quite an experience as well, most of the times. The concept itself is really well-thought and, as well as land battles, you get really engaged during a siege. Especially if you're hauntingly outnumbered, like 3 to 1 or sometimes 4 to 1. Those are the best. 
I have some problems with the mechanics though; sometimes your units won't listen to you and would do random/stupid s*it, and there are times when that random/stupid s*it will cost you the victory. For example, climbing the walls might be tricky as sometimes units simply forget to throw their hooks when facing the wall (for some reason??), and if the defender has a lot of firepower on that very wall, well, that's a lost unit. Also, as a defender, troops and units seem to be really shy of the wall, so be sure you're really preparing your troops well before the battle, or else you may find that one unit that you've ordered to go on the wall on East will literally climb the wall on the wrong side an just run on the walls to the point you've chosen, which can take a lifetime. It's really tricky and sometimes frustrating, but as far as I remember, this game is from 2010, so I'm not mad.

I don't know a thing about naval battles, I don't play them, but they seem fun. I'm really not interested in them, especially if playing as France against GB. There's no point, really, besides doing your best to get a hold on their Island. Also, be careful with Spain. They're really on point with their navy. As far as I recall though, the mechanics work fine. You've got wind and all that stuff, guns fire, what more do you want? It's 19th century navy things, not 2020. Don't ask for a lot.

This is basically the single-player game. Really cool and engaging, entertaining piece of total war experience. Cool design, cool troops, somewhat smart AI, sometimes hell on earth of a game, mostly satisfying.

But.. the best thing on this game.. is that damned multiplayer.
You.. just can't express in words how cool that is. Not to mention, played with friends. It's one of the best activities for you and your geekish friends. It has it all, from action to history. It's really sad that the campaign mode is available only for 2 players. That would've been the best thing ever, imagine being on a map with 6 friends. Just splendid. But it isn't.

SO, INSTEAD, YOU JUST KILL EACH OTHER ON DIFFERENT BATTLEFIELDS/HISTORICAL SCENARIOS, ADDING SOMETIMES BOTS TO SPICE UP THINGS AND I'M REALLy COOL WITH THAT AS WELL.

tl;dr:
Gameplay: 9/10
Mechanics: 7/10
Singleplayer: 9/10
Multiplayer: 9/10
Killing everything that stands in front of you with a swarm of dispensable russian partisan militia used as a shield just so you have enough time to unlimber your inorogs in the best position and rain hell: infinity/10.
Overall: It's worth buying it. Really glad I did.

P.S.: Beware the Rocket Troops.

CON: 
My cannons may or may not limber so they can move.
My generals have half health or more but are reported injured and have to leave the army. What the %$# if the health bar on the general for if it DOESN'T REPRESENT HIS ABILITY TO CONTINUE?!? 

PRO:
 I love the infantry in this game I do. Good abilities and getting into a musket battle with enemy infantry is actually kind of intense, because if you time it right you can charge the infantry before the enemy flee from ranged attacks and wipe them out, without having to chase them across the whole field. I really like that. 
Ammo is not infinite. so keep ammo in mind when playing.(I love how that brings more strategy)

FINALLY:
When it works right it's beautiful, but cannons are the stuff u hope works, the General sits and watches the battle NOT PARTICIPATE, and the infantry are great(militia meatshields lol).",1593974118,1593974118,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198830840348,42,8,282,0,132,1593983111

Graphics:

I ran this initially on my older PC before my main gaming PC, and even at max settings it ran VERY smoothly, even in the most trying of times. If you are worried about this game not running on your system, don't, this game runs every smoothly on every system.

Game play:

This game basically just delivers a more refined and polished Empire experience, albeit on a smaller scale. And while I don't normally talk about -mods- like The Great War and North And South are worthy of the asking price on there own in my opinion.

conclusion:

All in all i'd say this is a very good game with hardly and bugs and a very enjoyable multiplayer.

Good things: Fun battles, decent(if unspectacular) battle AI, cool new decentralized resources on the campaign map, beautiful ships, choosing the right place for your cannon-batteries is very important tactically, which is probably historically likely, whole trade-route system is very cool.

Bad things: Very small campaign map /w few factions, not very many different units, and not much difference in how to APPLY those units. Diplomacy-system is broken, playing any other faction than France is quite a shallow experience and the game is disinclined to TELL the player what the actual in-game strengths and weaknesses of factions are.

That includes the replenishment/supply system which has been a total war staple ever since, and might never have been implemented if the developers had not grappled with this defining aspect of - say it - Napoleonic warfare.

They made the map of Europe more interesting, removing some of the ""all or nothing"" aspects of fighting on over-large, nation-sized territories like France/Spain in ETW.

But. I will never forgive them for taking away India and America. A game where you can win as Napoleon, or counter a strong Napoleon AI, ought to reflect Napoleon's ambitions. He sought to strike at the British in their colonies, and wealth extracted from the colonies are what kept them going/bribing other Europeans to keep going.

41,70908486,english,"It is too easy. You can, at the highest difficulty, spam militia and national guard, and as long as you have some cannons to scare off enemy infantry you are good. Their is not a significant difference between more expensive infantry such as line infantry or the grenadiers that would warrant a different strategy or the purchase of the more expensive units over the cheap national guard, and the cannon with explosive shells is completely useless except for cool looking fireworks, that is no noticable damage to moral, it barely ever hits, and even when it does a regular cannon ball would be more destructive to moral and infantry. Regular cannon is the god of the game, and yet the AI has little to no idea how to use it. The cavalry is not very useful, I don't remember using it for anything other than running down routing enemies, except maybe dragoons which where an interesting unit (cavalry with rifles). The city battles had buildings added garrison-able buildings, but they are useless as they catch on fire if anyone attacks them killing all of your units inside, and are also very poor cover. You can just ignore all the building trees, you don't need them as you will easily have more than enough money through simply conquering. I found that due to the lack of unit diversity that combined arms consisted of screening cannons with infantry with a general nearby so they don't run, and running down routing units with cavalry. Also the terrain is extremely gamey, if you zoom in on most any map their are all these silly polygons sticking out, not smooth like 99% of real life terrain (considering these battles are in towns, plains, hills, not on the rocks on a beach or a quarry), so you end up spending alot of time positioning cannons, not so that they can shoot unobstructed by trees or hills, no, you can *magically* shoot strait through a dense forest with a cannon with good accuracy with 18th century cannons and usually shoot over hills with good accuracy, but so that your cannons aren't shooting into these silly polygons in the ground. I am not talking hills and valleys, but like someone just made some terrain colored cement obstacles all over 18th century Europe.

66,70629359,english,"First off, I like the total war games.  I generally enjoy realistic military games on a grand scale.  I played the original Shogun, Medieval and Rome before my computer couldn't keep up any more with the system requirements.  But I played them for years.  When I got a new computer I immediately downloaded 8 more.  I started with Thrones of Britannia and despite its unpopularity had a blast.  

Napoleon is something entirely new.  Gun fire and cannons aren't usually my thing, but I wanted to give it a try.--if only due to fond memories of the early broderbund game ""the ancient art of war at sea.""  I was purely interested in the naval battles.  But I found a lot more.

First off--the campaigns: The first two (italy and Egypt) are pretty easy but are necessary to show you the basics.  If you start with the 1805-1812 European Campaign, you could feel a bit overwhelmed.  Trade, technology, spycraft, and building chains are pretty standard.  The AI could be a bit smarter--but I'm currently playing on medium.  It has the feel of a fairly well balanced game.

However it is with the land battles that the game really comes alive.  Again, opponent AI could be improved--but I think next campaign I will switch to hardest difficulty.  From the screen shake of the cannons, to the soldiers saying humorous things in multiple langages, to the absolute horror of not forming a square in time against a cavalry charge--these large set piece battles are fun and challenging.  There are some tactical adjustments that need to be made going from swords, lances and arrows to bullets, bayonets, and cannon balls--but a good general rises to the challenge.

And the naval battles are fun and lived up to my expectations.  I think use of the wind could be a bit more pronounced (ie if you are sailing against the wind it should be an even greater disadvantage).  But there is nothing more satisfying than hitting your opponent with a broadside and watching his powder room explode...  except maybe capturing a flagship as a prize.

In summary, a great game.  Feels very different other total war games due to the guns and cannon--almost like another series.  I've played 76 hours so far and am still hungry for more.",1591883341,1591883341,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561199031156398,9,2,8314,0,4574,1593625237

72,26247087,english,"Napoleon is a great game that falls back in certain areas compared to its predecessors but improves in others.

Pros:
-The ""Napoleon's Campaigns"" are all quite challenging on high difficulties and are always fun to play.
-""Napoleon's Battle's"" differ in difficulty from slightly difficult to extremely difficult but feel realistic 
-More stable than Empire Total War 
-Battle's generally feel more intense than in Empire (Just what I found)


Cons:
-Campaigns of the Coalition can feel a bit boring as all diplomacy is already set up so you can't really change history/forge your own path without conquering the whole world, unlike in Empire Total War.
-No other theatres of war, which could have put more pressure on some members of the Coalition whereas Britain is extremely easy.
-Classic Total War AI

Well some might disagree with the above. But as I personally love the Napoleonic Era.
I enjoy this game alot, many say that ""NTW"" was the fix to ""Empire"" I would disagree. They are certainly two very different games, even though they kinda play the same with ""steel & gunpowder""
_____________________
On its on ""Vanilla"" is quite good. And the different Campaigns are decent.
Napoleons Personal Campaigns are well done, and you learn a great deal about the history of this Era.

For the full ""Immersive Experience"" I Recommend: [url=https://www.moddb.com/mods/darthmod-napoleon] DarthMod [/url]

Because of the time period, battles are fought with line infantry, which is just a big horde of dressy men with muskets firing at each other then proceeding to charge at each other with bayonets fixed. This is the combat of the time period, which I have no problem with. But this game just executes it so poorly. Infantry is non-responsive, they don't follow orders. I spend half the time in battle spamming right click on an enemy unit so my infantry can actually do something. Sometimes I'll find units I ordered to attack just standing there doing nothing while they get shot at. If I'm in a pickle, and need a unit to respond quickly, I'm sheit out of luck because the reaction time of infantry in this game is atrocious. It takes them thirty seconds to get into the ""proper formation"" to fire their muskets, when all they needed to do was just turn 90 degrees and fire! 

I like cavalry in this game, it functions well and can be used to great affect even with the presence of firearms on the battlefield. But that's where my praises end.

This game is really great for people who have a love for this time period of history. But the best part about this game is it's story campaign, the one for France. The writing is good, the cutscenes are awesome, the three campaign maps are great. You go from Revolutionary France attacking Italy, to an Empire spreading across Europe, to the downfall. It's historically accurate ending is actually really well written and makes you feel very sad for Napoleon and the people of France. The story is treated with massive respect.

I love the larger more detailed Europe map compared to Empire. It's really cool seeing all the different cities. There may not be a whole lot of playable factions, but the ones you can play as are fun as hell.

Napoleon for all intents and purposes is a much better version of Empire. It takes everything from the prior game, and improves upon them. Albeit now instead of the 18th Century style, it's more French Revolutionary Wars/Napoleonic Wars aesthetic.

Gameplay is solid, definitely and improvement from Empire. Decent variety of units, not so much as other Total War titles but the era is somewhat limiting. While it still has some problems inherent with the engine it uses, it still performs better.

Also, I might be slightly biased because this period of history is incredibly fascinating to me. The story of Napoleon bringing Europe to it's knees has always captivated me.

97,67654559,english,"Very good, the combat and strategy are difficult to master since, unlike other games it is not a rock-paper-scissor 'tactics' instead it is all about positioning; skirmishing with light infantry and skirmishers, bombarding elite enemy forces with artillery, gunning down enemy cavalry with mounted rifles, using light cavalry to take down undefended artillery or skirmishers out of position, heavy cavalry to take dong stronger units and so on. The forces in the game work together to weaken the enemy instead of single units countering each other. The game may take time to learn and you probably need a guide if you're starting out like, mass charging infantry is usually a bad idea (unless you're Russia) instead, when there is a weakness in the enemy formation charge a few units to break those and flank the rest of the enemy. Overall, the game is mainly about positioning (as it should for the time period). The main downside is that the AI is sometimes a bit dumb and may end up being easy to dispatch even in very hard in which the AI has some decent buffs. The AI isn't completely oblivious but it isn't brilliant either. The strategy part of the campain is pretty good even if it isn't the most flushed out. However the main downside is the AI being just decent or bad. In a 1 on 1 war it does pretty well but when you have allies that take months to start mobilizing it can be a bit frustrating. Now if you try to backstab on an ally in a war things can get ugly. First, that nation will probably focus its units on you despite being in a war. Secondly, the nation you were at war with before may just ignore your former ally's undefended land and naval invade you with a massive army (this is from experience).

87,66439406,english,"If you're someone who is a military history fanatic like myself or just someone who wants something accurate, thrilling, challenging and most importantly fun, then this is the game for you! 
I am playing this 10 years after release, and I have to say it holds up brilliantly. I am a big total war fan and have played many of their games, however mostly the older ones as I do not have a purpose built gaming PC and am limited to what I can and can't play. 
Most total war games, at least for me, are exciting, yet have a learning curve which makes each one feel different and unique, aswell adding a challenge to it meaning when you do learn the ropes and have mastered the game you feel like you've really achieved something and didn't just ""Copy and paste"" your previous total war knowledge over to this game. I have enjoyed every moment of battle, town and finance management and organizing that is needed in every total war game without it getting stale or old. Each campaign (I.e Napoleons Italian Campaign or the Egypt conflict etc...) shows you knew forms of combat, new units and new features meaning by the end of the story you have been given a full run down of what to expect when you play as your own empire in the Grand Campaign aswell as multiplayer but don't misunderstand me, it definitely isn't one big tutorial. Infact, the game doesn't really tell you much  about the new features rather, it lets you find them out for yourself and lets you figure out how to use and master them. 
In short, from combat to the campaign map, this game is thrilling, exciting and gives you a real sense of what this era of warfare was like and the sheer sight alone of hundreds of enemy troops marching towards you knowing full well you are outnumbered and that a bloody conflict is on the way is enough to send a shiver down your spine just picturing what these men really had to go through.

In this way, there are main forces and garrison forces. So a decisive battle can decide the outcome, which is a test of tactics. Consider that many wars in history are determined by World War I. In the former middle ages, Rome did not know how many army groups fought n bloody battles, which could not reflect the significance of a decisive battle. Then there are fewer cities. There are basically two or three cities in a country, which is very good. General players are not primary school students every day, so emperor war can spend less time to get the same fun.
Secondly, each branch of the army has done a real job. I like artillery best. In the 18th century, artillery was the king of war. It was a good weapon for killing enemies. And the white flag of the army is fast. In ancient times, the whole war took half a day.

The ground combat is pretty fun, artillery pretty much has to be controlled manually if engaging infantry as it seems to aim at either extreme end of the formation rather than the middle.
Naval combat is.. dull..? its okay.
With mods, this game can feel totally different. I've played with Darthmod for a while now, and I much prefer the ground combat using that.

83,48058950,english,"Total War: Napoleon isn't a bad game. However, with so many other games you can get on Steam, I can't reccomend it. You get all the DLC included with it now which I think is great of CA, but the game still isn't in where it should be. The AI isn't great and especially with cannons, even if they're the only unit left, don't route because they're so far away from everybody else, meaning you have to run across the map. Not to mention their accuracy is terrible unless you are positioned perfectly on the top of a hill and firing down on the enemy, which not every map has. I have had 1 cannon unit vs 1 cannon unit defending and i had to speed up the rest of the 45 minute battle because nobody could hit them. I can't even autoresolve battles anymore because I've outnumbered the enemy 3:1 with superior troops and end up losing twice as many as they do, and it throws a wrench in everything I've been planning. If you want a similar game, get Empire. That game has a Grand Campaign that is actually worth playing, with many different factions to choose from. Napoleon feels like they just took Empire, copy and pasted the code, and stripped a few features. Now you can only play as 5 empires. Now, for the DLC. I don't really understand how it was considered DLC when it's really just changing the final objectives and the province sizes. However, as they are free now, they are a nice addition to the game and I enjoy them. While I still enjoy this game, there are better Total War games out there. Empire is good, and Shogun 2 is fantastic.

Edit: After playing another 20 hours of this game, I still do find it entertaining but I still can't recommend it. Just get Empire instead. A final complaint is that while I personally don't strive to 100% every achievement, the achievements in Napoleon are awful. The majority of them are ""beat this campaign on easy, medium, and hard difficulty"" which only adds hours and provides nothing new. Having already beaten Egypt on Hard, I have no incentive to go play it on easy or medium. One of the achievements is to win 100 multiplayer naval battles. Personally, in every total war game including Napoleon, naval battles are clunky and just not enjoyable at all and I end up auto resolving all of them so there is no way I would even try 1 online naval battle much less 100.",1546485484,1577165383,False,1,0,0.460076063871383667,0,True,False,False,76561198831103396,38,18,2784,0,638,1597260608

91,60287469,english,"I don't think Napoleon is better than Empire, and Empire is a broken product that they refused to fix.

For a game that revolves around Napoleon, they executed it poorly. In a campaign as Britain it seemed that Napoleon was hiding, avoiding every battle until the very end. He was killed by the first cannonball fired in the final battle because the generals by default are deployed at the front within range of opposing cannons...

Yet when I defeated another army, Blucher was the sole survivor. And my only generals that died were ""assassinated."" So the way generals are handled is completely out of proportion. Either they die instantly, seem to be invincible, or (despite them supposedly having guards) frequently die on the campaign map before they even get in a battle.

The armies themselves have strange behaviours. Often reinforcements don't work, or the area of influence an army has doesn't register, and somehow an army can bump right into an opposing army at point blank range without seeing it (in real life they would have used scouts, if not just their own eyes to see what's ahead of them).

If an army is defending a bridge then you can't attack them from behind, even if you have armies on both sides of the river to surround them, it'll restrict you by only letting you start on one side (the opposite side to your enemy). Yet if you're defending a bridge then the AI armies themselves can start on both sides...

The game feels like a modded version of Empire that focuses only on Europe. One of the things it adds is a screen shake, and strangely it doesn't let you disable it, and the max camera height is often very low. Fundamental mistakes like that give off the vibe that they just wanted to release an untested mod at full price.

With the success of Empire, it seems incompetent that they'd make this smaller version and not polish it, especially when there were so many bugs left in Empire (like the dreaded memory leak/fort lag issue). They had the experience (and resources) to either fix Empire or make sure their next game was better, but they did neither.",1576986782,1576986841,False,1,0,0.490143835544586182,0,True,False,False,76561197960940977,728,218,4353,0,4320,1580396640

Spoiler alert! 
During campaign you need to know when you tax the citizen and upgrade your tech to improve military and etc.

The AI also seeks treaty’s and trade deals with you, something that many of the other Total War games just never seem to have as the AI just hates you no matter what you do, it is amazing to see Austria want to sign a peace treaty… to rebuild after I have taken half their cities, won’t see a tribe want a treaty in Rome II (even after patch 25).

Cavalry and Artillery are both significantly more lethal, a major step up from Empire. Honestly, sea combat is far more fun than ground combat most of the time, and due to the length of time and cost for constructing larger ships of the line, when you lose one you actually feel it.

I've had Napoleon Total War on my wishlist ever since I got Steam, Total War is what got me into gaming, the first every videogame I encountered was Rome Total War, and since then I haven't stopped playing the series. I initially didn't get Napoleon Total War because I already had Empire, and I figured that a game set in essentially the same time period, but with a smaller map, would just be a dissapointment. Boy was I wrong.

While Empire Total War brings the scope, Napoleon Total War brings the focus. The Campaigns are challenging, and have clear goals and a timeframe to adhere to. Often in Empire I would find myself getting bored, as I didn't really know what to conquer, I set objectives for myself, that gave no reward and only led to more objectives. Napoleon solves that, since the first campaign I've been totally immersed as Napoleon. I feel like I'm actually on a campaign, with limited resources, a set objective, and with no direct instructions on how to get there. I start every campaign by planning out the route my armies will take, and seeing what my initial objectives are, after that I pursue them until victory is mine.

Speaking of victory, battles are awesome in this game. I've been playing a lot of Paradox titles lately, and have realised that I missed total wars battles,  that no matter the odds some form of victory whether it be tactical or strategic is possible. 

Of all the battles I've had so far, the most enjoyable for me come from the Italian Campaign, one battle my infantry was defending a ridge, they were being swarmed by an Austrian bayonet charge and were barely holding on. I ordered them to pull back, right into the sights of my cannons loaded with canister shot. Many Frenchmen died, but more Austrians were killed, I was then able to recharge my infantry and routed the shocked Austrian units.

Now time for a note on the AI:
Cheese
One thing that frustrates me about total war games is the diplomacy, client states will declare war on you for no real reason, and jeapordise your campaign (cough cough Piedmont), however the way to counter this cheese is with cheese. In the Piedmont affair, I was only two turns away from winning the campaign so I did nothing to stop them, despite the fact that I had no supply lines, and my front was collapsing, I took the final victory point and won the campaign. 

The AI can also be abused in battles, in the Egypt campaign I like to set artillery traps for the poor Ottomans and they usually always work.

Get this game, its really good, and better than Empire, it offers a more focused and in-depth experience, and roleplaying as the short Frenchmen is quite good fun.",1574923858,1574923858,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198183635335,63,19,1635,0,453,1597513207

18,4480585,english,"One of the best Campaign/Battle RTS made in Total War saga, focusing in a brief but intense era: The Napoleonic wars, which has four specific French campaigns (excluiding the tutorial one):

-The Italian Campaign, which has a decent progression and makes you familiarize the concepts learned in the tutorial.

-The Egyptian Campaign, a very tough one that will put you on a wild desert against rebels, tribes, the Ottoman Empire and of course, Great Britain.

-The European Campaign, that puts you on the edge of your skills raised on Egypt and Italy, making alliances and trades with other nations figure as keys to progress. Also, you can play the european campaign as one of the countries that figure as the Coallition (Austria, Prussia, Russia and Great Britain).

-The Peninsular Campaign, this campaign generates a new vibe against the previous campaigns, because you have new technologies to research, manage a raging nation against you and prepare a counter offensive against the rebels (you can play as Spain and Great Britain in this campaign).

Going to the important part of the game, the battles, Napoleon: Total War gives a good feeling about micro management, you can outflank an enemy if you managed to lure him properly.

talking about the historical battles, they have very accurrate scenarios and gives you the feeling that you're moving the units like they should in real life (incluiding the legendary Battle of Waterloo, battle which puts you again on a Ultimate Challenge: win against a defensive Great Britain and Prussians on the way to rescue Wellington...).

48,10107055,english,"Fixes what Empire got wrong, but leaves out some of the things that made Empire great. If you are interested in multiplayer, I would rather recommend Empire as the game is more balanced. Napoleon suffers from balance issues online. Everyone tends to always either play England or France as they're the strongest nations, and there aren't a diversity of playing styles like there are in Empire. I also find players tend to play quite dishonorably by camping, spamming artillery, unicorns, or other cowardly tactics. 

For campaign: I found Napoleon to be very fun, although slower and a bit more challenging than Empire. What I missed was the  epic grandness that was in empire, however fighting in regions as opposed to countries made much more since. I didn't like how I could easily march a stack into Paris and completely take down France in ETW.  The Campaign AI is also much more sensible, and you have more diplomatic options like Joining Wars, creating Trade Embargos, and Cancelling Alliances. 

Edit some 3-4 years later: Alright, fine, this has became my favorite TW game to play online. At this point the online player base has improved. I'm guessing the age of the game filtered out bad players or something. There are still a lot of people who like to tip the game in their favor on ranked servers just to get more stars, or people who refuse to co-operate with their teammtes because they have some ""grand strategy"" of camping with artillery so they can bomb choke points and make the game take 40-60 minutes long just to get pointless internet points.  

Just avoid playing maps like Ligny and Dresden where the map prevent normal tactical gameplay. You still deal with forest campers and building stackers, but you can also switch the rules around to render these tactics useless. It would be great if CA could implement a way to set server-side rules such as class or unit limits, but it seems like CA doesn't care about optimizing the MP experience, so I suggest just avoid playing ranked games. 

The battle AI is still terrible. A half-decent player will mow through battles to the point that fighting battles will get tiresome, but necesarry if you don't want to get screwed by the auto-resolve. I must admit after 3 hours, fighting armies gets downright annoying.  

Still, it's an enjoyable game worth getting. However, Empire lasted much much longer in terms of replayability, grandness, and online fun. Napoleon's online experience is extremely disappointing.

Update: Still tons of bad players in this game. If there were a better community you might see me playing more often, but every game is hosted by a coward trying to tip the rules in their favor, camping in spawn/deployment with artillery, putting weather that disadvatages one army over another, just lame shit. I've only had a handful of enjoyable online MP games in napoleon. It's still terribly unbalanced with a terribly poor community. So many shithead players. Most of them have memorized the maps and how to exploit them, for instance, playing ottoman on desert maps with high dust and camping in the corner so enemy will be exhausted no matter what they do. Adding an extra 30 mins to the game just so they can win without using any tactics. If you like REAL battle tactics, this is NOT the game for you get EMPIRE instead. If you like doing cowardly shit and playing like a bitch, then get napoleon and just the rest of the faggots with no skill.",1400040206,1574503448,True,29,0,0.70905458927154541,3,True,False,False,76561197963283013,67,13,33938,0,7771,1592524402

How can you unlike a Total War game? Even 9 years after its initial release date, you'll still find pretty active communities across the world with an ever-expanding universe of possibilities. To be frank with you, to play this game on ultra graphics, you'll still need a decent PC in order to get good frames due to artillery fire, musket smoke and corpses on the battlefield. A great way to spend a Sunday evening is to stare at Napoleonic corpses on a 1800s battlefield. You can't possibly ask more from that.

Cons:
Because Napoleon Total War is considered to be an ancient game, most of its gameplay is pretty repetitive especially outside of battles. Building buildings and taxing you country is one thing then the next is fighting the good fight. But I can't criticize an old game for being old can I?

Verdict:
Since I can't really criticize the old man for living for all these years, I just have to go easy on it and simply because of the heat and intense battles you can dive into, I'll give it a strong:

8.5/10

as it is by far, the best Total War game I've played (it's also the only one I have currently).",1535628878,1573923722,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198282827209,29,21,3650,0,3315,1578258516

86,57281756,english,"After spending 60+ hours on this game, I can positively say it's one of the best Total Wars CA has put out. 60 hours is not a lot compared to others, however I plan on spending many more hours on it. Every single campaign in it is fun to do, where you have a small amount of time to complete these big tasks and if you don't go an overpowered country, it's extremely fun but also extremely satisfying and fun to play as one of the big countries. The game's combat is quite nice, with the muskets and all, however the accuracy these men have is atrocious. A line of 60 men fire, only 5 people get killed on the other side when they are within firing distance. They must be doing fuck all lol. It is nice to watch the engagements between units, and always fun to watch the bayonet fighting. The campaign gives you lots of opportunities to play as different countries in different campaigns. I haven't even played as 80% of the countries. Napoleon is a good game, giving you many hours on the campaign, customs battles, online battles as well. I would say around 200-300 hours of gameplay WITHOUT mods, compared to other games, that's quite good. I have not even thought of getting any mods yet, but I'm sure soon I'll get a couple like the zulu mod, great war mod etc. There are many great mods within Napoleon, and lots to choose from I assure you. 


This game is a great buy, don't let anyone else tell you different, this game is amazing and there's only a few things I would change. Yes, there are a few bugs here and there, but you won't notice them. If you are looking for a game with muskets, lots of units in the field without lag - (8000 on my shitty PC) - and bayonet fighting, real time action and all the rest of it? Buy Napoleon Total war.

50,56453160,english,"NTW is an odd game. It lacks the global scope of Empire, but unlike Empire the AI actually has a bit of intelligence to it in battles. You will take losses and they will be severe even in battles where you win handily. Unfortunately that intelligence does not extend to the campaign. Even on the very hard/very hard setting the AI recruits few armies and rarely sends them anywhere sane. The biggest threat is the loss of trading partners as trade is immensely more lucrative than any other alternative. 

In land combat you can get quite creative with your armies. I had a mix of cavalry/rifle/horse artillery fast mover stacks and 12lbr/howitzer/mostly infantry stacks for operational mobility and sheer firepower. While the AI is unlikely to actually beat you in tactical combat (unless you get totally screwed and the enemy reinforcements show up behind you) it will put up a good fight and you will take losses. Replenishment and supply depots are a creative way to represent the operational constraints of early 19th century warfare. 

The naval game is alright, but after the first engagements the AI will never recruit a serious navy again. And once you grok the tactics (individually micro your ships, ensure they get in front of the enemy line, kill the enemy one ship at a time) you'll find that it is virtually impossible to lose to the AI even when heavily outgunned. 

I recommend this game, but with serious caveats. If you enjoy your muskets marching around with lots of doot doot and cannons firing it is an immensely satisfying game. If you want a tough fight, well, this isn't it.",1572833080,1572833080,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561197999888759,253,27,11525,0,9048,1594413481

For example, he main problem people have with this game is how different it is to Empire, which too is an excellent game. I’ll address the ones most obvious to me.
-no fire by rank
-no real dynamic changes to the armies you play with as you research new technologies
-no grand campaign
-the ship battles are still bloody awful

I can explain these flaws. Yes, they still exist and might hinder your game, but please let me excuse the developers for these problems.

Fire by rank was indeed a concept that was used in the time of muskets - it was ruthlessly efficient, topped only by the British idea of the rolling volley, which kept a continued rate of fire for as long as necessary. The idea of fire by rank was, like any military strategy, to win the battle faster. Essentially, the combined power of an entire line of muskets firing was so devastating that the side that got the first effect volley in won. This translates into games as well. Empire multiplayer just became no fun because it would include the infantry blasting away at each other for a minute then one of them routing. The developers would have wanted the battle to last a bit longer than this, so they removed it.
Secondly, I think this one may just be me being picky but yet again I can’t blame the developers. In Empire, you could feel the research affecting your army. The most obvious example of this is the bayonets - you start with no bayonet, then progress to plug and eventually fixed. This was one of my favourite concepts with the game. Unfortunately, the dawn of the 19th century wasn’t exactly a golden age of weapon technology. Sure, people like Colonel Shrapnel make exploding shells for the first time and so on, but in terms of the musket and cavalry warfare? It’s days were numbered by that point. So again, it’s not the developers fault - they can’t change history.
Now - no grand campaign. The Empire grand campaign (I know I keep referencing Empire but people consider it the better of the two musket based TW games) was excellent. The feeling of watching your empire spread far across the globe, taking land in three continents is incredibly satisfying. However, it is just that - a game about empires. Not Napoleon. You could argue that the Napoleonic Wars were fought in America and, yes, India in the last years of the 18th century, but it doesn’t... count. The Wars were European. That’s a fact. You play as either France trying to take over Europe, or the Coalition trying to stop France. It’s not a game made to create an empire, not like how Empire TW is.
And finally, what can I say about the ship battles? I never play them. I make sure to either never use a navy or when I do make sure it’s the biggest one in existence so I can easily auto resolve the game.

Many people have many differing opinions on what the best TW games are. Personally, and maybe I’m biased just because I like this period of history more than any others, but I think this is one of the best to offer. Having played Medieval and Rome elsewhere, I’m confident in saying that, yes this game has its flaws, but still, it’s definitely one of the best they’ve made. But that’s my opinion.",1491592317,1571525466,True,0,2,0,0,True,False,False,76561198165656000,42,26,19834,0,1690,1600451793

I could write a whole essay on the historical and geographical mistakes the game makes. In fact, I did write such an essay, and considered including it here. But this is really about the game itself, and not so much the subject matter of the game.

This game is full of bugs that were never fixed. The early examples are best represented by the battle tutorials. Extremely broken. The events that are supposed to trigger at any given step of the tutorial just as often don't trigger. Especially the naval one, which seems pulled straight out of Empire, bugs and all. I sank both ships (it didn't tell me to try boarding until the first ship was already underwater and I had de-masted the second) and the battle didn't end. When I quit the battle, it's a ""Close Defeat"" despite no enemy ships existing on the water.

Given that Napoleonic campaigns are basically the reason this game genre exists, I'm very surprised how little attention to detail this game received in development.

Play stock first then try his mod, adds a lot of options to stock play.
I own a lot of TW games and this is one you can come back and replay again.
I also like shogun 2 and warhammer 2 tw games, rome 2 , not so great, attila better but still meh.

I would rate these as good TW games in franchise
Napoleon (empire also more content , but less quality) 
Shogun 2
Warhammer 2 (also getting 1 is worth having the extra races )
Medieval 2 is good title (though graphics are a bit dated, its best TW  for the period and has some good mods, like middle earth really give it tons of content(prob most content of any tw game with mods)
Britannia skip it. its a poor version of Medieval 2 gameplay wise

Rome is one of my least fav, the interface was changed and its horrible IHMO, devs made a lot of mistakes with this one, shame as its a great period in history.
I don't yet own three kingdoms, looks really good and getting nice reviews from tw content guys I watch on you tube, but I'll wait until its a better price.

Whereas Total War Napoleon has easily one of the best and most beloved modding scenes in video gaming. LME4, Napoleon Total War 3, the aforementioned Darth Mod, the Great War mod, all but Darth still actively modding (and Darth only because he went on to make the Ultimate General series on its own which I also highly recommend) and making a good game absolutely fantastic.

Needless to say, I can and have to confidently say this now, as outside of some truly grognard heavy games that you'd see over on Slitherine/Matrix or on some 50 year old dudes passion project type wargame? This is the closest one can get to a proper napoleonics game now.

- Artillery units are nerfed to the point of being useless. This is mainly due to the fact that when a shell hits an infantry formation, 75% of the men hit by the blast (or even by the shell itself) get right back up like nothing happened. Seriously.
- There is almost no difference in ability between militia and elite units.
- Even highly trained elite infantry units would stuggle to hit an elephant if it stood in front of them.
- The campaign is way to short to get almost anything done.

16,53104448,english,"In my opinion a classic Total War game, even if this is where their... less than reputable DLC system started, at least with only units instead of whole nations as it would later become.
Pros:
-Easy way to kill time, especially if you're playing with other people
-Campaigns feel fun and challenging, being grueling but not taking place on such a large scope that completion seems rare if not hopeless *Cough* Attila *Cough*
-Units are fairly logical in naming and use, for the most part at least
-Great taxation and building system, including nation capital specific monuments which provide nice buffs to your country whilst not being OP
-Specific, cheap trained Militia units, nothing too fancy, but still allowing you to actually choose how your cities are defended *Rome 2*

Cons:
-Any untrained militia units are made out of paper mache, even if some of the citizens you recruited were from a nearby logging camp, they are still unable to win a melee engagement with a 4/1 numbers advantage. They fact that their aim is awful makes sense, but will a socket bayonet and a 1/2 day of training with it really make you able to depopulate a city with the lads?
-AI frequently make questionable decisions, although are still able to make you suffer, even if only occasionally.
-Cannon accuracy is piss-poor, I understand that's historical, but watching a counter battery engage your cannons is like watching paint dry at 0.25 speed

Overall: 9/10 game: Great fun if you love the genre or period, still enjoyable even if you have a passing interest in Strategy games, even if only for the spectacle of watching burly Napoleonic men stand in formation and hit vapes at each other",1562058108,1562058108,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198117623880,163,2,5468,0,4619,1584616959

67,52197187,english,"Napoleon Total War is one of the better Total War games i've played, though I do favor the more historic setting than what Warhammer has to offer.
Napoleon has a solid run to it, where when you play it, you feel connected with the game rather than your own entity messing up the AI's fun vise versa. The diplomacy is far better than Empire and Rome, but still feels a bit lack luster with how things run, being that it seems the AI, whatever your standing with them, has objectives that they need to complete and your relevance to them is unnecessary. 
The game is well done, but the lack of content is a bit unappealing. It does have a different style to it (being that the campaigns are split), but that doesn't change the fact that there isn't an abundance of replay value. Campaigns take a while to complete (dependent how you play), so once finished with playing a specific campaign, replaying it will seem a bit bland because there aren't many other ways you can go with that campaign [explanation below].
The campaign has a specific route it wants you to take, and though you can obtain that objective in any way you want, you are still stuck with a specific style of playing which defeats being able to replay a campaign with a different set of goals/objectives that you want to personally obtain.

Overall the game is a solid 8/10, but that's only for less than 100 hours content. With more content, this game could be considered one of the better Total War games by more people than just me.",1561843494,1561843494,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198244013176,83,5,2376,0,1837,1585710018

If you're into strategy games you will love this game. Beginners can pick the game up relatively easily, although you may have some trouble with the campaign, so I highly recommend the tutorial for new players. You can tell from my play time that this is genuinely an amazing mod.

Positives: Although the game is made in 2010, the graphics and design are still great and you'd be forgiven for thinking this is a new game. Content is amazing, set (obviously) in the times of napoleon and it offers a wide variety of countries to play of, so the game-play never get's boring. There's also multiplayer if you're looking for more of a challenge, only recommend multiplayer battles for experienced players.

Negatives: The game is subject to a few crashes, but most errors can be fixed just by looking at the internet.

Overall, I highly recommend this game. Napoleon TW just never seems to get old and once your in a campaign, you cannot stop.

as someone summed it up long ago ""it's a napoleonic game that has nothing to do with napoleonic warfare""

the only redeeming features are mostly for multiplayer, otherwise AI is possibly even extra stupid, since not much makes sense there; then you may think maybe that's some finally balanced setting RTS for MP? but it's not even that, english infantry would be simply far superior to russian, though there are counterweights such as unique artillery, but that may likely not matter at all, since once again - it's quite poor at being real deal simulator, at least without big deal of mods

campaigns are kind of cheesy, easy, even when it's europe, which is once again about 0 historical accuracy while a lot of stuff is on rails anyway and setting is very limited, CA hasn't tried to do proper global simulation or have transition to victorian postnapoleonic era - without that it's like a bad attempt at what someone already did as for grand strategy and / or wargame

in short it seems to be a lighthearted casual gaym even by standards of TWs

Gains in economy become doubly expensive with each upgrade to properties.   Naval supremacy is essential.  But the war will be won on the land.   If you are Russia your admirals are terrible.   If you are Great Britain your land units are exceedingly expensive.  If you are Austria your allies are waiting for the first slip to strike you in the back.

Total War: NAPOLEON is a game developed by The Creative Assembly and published by SEGA and forms part of the Total War series

The game offers some pleasant graphics and really vibrant colours, although some ugly glitches here and there, it is pleasant all the same

The game does suffer with some repetitiveness at certain areas of the game but a fun game nonetheless

Total War: NAPOLEON overall, however, is a fun game to play, yet sometimes flawed, but is a great grand strategy game to play in short bursts!

0,48825960,english,"This is by far, my favorite Total War game of the series. It sure does have some downsides but it makes for one of the best in the series for multiplayer, campaigns, and historical battles. Multiplayer is probably the best function for the game. Multiplayer is very competitive and submersible with a fantastic community. The maps are well designed and balanced with realistic/unrealistic geography to make for great strategic gameplay. Aside from some minor bugs with artillery units, crossing bridges, and heavy rain randomly being selected (when not selected, thus making misfires more abundant), it's still a RTS multiplayer you don't want to miss and not to mention, there are even some ways around these minor bugs.

The campaign is also another fantastic aspect of the game. The coalition campaigns are a lot less ""grander"" if you will, but the developers make up for it with it's mechanics. A smaller campaign than those of Empire and the Rome series, yes, but when you play they don't make you feel as claustrophobic as it may seem. Although relying on coalition alliance and strength as history would have it, you are still free to do whatever you please as they still have a world domination option for the campaigns. If you learn how to run your settlements properly, it becomes fairly easy and less of a hassle to maintain public order like any other Total War, but a lack of religious missionaries is just one less thing to worry about making it easier to manage. They've definitely simplified some aspects and it has definitely made it more solid than vice versa. I also like the few added diplomatic options when discussing things with other factions, than that of it's predecessor, Total War: Empire.

Overall, the game is great and it's definitely worth the money. It's definitely not worth to complain of a few minor bugs and destroy the reputation of a classic strategical war game, both turn based and real time.",1549554985,1549554985,True,1,0,0.5,0,True,False,False,76561198342552977,47,1,54876,26,44756,1601772839

Your general's bodyguard will have a hard time charging a single unit of militia and even your elite lancers can be exterminated with only a volley or two...  and this is a good thing.

                      Campings as Coalition are not bad but diplomacy of other major nations is sometimes confused and stupid

Multiplayer: It's probably the weakest side of this game. I reccommend not to play it if you want your nerves to survive i one piece. Ye, I know as well it's cool to play with friends and this stuff....but. You are not almost able to finish single battle to get rank points WHY?

1.If you wanna make your own host room you'll have to wait for long time for other players. (sometimes)
2.When you finally get to the battle you'll find that your enemy broke the rules you gave him before the battle.
3.After you get over the previous points you can go rekt you opponents, if you can manage to do so one of you opponents will disconnect before the end becouse he does not want to lose the battle and his points - it means only wasted time for you.
4. Sometimes is the mp game really unplayable because it requiers good internet connection that all players do not have. This causes many lags and dropping players from the battle which means automatical end.

When happens one of these folowing points, you just wasted your time.

30,45658246,english,"A must buy for those who are interested in the napoleonic era, or early 1800's in general. The graphics are quite a major step up from emprie total war, wich makes the battle engaging and fun. Dust from the hundereds of soldiers marching forwards, smoke from never ending cannon volleys, the corpses and remains of a bloody battle, for a game that came out in early 2010, the graphics are impressive for sure. The gameplay is quite basic to get ahold of, especially if you've played other games of the total war series. 

A few things to keep in mind before buying this game: 

First of all, understand that this game is enterily focused around the napoleonic era and france at the time. If you do not wish to play as or against france in all of your campaigns (Atleast untill you've completed your objectives, at wich point i suppose you might do whatever you want in europe) i can not reccomend this game. If you are looking for a all out european brawl with major powers clashing with eachother both in europe and overseas in the colonies, Empire: Total war is the game for you. If you however wish to bring french glroy to all of europe, or be a part of a coalition to stop it, this game is for you. 

If you take interest in the histroical aspect of the game, rather then the alternate history aspect of campaign. There are multiple historical battles (Such as Austerlitz, Traflagar, Waterloo, Borodino etc) avalible to play right from the start, without having to play through any campaigns. Sadly, you are only able to play as france in said battles (With the exception of Waterloo), wich is a bit of a shame. And of course, there are custom battles, where you can choose the feild of battle, factions and armies and play out your own custom made battles. 

Naval battles play a important role in this game, and allthough some may disagree with me on this, i find them to be well polished and fun. Sometimes they are a bit slow, and i can understand why some people would it boring, but i really have nothing to complain about regarding naval battles in this game.

I have noticed a few bugs, especially with the sound. Audio bugs are quite annoying, especially in a game with such fine tuned music and sound details as this one.

Hisorical accuracy seems to be mostly on point, especially regarding the different uniforms and units. If you are familiar with the napoleonic wars you might end up seeing some familiar units like the Old guard, The 42th highland foot - The black watch, The 1st Polish Light Cavalry Regiment of the Imperial Guard etc. Sadly, some of the special units require you to buy dlc to get them, wich is a bit of a shame.

Allthough having some flaws like limited amount of factions to play as in the campaigns, lackluster rosters for some smaller factions and bugs, it is still a very good game definetly worth buying.

(EDIT) Forgot to point out that the AI is quite stupid allot of the time, definetly something that could be improved uppon. Never the less the review remains the same.",1541527033,1541539913,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,76561198154677956,30,3,11581,0,6967,1583676128

38,45457094,english,"i didn't like it that much. 
The first few battles are fun but it gets boring fast, especially once you realize how clunky and bug ridden the battles actually are. Often the enemy doesn't move a bit and just stares into the wilderness for several minutes. I had one battle in which the enemy didn't move for 60 minutes (thank God for 4x speed up), the enemy was supposed to attack my fortress but couldn't be bothered to actually attack it... after 60 minutes the game then deciced i ""lost"" the battle. 

The campaign is a bit of a joke, there are many nations but you are only allowed to choose from five (france, britain, prussia, austria and russia). Why can't i play as portugal, switerland or hungary? Managing your stuff on the map is tiresome, once you have 10-15 spies/gentlement it's a huge pain in the as to move them around.  Generally speaking the campaign map is unpleasent to deal with, you have to look for tiny symbols to find your agents, you can't properly zoom out, you can't rotate the camera, it isn't always clear where your troops can go, loading troops onto boats and unloading them is annoying.  

The game clearly wasn't finished, your provinences can have ""religious conflicts"" which lower your population's happiness and when you hover your mouse over that symbol it says ""you can use clerics to convert your population"", yet there are no ""clerics"", there are no priests, no churches, no pope, nothing. A feature they never bothered finishing. 

Diplomacy is pointless. You can sign a peace treaty and the same nation will attack you 3 rounds later. 
ffs i got several secret societies, let me plant bombs in one nation's capital and put the blame on another nation and have them go to war with each other. 

i don't get the 81/100 on metacritic, it's a 6/10. the battle animations are lovely, everything else kinda su cks.

For its age, Napoleon Total War still a solid game that fixed many of the issues that were apparent in Empire with the new engine. This would be greatly improved upon by Shogun 2, which I've already played more than double the amount of time I've played this game. Its line land battle mechanics are great, and with enough patience, the clunky naval battles still have their fair share of fun. These were the improvements needed to get Shogun 2 working even better. The campaign is much less of a mess since it focuses on different parts of Napoleon's conquests. There's still an option to play other countries in a grand campaign game for those looking for that experience.

That the game is solid on its own and allows for mods to be built on top of it, especially great conversions like North and South American Civil War or Napoleonic Total War 3, is an absolute blessing.

The one thing I'd say is incredibly disappointing in this Total War is the siege battles. You've GOT to be kidding me with those forts, man. They're bland as hell, and there's so few to choose from. And if you're fighting with AI, well, they'll try to put up a fight, but it's incredibly boring unless you're playing with another person. Thank goodness CA did a way better job with those gorgeous siege battle maps in Shogun 2 after this.

Same problems in NTW.

The disapointing multiplayer. The multiplayer was such a let down I thought I could allow drop-in battles so sometimes my friends could fight in place of the braindead AI but this is misleading and not how drop-in battles work at all(not that they do work at least not for me or my friends). The quick battles multiplayer/singleplayer are appauling; maps are so unnatural, bad, and artificial relative to campaign battle maps with every map being mirrored so both players have a 50/50 chance to get the advantageous terrain in the center.

The multiplayer helps, sure, but nothing beats going from London to Moscow in 1805. If you're using either Darthmod or Napoleonic Total War III, then the game's fun increases tenfold. In the base game, you have Britain, Prussia, Austria, Russia, and France. Thats it. In NTW III, you have Hannover, Sweden, Denmark, Saxony, Mecklenburg, etc. 

The game requires skill in multiplayer. Calling the AI dumb in a CA game is beating a dead horse. The campaign doesn't have much, apart from an epic battle here-and-there. Fighting a battle in multiplayer is far more tense and tactical. Forming square, tactical retreats, cavalry charges, etc, all improve the strategy involved. Catching a unit off-guard with Hussars is an amazing feeling. Holding a building with two units VS ten feels like an epic last stand.

Napoleonic Total War III increases it even more. Not every man can form square like in vanilla. Artillery placements can determine the outcome of a battle, or just one good volley fire.

Total War cannot handle any sort of gunpowder mechanics in a modern-age setting until the pathfinding is finally improved upon - but seeing how CA is still using the Warscape engine, this won't ever happen. Biggest problems (and repeated offenses since Rome: Total War) in this game are:

- One unit gets stuck and the entire regiment becomes unresponsive because of it. Your shooting line will break in no time due to this. Anything that involves moving your regiment, from assaulting a fortified position to ordering to attack a specific unit, is a 50-50 gamble. Not because you might die from the enemy, but because you might die from poor game design.

- Artillery might get stuck when unlimbering or limbering and remain unusable/unmovable/both for the rest of the battle. Strongly related to the aforementioned problem.

- AI blatantly cheats on Hard difficulty and above. Their militia can compete with some of your regular infantry and you can't possibly win any melee engagement unless you're using some heroic unit against a regular or below. This leads to the next point:

- In higher difficulties, the only winning option is to cheese any battle by abusing how terrible the AI is. Let them mass right in front of your cannons so you can rout them with one canister shot.

- Naval combat is a micro-management nightmare. It's more of a hassle you have to deal with rather than an interesting approach to combat.

These alone kill the core mechanics of the game. On top of that, what bothers me the most is that they keep labelling this game as ""strategy"" when there's none involved. Diplomacy is non-existent and the world map is just clicking on some towns, clicking some buttons, have a basic grasp of how making money works and create some troops. There's no planning ahead when you can just create one stack of doom that obliterates anything in it's path when you learn how to effectively kill the brain-dead AI. Every Total War has been the same. At this point, it's like watching the Call of Duty of ""RTS"" games, except CoD games aren't fundamentally broken, just fundamentally lackluster. Total War is both once you see past the Hollywood-esque scenes, and Empire + Napoleon are the worst offenders to date.

If you know anything about Napoleon, you know he was a troubled human being who even inspired a pathology: the 'Napoleon Complex.'  In this game, similarly, you seek to play as the French and come to appreciate the enormous advantages France had after the Revolution or the challenges one of its many opponents had in attempting to defeat the mighty Corsican.

That is the thing about the best historical rts games-they can allow you a level of immersion which touches some of the dynamics that echo from events in the past (if that's your area of interest).

That being said, the game is showing its age and the campaign can get plodding but the mods and soem fo the enriching dlcs can enliven it.

I knew a fair amount concerning the era and its developments but after immersing myself, better take off the bearskin now, in the game, I came to better grasp how great was the army left to Napoleon, how gifted were his subalterns, and how much the little Corsican outwitted and outmatched others.

His defeats were, all things considered, not altogether surprising.

Not a few of those hours were spent on the historical battles, particularly the challenging Borodino and Waterloo, but the campaign played extremely well, as I recall.  That of course was complimented by watching the BBC series 'Sharp' which I highly recommend.

But for grognards of the era, it is simply capital.

+ : 
The gameplay is really awesome. With all the different types of units (infantry, cavalry, artillery), you'll face many situations in which you'll have to make crucial tactical decisions, which makes the game really intense and thrilling. Moreover, each faction has his own characteristics, so you'll have to adapt your style to your choice during the battles (for example, France is a very agressive faction, England has the best infantry, etc...)
The strongest factions of the game are balanced (France, England, Prussia)
You can play both ground and naval battles
Many famous and different historical battles can be played (Austerlirz, Arcole, Waterloo,...).
Many imporvements make the game look realistic (battle cries in your units, camera movements when artillery firing,...)
The game is really beautiful (uniforms, colours,...)
You can play all the great historical campaigns of Napoleon, including the one in Egypt
The user interface is quite simple

- : 
The AI is still very weak and not very smart. However, if you buy the 'Peninsular War"" DLC, you will get rid of this problem, as the AI is much more agressive in this mod. 
Naval battles in ETW were much too easy, now they are really hardcore ! 
Some functions of the units are either useless or bugged.
Because of the ""first shot"" strategy, this game favours defense, and encourages thus too many players in multiplayer  to ""camp""(litteraly sit and wait) on hills, in woods, and behind river crossings . 
More maps should be availabe for the multiplayer mod.

The game is like any other Total War game in which you must control your units in order to kill the opposing army. The game does have both pros and cons that should be brought to attention before buying the game. 

Pros:
-Lots of different armies to play as this goes along with troops as there are a lot of different kinds as well
-The campaign has three parts and is about you being the French Emporer Napoleon Bonaparte (Italy campaign, Egypt campaign. and the Europe campaign)
-Battlefields are the right size and offer a good amount of variety (They are also for the most part fair to both teams)
-Lots of things that you could do with your friends such as custom battles or scenarios (You can also play the campaign against or with your friends)
-You can play battles by yourself against AI
-Graphics are beautiful (Game was made in 2010 as well which is very impressive)
-Battles are gorgeous as you can see thousands of troops go off to fight each other
-Lots of mods that you can play around with

Cons:
-The game does get a little bit boring after awhile as it is just two armies facing off against each other
-PC and Mac player cannot in any way shape or form play together
-The game is not too hard to run but you could have some difficulties playing Ultra setting
-Multiplayer is barely alive (As of 2018)

All in all, Napoleon Total War is definitely worth it if you are looking for a game that is both historical and has massive armies facing off against each other.

Emperors never see their efforts bear fruit.
Heroes dont die peacefully on a comfortable bed, but horribly in a putrescent ditch, their unnamed grave.
Mothers dont get to see their sons again.
For however good the speeches of a politician can be, the voice of the people is never heard.

The Napoleonic Wars were one of the last concrete efforts of humanity, and one of the maximum expressions of collective Love. I am a simple man born with (almost) all comforts, but from a conceptual, philosophical, and peripheral perspective, I am confident in saying that I absolutely adore this period of History with a passion so great that, if I could ever display it concretely, would place me in a very different position from the one I'm currently standing on.
I live a marginal existence among the annals of History, nothing of this individual will be remembered. But that is not what I long for. Not anymore. Being born 200 years ago, witnessing the Napoelonic Wars first hand, on the battlefield, that has always been my greatest wish. Being part of this collective effort, this enormous, monstrous, beautiful kinetic punch travelling across Europe and the world, shaping it up with the force of ideals, ambitions, and a genuine love for one's land and beliefs. A life so short, and yet so fullfilling. Whenever I think about it, just the thought of riding across the fields of Germany and Poland gives me a sense of completeness. My biggest regret, and yet, the most high gratitude as I'm able to experience countless variations of the same battles and produce innumerable outcomes. Dreams are a powerful thing indeed.
That is all Destiny has conceded me, in this era of decaying ideals and proxy wars, where corruption runs rampant and Valour is no more. I can only bow and accept my fate, with a clear, pure heart.
And while I move my courageous men and shout at the top of my lungs how much I love life, while fullfilling the Emperor's wish, I cannot but shed a solitary tear, of joy and contempt, forever grateful, forever regretful.

A single day on the Fields of Glory would last me an eternity. Its valour would exceed a thousand days spent in anonimity on this sad Earth of the XXI century. But it's allright, for I can claim that there's a star somewhere up there, that's calling for action, and my sword will surely be the one cutting through the enemy next time I'll be asked to.
For the Emperor, the Homeland, and myself. Never let this overwhelming passion die. Let the new generations know what Napoleon represented, what a powerful, imaginative, brutal, and yet poetic age this was. Let the world know how many perished to give them what they have today. Never let go of those who sacrificed, and those whose lives were sacrificed.
And look up where the Eagles used to fly.",1524756635,1524756635,True,26,4,0.684245705604553223,0,True,False,False,76561197972694609,345,80,61112,131,54787,1601767739
61,41691868,english,"If your mind is lost somewhere down in the metaphorical gutter of sexual innuendo, you probably looked at this game and figured it'd make fine fap fodder. A game about Napoleon (who is oft oversexualised in games) and the promise of Nudity in the Tags might lead one to believe that this game is just another Eroge that's been ""censored for steam.""

However, Napoleon Love Addiction is so, so much more than that. It is, in fact, a genius excercise in subversity.

With no nudity to speak of and romance taking the back seat, Napoleon Love presents us with the story of a young girl. Her name is Graham Parker, and she's just getting started at the Teito General Academy. However, there's more to her friends than initially meets the eye. Napoleon Love begins as a humble visual novel about General and evolves into a full-on mystery that will have you thoroughly gripped throughout.

The game has an absoloutely gorgeous art style, perfectly blending watercolour backgrounds with characters in the style of lightly drawn manga. It's a wonderful combination that gives allows characters their own individual quirks and expressions. It's honestly impressive that, despite sharing an art style, the six leading ladies all look and feel entirely unique and special.

In addition, the way characters are arranged in scenes is utterly genius. Making strong use of perspective by placing characters in both the foreground and the background, Napoleon Love creates the illusion of life in each of its heroines with startling success. The CG, similarly, uses flash cuts to create action scenes in still images; not unlike something you might find in a comic or manga. It's such a simple trick, and yet it's so effective at what it does.

The music is predominantly played on a piano, which blends seamlessly with the overall theme of the VN and with the art style to create an old-fashioned vibe that suits it very well. It also achieves this without being overly agregious about it, and trying to thrust it in your face. The cheery and upbeat piano helps create a smooth flow as you ease your way through the story. What's more, the further you go and the deeper you dig, the more the familiar comfort of the piano takes the back seat for darker tunes to really set the tone.

But, naturally, it has its issues as well. 

I only really have three complaints about the game. The first is the UI; it clearly carries a school theme, and is very clever about how it does so, but it feels a little too... Large. Often concealing the entire torsos of characters, the system window simply feels a little too intrusive. The font, on the other hand, feels entirely out of place. All of the fonts in menus are stylistic and suit the game well, but the actual writing itself is much too simple. It clashes with the soft art style and music, and this is honestly my biggest real complaint.

The final complaint is about one of the characters. Her route just feels entirely out of place and seems to offer no relevant input to the overarching story. This... honestly feels like it was added for the purpose of weak fanservice, if nothing else, to stay true to the game's title. And there really isn't any fanservice to speak for. It was the first route I took and left me with a very incorrect perception of the game. So be wary of that.

But in general, I adore this game. It kept me gripped once I really delved into the main story, and had me constantly ""Umm""ing and ""Ahhh""ing as new details brought themselves to light as I completed each new route. It's incredibly memorable with... Interesting endings that come completely out of left field and that each hit like trucks in their own way.

The price tag is hefty, perhaps a little too high for a Visual Novel that lasted me around 20-25 hours (At a guess.) But if you can afford to blow the money on this? You will not be disappointed.

Napoleon: Total War is one of those games that I recommend because its the best of the worst.

Napoleon: Total War is the follow up to one of the worst Total War games ever made, Empire: Total War. Napoleon is a lot smaller in comparison to Empire because Creative Assembly clearly realized they were way over their head. Napoleon basically fixes some of Empires issues but still suffers greatly from dumb AI, dumbed down gameplay and a lack of actual Napoleonic tactics.

This is a very subpar game but unfortunately its the only game like this set in this era. If you're really looking for a musket era strategy game this will do but you have to install Darthmod in order to make the game bearable.

If you've played Empire this is more or less an expansion to that (was intended to be actually) with most of the AI quirks, and various bugs ironed out.  

The battle AI is smarter, they play smarter out in the campaign map and diplomacy is a little craftier (they don't offer you much without a motive).

Obviously it has few campaigns featuring the diminutive Corsican himself which can be very challenging, Africa, Italy and a main campaign like traditional TW.  The Peninsular campaign is there if you want to pay for it (I bought the whole deal when it was on sale) which features a fair few new mechanics and challenges for each faction.

OR you can decide the Emperor needs taking down a peg and play as the coalition forces in a grand camapaign instead.  There aren't that many factions to choose from as the scope is limted (you can always mod it so you can play as most of the others though).

Short version; it's Empire where everything is a bit better but smaller scale.  You don't get to take over most of the world like Empire, which you should also get if you haven't.

42,39761924,english,"Napoleon: Total War is a great game, it fixes many of the bugs that Empire had, and improves the graphics. The battles in Napoleon are much better than that of Empire's. The battles feel more realistic, and on a much larger scale. The game isn't completely flawless, however. There are still some bugs. There are also very limited campaigns, not many factions to play as like in Empire. Still, This game is great. I would recommend buying it on a steam sale. 

Pros:
Battles are better, and more fun than in Empire: Total War. 
Less glitches than Empire has. 
Many great mods like Darthmod, and The Great War Mod.
Better graphics than Empire.
Great soundtrack.

Cons:
Sound tends to glitch out. Sometimes sounds from muskets can't be heard for some reason. 
Limited campaigns to play.
Auto-resolve can be annoying. I have auto-resolved a battle against 1 militia unit with 500 men and had over 700 casualties. 
AI is very stupid, both in battle and on the campaign map, but this seems to be a recurring theme throughout the total war series.

43,39724521,english,"This is a very good game. While many complain that the AI is lackluster I personally think that Battle AI on Very Hard in the campaigns can provide quite a challenge. 

The 3 main Napolean's Campaigns are very fun. Aside from the expected grand European campaign, there is his Italian Campaign in 1797 and his Egyptian Campaign in 1798, both of which are fun and provide an easy way to learn the game, along with the tuitorial campaign about him growing up and becoming Napolean.

You can also play the Campaigns of the Coalition, which are fun. Russia has a large expanse of land between them and Napolean so they can rest easy for a while, as can Prussia, which start at peace with Napolean. The British can concentrate on defending their island if they need to, and thus never need to fear invasion. However, Austria is in a bad position, as they are weak after Napolean's Italian Campaign, and start at war already.

Finally, there is the Penisular Campaign, which is a very different campaign in that the French occupy almost the whole of Spain, but must act fast to prevent the whole nation from rising against them. The Spanish start weak, but can use Guerillas to attack the French wherever they go. Finally, the British have lots of money, and can get more men shipped from England at port areas, but otherwise have to recruit local Portugese and Spanish troops. They also get Guerillas from the Spanish as a reward for liberating areas.

Multiplayer wise, the community is quite good. However, you may want to start as French, as this is probably one of the few periods in history where the French army is the best, having the most specialised troops and equipment for every task.",1517310907,1517310907,True,1,0,0.495872259140014648,0,True,False,False,76561198253846554,24,4,23470,20,5918,1601919754

You know what I saw? 
Horsemen, slicing at nothingness, the air itself, and a target behind him, about 20 metres behind him, which he had passed, SUDDENLY DIED!!!
The swords don't even touch the targets. Atleast in shogun 2, they did this alot better. If anything, they would be within 1-2 metres range(on horseback) to kill their target in Shogun 2.

I saw horses bumping into soldiers, and the soldiers fall over dead.
FROM WHAT?! They legit barely hit the ground.
It'd be like telling you that you would die if a baseball barely hit you, like not even hard enough to actually injure you.

18,38136237,english,"This was perhaps one of the best impulse buys I’ve made on Steam. Everything about it is quite excellent. The single player gameplay is a fun and exciting mix of turn-based grand strategy campaigns and real time tactical battles (which are entirely optional btw), neither of which require too steep a learning curve from past titles or comparable games. The graphics are top-notch for it’s time and I was pleasantly surprised that my HP notebook would keep pace. However, you will need to modify you’re preferences script to access higher levels, if you need help I’d be happy to provide instructions. The campaigns are excellent and can be completed on the lowest difficulties at around an hour (perfect if you’re short on time). The exposition given between campaigns by Marshal Louis-Alexandre Berthier does a great job in painting a rather charismatic and sympathetic picture of his emperor and friend. Finally, the sound and music provide an immersive, and sometimes cinematic, feel to an already great game. I can’t attest to the multiplayer because that’s not really my thing, but from my understanding there’s little difference from single player. The only complaint I do have are the relatively long loading times, which otherwise give little trouble.

Overall I’d have to say that for my first Total War game, Napoléon has been and impressive and memorable experience. I truly recommend it to anyone interested in Total War, grand strategy, or even the time period.

Pros
-The campaign is immersive like in any other Total War game as you need to strategically mannage what you should spend money on and you need to do things to prevent rebelions, also there is a foriegn diplomacatic part to the game where you can mannage things like who to trade with and who not to.

-Massive battles with lines simultaneously firing is beautiful, this game is a must get if you have a decent pc and like cinematic battles ( can be made to look better through mods)

-Large battles can be fought in water with ships or on land with lines/arty/cav both are dependant on strategy and the cinematics are beautiful

-Wide range of mods for this game keeps the fun going such as darthmod, the zulu mod..etc


Cons
- Musket sound are a bit patheitc in the vanilla game (but this can be solved witha mod)

-Campaign could have a few more aspects put into in to it like prisoners of war,more creative ways of dealing with unrest in a city like executing the leader or something like that

-An army cant kill or capture a spy or a gentleman

-Economics of the game could be more in depth

-Minor nations have little to no unique units 

-No custom upgrades for generals however they pick up traits over time 

-When it comes to goverment or town leaders (ministers..etc) the player has no control or the aspect is non existant

^^Most if not all cons can be solved with mods^^

The main campaign is a close knit and somewhat scripted affair, it doesn't detract from the experience, as you are retracing Napoleon's footsteps. If that doesn;t strike your fancy, there's also Campaignsof the Coalition in which it is more open ended but still on a smaller map than empire, plotting Napoleon's downfall. 
It's not entirely historically accurate, an inevitability in such a game like this. However, it tries its best to stick to period authentic tactics and effects. 
The battle effects are very lovely to look at although the Warscape engine is starting to show cracks what with wonky animation sync and sound clipping as well as some atrocious balance in some engagements. However, it works and is a decent engine for representing Napoleonic combat.

Now it may seem i have a low hour count, This is my 2nd steam account my first steam account was lost and i had 10 score the time on it. Lets get down to the meet and bones of the game.

You can play as either France to fend off the Coalitions forces in a multitude of campaigns or you can play as the coalition to defeat france and other members of the Coalition.
Here are my PROS and CONS to the game

:PROS:
+Good Graphics (AGED WELL)
+Good historical era
+Good Unit Diversity
+Good fluidic battles
+Multiple Campaigns right off the bat
+Can force enemies to surrender with the proper show of force from a town or garrison

:CONS:
-Slight lack in research 
-Few factions to play as (I don't mind this actually, But can be changed with mods if you like)
-Slight Lack in Deplomatic options
-Sometimes the sound is a little off (Barely happens to me but still) 

All in all this game deserves a 9/10, Honestly i wouldn't shoot other peoples reviews down, But saying this game has less the empire total war is a very sad thing, Napoleon Total War has a beautiful diverse unit roster for each country, While Empire total war the only (DIVERSE) scale of their unit roster is the (COLOR) of their (UNIFORM), Empire total war you HAVE to mod that game to enjoy it, This game you do not it is very good right out the door. Those of you that play the mythical warhammer total war, When you get bored and want to settle disputes with a cannon and not a spell then this is the game to do it in.

As a historical buff of the time period it adds massive bonus points for me, I wish more people would give credit for the game but you just can't fix stupidity sometimes. 

Anyway have a nice day and Pound with the cannon march with the infantry and charge with the cavalry.

31,35083630,english,"The Total War series is a perfect blend of Real-Time Strategy and Time-Based Strategy. 

The campaign map comprises of the entire european map (In this case as plenty of other Total War Titles have varying maps) that is turn-based. You manage your empire by constructing buildings, manage your economy, establish trade routes, research technologies, build armies, and, as the title suggests, Declare war on other nations for land. It is chock full of many ways you can go about managing the nation you pick from the selection screen. And yet, with all these things I have described about the campaign map. The games bread and butter is the battles. So how did they go about that?

The battles are a real-time map that give you a more detailed look on what your armies are doing when they are locked into conflict with their enemy. You place your troops, start the battle, and plan your way to victory on the battlefield. It is very simplistic in concept, yet complicated in execution. There is a huge learning curve that you have to bypass, but once you do, it can be either very relaxing, or mind challenging. Depends on the scale of the battle you engage in.

Before Napoleon Total War came out, multiplayer was a tacked on feature that was rather dissapointing. Sure it was fun to play battles with your friends and engage a player in a battle of wits, but a campaign coop mode was sorely lacking. Thankfully Napoleon Total War fixes this. It added a campaign coop feature where you and a friend can either dominate the world together, or be at each others throats in an almost never ending conflict. There are plenty of things wrong with the Coop campaign that irritate me. Dsych problems along with many exploits that can feel... cheaty. Overall it's a nice tacked on feature. Just wished they expanded on it further than they have.

In conclusion, Napoleon Total War is one of the most tactical Total Wars I have played, but it's far from the best. Its got its bugs here and there, but they are mostly patched.
My recommendation in playing this game, if you decide to buy it, is to install Darthmod with the game. It makes the AI smarter in the sense that they use tactics instead of bum rush you, and it overhauls the audios and visuals of the game with new musket sounds, smoke effects, blood (that you don't have to pay money for btw) and drums and fifes. It is a must have that is simple to install and easy to set up. I will post the link to the mod after my final score.

One other thing must be addressed. For newcomers in the Total War franchise who bought this game as their first Total War. Please take a look at this guide, that I will link after the mod, that will teach you all you need to know about battles and how to effectively fight them.

The final score for this game is an 8/10. One of the better Total Wars I have played. I recommend getting the game at the price it's at right now, as it's cheap and worth it, but for the dlc it is better to wait until it goes on sale. Some may argue that they are worth the price, but I feel it is a bit much to pay just to get extra units.

96,33928454,english,"Haven't bought the dlc. bought on sale many years after release.

Its a good game. Its a solid 8/10 probably. Recommend it to anyone who wants a game that combines the civ series with actual rts combat. It scratches that itch without forking over a kitten load of money for a civ game (the new ones anyways).....and I mean lets face it, civ games feel llimited in the combat side of things and they have bad ai always in general. This game seems to have a bit better ai but it still has issues here and there. But it has the rts side of thigns included...its a bargain when its on sale no doubt, 8 dolllars....why not? you kno.

In terms of the theme of the game. I was a huge Napoleon fan growing up. I read books on him from teh library at night for pleasure.....just for the heck of it! It just seems weird to me now that i would spend my teen years doing that of all things. This is the game that woulda made my soooo happpy back then, if i coulda played it. Instead I had rise of nations....which was amazing in its own right. ANd it actually had a Napoleon campaign in Rise of nations i really enjoyed....and would play again. 
Here tho THere is no unity or grand story...its just fragments here and there presented in some ill concieved kind of timeline format. They coulda done a much better job creating a sense of progression in this game, as it stands every campaign and battle is a standalone installment....it doesn't feel like ur moving forward when u hit the next campaign...the  process just restarts which is a real pity. Its fairly faithful to the Napoleon I read about though, but like I said its not presented for people new to Napoleon. YOu aren't gonna be able to follow Napoleon's life or his ahcievements in any sense of chronological timeline in this game, which is a pity. 

The combat is not like any rts/strat game i've played to date. Its all about positioning rather than firing the most shots or focusing ur fire. And moving ur units is very frustrating at times. for example you have 1 enemy unit left to kill....so u just target ur units and click on the enemy to get them to attack. What happens? Alll kitten breaks looose and you could lose a small army or the entire match depending on what that unit is. however if you move unit by unit and get them in their right positioninig u can clear that unit with hardly any loses.

Moving units is rly hard at times. And getting them to attack or follow orders or face the right direction are things htat can cause alot of grief. They won't turn around or react when some1 is shooting them from behind or from the side or from the far front right..you have to do it for them. Lotta micro management.

My favourite part is the artillery really. you can just wreck havoc from the other side of the map on an eniterly enemy army with enough 12 pound guns. Its really satisfying to mow down a huge force of milita before they even take a single shot at ur army. So I often try to get as many artillery as possible in my army. Problem with that is the artilly dont always listen to my orders....lol. Especially when i clump them, some are prong to not halting fire when i signal. And if anyone friendly units 'move' infront of those cannons while they are firing they get butchered. Very annoying to signal ur troops to move in only to have ur general decide to do  a very wide turn infront of ur arty....then ur general is ded. Then ur troop morale plummets, then the enemy cannon you are charging fires 1 round and ur entire army flees the battle....just plenty of times where I lost a won battle cause of crazy stuff like that.

Ummm problems?
Ai can get predictable after a while. The campaigns are not.....they aren't as scripted as they shoulda been. They all felt the same in how you tackled them. We needed more scripted events like armies appearing and rewards for taking out of the way objectives. And winning a story campaign isnt that fulfilling...its actually the least fulfilling part of the game is winning it. Why? Cause theres no more point conquering the other land u spend so much time trying to conquer. And the victory doesnt mean anyhting. it doesn't lead to anything tangible. 
I really woulda liked if it forced you to win a campaign before you could move onto the next.....instead all you have to do to uinlock tthe next campaign is ""start"" the previous campaign...then it automatically unlocks the next. There is no drive to complete the campaigns, u get a bit of cutscene goodness sure but its not.....its so distant and limited to just that campaign. It doesn't branch into the next campaign.



So major problems:
-ai gets predictable after a bit
-unit pathfinding.....especiallly when fighting in forts is horrible. I can't believe how horrible it is to position units in forts. ANd forts themselves feeel reallly stupid and broken. Like the first fort  is a rectangle thing where you put units ontop and posiitoning them near cannons alllows a really wimply cannon to fire at incoming forced. Forces themselves aren't worth the cost they take to build. They offer next to no combat advantage reallly. Artilly just go to town on these things.....if ur attacking the fort plays to ur advantage when bombing the enemy. Its 9k gold or something for a fort which is HUGEEE and  it takes 8 turns or something to build. ANd once is built you can upgrade it AGAIN to a star fort. THe start fort is a gianttttt fort you won't be able to even man properly.....I don't get it! forts should be there so you can defend with fewer units. You can't defend these forts with fewer units though at all. U still need an army to man the fort to defeat another army. And these star forts which are costing you 8k + 16k gold to make.....are even worse! How can I pay 16k more gold and get something that offers me lesss defense?!?!? Just things like that pop up in the game alot in different forms.

You get alot of moments and amazingly satisfying moments in this game. in the board type thing though you don't get many options. Im sure the expansions add more options to diplomacy and what not. I just found the army and combat options of the ai were limited a bit too much. You basically have to do everyhting it feels like.


Closing thoughts:
The ai could be improved, but in the campaigns they somtimes send interesting forces to ur flank making you spread ur forces out a bit to be safe. Its frustraing you can't raze cities. you have to capture them and control the populace. u can loot the city for sometimes massive amounts of gold, but it quickly gets spent on infastructure in a flash. capturing the city and keeping it is always the best longterm or liberating is good too so you can focus on ur inner cities without getting ur armies flanked alll over. 
The multiplayer is atrocious. Its soooo laggy. Hardly any games going. The ones you get into generally won't take new players, and they alll these stupid rules about no arty.....no light...max this min that....then you get into a game and nnobody lets you speed up the timer so ur stuck in slow motion for 15 mins till uu can actuallly get tour enemy.  Then he either camps or ragequits. And if he camps.....and you got no arty.....welll ur pretty much at their mercy and its game over for you unless u start a campwar. Thats really a community problem....theres no reason to not use artillery, its needed to prevent camping. Just its troo frustrating to even bother playing the multiplayer.....its horrible atm. If ur loooking to just play it for fun there is no fun, if ur playing to win......well ur  gonnan be camping alot and harassing alot of people to make them play with no artilly so you can camp and easy win. dont play unlesss u got friends alrdy ingame u can play against.
Its a huge game, just its rly fragmented feeling, i wanted more unity between all the modes and a progression based system with the singleplayer campaign. skip the naval combat. plenty of ""up all night"" marathons to be had here.

I negotiated military access with a pay off to the Venetians to travel through their lands and have a back door to Austria. Ok. Next turn they declare war on me for no reason. 

Next, when I've destroyed the traitorous Venetians, my client state Piedmont-Sardinia, suddenly declares war on me for now reason. It's not like my forces can't crush them, I just need to take one army and race it all the way back across the map to retake Turin.

Pros 

Single player campaign 
Correct military uniforms
Music bands (recommend band mods)
More immersive cannon fire and smoke screens 
More factions

That is what if gathered from my play through and here are some things I hate.

Cons
Fire by rank seems to of been removed completely from the game for some reason that I don't know about.
The map seems to of been dupped down just a bit and India is not in the game aswell including America.
I was hoping for expanded muiltplayer such as coup but it's just the same as empire total war .

My opinion of the UI is that it does look just a bit better but not like empire total war. 

To expand the experience, I would recommend mods 

Better musket sounds as the ones that come with the game are not very good

One of my personal favorites among the TW franchise. The game has everything: muskets, cannons, man in orderly formations. The era compliments the whole franchise - perfect theatre of european turmoils during and after Napoleonic era. Game involves in a 4 campaigns around the years 1800 AD and is closely related to Napoleon himself. The biggest isue of previous title, AI, i still bad and overall clueless against clever planning and strategic movement.

+ Graphics
+ Variety of units
+ Mods for everything imaginable
+ Usually can be bought as low price whole pack
+ Great soundtrack
+ Both singleplayer and multiplayer gameplay
+ Big map with many details
- Only a small amout of playable nations in campaign
- AI is still so-so average at best but what you gonna do

Ingredients: 
1 cup digestive plain sweet biscuit crumbs
3 tablespoons sugar
3 tablespoons melted butter
40 ounces softened cream cheese
1 cup sugar
3 tablespoons flour
1 tablespoon vanilla
1 cup sour cream
4 eggs

Directions:
For The base:.
If you're using a dark pan, preheat the oven to 350. If you are using a shiny pan, 375.
Combine the crumbs, melted butter and 3 tbsp sugar well and pat onto the bottom of a 9 inch springform pan. I also like to very very lightly butter the sides of the pan so that the cheesecake will not stick later on.
Bake for 10 mins in your preheated oven and remove. Let it cool while you prepare your batter.
For the batter:.
Make sure everything is at room temperature.
Combine sugar, cheese, flour and vanilla in a big bowl and mix on medium speed till well combined. Don't forget to scrape the bowl as you're doing this.
Mix in the sour cream till its incorporated well. Then, add the eggs one by one, mixing well after each addition.
Pour the batter into the springform and let it bake for 1 hour and 10 minutes After the baking time, turn off the oven and leave the door ajar. Let the cake cool in there for about 1 1/2 hours.
Remove the cake and let it cool thoroughly. Refrigerate overnight.

It is a shame the main campaign is more story driven and that the open campaigns are also fairly limited as it gives the game a feel of an expansion or DLC for Empire Total War, in the same way Kingdoms was for Medieval 2, but in many ways this is by far and a way the superior title and deserves to be treated as a separate entity entirely.

There are fewer nations, and your world map is almost entirely gone, limited to the more tried and tested method of a European map.

Even as a scaled-down version, Napoleon is far more playable than Empire. The game seems far more polished than Empire, with the politics and government branches greatly developed from older titles like the first Rome and Medeival II. Still, the politics, while more intricate, has not detracted from the ultimately military conquest feel of the series, merely added anther effective tool to your arsenal.

As a great admirer of the modding community I am pleased to observe that modds exist for Napoleon that enable you to play as any of the minor nations - the vanillia game only enables the larger powers - and even allows you to play as Ireland, which didn't exist as a soverign state at the time.

The campaign is excellent, and the option also exists to skip the grand strategy and play Napoleon's most important battles, each unlocking the next until you finally see can you succeed where the 'little corporal' failed and defeat Wellington at Waterloo.

I have no hestitation in reccommending this to any Total War fans, and especially those who played 'Empire' and felt that the attempt at grand global strategy took away from the traditional feel.

1. The game is very beautiful. Even though the battlefields are very similar, its a beautiful game. Its like shogun 2 but in a ""clearer"" way.
2. Its almost a better version of Empire Total War. It does have the simialr musket era but only difference is that they differ in differerent time periods. Empire is more of during American Revolution and Napoleon is well, Napoleon's time!
3. Its fun! Though it's multiplayer is quite small last time I checked, its still awesome to play!
4. Mods. That one word can make any game great. THis game has many great mods like The Great War mod (ww1) and the american civil war! (sorry for my shit grammer...)

Now Here are the negatives:
The one thing CA does tend to lack in is AI. Like Empire and its past games, the AI is quite, well, dumb. Its not retarted like it'll charge everything it got at ya but at least it knows where to position its trooops and all. If you get Darthmod, its like the AI got a boost of 100 IQ. No Joke....

- painfully slow naval battles (I know, thats how naval battles are in general...)

It's got a great set of unit counters and all the nations have really distinct units and strategies despite the age of horse and cannon often seeming too simple. The strategies you can use are immense, the campaign map is incredibly detailed and rewarding despite only covering Europe, and it's very pretty and well-optimized. The game rewards you for securing trade routes, for harassing your enemy, for having good plans, and for ambushing.

The only negative is that the siege warfare is pretty much redundant in this game since forts are so ridiculously powerful that they're almost impossible to take if the enemy has anywhere near your numbers.

Most importantly, it has much better unit variety and almost no bugs compared to it's mediocre predecessor, Empire.

I have played Rome Total War and got a bit bored of the conventional hand-to-hand, compact method of combat. So I bought Napoleon Total War and was not left unimpressed. 

The camera movement is astounding and the gameplay is very diverse and challenging (both campaign and multiplayer).
You will have to adapt to different strategies and means of movement, as well as positioning of your troops. 
You will be forced to make effective decisions and strategies in order to ensure your success and victory over the enemy (tip: outflanking your opposition is an INTEGRAL part of the game).

As with the visuals it is AMAZING. The environment truly gives you that 'Napoleon' ambience (if you know what I'm saying) to your battles. With the soundtrack it's not as good as the music in RTW, but the fife and drums that soldiers march into battle listening to truly gives battles a completely different and unique atmosphere (tip: 'FN+DEL' or 'Insert' allows you to go on the selected unit's first person view so that you can experience what it looks and sounds like).

Altough there is a slight learning curve, multiplayer is a blast, and this time around there's a co-op multiplayer campaign. As of me writing this, (May 2016) the community is also active enough to be able to find a match easily. For cons, In terms of AI, the tactical battles are engaging but still exhibit a few of the pathfinding and judgment problems seen in Empire. Units still try to cross from one flank to the other if you try to resize or reface the line. On the plus side, units don't seem to go into melee mode on their own as often anymore. I also noticed there weren't as many factions as compared to Empire, and unfornuately no Native-American factions, but the nations added have enough variety to keep me intrested.

Pros: 
Graphics
Stable
Week by Week Gameplay


Cons: 
Only Europe to play on
No Grand Game like in the previous entries
Limited choice of countries



The game is broken down into smaller campaigns and you have 2 Short Napolean Campaign and 1 Europe Wide Napolean Campaign, but for the coalliation you have a europe campaign, choice of your country from the coaltition

As with Empire, the building mechanics are dumbed down from Medievel 2 and Rome TW
Focused on Gunpowder Units but has Dragoons and Horse Mounted Infantry with Guns
Has a couple of Ships to choose from but in the smaller campaigns, naval power is irrevlevant.
I personally would have prefered it if it went longer and maybe spread to the war of 1812 but on smaller campaigns it only lasts half a year and you have to option to continue.


The Italy Campaign for France: 
It is you vs Austria and Piedmont.
Take Piedmonts capital and their yours (though i would take it last so i can have the most land possible and it bankrupts them) They will horde all of their units near and in their Capital City so you will need a lot of troops. 
Take Austria and Clear a path to their Capital (It doesnt go to their capital, it goes to the Eastern Point of Italy and all you have to do it over whelm their cities with men and they will go with out a fight
Take the northern part its you slugging away while late game and everyone is taking attrition and losing a portion of their men to snow and desertion, its the same as the rest of austria

I am having a lot of fun so far but artillery and cavalry are really surprisingly weak compared to empire darth mod ( I never played empire vanilla). I tried 3 army compositions, one with focus on either arty, cav or inf. Results were that arty and cav are in my opinion almost useless. I play on highest battle difficulty and the only unit which seems to win battles reliably is special infantry with very high range like prussian 'jagers'. Arty doesn't really hit and heavy cav barely stands a chance against line infantry. I mean, I read that prussian cuirassiers (heavy cav) weren't allowed to wear armor so maybe that's why they have such a hard time defeating infantry? Basically only good to reliably mob up unprotected arty or alrdy fleeing leg infantry.

My personal favorite favorite faction has to be Austria

One of the biggest things I really love about the game are the diplomacy options;Meaning you could wage war peace trade and negotiate alliance. You could become the new world superpower.
Another key pointer France..... France with the leader Napoleon Bonaparte...when playing his faction or another coalition force like Austria Russia or Prussia(there are lots more factions) you have to conquer the world or liberate from the forces of the mighty French......

One of these bugs/glitches is on the campaign map, the sound will go nuts and if you zoom out and move away from the spot where the noise is coming from it will fade away. Another bug is sometimes you can't hear the noise of the guns, cannons, soldiers, etc, on the battlefield and this really takes away from the game.

25,29819102,english,"Fantastic game. Although my only experiance with the game is the Grand Campaign(OR Campaigns of the Coalition as its called here) I have to say that its been 80+ hours well spent. I love how in the beggining Napoleon and his army charges through eastern europe like a train(Which is kimd of cool if you are the UK or Russia, not so much if you are Austria or Prussia). My main complaints with the game are that If you play as the german speaking countries you get little to no help fighting France, however allied nations will send troops to gaurd low defended territories which is awesome. I also dislike the few playable factions(I BOUGHT THIS GAME TO CONQUER EUROPE AS NAPOLEON IN A GRAND CAMPAIGN, NOT PLAY A SCRIPTED VERSION) anyway, id give this a solid 8.5/10.
Pros: 
-Fun to create alternate histories in Campaigns of the coalition 
-Europe is scaled fairly large to compensate for no Americas and Northern Africa
-Winter now affects units stationed outside of a building(unless they are russian)
-You can create puppet states from certain regions like Hungary, Italy, Romania, Catalonia, Brittany, Wuttenburg, and many more.
-Decent technology tree
Cons:
-Gameplay and Politic wise, the game is better than Empire but i really hate that this game is Europe only
-Cant use France in Grand Campaign
-Battle Gameplay can be improved upon but still better than Empire's battle system.

63,29239523,english,"I'm giving this a cautious thumb up. If money is tight there are better things to spend it on but it's a good solid game and worthy of the Total War title. I bought this game on sale some years back and it was sitting in my library. I was obsessed with Rome 1 in college and played Medieval II until my eyes bled and loved the modding community. One thing they pointed out was the games got worse and worse. I would say Napoleon is worse than Empire. It's just too focused on the one dude.

That said, Napoleon's conquests were remarkable and they were able to fit four campaigns and numerous historical battles in a game. What that man was able to accomplish is on par with Alexander, Belarius or Caesar any day. It's a complete game, don't get me wrong, but it's more narrow than Empire Total War. I think part of the problem is large studios like this feel the pressure to release their flagship games every year or every other year and the quality degrades. This really should have been marketed as a stand alone expansion to Empire Total War because that is what it is.  

So much was borrowed from Empire from animations to text you name it. They improved some things though. I love shooting people off horses now and having the horses flee. However, there were some things that aren't as good as Empire. The main thing is stability. The game just freezes up during the battle phase and usually towards the end forcing you to replay sometimes really amazing battles. Also, the sound glitches after a battle. This can be fixed by alt tabbing.

One thing that they did, which I hope they do in the later Total Wars that I haven't played yet, is have a storyline. It's basic, you follow Napoleon. But Napoleon is such a remarkable character there was a lot to take from. I loved the King Arthur Roleplaying Games by paradox because it had a storyline. I was very pleased to see Total War (which gameplay is better) attempt to do the same and I hope future Total War projects go that route more.",1484369205,1484369205,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198022039830,630,44,3336,0,3121.0,1486527283

I like to play slow, build up and max everything out while I very slowly expand. Then I build massive maxed out army's and crush everything in my path. I loved the Empire Darthmod world domination campaign, it allows up to 500ish turns to win. Napoleon does not allow even a fraction of this. I realize for historical accuracy the way I like to play does not fit well but, I would have much rather had the option to set my own turns per year so I did not feel pressured into expanding until I wanted too. 

All of that being said this is worth buying just for the great war mod. I think this is the best overhawl mod I have ever seen.

[h1]General Impression[/h1]
This game managed to fix and improve the unstable and finicky engine that it shares with Empire: Total War. That is a feat worthy of apreciation by itself. Also, Napoleon TW features well designed mini-campaigns which unravel the Emperor's story from his humble beginnings (the tutorial for this game) and all the way to his final defeat at Waterloo. Make no mistake. It is not an easy game but neither are Napoleon's achievements. Europe was never the same after his reign and neither will you after you have played this game on the only dificulty it matters. The hardest one. If you're playing strategy games on Easy or Normal, you're doing it wrong.

[h1]Strong Points[/h1]
+ Beautiful graphics.
+ Modding potential.
+ Steam Trading Cards & Achievements.

[h1]Weak Points[/h1]
- Weak AI in its vanilla form.

As with that game the AI armies are incredibly stupid and you win battles you really should have lost.  But the thing I most dislike about the game is that campaigns are heavily scripted.  You keep being given missions to attack neighbors before you even have a proper economy established.  You're told what specific attacks you are to make, what province to conquer next, etc.  I haven't played multi-player.  But playing the campaign against the AI pretty much stinks.  It's too easy and the campaigns are too short.  I want to enjoy the game with out being on a strict schedule or being pigeon-holed into a strategy that's not of my design.  An annoying factor is that even if I manually shut down AI verbal advice, those annoying British-accented voices keep returning.  I'll say to myself, damn, I shut that off.  Also, even when you opt out of watching the mindless CPU moves, the AI will make you watch some of them anyways.  So you see your opponents and others marching their Gentlemen and moving their ships around all over the place for absolutely no reason.   Seeing some of these things tipped me off early that just like Empire, this game was going to have bugs.  Like freezing late in a campaign.  I'm going back to play Rome.

Anyway, now you know why my strategic intelligence can be only tested by the AI (obviously, a modded one), I´ll tell you about this game. I shouldn´t have to because YOU CAN BE NAPOLEON. WHY ARE YOU READING THIS. GO WIN WATERLOO NOW.

I´ve played Total War from Rome to Rome II, and I´ve got to say MTW II and Napoleon are the only ones constantly installed in my computer. It´s a seven year old game, so don´t expect too much about the graphics (or do it, when you´re in the middle of a caothic battle, with smoke from every corner and constant explosions, you realise that the uniforms are quite dope), or the sieges. In my opinion this is a game that truly test the strategic mindset of a person: attacking a position is no longer sending a blob of units to fight there. If you want to conquer the side of a river, you´ll have to go step by step, and oh boy if you ignore one of them.

This is a game from the time they were released like a whole game (Not looking at you and your tons of DLCs, Rome II and Warhammer, shame on you), when you actually noticed deep changes in playability. And for those who say that Napoleon is an expansion of Empire (which I actually like) well, go back play AOE II (which I love, man, that game sums up my childhood).

A few graphics improvements with the addition of Co-Op campaign, yet they don't have America and the native tribes. It's also quite clear that they hardly tried to make their maps. You have open fields with a fort in the middle, or maybe a town. In Empire there was diverstiy to the maps. A fort on a large bluff with cannons on all sides, and it made you put in some actual thought as to how you were going to get up there.

Meanwhile in Napoleon, you basically have to fire artillery until you break a hole in the wall, and then send all of your infantry to march into the fort. And that happens every single time.

39,26497739,english,"Pros and cons of this game.

Pros are that it is graphically polished and optimized and that there are no staggering and unfinishness like in Empire Total War. The map is tighter and encompases Europe from the Spain to the Moscow and from the Mediterranean to southern Norway and Sweden. Single player introduces the option that was missing in Empire TW and that is looting of conquered towns which brings you money or option of making puppet states of selected conquered national regions. So you can essentially be an European puppet master who forms huge puppet states dependent politically of you which give you money and with whom you can trade and have steady income. 2nd huge thing different from Empire is that your troops automatically replenish losses in friendly or allied teritory. Also now you have expanded diplomatic options where you can ask your allies to join your wars or you can give them proposal to stop trading or breaking alliances. The AI often gives you similar propositions which are usually to their own gain and your loss. 

Cons are typical for most recent vanilla total war games - vanilla AI is criminally stupid, battles are arcadey, soldiers die too fast, firepower is buffed to the degree where bayonet attack is pointless. Also there are only 5 playable factions and number of Napoleonic era troops is limited to few generic groups like ''militia'', ''line'', ''elite'' etc., with pretty much similar stats. And game engine cannot endure modding or unit multiplier that adds more soldiers to the units, and that is where all recent total war games stagger. It doesn't help even if you have a beast of a PC with huge amounts of ram.

All those things can be fixed and given depth by installation of mods. This game is practically worth of investment because of mods who give it depth and complexity. Personally, I played vanilla limited time and dissapointed by its usual arcadey SEGA style for casual majority of bored gamers I switched to mods. Now once you have tried mods for this game there is no turning back to vanilla and you would be sattisfied.

Same goes for Empire TW or Shogun 2 or Rome 2 or Attila - the engine and battle mechanics are pretty same, despite latter games being without firearms - soldiers still die too quickly and it completelly ruins those games. Now with mods, some of them supporting multiplayer, installed this game is worth investing into and I have no regrets.",1478655594,1479497099,True,10,0,0.640431582927703857,0,True,False,False,76561198163856241,33,4,35108,0,25403,1565980598

It does lack from the same issues as most other TW games, with an AI that never agrees to peace despite being totally overrun, more tactical than strategic and so forth, but the game has some strong points compared to other TW games as well.

1. Naval combat. This I think, even though it can be difficult to control some times, is good implemented, and good fun as well. I've played a british campaign based on naval power, and blockade and disposition troops with it. Naval strategic movement are stupidly slow though, taking months and months sailing from say England to Gibraltar. Has to be fixed for naval power to have true strategic value.
2. For those who enjoy that, fortified cities are gone, and you can now build fort or fortresses. This will be a star shaped fortification, and any infantry troop can scale the walls. No more siege equipment. I do think this actually is a drawback though, since fortifications controlled surrounding areas, and it doesn't really work like that now. I do know though that there's alot of players who don't like the siege stuff, so I suppose overall that's an improvement. 
3. Different campaigns and scenarios, not only the grand one, but also Napoleon in Egypt and so forth. Very nice if you want a campaign, but a smaller scale one.

As often is, this game is beautifully made as well, especially naval combat looks nice. Gunpowder smoke is thick in both land and sea combat too, giving a very good feel of the combat of the age.

Very fun and in depth game. Few games give you this time frame in world history and let you have the option of both fighting on the battlefield and taking a tactical world view/city managing view of things.

The Bad: 
If you are a single player type of person, this game is not for you. The AI battles are incredibly easy even on the hardest difficulty. The AI troop movements are as if they all suffered some type of dabilitating disease and have become mindless zombies, walking straight into cannon fire and allowing my army to completely destroy them before they even have a chance to attack. This is game breaking for me.

Overall:
For the price of 20 bucks it really is a fun and fast fix. the battles (though the AI is as dumb as a box of rocks) are very in depth and create a lot of oppurtunities to have fun and expiriment with different unit types,

24,24985287,english,"The Total War Series is my most beloved gaming title on the PC, and this game was a huge step forward for the series at the time of its release.
Napoleon: Total War touches up on features from Empire:Total War but also adds more of a in depth look into the combat of the Napoleonic Wars Era.
I'd say this game has by far the best depiction of musket and line infantry combat on a large scale.
You can have literally control thousands of troops and depending on how you win or lose battles, the generals commanding those troops will gain traits and retainers. Coming from Shogun 2 however, this feature lacks to me only because they are auto asissigned traits, where as in Shogun 2 and Rome 2 you can choose the type of traits, behavior and entourage you want your generals to have. 
This game (like Empire in my opinion) focuses more heavily on the combat as opposed to being focused on building up cities, having a repuation to keep up with or decisions to be made based on your actions.
The AI in Napoleon is up to par but is still un-polished and buggy in some areas, 
you also have to remember this is a relativly old game 
(4 new total war games have been released since this game)
SINGLE PLAYER & CAMPAIGN-
The campaign is fun being very much different pending on the battle and campaign difficulty you choose and has much replay value, on top of that  there is plenty of DLC to download/buy. 
In total there are 4 diffrent campaigns to play (Europe, Spain, Italy and Egypt)
You can play these in single player or multiplayer ether being enemies or coop or both throughout 
There are a huge variety of units to choose from in this game, if you have the right technology of course. You will notice that alot of the units look the same with similar uniforms and hats, but that is how it was in the time period, again i highly recommend the DLC's because you will acquire over 30 + more units and it will help very much in both single and multiplayer.
MULTIPLAYER-
For me this game is all about the multiplayer. There is a ranking system which is what keeps me playing. Although you will come across lots of slight or big lag, people quitting and people lagging out, 
I truly wish they would re master this game. You have to repeat rules in lobby constantly and you can't restrict units to certain rules you want to apply, so new players or trolls choose units not allowed.
You will get frustrated if you care about rank, but if you are playing for fun there is plenty to do :).
Siege, Naval, Land And Historical battles are available for both single and multiplayer.

Pros+
-Stellar graphics for a 2010 title
-Awesome Single Player & Multiplayer
-Unit Variety
-Historical Accuracy & Realism
-Runs on High - Ultra graphics smoothly on low end PC's
-High Replay Value

Cons-
-Multiplayer games crash fairly often and lag, needs to be remastered 0:)
-Some bugs when it comes to garrisoning in houses and firing on certain positions (Hills, Corners etc)
-Outdated AI

34,24737811,english,"Just noticed I never reviewed this game.

Prior to this game there was Empire: Total War, another game of the Total War series that took place during the 1700-1840.
Cannons and muskets are the dominant force on the field.

As the title suggest the wars you will see and take part in, will be between Napoleonic France and his Allies vs. those that oppose the little Emperor. 

Pros
-You enemy is clear for the most part, you do not need to spend so much time in diplomacy.
-The Tech tree has been re-worked and has been dumbed down to focus on Military recruitment, tactics and nation moral. The only part of the tree that still gains technological benefit from research is the Naval Tree, which unlocks better ports and ships.
-Battles are not just about cannons. Calvary has been given a needed boost, making them the fierce opponent they would have been historically.
-Each nation has a respectable and historical (In a sense) start when it comes to regions owned, and troops deployed.
-Very long story campaign.
-Challenging
Cons
-A very annoying sound bug can occur that potentially results in the game crashing. Luckily it tends to only happen on the campaign map.
-France has a Light Calvary unit that has bugged stats, which make it superior against all other types of Calvary. The AI knows this and will field massive armies of this unit if appropriate funds are achieved. 
-Ships feel more brittle and will sink with much more ease. (A pro for some)
- Cannons still determine the battle out come. Being that one well placed explosive shell can completely turn the tide of battle.
-Limited number of playable factions to about six.

However there are many mods and online fixes out there to get the game working to the degree you want it too. I do not use mods, and still have fun when I get the Napoleon itch.

The AI is bad but that can be remedied with mods such as DarthMod.

Pros:
Cinematic, enjoyable battles
Turn-based campaigns, fun to run in and invade a small country such as Saxony
Looks great on maxed out graphics
DarthMod Ai makes battles even better.
Realistic Gunshot sounds.
Heaven for strategy game lovers.

Cons:
Vanilla AI is bad
Interface takes time to learn, only works if you are patient enough
Some of the uniforms aren't accurate, (eg. The Russian ones)

Overall, the game is great, but people who aren't experienced with complex interfaces might get frustrated with the amount of patience and practice it takes to win a battle. I would recommend this to any history buff or strategy fan.

Every battle I fought in this game felt realistic and intense, capped off with an insane artillery mechanic that will leave you with your heart stopping every time your enemy fires a barrage. This is truly a fantastic game.

As far as critical concerns, this is unlike most Total War games. If you have just started with the series, you might be very happy with this game and Empire: Total War. Both are solid games, but unrepresentative of the Total War series as a whole. If you are a diehard Total War fan, with your Medieval II: Total War poster on a shrine above your dresser, then you probably will dispise this and Empire very much. It is very much a conscious decision that your units walk towards an enemy, stop, stare, and then fire at quizzically odd rates.

I'm not going to argue the attention to detail the developers had for history here, only say that this is about as perfect a representation of 18th-19th Century warfare as we can get with our slow processing power.

-Some bugs, such as audio glitches and units not following orders, but nothing game-breaking
-Very little variety and replayability, there's little choice in what to build at any given place, only a few buildings in general, and every faction plays basically the same
-Very little challenge, even on higher difficulties

[h1]The Review[/h1]

I've been a fan of Total War for a good few years, but Napoleon slipped past my radar until a year ago when I bought it on sale and for some reason I just couldn't get myself to play it. Well, today, with a bit of free time, I decided I was going to start a campaign. I never would have guessed that today I would also finish it.

I'm by no means a great Total War player. It takes me around 100-200 hours to take over every province on the map in most games in the series. Most of these games have early hours of figuring everything out, building up a bit of a base so I can afford to expand out and carefully picking out weaker targets that I can claim without upsetting our larger, more powerful neighbors, trying to create the best armies that can adapt to varied situations and create new tactics on the fly, winning some hard fought battles with bare-minimum units, establishing a pattern of stretching my borders and then building up infrastructure to support the expansions and taking a little bit to restock my armies and pacify the locals before starting the cycle all over, each time a bit bigger and a bit more efficiently until what begin as a bunch of dudes in tshirts with sticks has become an armoured, trained fighting machine backed by a growing culture and economy and somewhere a point comes towards the end where my economy really starts booming beyond what I can even spend and suddenly countries are falling left and right to my juggernaught of economic and military might as I storm across the rest of the map, so powerful that even if everyone banded together they could not stop me. It's a culmination of a hundred hours, hundreds of turns of planning and pacing and careful execution that feels cathartic as I realize the whole world belongs to me. 

That final push is what Napoleon is all about. 

A big part of the Total War experience is the struggle at the beginning: starting from nothing and building up, but Napoleon gave me everything to begin with. I didn't really have to put any work in. The units you start out with are fantastic. Indeed, my first recruits were winning my final battles. There aren't many upgrades, and it's debateable whether the new units you can research are even better at all, and there's very few technologies to research either, further giving the impression that you've begun at the end with all the build-up completed for you. The building in this game is also incredibly restricted to the point where it felt token and unnecessary, like how some FPS games give you the opportunity for a health upgrade or two and call themselves RPGs. There's generally only one, maybe two options that you can build at any given place, so even in this area the game has set up everything for you. You just have to click the picture to build what they've decided should go there (you can also set the computer to manage the building automatically, which at this point might just remove some of the tedium, though I never tried it for fear something interesting might pop up at some point. Nothing ever did.). You begin with such a strong infrastructure that it's more a matter of holding the unbeatable hand you were dealt than fighting your way to the top. 

That's not to say the game is all bad, though. The fights look and feel intensely cinematic right from the start, with muskets and rifles and canons blasting and smoke filling the air and men dying by the hundreds from battle #1. It was awesome to watch the fights unfold, and the game is beautiful both visually and in terms of audio. That's great, because there's really not a lot for you to do during the fights besides watch things unfold. Every battle I partook in I won easily with the same simple strategy. Every fight went the same way. The enemy always reacted exactly the same. Every faction used basically the same units and fought in exactly the same way which meant that the country divisions were basically meaningless and every battle melded in my mind so that I can't describe any single battle, but rather just what ""the Napoleon battle"" is. My PC really didn't like the naval battles for some reason, so I just ignored it, and yet still came away with the strongest navy in the world: it was, according to the game, twice as powerful as the next strongest navy on the map. Likewise, my army was composed of basic units throughout the entire game that all used the exact same strategy for every single battle and always won, even though some units, especially cavalry, would decide not to follow orders but instead to make up their own galavanting across the map instead of taking a few steps to the side, or charging at enemies to the left instead of ones on the right I had targetted. My spies never failed in their missons, my gentlemen always won their duels (though the effects your spies and gentlemen can have are so insignificant and unnecessary that it wouldn't matter had they all lost), everything always turned up my way. It felt like someone else had played the first hundred and fifty hours of the campaign and then decided to let me have the last 10 once they felt like it was too far gone for me to mess anything up.
 
And that's all it took. 10 hours to beat my campaign, and a good part of those 10 I wasn't even at my computer, though really it felt like the game should have just played itself while I was away for all it expected of me. When I looked at the ""prestige"" screen to find that the only nations left were my unnecessary allies and that I was more than twice the prestige of the next strongest group even in areas I had given no thought to, all I could think was that there really was no other way this could have gone, and that was a disheartening thought. Even Napoleon himself fell while I watched a video on YouTube after setting up my men in their basic formations, assured that they would win without my help.

If you love the endgame of Total War and find the early- and mid-game a chore, you'll love this game because it really is just a ready-made endgame set up and waiting for you. But for me those early stages are where the challenges really lie and the necessity for thought and strategy and planning is what entices me to keep playing. For me, the endgame rush is only satisfying in light of the beginning, and with that gone it feels pointless and hollow. I struggled to find motivation to keep playing even for one day, where before these games have lasted me for months. I tried other campaigns as well as the historical battles and was met with more of the same, easy, mindless victories.

I could see potentially how this could be a good starting point for people looking to get into strategy games or the Total War series because it does a great job of holding your hand and leading you down the path to victory, but for those who want a challenge I cannot recommend this game. The victory of a Total War game rests on the knowledge of the struggle you went through to get there, and this game takes out the struggle. It delt me a pair of aces, and as I watched the dealer some how turn over 5 more aces, I couldn't feel accomplished or proud of myself when none of my opponents could beat the hand I'd done nothing to win.",1467090094,1467133953,False,21,2,0.544881939888000488,0,True,False,False,76561198025350355,212,17,746,0,746,1467337271

+ Huge variety of historical units and regiments, like the Old Guard or the Blackwatch.
+ Awesome Combat 
+ Great balance overall between units and unit types, Cavalry can kill light infantry easily, but line infantry kills cavalry and so on.
+ Alot of Nations to pick from, who all bring different units and ""focuses"" to the table (for example: Russia has very good melee stats)
+ The maps are very big and dont feel too clumbed up like in newer titles. 
+ Most Maps provide a variety of strategy you can use
+ Siege Battles feel great and pretty balanced, which is hard to do

- Minor Nations (Like the Dutch or Denmark) dont have alot of unit variety and their units are practically worse than the units of big nations in every department
- Some maps encourage camping due to 2-3 choke points that have to be pushed through
- Artillery has infinite ammo
- Most Players dont allow Artillery which leads to constant camping/skirmishing fights

Since my bonny light horseman to the wars he did go
Broken hearted I'll wander, broken hearted I'll remain
Since my bonny light horseman in the wars he was slain

When Boney commanded his armies to stand
And proud lift his banners all gayly and grand
He levelled his cannons right over the plain
And my bonny light horseman in the wars he was slain

Oh, Napoleon Bonaparte, you're the cause of my woe
Since my bonny light horseman to the wars he did go
Broken hearted I'll wander, broken hearted I'll remain
Since my bonny light horseman in the wars he was slain

And if I was some small bird and had wings and could fly
I would fly over the salt sea where my true love does lie
Three years and six months now, since he left this bright shore
Oh, my bonny light horseman will I never see you more?

Oh, Napoleon Bonaparte, you're the cause of my woe
Since my bonny light horseman to the wars he did go
Broken hearted I'll wander, broken hearted I'll remain
Since my bonny light horseman in the wars he was slain

And the dove she laments for her mate as she flies
""Oh, where, tell me where is my true love?"" she sighs
""And where in this wide world is there one to compare
With my bonny light horseman who was killed in the war?""

Oh, Napoleon Bonaparte, you're the cause of my woe
Since my bonny light horseman to the wars he did go
Broken hearted I'll wander, broken hearted I'll remain

game's unplayable vanilla because of crap ai, weak sound FX and balancing issues. usually CA is happy to leave it to the modding community to fix their games they've always been fine with it in the past; seems they were determined not to let that happen in NTW though. even with mods its unplayable because of the stupid voice bugs CA has boobytrapped it with.

Things I liked: 

I like the individual city based approach as opposed to the newer 3 cities in a province approach.

I'm a fan of the Napoleonic era, and have played many strategic boardgames set in this timeframe.   This game has a similar feel to Empires in Arms, and other strategic Napoleon era games.

I like the cav vs. artillery, infantry vs. cav, artillery vs. infantry matchups.

AI for all computer games is somewhat suspect.  This AI is ok on defense, but lacking on offense.  For best results, the player should be on offense and the computer AI on defense.

The objectives and victory conditions are good.

Technology tree is ok, but nothing special.

I've played several campaigns: Egypt, Italian, and Grand Campaign (1805-1812, both Napoleon or an allied power (UK, Russian, etc.).  My preference is the grand campaign because of diplomacy, trade, technology, etc., but the other campaigns are also pretty good.

Ingredients: 
1 cup digestive plain sweet biscuit crumbs
3 tablespoons sugar
3 tablespoons melted butter
40 ounces softened cream cheese
1 cup sugar
3 tablespoons flour
1 tablespoon vanilla
1 cup sour cream
4 eggs

Directions:
For The base:.
If you're using a dark pan, preheat the oven to 350. If you are using a shiny pan, 375.
Combine the crumbs, melted butter and 3 tbsp sugar well and pat onto the bottom of a 9 inch springform pan. I also like to very very lightly butter the sides of the pan so that the cheesecake will not stick later on.
Bake for 10 mins in your preheated oven and remove. Let it cool while you prepare your batter.
For the batter:.
Make sure everything is at room temperature.
Combine sugar, cheese, flour and vanilla in a big bowl and mix on medium speed till well combined. Don't forget to scrape the bowl as you're doing this.
Mix in the sour cream till its incorporated well. Then, add the eggs one by one, mixing well after each addition.
Pour the batter into the springform and let it bake for 1 hour and 10 minutes After the baking time, turn off the oven and leave the door ajar. Let the cake cool in there for about 1 1/2 hours.
Remove the cake and let it cool thoroughly. Refrigerate overnight.

I Understand people don't like overly long description of how people cream for their games so I made a quick pro and con list.

Pros 
- Good challenge on the higher levels, the AI will make good decisions about army composition and will punish you for mistakes
- Still very decent graphics, you won't really be feel how old it is
- vast improvement on Empire but still in the same enjoyable time period

Cons
- some features that were kept from Empire have been so reduced they don't seem worth including such as the ability to manage your Ministers, they hardly ever come with any good buffs so it is basically getting rid of the most shit ones and then hoping they don't die and get replaced.
- Would have liked to be able to play as minor factions such as Denmark as you can currently only play as Great Britain, Prussia, Russia, Austria and of course France in the main campaign.

Other points - The Peninsular Campaign adds a great campaign to play as and will add hours of enjoyment.

13,22010911,english,"Napoleon: Total War is fundamentally a very enjoying RTS game. I only have two big gripes with Napoleon. The first gripe is that - much like Empire - the textures on units and structures are shockingly low res, even when set to high. Not that it ruins the game, but it's offputting how grainy it can look when zoomed right in. In Shogun, this wasn't as big of an issue. My second gripe is that the offline campaign - which is honestly about the same as that of any other Total War game - focuses strictly on Napoleon Bonaparte's real-world campaign. This shouldn't be a shock, since the game's called fucking Napoleon, but it would be AMAZING if this game had the same huge campaign map that Empire did. The time period could have also been a little big bigger - but again, it was to accomodate Bonaparte's epoch, so I get it.

I grabbed some DLC for this when they were 0.50$ a piece during the Sega sale, and I really enjoyed the addition of some historical units for all countries. Especially the UK units! Total War has a good example of how to do DLC right - some neat additions that don't make the game better or worse, for a reasonable price. All the DLC does is add some historically accurate units, so really it's just for the sake of eyecandy and to please history buffs.

The combat also feels mechanically better than it does in Empire. Not much to say about it, but it feels better. Pretty much all there is to it.

34,21796378,english,"I grabbed Napoleon Total War on a sale years ago for reasons I cannot really remember. Maybe I had been playing Shogun 2 and enjoying that, and thought it would be a good idea to throw money at Creative Assembly.

Napoleon has the same two layers of war that all the Total War titles do. You've got your Campaign Map strategic layer where you recruit troops, upgrade settlements, research technology, partake in diplomacy, and move your armies around conquering, retreating, or what not. Then you've got your Battles (when two armies meet on the map) which plays like a slow paced RTS where positioning and unit composition mean the difference between victory or defeat. I enjoy both layers of the game on their own, and put together they make this franchise. It works pretty well here as it does in all Total War games.

Empire Total War was very buggy for my then-computer and I didn't really enjoy that style of warfare, so I went into Napoleon Total War with low expectations. It grew on me pretty fast. I still question some of the game design decisions. Select your infantry unit, right click to attack an enemy unit like any other RTS? No. They'll be inefficient and terrible. Napoleonic warfare seems to be a lot about forming big lines and just sitting there, and on a lot of battles you do just sit there and watch your vast lines of troops slowly slaughter vast lines of enemy troops.

Napoleon Total War feels like polished Empire Total War, and now that it's several years old I had the pleasure of playing through the game on maximum settings and resolution while maintaining a framerate above 60 at all times (usually above 100). It was not without technical issues. I experienced several Crash to Desktop errors in the Italian and Egyptian campaigns, but none in the European campaign. In battle, there were occasionally weird white-square graphical glitches that would flash across the screen. The campaign map had a few weird audio beeping glitches. At this point, assume there will be no patches for this game, so know you may be getting into some of that.

As someone chronically bad at RTS, though, I found ways to enjoy this. I would always try to field 3-4 units of cavalry, and while my line infantry sat there awaiting battle in guard mode, I made my own fun micromanaging a few cavalry units to harass enemy artillery, lone cavalry, or generals. By the time I had to pull my exhausted cavalry back, battle would begin, and I could often micromanage my artillery or tighten infantry lines. 

I enjoyed the historical approach to the campaigns. The tutorial campaign teaches you a bit about Napoleon's life while learning how to play the game. Each successive campaign after that is slightly larger, unlocks more of the game's complexity, and follows Napoleon's historic conquests. The Italian campaign only has a few factions and is landlocked on a small map, with no diplomacy or technology research. You learn to fight and do some basic economic management. Beat that and you're off to Egypt, where they introduce naval battles, technology research, and a medium-sized map. Finally, you take on the European campaign which is often called the ""Grand Campaign"" in the other Total War titles. Europe (and parts of Eurasia) are rendered on a huge campaign map with plenty of factions. I enjoyed the steady increase in difficulty and complexity. If I had dove right into the Europe campaign I would have done terrible, but after beating Italy and Egypt, I felt ""ready"" for Europe. Good design.

I never enjoyed the naval battles much. My own ship AI seemed terrible, requiring massive micromanagement. Any more than a few ships was beyond my effective control, so I ended up building huge navies and autoresolving those conflicts.

This part of history still isn't my favourite, and I have a few other Total War games to play in my preferred more ancient settings. But if you're into Napoleonic warfare, this was a surprisingly good game to immerse yourself into. Of course, it is very similar to Empire Total War, which has a more global feel, and in terms of scope that might take the cake. But if you're happy becoming Supreme Emperor of Europe, this is quality game.",1457808708,1457808708,True,8,0,0.631386637687683105,4,True,False,False,76561197977690701,624,39,1887,0,1887,1457807145

But if you are looking to start playing multiplayer I absolutely could not recommend this game unless you plan to play it with some friends. I say this because in the 9 hours I have tried the multiplayer I have only played THREE battles. And that isn't because there is a lack of games being started it is because a good portion of the bastards hosting them have an ungodly hatred for players who have a one-star ranking which means people who have just bought the game have extreme trouble finding good matches and when they do people don't want to be on a team with a one-star because they think ""Oh God he is a one-star I am going to lose if I team up with him"" and then the game ends up with either a bunch of one-stars vs veterans at the game or other players begging the host to kick the one-star because they want more experienced players on.

The first game I played was 3 one-stars vs 3 5 stars we lost of course, then the second game no one wanted to be on my side so the host gave me an AI ally, finally my third game was the ONLY game where players greater than one-star were on the same team as me, it was a great experience.

So unless you have a friend who you can boost your stars with I would not get this game for the multiplayer as it takes a great deal of blood, sweat, and tears before you can find a single decent host. I unfortunately do not have such a friend.

I assume the multiplayer could be good if you boosted your rank.

70,21207177,english,"The artillery is a joke. They fire into the ground if you have a bad position and are completly useless then. The only real important upgrades in the game are for the artillery which you get very late, if you have it, you can do long range luck shots and kill hundred of units with 1 shot. Usually it only kills 1 or 2 with a long range luck shot. At short range you can do better luck shots with more kills and fear effects.

There is friendly fire on. If you place a group of units behind yours and let them fire you kill your own units. This is a kind of the battle system, which is pretty ok. Its your job to make as long as possible lines to have the biggest damage as possible. You can also try to surround your opponent if you have more units and make your opponents units running by fear of the upperhand of the opponent.

The building system is a joke. The buildings are too expensiv and too less worth. Usually you only need a training camp.

The cavalery is senseless, because they are weaker than the infantry and the infantry can furthermore their strength against cavalery by using a other formation, which is fast done and has only a small disadvantage by less fire power, because of the smaller line. Against the ai its just overpowered.

There are 4 kinds of infantrys. 
The simple infantry (militia or peasants) which has less fire power and cant use anti cavalery formation. 
The regular infantry which has good fire power.
The mortar infantry which has good fire power and a useless skill to make 1 time a good damage in short range.
The sniper infantry which has good fire power and a slightly higher range but have less units per group and are only good against players, because they run automatically as soon as the regular infantry come too close.

The Ai is a joke, the only thing they do is to spawn units for free from nowhere cheating like. They will attack just in a few situations, but never real. The ai isnt able to defeat you, because it never try to conquer, except in specific events. For example, if you conquer Paris the ai start to get units for free from nowhere in a other town next to you and in 3 turns they will spawn and move to Paris to conquer it back.

The combat mechanics are well done, even if the AI is a little lacking. The map is great, not to big, not too small. The period is fun. The combat animations are still very well made, even 5 years after realease. This is the first total war that naval comabt really comes into its own.

The game just works compared to the latest renditions. I recommend this game, especially if you are new to the total war series, or want to give a very cool ""history simulator/action strategy"" as a gift.",1451909332,1451909332,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561197968988680,139,4,6155,0,3616.0,1587173582

What I do not love, is the community.

About 40 hours of my time has been sunk into the first 3 campaign's of Napoleon, the rest are online. The first 30 hours-ish of online were superb, friendly people ready to decimate each other's armies with grand batteries or unicorns (haha). 

Anything after that has unfortunately, for the most part atleast, been an utter waste of time, due to ""ah nah m8 u ent gt 5 starz so u ent pleyin bruh"", or the ""lets play lets play lets play....... OH EM GEE i sed no ARTILLERIIE"" .... or finally, and the WORST of all....... ""host has left the game"", which happens as soon as they realise you have the upper hand. 

weird people in the world say gaming is a waste of time, a lot of the community in this game help prove that point.

This is a pretty good game. It is basically Empire Total War with a few changes. It runs and plays well. I like the soundtrack in this game.

There are not as many small kingdoms as in Empire Total War. Battles tend to be large. Both of these things can be positive although I like having many smaller kingdoms on the map. Of course a long Empire Total War game has fwe remaining kingdoms late in the game and most are rather large.

This is an excellent time peroid for warfare. Artillery, Cavalry and Infantry are all useful on the battlefield. There are many cool units during this time period.

63,19272248,english,"empire has some better mods, but imo this is the best vanilla total war game out there (altho i did play it the first time and quit and came back later as i was used to previous games and it took me a bit to adapt).   Typical medival type tw games have a kind of rock paper scissor type mechanic representing foot troops, archers and cavalry (and a bit of crappy artillery but historically those were only good for seige anyways).  But in napoleon you have have gun powder and that changes alot as far as unit diversity.  You now have troops good at various ranges as well as some taht are melee intensive (or mixed), some that are skirmishers, grenade specialists etc etc.  Artillery is pivotal to battles and have various impressive types and even ammunition choices that are far superior to the other games and time periods.

Cavalry can still do terrific amounts of damage, but seem to only be good for a few charges even if successful and many infantry units if prepared can go into specific stances and blunt them even further so cavalry arent the overwhelming save you from anything units they have been in the past (but still really good but expensive).  Use of terrain imo is superior as well, but you dont really see much use of forts or seiges unfortunatly and generally just fight over urban areas for towns.

And as far as the world map, imo this is also tw's height of gameplay for the series.  They include cities similiar to the other games, but you get better use of outlaying towns and rural areas that you get to play around and get more freedom with your choices then the other games.  Overall this one is my favorite game in the total war dynasty.

oh and for dlc: the penisular is sweet and worth it, but the others are just unit packs and dont really add much to the game.  The ai cant use them so you cant even play against them and they werent really balanced with the original units very well imo (too powerful).",1448483966,1448484362,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198005577371,297,54,11031,0,9689.0,1469649527

-Offers multiple Campaign Scenario Options

Con's
-Lacks a polishing to the controls
-Random crashing issues
-Boring AI
-Boring Battles
-Want to play EmpireTW instead

72,19125324,english,"As much as I want to recommend this game, it just isn't as worth it as it is for Empire, Medieval II and the other Total War games, and I will explain why.

Firstly, the theatre of war.

Sadly, this game is LOCKED to the European theatre of war. I mean, yeah, it's Napoleonic Wars, not like it happened in South America, but it would've been interesting to have, oh, I don't know, NORTH AFRICA? MORE OTTOMAN LANDS? Seriously, it isn't that hard, CA.

Secondly, the lack of diversity.

I mean, sure, it's 19th century warfare. Line infantry, light infantry, horsemen, all that shit. But it would've been nice if there were atleast some diversity. I mean, a faction like France or the Ottoman Empire will be very diverse as they are very unique, but you didn't have to copy paste faction units to factions YOU CANT EVEN PLAY ON CAMPAIGN without NTF, which brings us to the third factor.

Thirdly, you can only play as Austria, Great Britain, Prussia and Russia early game(excluding Napoleon's campaigns which are actually okay)? WHAT? WHY? Why can't I play as the Ottomans? Why can't I play as Sweden? I mean, I like the emergent factions thing. That's awesome. But, why only 4 factions?

Now don't get me wrong, there are a lot of awesome features in this game which makes me want to give this a great review so badly, but I just don't want to lie with myself. Sorry.

In conclusion, this game deserves a 5.4/10 personally. Slightly above average.

Sure, there was 'MURICA but I still felt like it was more based on small armies and capturing cities, rather than the big-army based Napoleon. Napoleon, as said, has much better battles in campaign in my opinion, and the afformentioned factions that bugged me in Empire are pretty individual in Napoleon (Especially with the unit add-ons).

However, this single player experience is enhanced by historical campains which should satisfy the campain focused total war player.

NTW also has many single player historical battles which are also good.

Where NTW really shines is multiplayer. It is the most balanced and enjoyable multiplayer of all the series. Because I am a primarily multiplayer focused TW player, this simply makes NTW my favorite of the series. This superiority in multiplayer gameplay is expecially noticible due to the lackluster multiplayers of recent titles.

So, in conclusion, if you are looking to fight epic battles in the napoleonic period agaist other players, look no farther than NTW. However if you are looking for a great TW campain, I would suggest another title.

Could be good if it was not for migraine inducing sound bugs, regular crashes to desktop, very very odd unit bugs (like sometime the battle won't end because there is a enemy unit that has no banner, can't be attacked and will not move. Joy!) and my favorite thing of them all: when sometimes a country decides to split there armies up into individual units for no reason other then to make their turn take forever and any battles with them a long line of single units slowly getting killed.

I would give it a thumbs up if it was not for the fact that when you look up possible fixes for these bugs you only get ""what bugs?"", ""its common sense this will be fixed first patch"" (dated 5 years ago) or a list of bugs and no fixes.

76,17265210,english,"After buying this on a Steam Summer sale a couple of years ago, I finally have a PC that can handle the unit numbers that some of the mods like Darthmod produces. I used to auto-resolve combat because I was concerened about getting pwned by hard AI. Not so anymore. Putting in the time to understand the battlespace and what I can do with my ranks in most circumstances has given me the confidence to face off armies almost twice the size of mine and still survive (and on Hard Battle settings). Finally I feel I'm getting the value out of this great title that thought was lacking a few years back. 
I've watched Oakley's THFE youtube channel and the one thing I have taken from his expertise is the finessing of your units. Subtlety in placement and timing. These factors are just as important as the skill and moral of your men. 

The finer aspects of the campaign game are still a work in progress for me, as I'm not an accountant, though you don't really need to be to succeed. However accounting for cashflows when stretching multiple armies across the map is vital. Getting spys ahead of your armies to gater intelligence can save you the heartache of being double-teamed by opposing armies! 

I currently have a GTX970 and have the graphics cranked right up to ultra all around. I've upscaled my resolution to 1.5 native, reducing the interface just enough to be out of the way and still useable.

17,16667912,english,"The early vanilla version of this game was pretty good, but limited in many ways: a very predictable AI opponent, limited number of playable factions, minimal battlefield music and sounds, relatively small field 'armies' (max 20 units, usually with a few thousand men total); this is barely a brigade in the actual Napoleonic Wars. Yes, the initial version of this game showed a game with a solid foundation, but unrealized potential for such a fascinating period in history; full of pagentry and spectical, when hundreds of thousands of men clashed on huge battlefields dressed in colorful uniforms with gloriously ornate flags, batteries of thundering cannon and thousands upon thousands of clattering muskets. The designers missed an opportunity to really do something great. Then they failed to developed the uniform editor they had promised for the game and that didn't help. They just didn't seem to want to go the extra mile. I liked the game but was a little dissapointed, even with the DLC they added later.

Then I discovered a mod for this game called 'DARTHMOD NAPOLEON v2.6 Epic Edition' and quickly realized this game's potential. Darth Vader (the mod's author), teamed up with a group of similarly talented modders and buffed this game up into something special. They vastly improved the battle sounds, music, unit flag details, battle smoke, etc. They added so much detail that it was like a new game altogether. You can also play the game now as almost any nation state of the Napoleonic Age, which enhances replayability enormously. Want to try building an empire with Ireland, do it. Like to try conquering Europe with little Portugal or the Duchy of Warsaw (Poland), sure. It's harder with these small factions, but it can be done; and with a smaller faction it's a real challenge. This mod also allows 40 unit max armies and 30 unit max fleets for many of the major nations, making for huge battles on land and at sea, and the units can have as many as 500 men in them; so a land army with this mod can often contain 12,000 to 15,000 men. On the new scale, with all the aforementioned visual and audial improvements, the battles become like interactive movies; they are a joy to simply watch, let alone get actively involved in. One warning though: you will be very busy trying to control such a large army. After a big battle you will likely feel a bit worn out, and you will be wearing out the pause button during the battles, both for your army's survival and a means of taking a break from the action just to appreciate the amazing beauty of whats going on before your eyes. It's really quite astounding. You pan in and hear men muttering in the ranks, horses neighing, orders being given in the units and so on. The sea battles are just a spectacular and just as labor intensive (but worth it).

Yes, even with DARTHMOD NAPOLEON, the AI could be better, but the rock-paper-scisors tactics of Napoleonic warfare are alive and well. Charge a well formed infantry square with cavalry, bad idea. Let your infantry stay in line when cavalry charges, bad idea. Form infantry square within range of artillery (especially cannister), bad idea. Leave your cannon batteries without infantry or cavalry support to protect them, especially from enemy cavalry, bad idea, and so on... The one main problem I have with game play is the morale model, especially for the French and for cavalry units in particular. I often see units almost die to the last man that should have long ago fled the field. A batallion of 360 men with 20 or 30 left should be long gone, and certainly should not have 'steady' morale. Still, I can overlook this issue and the others that are less severe, because they are so greatly outweighed by the good points of the game. 

I have come back to this game over and over for the last few years (8,000 hours plus listed but probably about 1,200 to 1,500 or so actual, when you exclude the time the game was in the Strategy Map planning mode or paused in tactical mode). There is really no other game like it for the Napoleonic era, and the entertainment value and unbelievable replayability (with Darthmod installed) are amazing.

If you like Napoleonic Wargames with spectacular, realistic battles, rolling drums, booming cannon, thundering cavalry charges, shattering musketry, beautiful, fluttering flags and a smoke enshrouded battlefield, you'll love this game.",1435122886,1435242931,True,87,4,0.849783957004547119,10,True,False,False,76561198007213063,68,3,681493,0,504756,1598933577

I feel as though the series really hit its stride with Napoleon (though Shogun 2 reigns as best in the series). Improves upon Empire in many ways, with solid, engaging campaign and a great multiplayer. Bonus fun if you are a fan of the era, Sharpe, Waterloo, etc. Battles are as beautiful as ever.

Many would argue that this is just an expansion pack for Empire, and they might have a point, but considering that TW expanisions are often pricey enough, I'll take this as a stand alone. Battle AI is improved but still not especially good (strangely still better than  Rome 2, which i found dreadful)

My only girpe is that some of the unit abilities just don't work at all. The diamond formation for cavalry and the bomb mode for grenadiers come to mind. It just seems like broken code. I was expecting them to be updated in a patch but so far, they remain ususeable. This makes the grenadier units pretty useless overall which is a shame.

The game is in Europe during Boneparte's (Bonerpartes as I call him) reign. So unlike Empire, there is only Europe in the campaign. And, being an an American, that sucks a little. But I'm still interested in Britan. Anyway, the game takes away fire by rank also. Another minor issue is the graphics for soldiers faces are a little off.

11,15272722,english,"Pros: The attention to detail and history of the time period is very well done. The scope seems to be less than some of the other big RTS games, but that will be a plus for people getting their feet wet in the genre. There are a decent amount of variety in the units, and specifically, learning how to use the buffs from the general units is very satisfying. The protectorate system is a nice addition on the surface, but could have been fleshed out more (see below). The minor towns are a nice touch, and since not everything is centralized in the major cities, it makes for some fun times attacking and defending the country side.

Cons: A couple of cons, not many, but these two are pretty aggeravting. The AI is horrendous. In my recent playthrough as Russia, I have had to pretty much conquer France and Spain single handly while Prussia and Austria move 2 units around aimlessly. And then I had a French army walk, unattacked mind you, through all of Prussia and Austria, take none of their cities and then attack my lightly defended homeland. Thanks devs. Way to break my emersion.

Napoleon is huge improvement from Empire, essentially, the battles are now more naturally paced and feel very player influenced. Artillery is the biggest asset in the game, using the battle of Arcole for example, holding a bridge and firing at it with canister shot is often the deal breaker. 

Cavalry takes a backseat to Artillery, but its still effective, dragging heavily armored mounted units through light infantry will destroy them. Infantry is the last in importance, however; line infantry is more durable, but less spammable as they lack the range to attack longer ranged infantry blocks effectively.

Essentially, the best part of each battle in the later stages, because your going to lack fully stocked infantry. Your going to find that victory is often due to tactical play, rather than spamming line infantry and rushing people down.

- Unicorns.  NO WAIT, I LOVE UNICORNS!  MUST BE A PRO! 10/10!

- Rules have to be spoken in chat.  Take a hint from Civ 5 and add a rules creation page that can disable things like artillery and limit the number of light units.

- Having to choose the way I want my units to line up.  I don't want to click double-line standard every freakin time just to have my men line up straight.  You know what im trying to do when I drag them.  Don't piss me off again.

It also allows you to recreate and play historical battles, such as Waterloo and The Battle Of Austerlitz. Where the game already have made some of them, but not them all! 
The game have all the real world tactics and strategy from the age you are in. At the same time the uniforms, models, weapons, maps/battlegrounds, horses, forts, hats and leaders. 
But if the game are going to get five stars or more, it must have Multiplayer and Online Comunity, and it is what has. So good news from here, and some bad info about the game,  but i wan't talk about that.

Additionally, the weapons, units, and technologies that correspond to early 19th century provides the player with the ability to use unique strategies. The only complaint I may have is the lack of building diversity during battles. The battles eventually become a bit monotonous when almost every single city and battlefield looks the same.

1/8 teaspoon freshly ground nutmeg
2 large eggs, at room temperature
1 1/4 cups milk, at room temperature
1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
3 tablespoons unsalted butter, plus more as needed

Now to make it
1. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and nutmeg.
2. In another bowl, beat the eggs and then whisk in the milk and vanilla.
3. Melt the butter in a large cast iron skillet or griddle over medium heat.
4. Whisk the butter into the milk mixture. Add the wet ingredients to the flour mixture, and whisk until a thick batter is just formed
5. Keeping the skillet at medium heat, ladle about 1/4 cup of the batter onto the skillet, to make a pancake. Make 1 or 2 more pancakes, taking care to keep them evenly spaced apart. Cook, until bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, and the undersides are golden brown, about 2 minutes. Flip with a spatula and cook about 1 minute more on the second side. Serve immediately or transfer to a platter and cover loosely with foil to keep warm. Repeat with the remaining batter, adding more butter to the skillet as needed.
6. Procedure for adding fruit to pancakes: Once the bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, scatter the surface with sliced or diced fruit, or chocolate chips, nuts, etc. Flip with a spatula and cook for 1 minute more, being careful not to burn toppings.

-Amazing unit control
-Great realistic gunshots/reloading
-Unit selection is HUGE as well as elite units
-Good selection of factions
-Maps are pretty decent
-Graphically pleasing
-Better melee combat details than Empire
-Uniforms more detailed
-Great ""historical battle"" scenarios

Cons:
-Cavalry control is a bit whacky at times
-Not as many maps as I would expect (compared to other Total War games)
-Some overpowered factions are better than others (Great Britain, France, Prussia, in that order)

I love the vast selections of nations, maps and troops that you can choose from for a different and entirely unique experience each time you play. I recommend this to anyone who loves strategy games as this game simulates the fantastic strategies and formations of the early 19th century.

The audio is captivating and the visuals, even on medium to low graphic settings are mind-blowing. This game features  entirely accurate maps of europe, africa and asia in stunning detail with hundreds of towns, cities, and universities dotted across the map. Battles run smoothly and are extremely enjoyable as well, featruing weather and much much more to influence the fight. Naval battles are a vast improvement from Empire as well.

The government system in this game is revolutionary. There are revolutions, parties, ministers with unique traits and much more. Generals also have a drastic effect on the game. Each general has a set of traits and followers that can change over time. Each trait or follower effects the general and his army. 

Many Total War Games require mods to enjoy, however Napoleon for as old as it is, is one of the few Total War titles that can be run without mods. I feel Napoleon total war is great value for money.

78,4374735,english,"At first glance the game seem's like a massive patched version of Empire Total War, however there is more than meets the eye with this game. Overall it's a net positive for me, now is it  better than Empire? Well... yes however thats not saying much, now as Empire was a fun game to play and was even a legendary game with the Darth Mod, its launch was a complete disaster. As I understand the warscape engine which is the engine used for the Total War games from Empire all the way to the upcoming Attila Total War, is beautiful to look at,  however the collison of the units and the bugginess of the orders being ignored makes the engine much to be desired. Now onto Napoleon, if you're a history buff like myself and also a person who enjoys grand stradegy games, then you should pick the full edition of this up. Now I'm speaking of this post patch, I did not have to suffer the extraneous amount of glitches this game damned amongst many of its early adopters. Now to start with the negatives, the game has rarely crashed on me, only about five times that I can count, and thats from sixty total hours of play, thats pretty good from a total war game after Empire, sad to say. Also there seems to be a sound glitch after exiting battles and onto the campaign map, however if you hover the camera away from the sorce of the glitched sound, it should remedy that. Other than that I havent really encountered any game breaking bugs worth mentioning. Now onto the positives I will first start with the setting. The Napoleonic Wars could have arguably been considered the actual first WORLD WAR, just on its scale alone, this mixed with its asthetic makes this a great setting for a total war game. You can play as the coalition powers that have rallied against France and stop Napoleon or you can play as Napoleon in the games story mode which is split into his major campaigns from his birthplace on the tiny island of Corsica to the gates of Moscow, and of course to his demise at Waterloo. The campaign maps are Egypt and the southern Levant, Northern Italy, and finally the whole of Europe. The battles themselves have the same bland muzzle loader sounds from Empire, however the soundtrack sounds much more epic than Empires. Also the user interface doesnt lag like it did in Empire. One more thing to note is that unit variety is seems to cover all the major and obscure units of the Napoleonic Wars. Overall this is a fun game which takes place in a period  of time and focuses on a great man that is sadly overlooked in video games. This is truly the best simulator for the Napoleonic Wars that I've encountered thus far and is a fine addition to the total war series. This game is a definate recommendation.",1366160590,1416816394,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198036144388,122,7,3649,0,2510,1590291502

It's computer generated, shitty, and is generally nowhere close to music of the period. The AI as exprcted in all games litterally accidentally walks into your lines with total disregard for any bullets flying into the from any direction. The map is downsized from that of Empire and many of Empire's good qualities are gone. I can most definitely say that this isnt one of my favorite Total War games. It seriously needs revision as well as bug fixes such as the bug where the AI units stand in place and turn from side to side over and over for about half a minute.

 One downside is that the Grand Campaign isn't 'Grand' enough, at least compared to Empire, although you instead get several mini-campaigns.

It is a clone of Empire with some changes. Those changes don't affect the core gameplay. I would be fine with the game if was essentially an expansion pack, but there are so many glitches, some which can cost you a battle. Let me name a few:
-units will stop responding. In one instance, I had an enemy cavalry regiment bearing down on an artillery group. I ordered the artillery to fire stop firing at enemy infantry and target the cavalry. The artillery stopped firing. They weren't reloading, they weren't doing anything, they just stopped. This happens so often with horse artillery (the really fast artillery pieces) I don't even use them.
-Units will sometimes do the opposite of what I tell them. On a number of occasions, I ordered an infantry regiment to charge an enemy. The regiment was at full strength, yet it started running the opposite direction for no reason. I kept ordering it to attack the enemy but this did nothing. The regiment had not broken or shattered, it just ran away for no reason.
-ordering grenadiers to throw grenades rarely works
-a wall was about to be destroyed on my fort so I ordered my regiment to the center of the fort. While it was in the middle of the fort, everyone in that regiment dropped dead the second the wall was destroyed even though they were no where near the wall. This frequently happens.

I've played every TW game through Medieval 2 before taking a break to start working and have a couple of kids. Now that they aren't infants anymore and I can afford a decent rig (iMac 3.2 GHz Intel Core i5 w/ 8GB 1600MHz DDR3 w/Flash Fusion Drive) I've begun playing again. I skipped Empire TW b/c I've always been interested in Napoleon and since I've played >80 hrs and completed all of the main campiagns I thought I'd share my thoughts.

Technically the game runs and looks great on my Mac. I've only crashed to desktop ~3 times which is actually good for this franchise. The graphics, mucis, and sound are definitely a step up from the sprites and rendering of Rome TW but not drastically different from Medieval 2 (I downloaded but have yet to fire up Shogun 2). I have experienced an annoying sound effects glitch when leaving battles that is a quickly repeating monotone beeping. However I turn off sound effects and turn then on again when entering a battle and it goes away.

The play is entertaining as this is my first experiencing with armies composed mainly of rifles and cannons. I have to say that the action is very exciting and the boom of cannon fire and retort of muskets is really thrilling. That said I feel the game suffers from the same problems other TW games have after the studio was purchased by Sega. It does give me the feeling that they are ramming out titles with little in the way of improvements. Great graphics and modest content. For instance, I completed the main campaign rather quickly without need for much technological advancement, investment in infrastructure, or diplomacy.

That said, if you enjoy Total War games, Napoleon: TW has a lot to offer (and I've just begun messing around in the DLC campaigns). The battles are exciting and the game still offers a mix of strategy and tactics that few other titles offer. I've been a fan of Total War from the start and Napoleon has enough to keep me excited, but perhaps wanting more.",1414632910,1414632910,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561197962674268,62,2,7481,0,5379,1476342391

38,12298912,english,"Don't waste your time with this one, the artificial intelligence is ridiculous.  The battle simulator allows the AI units to exceed unit capabilities such as using formations that are not available to the player (moving infantry in a skirmish cloud, refusing its line and firing in multiple directions), sustaining 75 - 90% casualties without routing (units ought to rout after 20-30%), artillery shooting through its own units with no friendly fire damage but will use your artillery to kill your men unless you control every aim point.  It's kinf of like the AI doesn't like losing and cheats to gain an advantage.  Allowing the AI to autoresolve battles is even worse, the player almost never wins even with clear material superiority, if you do win the attrition is so high your army is useless afterwards.  

On a strategic level the AI is also rigging the game, allowing pissant countries that have inadequate funding to field multiple armies it can't afford.  The AI will cause friendly or neutral countries to declare war for no apparent reason.  If you conquer a country and a rebellion occurs you wind up facing two or three whole armies of top line troops, just an absurdity.  

The game has potential but the idiot designers have made this AI function in a ridiculous fashion rendering the game experience maddening.  If the game used superior strategy and tactics to present a challenge to the player that would be fine, but giving itself unfair advantages because it controls everything makes the game experience unrealistic.

NTW setting is in Europe, during the Napoleonic Wars. Sadly, it is strictly only Europe, which makes the campaign lack variety, even North Africa, or Turkey would be nice. Anyway, The main factions are, France, Britain, Austria, Russia, and Prussia. All of these factions have advantages and dis-advantages, which I will get onto later.


The actual Gameplay in NTW is outstanding, with the traditional TW engine, mixed with Muskets, and Line formation warfare, makes for hours upon hours on entertainment, not to mention the Campaigns, and multiplayer.


But, my favorite aspect of NTW is the multiplayer battles, more then any aspect.

I have hours upon hours with my friends, fighting Public players, as we used outstanding teamwork, when outmatched and numbered, It is just a blast, I do not know how to explain the Multiplayer in a review.


I would go more into the gameplay, but there is Youtube Videos, and screen shots for that.

91,11773071,english,"Napoleon Total War, a great game. It reminds me of Realism, and the hardingship of war. Now Napoleon may be hated because its lack of more explore of other Theatres of War. It'd would of been great if they added More Regions to the World like the map on Empire's Europe but more detailed with more Regions. Also the war did take place in India too. So that'd be great as well. But by far. Napoleon Shows you the realism of war. Which makes it hard. Like Great Britain's Campaign, You have Gilibratar 
And you must defend it from the Hostile-Agressive Spanish. But you can also get Portugal to join in the war if you through acouple of thousends of Shillings in Portugals Face, If you know what I mean, Ya you know what I mean. But Napoleon by far has a great Battle Features, That should of been in Empire. All though Napoleon Total War doesn't nearly show the Factions of Empire. But thats no Problem. Download Darthmod. A great mod Which gives you lots of abillites. Which Napoleon Should of Had. But Again, if you can't download mods Then Still play the game, Its still great! 

==========
Naval Combat
==========

    Ok, from 2010. Empire introduced a New Feature to the Total War Series, ""Naval Combat"" Which before it was basicly of a Auto battle. But now its brought to full Feature. Napoleon Brings the realism of Naval Warfare. Which Many new Featrues but alot are old but still clean. Napoleon does also have a Graphic Advancement. So if your a person with no taste in Bad quallity again Napoleon Is your game.  Also. The Battles make you feel like your a Admiral or a General. Leading and deciding were to attack. Every little move you do make effect a problem or a salution to a couple turns in the future. So Be careful. Picking fights with abunch of Countries could lead to Bank rupting on Military upkeep, Or parishing under another Leader's Flag.

=========
Land Battles
=========

  Now Have you always wanted to be leading a Siege or a attack on a Open Field. Now Empire/Napoleon Is your game. On Napoleon a whole new and better Engine is used. Which allows you to easier finding of troops and eaiser to see instead of have a big box blocking 1/4 of your Screen. Now With Epic Sounds you can hear the Crackle of a VOlley, You can hear the Drum and Flutes of a Regiment. Makes you feel of so realism it over flows. This is the First time a Total War game follows a Person not a Time of History. But it does take place of the whole Napoleonic Wars, Though Really Napoleonic Total War sounds  abit weird. So Napoleon Total Fits.

The gameplay In Napoleon is much more streamline and easy to use, both during battles and the campaign map. A large difference between Empire and Napoleon is the size of the campaign map. In the Empire campaign there are three different areas including the Americas, India, and Europe. This large scale makes the campaign as a whole more fulfilling although it is more difficult than the Napoleon campaign. In Napoleon the map is only europe and you are severely limited to what countries you can play as. Despite the small size, I have played and replayed the campaign again and again thanks to the immersive gameplay.

14,11406251,english,"Napoleon: Total War was an interesting addition to the Total War series, created in hopes of improving upon the mechanics of Empire: Total War. On it's own, the game is not remarkable at all, but with the right mods, it suddenly becomes one of the best strategy games out there.

NTW obviously takes place in Napoleonic times and features prominently a series of campaigns that mirror Napoleon's wars from the 1790s to 1815. The main campaign of the game is his European war effort from 1805 to 1812, beginning with the War of the Third Coalition and ending around the time Napoleon was trapeezing about the Russian steppes. The campaign, like all Total War campaigns, features elements of economy, infrastructure, and regional control that bring about challenges to building your empire and maintaining control, as well as feeding, paying, and supplying your troops. In addition to this and the usual mess that is diplomacy, NTW features weather prominently, with zones of attrition existing across the map, in places where weather and terrain  demoralize men while also killing them off. Spend too long in one of these zones, and you will have no army.

You can also play the parts of Russia, Britain, Prussia, and Austria, in this European campaign. It should be mentioned that without mods, you cannot play any other nation in this or any of the campaigns (which include an Italy-centered campaign and Napoleon's expedition to Egypt. In both of these, you can only play as the French). This totally take away from the fun of ETW, in which you can take any nation that existed at the time and turn it into a dominant power. And, because the game mechanics sevearly tilt the odds in favor of Napoleon (which is both fair and unfair), playing as any of the afore-mentioned powers can be a fruitless struggle in futility and swarms of French soldiers.

The battles themselves are where NTW, as all other Total War games, truly shines. commanding vast armies of a thousand soldiers on the field of battle in real time is exhilarating. NTW did a particularly good job with programming for soldiers (it is a step up from ETW, which is a relief to many), and especially with artillery. Spectaular graphics make the battles all the more incredible, but this has always been a hallmark of the Total War series. And of course, there are some problems with battles in NTW:
-1) You really can just sit there in a defensive starting position while the enemy AI bayonet-charges you. It's like Pickett's charge every fucking game.
-2) Shooting mechanics are not accurate for the period. There is no firing by rank, and light infantry, which have the same weapons as normal line infantry, can shoot as far and as acurately as most riflemen. 
-3) AI controled soldiers are prone to fire towards you, no matter if there are three units of their own men in front of them. Again, it's not much of a fight.
-4) Battles seperate from campaigns have the added benifit of a complete lack of variety in maps, most of which seem to be geared towards tournament play. 

NTW does offer compelling battles, when fought against other players in Multiplayer mode. They even tried to add in multiplayer mode for campaigns, which was a brilliant idea and could have been wonderful but instead is a poorly-programmed piece of shit.

The only way to have fun while playing a campaign, or to add fun while playing multiplayer, is to use the mod known as DarthMod. There is a DarthMod made by independent sources for every Total War game, and in NTW it is almost essential to have this mod in addition to the game. The mode enhances the sound quality, texture quality (smoke lingers in clouds, and blood splatters when soldiers are shot), melee fighting programming, the number of soldies per unit (from around 160 to about 360!) and most importantly, AI programing. Soldiers now fire by rank, and the AI is a cometent and worth opponent, both in battle and in campaign. Additionally, you unlock every availible nation with DarthMod. I've gone on rampages as Hannover, Portugal, Bavaria, and many more.

In short, if you are looking for a good Total War game, this is probably not the one to get. However, if Empire was your favorite Total War game, or if you prefer guns and cannons to spears and arrows, then get this game and the DarthMod for it. 

Without DarthMod, NTW is a 4 out of 10.

With DarthMod, I give Napoleon: Total War an 8 out of 10.",1406306673,1406306673,True,7,0,0.60204082727432251,0,True,False,False,76561197979993170,88,9,25628,12,14068.0,1602000284

Napoleon total war is set in europe and has a smaller map than empire total war though their are more options, such as liberating nations  as well as more favourable diplomacy/negotiations with other factions. The game is a little less clunky with more map detail, though if you already have Empire total war i dont think their is a need to purchase this game at full price unless you want more of the same. 

I completed tha grand campaign in around 18 hours though, after playing some 18 hours rome 2, really prefer non musket style combat and began finding this game a little boring, despite playing A lot of empire and enjoying it this game makes me want to conquer europe as fast as i can, and have taken over europe with less than 15 battles played, the rest auto resolved. 

I have yet to play the DLC though i am planning too but i cannot review (yet) as i have not yet played the DLC.

In conclusion if you want more of Empire total war buy this game, if you dont dont buy the game at full price (like next steam sale =P) and if you have played later games then it will make a change though i would recommend empire more, due to the large map diversity though most battles in napoleon are standing in a field exchanging artillery fire and the AI standing still with far fewer fortresses than Empire. 

It all depends on if you like this era, wether youve played empire and if you like musket fights with people standing in a line =)

Even though, it didn't focus on other continents other than Europe (not even a North Africa or Middle East setting in this one; Coalition Campaign), it focused a lot of details that happened in the Napoleonic Wars. The different minor factions like the Republic of Veneto (Venice), Italy (not the kingdom of Italy which this Italy shouldn't be here til ~1880ish), Savoy, Ireland, Scotland, Brittany, Catalonia, Westphalia, United Netherlands and Batavian Republic (or Netherlands), Courland, Crimean Khanate, Greece, Hannover, Hessen, Bavaria, Baden-Wuttemberg, Romania, Belgium, Norway, and Poland (I think I named all the possible minor, emerging factions in this game). Its great to see such variety in the gameplay itself. Plus, you can even modify the files for this to your purposes, such as me making a pak file which lets me build Italian Velite Grenadiers (which is a speciality unit) and one of Napoleon's prized unit Grand Artillery and the Old Guard as playing the BRITISH. You can also change attributes of politicans/generals/admirals (name, face portraits, age, etc.) and even replace existing units to have different units (replaced Horatio Nelson's Rose 122 cannon ship to the Santisma Trindad 144 cannon) Sending the Spanish Armada to Davy Jone's Locker in the first turn (all of these are on twcenter.com/forums). Also edited my money so I can pay off nations to get territory without fighting, buying property and encircled my enemies lawl

Horse and musket is tremendously exciting when done as it has been in Napoleon. There's no serious cavalry advantage as there is in Medieval II, so combined-arms tactics win the day. Each unit has its role to play and each player will find a balance that suits his or her play style. The campaign, naturally, is fantastic. The diplomacy system and AI have been fixed over Empire's, meaning that things play out logically and the AI nations are often quite reasonable.

Empire introduced naval battles, but Napoleon perfected them. The feel of giant wooden ships moving in formation is breathtaking. When things get messy and it all breaks down into ship-on-ship combat, the game's interface allows a good level of command. As ships become damaged and crippled, the tactical choices become more difficult.

  Napoleon: Total war is an excellent strategy game the redeems the series for the sins of Empire. The ai is much better in Napoleon then Empire and bugs are much less frequent in Napoleon. Napoleon also has fantastic historical battles, which have never been my favorites to complete in the past. The campaigns, all 4 ( I'm not including Waterloo because it's one battle with cutscenes) while being more restrictive then in the past, are great fun, and present a challenge when set to very hard. The graphics are fantastic if your pc can handle them, but the game is a system hog and if you have a lower end pc you should rethink purchasing until you've read up if you can run it decently or not. Multiplayer is great, with very little connection issues and the introduction to the series of a multiplayer campaign. 
              Overall Napoleon:Total war is a superb strategy game that deserves a place in every strategy players liabrary.

Napoleon's campaigns are fun and the historical battles are really awesome imo. The tactics involved in manoeuvring armies across the battlefield with gunpowder-wielding soldiers presents a challenge that is very welcome for me, especially when it rains. ""Damn this weather, sir. Wet powder makes misfires a certainty!""

Multiplayer, imo, is WAY better than Shogun 2 and is easier to battle people online too. The campaigns are great and have a lot of replayability value to them and  the units are mostly varied, except for a few of them which are just the same unit but with a different name and color of uniform. Naval battles are better than Shogun 2 a million times over and are less complicated to play.

I conquered the French Coast, fighting for Gibraltrar and having to deal with economics and other duties. My first priority was research and money, so I could get a big and strong army, as well as a navy. 

Then I moved inward, conquering the smaller countries and the weaker ones. I made allies.

Then I downloaded the Darthmod. It made the game look 5x Better, and it added the smoke effect. It was really imersive.

25,9649306,english,"Having purchased this game in the glorious year of 2010, it marked my true entry into the world of PC Gaming. And for that, I thank Napoleon: Total War.

It was early in 2010, and a friend of mine had brought a Game Informer Magazine into school one day, we were in 8th Grade at the time. I was flipping through it in our Computer Class, when I noticed ""Napoleon: Total War"" in there. I had never heard of Total War before, but I sure knew I wanted it as I was in a bit of a Napoleon craze at the time. Of course, my teacher noticed me not paying attention on how to type with the home row keys (77 WPM without it, suck on that Home Row!) and took the magazine away from me. I swore on that moment to buy Napoleon: Total War, and to play the living hell out of it.

And I did. I bought it on Friday, August 27th. The day I joined Steam. Got home from Target with my brand new copy of N:TW and a twinkle in my eye. ""What the hell is this Steam stuff?"". So I spent the night getting Steam set up. Then came the instiliation. It wanted to download it, but I was getting roughly 30KB/S at the time, and that would take a long, long time. So I went to sleep frustrated. The next day I learned how to install with the disks. A useful tip. Then came the patches.

Most of Saturday, and for the morning of Sunday I waited for the patches to finish installing. They finally did. I hopped into the computer chair with glee, the moment had finally arrived. *Click* and I hit the ""Play"" button on Steam for the very first time.

I still remember that music in the intro, and the intro itself ""My enemies are many, my equals are none"". The main menu appeared before my eyes, was I really playing this? I hit custom battle - I don't remember my army composition but I was just escatic I finally got to play it. I only got to play that battle though, I had to go to my youngest brother's Football game. For the rest of my Freshman year, it was nearly all I played. Day in, and day out I was commanding armies. I didn't even have an exceptional computer. It was still like a dream come true for me.

That my friends, is just the beginning.

Napoleon: Total War is the 6th main entry in the Total War series of Turn Based Strategy and Real Time Tactics game. It takes us back to a simpler time, when the French were ruled by an Emperorer. Having the experience of the failures of Empire: Total War under thier belt, CA was able to fix many of the issues that plagued Empire. It feels much more coherent and fluid. It's a better game, with the exception of the scope to some.

The map, unlike Empire: Total War, is limited to Europe for the Coloalition Campaigns, and a few smaller maps for Napoleon's Campaigns. For some, this loss of scale is a detriment. To me, it's a plus. The campaigns feel tighter and more worthwhile, and less daunting.

The game's score is wonderful, and takes you back to the time period. With memorable pieces, you'll be sure to remember some of these tunes for time to come. It is truly a highpoint for the score of Total War.

The units are well done, and represent the uniforms of the period accurately and beautifully, The graphics, especially for 2010 are great, and have a nice feel to them.

The game is also extrememly moddable, and there are many mods for many tastes. From small mini mods, to large overhauls like The Great War mod, you'll never be bored with the game.

Overall, I give Napoleon: Total War a 10/10. It truly introduced me to the world of PC gaming, and is a real highlight in the Total War Catalouge. It is by far my favorite Total War game, and one of my favorite games that I have played.",1395982206,1395982206,True,169,1,0.897026002407073975,18,True,False,False,76561198029676636,993,32,12236,0,8754,1598048651
26,9639617,english,"The Napoleonic age was by far the most ironic era for warfare in terms of beauty and romantisism but its very opposite relation with the brutal afair of war times. CA did do right to extend the 18th and early 19th century warfare, and with it, they were able to get the uniforms pretty close to what they wore... well... not quite. Some uniforms are a little cartooney in nature and some of it fantasized, which when i found out kinda made me loose interest. But i eventually found myself going back to it. (Explain later). one big thing about this game is that a large modding community is owned by it and they are, in my opinion, very decent historians for the skins and even custom units that arnt even in Vanilla or the DLC purchassables. 

So, after modding it with Darthmod, Napoleon total Combat, and Napoleonic total war 3, all very prestiegous and respected mods, i found myself clining to this game and settling on NTC, and Napoleonic 3. One for having a broad 40 unit Army factor, and the other having a very to-Earth tatical over veiw. 

The game in Vanilla in my opinion, is kinda poorly done. I remmeber when i was facing thr AI, which became very perdictable and famous for just making the old 'form a huge line of the army' strategy and either approach mine head on and inevitably be repulsed dozens of times, or i flank both their sides in my attack and eventually let them cave in. I Even tried Expert difficulty to get a thrill going, but later i found it just makes it impossible to beat the AI by terms of being buffed up in Stats only. abotu 2 to 5x that of the players army and its ability to have less upkeep/recruiting costs. 

I did, though, have a fun time with the annexation of countries and how the people were either somewhat reluctant or very repressive, and trying to restore their own country again when im not looking. And i mean it quite literly, they did do it when i wasnt looking. Sometimes i got away with the tax exempt tatic to calm the masses, but other times that just hurt my economy and myself in slowing my campaign against a neigboring country. 

In terms of what the battle looks like, id say its really dazzling at some moments. To See huge clouds of smoke gather with the vollies, and the gleam of cavlary sabers in a massive charge, and the rotation of the day made quite a spectacle. And i then found myself addicted to the old Russian 4 movie series of War and Peace, Napoleon 2002 series, and Waterloo. Even watching unoffical Napoleonic war videos and movies and even reenacting clips.

So i would say in a finally answer:

Vanilla mode = 6.5/10 : the reason being is that ive been a fan of the TW series for a while, and i knew they could do better than this. A very large 16 to 20 stack enemy army jsut forming a huge line became rather boring and very easy to beat, and left me concluding that using expert just to beef up an already lame brained AI's army, was a very lazy way to go. 

However, i am very impressed with how the people want to be heard, no matter how powerful you are or how far away you are. Id be quite pissed too if someone looted my home town, pissed for possibly 20 more turns maybe. 

The multiplayer, is a completely different experience in my opinion. The Revoltionary idea of having multiple players for a campaign map game is very engenius of CA to create, and it was very enjoyed to replace the AI. (unlike Rome 2 which is only 2 player campaign) And sometimes it made a very difficult struggle just to forge an Empire for yourself whilst just annexing minor states.

As I said before, the dazzling scene of the battle is breathtaking, and it even jumps a mile and a half away from the dullness of the secene of battle such as in Empire TW or its predessor Medieval 2. It does have a way of keeping things fresh, nice looking, and colorful whilst having a strong dose of destruction with it.

Though my final verdict isnt all to great, my final verdict of the game WITH mods, is a strong 8.7/10. Though most mods, large and small, are rough around the edges, they are not all created equal. I once thought that Darthmod would be my only choice of a true, realistic experience, but then i decided to broaden the horizens with other mods like Order of War and things of that nature. And even the refined mod Napoleon Total Combat has its own MP set up on the way to jumpstart it up again, in a more clear way it shouldve been, and the AI is none the less smarter than vanilla, save the sucidal generals an occasional light cav. 

Thankyou for reading my reveiw, and by all means message me for whatever reason in contrast with this awsome base game. See ya then

50,9290579,english,"This is probably way overdue; but here it is. Along with every other total war fan I became hopelessly obsessed with NTW from the moment I saw the trailer and felt the tingles of empiricism run down my spine. We'll start with the campaign. Although I liked the fact that historical accuracy was kept intact with the coalition against Napolean, I found the campaign interface seriously lacking in my expectations. Having become accustomed to the layout of ETW I struggled initially to adjust to NTW and navigating my way through the campaign. Eventually I got the hang of it, but I found that everything took far too long, from ship building to unit replenishment, everything cost too much as well, making progression very difficult. However; what the game lacked in campaign dynamics it completely made up for in battle realism. I always found cannon shot on infantry in ETW to be a little, ""underdeveloped"" as it were, only killing one or a few men everytime. But in NTW it couldn't be more realistic; anyone with a brain stem can figure out that an 18 pound cannon ball hurtling towards a body of men all tightly bunched up is going to rip a hole through them! I find this is perfectly incorporated into the battle aspect of NTW. Along with this, I find the unit variety much more inclusive of the period, and my particularly favourite touch that was thrown into the battle sequence was the fact that unlike in ETW; when the troops fire their muskets they all don't fire at once. NTW truly is my number one game for battle realism, with brilliant detail, such as when you zoom in to view a unit up close, the screen shakes to signify the marching, you get sun glare, and music plays, which to my amazement is indicitive to the regiment.

Out of 10, I would give it a 7.8. It is indeed a ""must-buy"".

60,9188195,english,"Wow ....wow ....wow. This game is incredible, honestly. Unlike Empire TW, the scope isnt global, but this makes for more focused and pointed gameplay; you have more depth into a few areas rather than breadth over many. The battles look immense and there is definitely a lot to think about -- the incredible number of expansions delegate a variety of units into your fingertips, making every faction that much more varied and unique (albeit confusing at times) -- something which I actually enjoy compared to the more streamlined Shogun 2 and Rome 2 games. 
The great thing about TW is that it NEVER gets boring because of the sheer number of options availible for you as a player to make. You arent pigeonholed into a campaigned; you CREATE the campaign, and because you will never be the same every day of your life, you are bound to make different moves here and there which can lead to VERY different results.
OF course, it can be improved. Better AI, fewer glitches, and more macro control (instead of micro in regards to units on battlefield) would be good places to start.

The Napoleon installment in the Total War franchise is, in my opinion, one of the best thus far. Compared to its predecessors, Napoleon TW boasts the best projectile combat for gunpowder based units (except for cannons). Line infantry, skirmishers, and snipers are all integrated effectively so that an armed comabt force can utilize all three of them without running into issues. Additionally, the balance of the game is quite good in that all units have counters and all counters have units that counter them. No one army can be used to defeat all counters. That being said, however, the game does have a few notable issues that detract from the enjoyability of the game. The first issue is that standard cannons have horrible trajectory algorithms. Cannons in Napoleon TW will consistently fire into the ground if they are not placed on flat ground or on a downward slope. This makes non-mortar artillery extremely frusterating to use since it is difficult to discern if the land you're deploying them on is 100% flat or if it is slightly rough. The second issue with the game is that melee combat is quite ackward due to a lack of proper unit collision in the game.

Italy campaign you are primarily focused on battle and province development with limited tier of units and building. Then in Egypt campaign, you get to use naval units as well as research and religion. Then in Grand campaign where you can play as France or the Great Coalition, you get to control every aspect of the game. Thus new players don't have to freak out by the amount of things they need to handle. Also, since the game is driven by Napoleon's story, campaign AI behavior is quite scripted and most of time follows what happened in history so there is less room for AI to screw up big time (which happened a lot in empire).

The most noticeable difference is that Napoleon concentrates exclusively on Europe whereas Empire allows the player to conquer the globe. 

Beyond first blush, Napoleon does feature some improvements over Empire that make it worth consideration. Chief of those is better coding - Napoleon is accepted by most to be a much more stable and better running game than Empire. It is also better looking. AI is supposedly markedly better, however that is debatable. There are a number of mods available that greatly improve the Napoleonic experience - but you're fine running the stock game.

If you've ever had a go at Empire: Total War, you'll find that Napoleon plays a lot like that game. It's set in more or less the same time period, and you'll be using very similar units. It's also not as grand as Empire was, but then again, no other Total War game can quite match Empire geographically. 

Nonetheless, what makes Napoleon unique is, well, Napoleon. Through the sheer epicness and grandeur that Creative Assembly has managed to, well, creatively assemble, the game focuses on the exploits of a single man, whilst still delivering the Total War experience we all know and love. It brings a much more intimate and story-driven touch to the series, although slightly limiting the campaign. 

If you're interested in becoming the military genius that was Napoleon, or fight against him in the coalition, you will not be disappointed.
