Don't be discouraged, as the hitboxes can feel unforgiving in comparison to any FPS game that isn't CSGO, where even the hitboxes aren't hitboxes, but don't let the frustration get to you. There's are a wide variety of minigames to help you improve in your desired category, and if you don't feel like crafting a routine by picking a bunch out from the vaguely named online scenarios, there is an extensive KovaaK's workout guide you can find on Google (it's a dropbox file).",1601665665,1601665665,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198137797770,115,11,1132,405,927,1602075015,,

6,76051614,english,"Some people disparage aim training and its effectiveness in games. If you are one of these people I say this with the most respect, you are misinformed and are making a philosophical and psychological mistake. Aim training is nothing more than improving mouse control and reactivity to a moving or stationary target. Some of the best players in each on of their respective gene of first and third person shooters, have done some kind of aim training/mechanics isolation before in their careers. Weather that is this program (Psalm 2nd in the Fortnite world cup, Daquan[The most entertaining Fortnite streamer I have had the pleasure to watch], Beaulo [Prefessional Rainbow Six Siege player for TSM at the time of this review]), a healthy variety of different types of programs (Shroud, Myth, Booty clap KC) or has played custom games with bots for hours upon hours a day with the intent to improve (Nate Gibson) we all have the drive to improve ourselves and be better then we were yesterday. Maybe this will be the final leap to making you a professional/semi-professional player in your game of choice. I will achieve that level one day and I know you can to, these people I mentioned did it so why can't you? There is no excuse for not wanting to improve and become a better version of yourself even if you do not want to be a professional player. If you have come from console (like me) I would strongly recommend consulting Aimer7's guides on aiming, this includes the positioning on as well, for the people with many years of First person shooter experience you can most definitely improve on you game sense. These are the guides and there respective links:Aimer7 Workout Routines (I would recommend doing the complete routine for console players):https://www.dropbox.com/s/vaba3potfhf9jy1/KovaaK%20aim%20workout%20routines.pdf?dl=0Aimer7 Positioning Guide (Even console players can benefit from this):https://www.dropbox.com/s/aif0jy1prxe0rjm/Heuristic%20about%20geometric%20positioning.pdf?dl=0One more thing before you start your improvement journey, diet, physical exercise, and proper sleep have huge effects on how well you will be able to aim. I have personally noticed an increase in reaction time from 180ms average to 150 average on human benchmark:https://humanbenchmark.com/ by focusing HEAVILY on improving my Daily routine/Eating habits. I would also recommend the content on these youtubers:Blink: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzn7P3lnglgxwHM_kFQ0AOARon Rambo Kim: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCr97_mhDwscRciN6eWyXLowNow a wildcard interview from a professional Rainbow Six Siege player, this has sparked my interest in reaction time and nootropics: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui898Biq_S4I am by no means a professional in any of these topics and I am constantly learning about the world of E-sports/improvement. Right now I am a advanced beginner according to Aimer7s guide, and can 100% attest to the effectiveness of this guide.

0,75086500,english,"Kovaaks is great for training your muscle memory in regards to the movements associated with aiming such as flicking and tracking (mouse control, hand-eye coordination, and speed specifically). I think the worse your aim is the more you stand to gain from using Kovaaks to take your game to the next level. However, it's not some magic panacea where after a month of grinding a playlist or two you'll become an aimgod like Shroud or KennyS. (They are the exception and have hundreds of thousands of hours playing FPS' titles for years even before mainstream aim trainers have even existed)


You have to be consistent with your training regimen and keep at it, similar to people trying to get in shape by using the gym. Hoping for overnight success without putting in the work will only leave you jaded and disappointed. As an aside I'd recommend making sure you spend plenty of time in your target game while using Kovaaks since aiming is only one part of becoming good at an FPS title where game/map knowledge, decision making, movement, positioning, teamwork/communication (If it's a team-based game), and recoil control are just as important as bettering your aim (Things you can only really practice by playing your game of choice). If you have realistic expectations, set some tangible goals, stay committed, you'll be surprised how much you can improve at your target game. Also make sure that accuracy is your #1 priority, speed will come with time.


I've only been using Kovaaks for a little while now but I've started to notice that my flicking and tracking have incrementally gotten better resulting in winning more gunfights, but I still have a long way to go to be more competitive in the games I play. Bottom line is what you get out of Kovaaks is what you put in, it's a tool, but an amazing one for the FPS enthusiast that takes it seriously.",1598667113,1598765693,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198051627501,255,21,421,0,374,1599215348,,

aim lab - good for basic aim training but you wont be able to get as much variation on aim practice (gives you more specific things about your aiming issues + score and high score)

both programs are good but if you want to actually see progress you want to practice every day for a minimum of 1 hour (best to do this before you go to sleep because your muscle memory will get finished learning faster when you sleep)

Tracking:
Ascended Tracking v3

i use kovaak on a day to day basis and every week i have new issue with a new part of their interface. one week it was an issue with the playlists that are local to the game (these should be a part of the game, not something you need to upload) and this week im having issues with my mouse exiting the fullscreen window?????????????? how is this actually a bug in an application solemnly made for point and click. 

another part of the game called sandbox mode is also a complete waste of time and it has been in development for months. the only part of the game that works as intended is the other half of the game where you can access local/online playlists. 

giving credit where it is due: local playlist are top notch. helping me refine and enhance my aim just by working my way up in the difficulty tiers of different aim categories (tracking, clicking, flicking). the game works as intended for the most part but it is unbearably frustrating to be dealing with new bugs and flaws that make the practice game unplayable. 

this game is not completely reliable as a primary source of daily aim training. when the game is actually able to work, it is a pretty decent aim trainer with a really shitty interface.

29,74129608,english,"The base game, the sandbox mode, works great. No doubt about that but the added Trainer and it's algorithm as well as the provided user experience need a lot of work.

To the developer:
- Consider the option for people to skip a level. Sure, there is the aspect of earning it, but the algorithm totally ruins every bit of progress if you have one bad run. It feels like it doesn't take it's own issues into account. E.g. if you spawn 30 targets on the left and you miss the 7 of 10 targets that spawn on the right, of course the percentage of the targets you miss on the right is higher, but you have no chance of correction in that case. Writing ""please excuse any odd data in the software"" is not the correct way of handling things. Either you give the user the option to skip a stage when the algorithm does not perform as intended or you just don't release it in the first place
- Following situation occurs too often and should be taken out. You play one level and finish it BUT you have to play it multiple times afterwards to prove that you finished it and not just by chance? I get the point but from a usability and reliability perspective it makes no sense to implement since it is a frustration factor for the user. Imagine you finish the level twice well and don't perform as good to any factors that YOU AS THE DEVELOPER can not change, user error. What you do is make the user repeat everything from the start, there is no reward in doing that but only frustration.

What I mentioned above is the reason I won't recommend this software, no matter how far the development is, until the usability and reliability of the ""software and odd data"" is not conflicting.

I am here to answer the question if the game is good at what it tries to achieve.

Long story short it is ok. For me it is worth the price in the sale but not the normal full price.

---------
Pros
---------

- The scenarios are working good.
- A lot of community content
- Many game sensitivity's
- Clean and easy to use menu
---------
CONS
---------
- The scenarios itself are working fine but I did really like some more optimization. When I start up the game I 
  need to wait like half a minute for loading in all the scenario's (I suppose?). Sometimes I need to restart my 
  game because it just takes to long to finish the last 1. Sometimes I don't need to wait at all when I startup 
  the game. I would like more consistency.

- The second thing is that I do not like that it redownloads the ""Valorant"" playlist even tho I don't want it. Just 
   let me decide.

-  Also it would be nice to set for each scenario a time in your playlist instead of ""rounds"" or both is also fine.",1596798141,1596798141,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,76561198080264971,271,24,1551,17,1004,1601458461,,

Thanks to Windows garbage updates it messes with my crap and I have to reinstall games sometimes and I forget what my mouse settings were. Or I'm a zombie from working 11 hour days and when I finally awake from my coffin I'm too slow to play any fps games. 

So this helps me wake up and smooth out any other tedious edges of things I normally don't notice. This is amazing and I'll be keeping an eye on any and all updates or DLC this hopefully will have in the future. I'd recommend this to even people who feel they aren't great with fps games or normally a console gamer moving to PC. 

The people that designed this were genius for coming up with a concept like this. It has 3rd and 1st person cameras. So if you want to practice for GTA, Red Dead, or anything pretty much it has so many options and presets of some fps games. I wonder if there will be a way to match the sensitivity from here to another game, like a way to measure the sensitivity setting. Money well well worth spent. I'll probably gift this to a few people also. It's affordable and has so many options.

[*] CRASHING on loading screens (like I can't play 3 rounds in a row kind of crashing)
[*] No data tracking in the classic mode (just high score)
[*] Very few games supported in either mode
[*] ONLY Overwatch and Fortnite supported in the ""training"" mode
[*] Horrendous UI
[/list]



If you get passed crashing at launch, the first thing you'll notice is the horrible wall-of-text UI. You'll try some ""sandbox"" and find out it does not record any of your data but a high score (so no record of how much you've improved over time). Additionally, the settings do not include many common popular FPS games. 

You figure you'll try the actual ""Trainer"", which will give you analyzable data but will only allow you to select from Fortnite and Overwatch...the games that are, unless you go pro, some of the least aim heavy on the market. Also, not as popular as they once were. So I have no clue why these were chosen for the new mode. And, after a round or two, will crash with no error message or notice of any kind.

Everything about this screams early beta. And, with free options on the market, it's hard to justify paying for this. Extremely disappointed.",1594418171,1596261248,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198028976928,305,4,289,0,65,1600392042,,

My only complaint is the challenge mode is not complete, it only has flicking challenges.

31,72090693,english,"EDIT: This program FALSELY ADVERTISED. Read further to see why.The program weighs far too lop-sided. I've had most of my runs, where 55% of my missed shots were on the right or left side, fully inconsistantly. Randomly. Not because I couldn't hit on that side, but because random targets happened to surprise me there that time. If you accept the adjustments, the program throws MORE bots to the left, which means, if you flick with the exact same accuracy, just by statistics, you're gonna miss more on the weighed side. I know myself, that I can't shoot for sht on my lower right, because the gun model blocks my entire view there, but the program has no ability to notice that, therefore I could never practice that specific angle. Also, when the program doesn't find any mistakes, it makes ones up randomly. I did control-groups, where I didn't flick at all, and slowly moved my cursor over to the exact same amount of targets on each side in the quadrant-controll exercise. The exact same hit locations on for dummies, and every shot not taken after those. The program concluded, that my lower left quadrant was weak, and would procede to give me 3 train-levels of lower left, in NEITHER can you level up. Do I have to browse through the workshop for that? Also, the program's screenshots include hanzo's bow from overwatch, but that mode is not available, or at least locked behind some unexplained requirements. If it is, how does it make sense to complete however-many hitscan levels, to be able to go to tracking? And there are a TON of hitscan levels. Do you have to become a GOD Widowmaker, before you can practice hanzo? Is this some sort of gatekeeping? In it's current state, the program is not polished enough to be worth its price, that is my opinion.
Edit: this genious program reset my 5 hours of progress I had in it. https://imgur.com/a/s8u1vbh if you don't believe me. My highscores are still there, but I have to re-do the entire program again. Now that I play it again, and have SO MUCH BETTER results, the program still looks down on me as if I was just lucky, and makes me re-do the stages. It just doesn't let me through the 4-directional flicks. I am sure that there is a programming issue with the stage, as the developers don't seem go have any sense for statistics, and will just randomly go out on tangents about random one-click mistakes. Oh, you couldn't get a single target on the right side? Must be because that mistake is DEEPLY ROOTED IN YOUR SYSTEM, AND WE MUST ERADICATE IT! Now DO IT AGAIN like a good little btch! The visuals are ugly, the program looks like one of those 'I made the mirror's edge running animation in unity in 24 hours' videos, and most of the job, and anything that's actually useful, like tracking and scoping, is done by the workshop. This is nothing more, than an overgloryfied shooting gallery, and SHOULD BE FREE. Or at the very least optional to pay, or free with microtransactions (skins on the dummies, for example), because dummies randomly spawning in unity engine, grounded on the foundations of simple-as-nail if/else commands is not what I was promised. You are paying 10 euros for community made maps basically. That's literally the only thing this shooting gallery has that others don't, and I am very disappointed in my purchase. No, flipping a coin on my better than avarage results if I can  maybe get to see further levels is not what I was promised. I did not want to pay 10 euros for a skybox and seemingly free assets popping up that I have to click on, and a single menu, with absolutely no freedom given to the user to gauge his/her abilities or decide for themselves which level is best suited for them. This is a hoax at worst, and you can get the very same skills and results with any free alternatives. It just sounds good, when someone like xQc says the words ""aim trainer"" in a video. Reality is often disappointing. Verdict: will this improve your aim? Yes. Is it worth your money? Not at all, not even at half price. Go download something for free, because mechanically you're gonna get the very same improvement. Go spend that 10 euros on dinner, instead of supporting this horrendously lazy developer.",1593953426,1595172944,False,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False,76561198084228107,89,13,515,0,238,1599384547,,

80,72806035,english,"The last time I played a competitive shooter with such low TTK was at least 10 years ago. Not playing CSGO at all made me a complete newbie to Valorant aiming. I love playing Valorant and most of my friends have started playing it. Being a try-hard that I am I wanted to gain momentum on the loads of people that are switching to Valorant from CSGO. My aim being sub-par made that impossible for me to win 1v1 against CSGO experienced players. They being well versed with ideas like Crosshair Placement. Now I've played my fair-share of CS 1.6 but never with crosshair placement and all recent developments in tac shooters in mind. 

This is where KovaaK 2.0 came in like a gun-toting angel in my life. The aim routines made by vets and pros are so focused at areas that most like me lack in. I bought a new mouse, switched to a newer, lower sensitivity and started practising a month ago. Now this is no ""Pro-maker"" but it definitely, slowly and gradually adding confidence and efficiency to my aim. I have no idea how I can now peak angles and take kills that still surprise me. They will soon stop surprising me and make these kills second nature. Kovaak will have most to do with that.

83,72543351,english,"Firstly, the email harvesting is intrusive and annoying. I don't want something like that from a simple aim trainer that I've already bought through Steam. Being forced to login again is a pointless nuisance. Clearly, the only reason this retrograde feature exists is to harvest emails for bonus profit. Just charge more for the game! If it's actually worth it, people will pay. But they know it's not worth it.

A lot is made of how the features hidden behind the registration and login allow you to train with something close to a real-game setup. This is just marketing nonsense. It doesn't.

To find out that the new training is bad, means you've already had to register, and they've got your email. Being exploited like that is not endearing.


And what is does after you register definitely isn't worth it.

The ""new"" training experience is disappointing. The long, unnecessary delays where it pretends to be downloading data (what data?) analysing your data (what, forty clicks?) just get in the way of practice. It would take less than a millisecond to calculate a hit/miss ratio, or per quadrant, or whatever. Not that it will even tell me my per-quadrant ratio...

In practice, the statistics are amateurish and lacking completeness or utility. For example, you will get something like this:

""55% of your missed targets are on your left. Your left accuracy needs improvement.""
Firstly, 5% deviation there probably isn't meaningful. If I missed 70% of targets to the left, maybe it would be important, but 5% is well within a margin of error. If you accept the questionable suggestion to put more targets on left, it will then (and this is bad statistics management from the trainer) complain that 90% of your missed targets are on your left... Of course they are, it put 90% of the targets on the left, so of course that's where the misses are; you have almost no chance to miss on the other side.

That is takes so long to produce such a broken analysis, and makes such ill-founded recommendations is the main reason for my bad review.

There are other problems along this line.

For example, it never complains about top screen/bottom screen accuracy, even though for me, this is more pronounced.

It doesn't distinguish near misses from complete misses, or have any statistical measure of accuracy other than simplistic hit/miss. Now, in a game, only hits count, but for training, the other data does mean something.

Nor does it consider the distribution of targets. It doesn't take into account the real difficulty of a shot, given sequential placement of targets. Instead, the targets are completely random, and it provides no data about sequential tracking. So when it puts five targets in almost exactly the same spot on the top left, then one on the far bottom right, hidden under the character's arm, it considers that bottom-right shot to be just as easy as the ones that were all in the same place and clearly visible.

Also, every session, I find my mouse creeping down and down the desk towards me until I run out of space. This is a non-problem in a real game, it's only a problem in the trainer. The sessions should have mouse-reset pauses, where it stops for a moment. This would allow for longer sessions, with better average data. The current sessions are quite short. You should at least have options to configure this sort of thing.

Overall, I find the long ""analysing"" delays between sessions extremely frustrating, and doubly so because the authors don't seem to grasp even basic statistics. I'm not even sure they understand anything about mouse movement difficulty and how it impacts real shots.

Even if the analysis code were written in Python, or R, it would still be effectively instant for the tiny number of data points it handles. So what is the program doing during those long, frustrating delays? I don't think it's doing anything, it just puts in the delays to try and con you that it's doing something clever.

And the lack of configuration options for how things are measured is apparent. You can't choose between square quadrants and radial quadrants for example. It seems the program is using a square quadrant model, which is inherently flawed.

But... It's the delays that make this an unendurable experience. Why are there analysis delays? Why are there loading delays? Loading delays on a 32GB PC, to show a level that consists of nothing but a low resolution model and a background image! This is just ludicrous.

The sound is unpleasant, from the robot voices to the cold, repetitive music. I don't need a music track from a game like this, any time or effort spent on it is wasted. Doubly so if it's so unpleasant to listen to.

Some basic features are missing too. You can't turn off the stupid screen-covering arm. You can't customise your cross-hair. It will let you play flicking training using a machine gun, which produces garbage results ... and so on.

There is no customisation of the guided training mode at all. Again, a big oversight. If I could do things like set up ""head shot only"" mode with a distribution for flick distance right from the start, that would let me address something I want to train, instead of what it thinks I should do.

You have to log out to swap back to the classic mode, which is hardly an intuitive way to integrate it.

The ""classic"" mode, or whatever they call it, is better in many ways. It's what you got in a lot of other trainers. But it's just the same, there's no reason to buy this over those other trainers except for the new mode, and the new mode is not well done.


Then there's the video support...

I have an ultra-wide monitor, and true Fullscreen mode won't let me set the ratio I want to fill, instead trying to occupy all of my 32:9  5120x1440 screen (impractical, and looks bad because it doesn't even suggest the right resolution).

Windowed mode FAILS TO CAPTURE THE MOUSE properly, causing the program to be unusable... Fortunately, Fullscreen-Windowed works sensibly, but only one out of three modes usable? That's not good.

Some other programs have similar problems, but well made ones do not (Overwatch itself is fine for example).


Finally, the graphics are ""programmer art"" and look quite bad. They do not create a professional or polished appearance. I could forgive that if other aspects were right, but they aren't.


There are some reasonable ideas here, but the execution is flawed and incomplete. It calls the analysis ""beta"". I wouldn't describe it as even reaching an alpha standard, and it's not even in a program being sold as incomplete.

Long delays, pointless registration, that I don't want ... it's clearly to scrape extra monetization off customers who already paid ... plain bad statistics ... and a extremely limited configuration and customisation options.

While other trainers also have weak statistics, they cost less, load faster, have no pointless forced delays, offer more customisation, and their training modes are ultimately just as useful, and perhaps more realistic. And they don't harvest your email address or force you to login.

This offers no benefits over other trainers, costs more, and harvests your email.

My suggestions is to avoid it and buy a different trainer.",1594532354,1594539084,False,12,2,0.573693931102752686,0,True,False,False,76561197971243755,123,9,821,0,70,1599477305,,

Before buying you should know that improving ur aim require consistency in your training schedule , you should put 1 to 2 hours in it everyday and play the good scenarios for what u want to improve. there's alot of routines available , best free one is probably Aimer7 one. if you want to improve more and really strive to be the best aimer possible , you should consider getting custom routines and coaching with vF or sparky coaches.


so to resume:
- be consistent , don't miss a day in the schedule because of lazyness. you can take breaks from time to time if you have pain to avoid injuries or if your mental is not in a good shape.
-play good scenarios. don't spend your time playing tile frenzy or things like that , most of the good scenarios have moving or small targets , or both.
-be patient , you may not see great improvement in term of scores on the scenarios as fast as you expect. but if your more comfortable with your mouse and develop a better mouse control , results are gonna show in the FPS you play and slowly scores in kovaak will grow",1594245676,1594245676,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198173335263,182,2,7442,432,5613,1601503732,,

Aim trainers are a great tool for improvement, but they're just that: a tool. They only work if you use them in addition to other games to train your aim. You need to play a variety of scenarios in order to practice aiming in different ways. Too many people make the mistake of sitting in KovaaK's or Aimlab all day and never hopping into a game to practice. If you only play an aim trainer, you'll just improve at the aim trainer. 

That said, when used properly, a game like KovaaK's will help you make rapid improvements. It's sort of like working out: you keep getting gains, but with diminishing returns, and you have to keep at it. If you want to add an aim trainer into your daily regiment, KovaaK's is the best in the business.",1593610863,1593610863,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198117018342,55,1,17317,317,13038,1601933566,,

About 300 hours in quake
And alot of more hours in other FPS

The pros:

* Well lets just start off with how many different training maps there are as default:
There are about 6 useful maps that train your aim really easy and fast.
There are around 2-20+ standard maps for Flicking and clicking that most people use.
And there are ton of maps for tracking both in Y and X coordinates.
And they all are really good even after 5 hours of Kovaaks I can see the difference not only in game but how I aim in general. My aim increased about 2 fold so far but lets see how far i can push it!!! 

* Really good fps!
(I get around 350fps on low settings and I have a not so great Pc: GTX 1660 ti and xeon 1245 v2)


The cons:

* Really Bad crosshair customization.


Thats pretty much it!

13,52714411,english,"The ""Trainer"" is a set of developer created scenarios for the user with special features released with version 2.0. The ""Sandbox"" has user created scenarios and was there from the start.


The majority of my hours are from when the game was at version 1.0. The game was a lot more lightweight then and it didn't have an unnecessary ""Trainer"" along with it. Before this addition, the game was less than a GB, roughly 700 MB. Now it is about 8 GB. For an aim trainer, it should be as lightweight as possible while maintaining features that the users want. Now more about the ""Trainer"". This in my perspective is aimed towards the people who are attracted to aim trainers like ""Aim Hero"" or ""Aim Lab"". They're appealing to people who haven't educated themselves about what their best options are or people who want everything pathed out for them. While that it is nice that developers would try to make it easier for the user to get started, it is not an effective way to train aim. Before the 2.0 update with the ""Trainer"", the ""Sandbox"" was and still is the only reason to purchase the game. The majority of people that bought the game prior to 2.0 were made aware by it from streamers where they played a couple of scenarios like Tile Frenzy and Ascended Tracking. Now I am assuming it is the ""Trainer"" luring in new users which I also assume was their plan in creating it. The reception the developer team got from the community on the release of 2.0 was anything but positive. Look at the negative reviews in the community hub or the subreddit if you want to know how bad it was. 


I got about 100 less FPS with the release of 2.0, I brought it up in the Discord server and did not receive a response. They never addressed the performance degradation from my knowledge. There have been issues with AMD drivers and this game, requiring AMD to fix their drivers. They recently added analytics that from my knowledge you can only opt-out by sending a letter? I would recommend reading their privacy policy https://themeta.com/privacy-policy. The ""Trainer"" requires an internet connection to play but the ""Sandbox"" does not. I thought their UI rework would make the UI look a little better but it still looks outdated and made by a developer and not a graphics designer. 


The Meta is what the developer team for ""The Trainer"" call themselves, a team that was working on their own training platform before merging with Kovaak's FPS Aim Trainer. Subsequently after that merge is when this game started going downhill with the addition of ""The Trainer"". Quote from the TechCrunch article: ""After the two esports entrepreneurial teams met, they decided to join forces and offer what they believe to be the ultimate training tool."" The team has also raised some money ""The gaming startup has raised $2.5 million in funding from investors"". I can only speculate to the reason for why Kovaak decided to merge his game with something comparatively inferior. 


While Kovaak's FPS Aim Trainer still maintains ""The Sandbox"", the addition of ""The Trainer"" and The Meta team has really made it something I would stay away from. Turning from a friendly developer into a corporation asking me to accept a 3rd party EULA.  Aimbeast seems closer to what Kovaak's FPS Aim Trainer was like around 1.0 and I would only really recommend an aim trainer to somebody inexperienced with FPS games.",1561952039,1593440122,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198107431741,438,1,27332,0,27329,1598787788,,

I thought I had decent aim but i felt it was lacking at times so I decided to try kovaak's. At first I was disappointed at how simple the top rated games were and I was skeptical that it would translate into other games. On top of that the challenges felt very taxing on my brain and I would get burnt out after 20 minutes. The median scores were surprisingly high and seemed out of reach. However I kept playing for 20 minutes a day during my down time and within a week the challenges were no longer exhausting me mentally and became very fun. I found myself playing kovaak's over my other fps games, trying to top my high scores and climb the leaderboards became very addictive, especially coupled with the fact that I knew I was becoming a better gamer in the process. Now after just 3 weeks of playing I consistantly score in the top 80-90%. I've noticed a huge impact in other fps games; I get compliments on my aim from spectating teamates regularly now. This game also was immensely helpful in finding my optimal DPI and sens, which i was way off from and had no clue.

This game has made my other shooter games more fun as I'm better at them now. This is possibly the best $10 I've ever spent on a game.

- Skeptical at first
- huge improvement very quickly
- definite translation into other games

But the key is when it decides to run. This game is in such a buggy broken state for me, and I've tried EVERY FIX the devs have told me, on their FAQ, I even switched most of the games I play's resolution to a 16:9 just so I can use this more often. Unfortunately, launching the game is like playing Russian Roulette except 5/6 chambers are filled and only one is empty. It crashes so often on startup, usually I'd have to reinstall the game every time I just want to run it. It's a great trainer when it runs, but thats if it wants to run at all.

I have to give this game a negative review until they fix it. Resolution in 4:3 streched crashes the game. Launching the game crashes the game. The game will crash randomly every once in a while when it's launched.

Additionally, the recently added ability to make playlists for exercises is brilliant, it can be buggy at times but that feature alone is a game changer. Anyway here's my nitpicks:

-There's no ""reset to default"" for the graphical options, actually a really big annoyance for me.
-There's some pretty bad lag upon initially starting the game due to it having to load all the workshop maps, I'd like it if it only loaded those when you opened the workshop browser, that way I don't have to wait 30-60 seconds (on SSD) before starting a 5 min warm up exercise that I have saved.
-To add to the above issue, It isn't uncommon for the game to be unresponsive on startup, forcing you to ctrl+alt+del out of the game and deal with the load time again.
-There appears to be a little bit of lag when initially starting a challenge, can be a little frustrating to beef 2 seconds into a 1 min challenge just because of some slight lag. This seems to have been improved in updates but still exists.

Again these are all pretty nit picky, just mentioning them because it is such a simple game designed to do one thing really well, which for the most part it does.

It doesn't give you the option to reset back to normal, you only get replay or get more targets on the right.

TL;DR: It used good and something else. Uninstalled.

Frankly, I wonder if this ""update"" is even legal. I'd argue with the ""2.0"" update, this is a different game now.
Which is not what we paid money for.

When you start the game now, you -have to- register an account. Separate from your steam account.
This is looks alarming and suspicious to me. Why is the steam account not good enough?
Might be that the dev wants do something that's against steams EULA. Or a similar set of rules for devs/publisher maybe?
Could be that, its for skill/progress tracking. Which used to be offline and is now online?
In which case, this would again not be the same product anymore.

When you register for an account, you're asked whether you want to train for Fortnite or Overwatch. That's it.
I happen to care for neither of those games.
If that is the direction 'The Meta' wants to take this product. Then I am simply out.

75,69735600,english,"Provides a wealth of aim training scenarios for you to practice both core and fringe components of FPS aiming and allows to you see how you compare with other users. The sandbox is probably where you'll spend a lot of your time exploring scenarios and warming up. 

The guided training is still in progress but could use a lot of work. Some of my major complaints:
- There seems to be some sort of disparity in the tracking. I have no mouse acceleration turned on and I checked Windows, my mouse driver, and Kovaacs itself. Yet while practicing flicking, my mouse is consistently drifting towards me. Unlocking vertical and horizontal sens and instead setting them to the same amount seems to help. I'm using an ultrawide monitor, which may play into this. Either way, it's an issue they need to fix.

- For a guided training, it does not provide very useful information with regards to what you need to do to move on. Sometimes in flicking, it tells you that high accuracy is more important, other times it tells you that speed is more important than accuracy. At the end of each trial, it gives you very limited information about your performance and nothing about what your score made you fail that level. It's kind of frustrating. Yeah if I had 100% accuracy and lightning quick aim, I could definitely move on, but I don't, which is why I'm going through this training in the first place. 

Don't expect much from the training mode. It only has 1 out of 3 modes available right now anyways. For now, I would stick to the user-generated scenarios as your mainstays.

Once you get to know your way around some scenarios, time spent in KovaaK's can make serious improvements to aim no matter your current skill level, thanks largely due to the great creativity and broad scope of many scenarios.

Update: 2.0 Meta was a bad idea and these efforts should have gone elsewhere. The developers have a vision for this trainer that strays from the light simplicity and user-defined experience that made this the best aim trainer out there. Every update gives Kovaak's a worse feel and introduces & expands bloat. I strongly encourage potential users to look elsewhere for their aim training unless they run a 1.x version before 2.0 Meta. It really seems the new dev team is completely blind to what made Kovaak's the best aim trainer out there and they continue to make changes that push away even the most dedicated players.

84,69709446,english,"[h1] HONEST REVIEW (LONG) [/h1]
[b] Summary [/b]: KovaaK is a great tool to help improve your aim (and some movement if you play Quake, I guess), but it's still up to you. You won't be a God just by training KovaaK, you still have to put in the time in whatever game(s) you play.

This aim trainer will definitely help you, [b]provided you use it properly[/b]. I'm saying you should work on what you're lacking on. Of course, it depends on which game you play, and your play style. I play CS: GO (1.8k hours) and Apex Legends a lot, so I adjust my training for both games accordingly.

[list]
[*]In CS you utilize more flicking and shooting heads over tracking, so I focus on 1wall 6targets and other flicking/target switching challenges, and add some Cata IC to brush up on tracking. The Short Strafes version is extremely helpful in CS, as a lot of high-level players with great movement tend to sidestep a lot.
[*]In Apex, tracking is a lot more prominent, so I tend to utilize more Ascended Tracking, Cata IC, Vertical Tracking, and such. 1wall 6targets pasu is surprisingly hard and should help you switch targets while also tracking them. This is very useful in Apex, as everyone is running around all the time.
[/list]

Even only after less than 15 hours put in, I've seen a major upgrade in consistency, and adjusting to targets is much easier. 100% recommend this aim trainer. Definitely look into AIMER7's guide, you can look it up on Google. The guide will help you set up nicely.

Use KovaaK responsibly. Again, this and only this will not make you a God. The time you put in, in whatever game you play, along with proper KovaaK training, will definitely enhance your mechanical skills and push them to the next level. Can this make you as good as Shroud/Aceu?  [spoiler] Yes. It definitely can. [/spoiler]",1590302872,1590303074,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198182236766,21,1,3763,294,710,1601818795,,

94,69680572,english,"I think it's a good idea for an aim trainer but, the ""trainer"" portion needs some serious work. There's clearly something wrong on a basic level. I will complete a training session and it will tell me that ""55% of misses were on the left"" then it will say it's adding more targets on whatever side it thinks you need training on. This sounds good in theory but, that seems to be as far as they got in that algorithm. Now with more targets on your weak side you of course have more chances to miss on that side but, it doesn't seem to account for the extra targets. Other times it will just switch what it thinks you need work on based on who knows what. Sometimes it won't even tell me a percentage of misses and instead will just say ""Most of your misses were in the bottom right"". There isn't really any progression because as soon as you think you're making it somewhere everything changes.

There's still other things in the general sandbox that I think are more like the original Kovaaks. This game really needs to add in some other settings for other games so you don't have to figure out the sensitivity on your own. I don't play fortnite or overwatch and that's all that's avaulable in trainer.

10,69344941,english,"I have no idea what's going on. I saw videos of the original Kovaak and thought that's what I was getting; a simple, clean, easy to use trainer with no frills. I get into this and am immediately bombarded with confusion. Why is there a robot? Why am I getting options to play with Overwatch weapons? Why do I need to register? No way I'm registering for this... I just want to practice my aim! I don't want to go online!

So I figured maybe ""Trainer"" was the wrong mode and went to Sandbox instead. I have a list of 5 recommended scenarios, so I figured I'd try those out... but I can't even figure out how to do that. Why do I randomly have like 16 local scenarios already and why are half of them starred and half not? Why are there weird player names on my screen called ""A_frozen_pistol"" and ""react""? Am I online or something?! What's a session manager? What's the difference between ""Start Challenge"" and ""Play""? And ""Start Playlist""? I tried going to ""Online Scenarios"" and figured out you can click this tiny little ""play"" button next to the name, so I clicked that... and then proceeded to wait 5 minutes while it says it's downloading scenarios. What? Are you trying to download EVERY online scenario or something? Just let me play!! 

So finally I tried making a playlist. I figured out how to add stuff to it. But when I try clicking ""Play""... nothing happens... I can't double-click the scenarios to play them... the play buttons next to the titles don't do anything... I'm completely lost on how anyone can use this.

Anyway, I have no idea what's happening. Half an hour later, I haven't even been able to do something as simple as make a playlist. This may be some of the worst UI design and user feedback I've seen in any game, period. I'm disappointed, because the program I saw online looked really good and clean.

40,67089095,english,"9.5/10 The best aim-trainer I've tried, period! 

PROS: There are so many different scenarios and practices to do. Having a challenge mode with leaderboards makes it easy to track your progress and see how you fare among others as well as giving you that competitive drive to keep grinding at it and improving. I think KAT is 100% definitely worth the cost even when it's full price, but if you can get it on sale then it's even better. After a few weeks of playing KAT almost daily for 1-2hrs a day, I can say with certainty that my aim has improved drastically. Seeing your high scores increase in scenarios is 1 way to track your progress, but I think an even better way is just feeling the difference in your game of choice. In a lot of situations where I probably would have choked and not hit a single shot under pressure, I can now easily just react to being put under pressure and my muscle memory does most of the work for me. There are so many selections of great scenarios people have created, many of them really help you identify where your weak points are with your aim.

CON: the only negative I can really find with this aim trainer is that there aren't options for custom crosshairs. There are quite a few options with your choice of custom colours, but some of the crosshairs provided are really out there and ridiculous, ones that nobody would ever really use in any tactical fps game. I really wish there was a custom crosshair section, something like in Overwatch with multiple sliders that let you fine-tune how thick or long the lines are, if you want an outline or not, or if you want a dot and how big that is, opacity etc.. If it had that then I'd give it a straight 10/10, but not having a crosshair option like the ones I use in game is a bit of a bummer. I like there to be a small gap in my crosshair for me to lineup headshots with, but the crosshairs similar to that in Kovaak's either have to large of a gap or no gap or a gap so small you can't really get an idea of what's in the center of it.

 Overall thought, I would HIGHLY suggest this aim trainer and also following a guide so you know you're doing scenarios that are the best for you, AIMER7 has a great thorough guide that I tell everyone I know to follow as a guideline if you don't know exactly where your aim needs work: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1351275779",1586606683,1589035776,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198940121152,9,2,108291,6521,335,1602053588,,

IMO it is best used as a warmup before playing the game you want to improve in.  40 minutes, 4 exercises, don't strain yourself.  Take breaks.  Don't be hard on yourself about challenge scores.

47,68387314,english,"It's a good aim training tool, offering several different training scenarios for you to practice. Disclaimer that I've only used Kovaak's sandbox, so keep that in mind as you read my review.

I think the sheer number of scenarios you can try in Kovaak's matches or exceeds that of any competitor, which might make the price worth it compared to other free aim trainers for some people. On top of that, there's many different pre-made aim training guides which are tailored around Kovaak's, so getting started with a strict routine for improvement is easy. 

Having the leaderboards for each scenario is useful for benchmarking your performance with a specific routine and giving you a sense of which areas to work on the most. Though I don't believe the Kovaak's sandbox itself has any sort of in-game analytics or performance-tracking, the game can be set up to export cvs for each challenge completed for each scenario, and the community has created an online dashboard which visualizes your progress over time using those csv files (""FPS Aim Trainer Dashboard"").

One criticism I have is that in my experience, the game menus in sandbox are somewhat slow, unresponsive, and prone to freezing. Within the scenarios themselves, I have never noticed any issues with performance (no frame dropping, for example), but for example, searching for a specific scenario using the search function in sandbox takes longer than you would think, and clearing the search doesn't work with the ""x"" button either. Loading the game directly into sandbox also requires me to load into at least one other scenario before I can do anything. 

These kind of performance issues in sandbox definitely remind me that I paid money for the game (considering there are free alternatives), and it could be a complete turn-off for some people. However, my overall experience with the game as an aim trainer is positive, so I would recommend it (maybe avoid paying full price though).

After using Kovaak's aim trainer consistently every day for a week, I can say that I have experienced a noticeable increase in my in-game performance. I have more confidence in my aim, so even whiffing a few shots doesn't instantly tilt me anymore, and I noticed a massive increase in the number of headshots I land since I started training. 

Because I am seeing the results of Kovaak's paying off in-game after only one week, I would definitely recommend this game to someone who is willing to commit to a daily routine even at full price. 

However, if you're just curious in seeing how an aim trainer might work for you, I think it would be better to try one of the free trainers and see how you feel before pulling out your wallet for this one.",1588364325,1588710457,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198063096586,78,4,4920,0,936,1597291148,,

The whole thing just screams ""half assed"". 

There are some major oversights that just seem unprofessional. For instance, if you're often missing the targets that pop up on your right, the game will add more target on the right so that you can train yourself. Now that could be a good idea except that the dumbass who made this game doesn't account for the skewed proportions when it'll calculate the balancing next round. So first round it spawns 50-50 on your right/left, maybe you miss more on the right, maybe you miss more on the left. Balancing happens. Next round it spawns 70% to your right because that's the ones you missed. Question, when there's more targets on the right, guess which targets you're more likely to miss? Enter: the vicious cycle.

The first thing i did at that point is search for guides and routines and then kovaaks showed its true worth, a bunch of people support this game through the workshop and creating scenarios for this game its amazing the amount of excercises there are for this trainer as well as guides and routines to follow to improve substantially. Before coming to kovaaks true tips about how to get better and the science behind being a good aimer were scarce and few. However kovaaks has great people like Aimer7 backing it and explaining a lot of things about the wonderful subject of aiming and the science behind it through detailed guides. It honestly is the best 10 euro ive ever spent on anything and i regret not doing it earlier. Shortly after joining the kovaaks community aim labs recieved a few millions as an investment in it and they decided to spend it on advertising by hiring popular streamers instead of developing the game, and the worst thing of it all is that instead of enabling steam workshop on their game they opted for a custom ingame workshop that barely works.

In detail; Kovaak's allows, for the measly price of $10 USD, any person to train for any fps currently available in a way similar to how a gym works. By creating practice scenarios that only focus on one skill such Flicking and Tracking, or more specific scenario-based skills such as hitting with slower moving projectiles and quickly moving from target to target while scoped in. In 2.0 there's a directed training mode that, even though the game has a focus on Underwatch and 2 weeks, teaches you important skills that can be used in nearly any fps. While the Directed Training Mode is much more intuitive and even learns where you need help, it doesn't truly help you with game specific situations. But that's where the sandbox mode comes and the game's biggest issue also comes into play. The sandbox training mode has you download scenarios from the workshop. Most of the ones out there may not give you the training you need or they may be above your skill level in the first place, or may be for an entirely different game. Sadly, the way the workshop content is handled in the sandbox is perhaps too bare-bones and requires you to just kinda figure it out to find out what scenario works for you. Thankfully, the community content is focused and at the time of writing none of the scenarios are actually impossible nor are they far too easy to get any kind of meaningful learning from. With time, more people will create more content for more games and hopefully the workshop scenarios will be able to supplement the directed training. Overall, a great training tool that will only grow in value and currently worth the price as it stands while writing this review (4/25/20)",1587865445,1587865445,True,30,3,0.748142540454864502,0,True,False,False,76561198045754008,64,6,342,0,194,1588390079,,

I know this is an issue the developer said they were going to patch in the next update. I tried to compare the aim in paladins and kovaaks with sensitivity matcher, and although it was perfect for the 20 rotations, and did not go off mark, when I did it in kovaaks it was off by a pixel or two and that added up over 20 rotations. Not so bad. But I am not sure if the sensitivity matcher is accurate because it is made by the same developer. lols He seemed like a good guy and I am sure it will get figured out. Plus I do not know how there is not one single training exercise for spinning and shooting. For characters that require that, because of dashes and teleports, and also for anyone who is being flanked in any game.

Examples are Rainbow 6 Siege, Call of Duty games, and many other normal gun usage games. Fortnight is stuck in 3rd person mode all the time so if you wanna work on that you can. Overwatch uses random weapons that are main for its game. Another down fall of this is you can only work on ""Flick"" training for now. To be honest tracking and scoping are more important than flicking. Flicking requires speed over accuracy and if you are using this for other shooters you need accuracy. I have worked on the flick training and honestly not reliable. It takes to much work to move up and many of my shots were on point but didn't connect. The game also has a sandbox mode where you are able to kinda train on other things, but only shows shot hits and a K/D ratio.

Buat pemula FPS seperti gua, ini bener2 sangat membantu. Gua memakai kovak dalam Apex Legends. Dimana game nya 70% nya looting/keliling2 map dan 30% nya fighting

Dan fightingnya pun biasa hanya berlangsung singkat sekali, tau2 sudah mati... 

Melatih aim jadi sangat mudah dengan Kovaak, buat pemula seperti gua, gua belajar flick/click timing dan tracing, jadi lu bisa melatih aim tanpa perlu looting2 

Ada juga skenario 1 v 2 , 1 v 3 yang membuat lu bisa berlatih real fight / bukan lawan bot

Secara grafis memang ini tujuannya bukan untuk visual, tapi Kovaak sangat melatih timing dan muscle memory, 

Temen2 gua pun bilang aim gua meningkat, terutama dalam close range fight, thanks kovak, padahala baru 14 jam",1585375868,1585375868,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False,76561198115994737,15,1,1295,0,886,1587837226,,

59,65752087,english,"Pros: 
It's good for aim training. I can 100% see myself getting better at the game

Cons (get ready): 
A lot of stats are hidden, I can't see my shot accuracy, I have to have a calculator up to calculate my ""Flicks"" to ""Hit flicks"" to ""Targets Spawned""

The analytics are pretty much useless. It just shows you a target with hit markers as to where you hit it. Telling me if I missed to the left or right doesn't tell me if I over aimed or underaimed because they spawn on both sides.

Fucking robot limbs everywhere

I don't know what the fucking objective or pass conditions are for the levels. I just have to keep trying a million times until I just so happen to align the stars and pass the level. The instuctions are garbage too, level 2.1 tells you to practive speed rather than accuracy, but spawning 100 targets gets me nowhere and all the feedback is accuracy based.

""At this rate you'll pass the level in no time"" What the fuck was I doing wrong? 

No over time progression

Only flicking training right now

Neon backgrounds make the change my crosshair every level

No real reaction time trainer. If I'm playing Rainbow 6, genociding 6million robots in .4 seconds doesn't help me at all when holding an angle and waiting to shoot.

Some of the lables need more explaining, what is under 5m? 5 meters? From what? There's nothing there, but 5-8m is the majority of my shots all on target. 5 miliseconds? I doubt I'm nailing 30-50 robots under 8ms but 0 under 5

64,65047674,english,"My verdict? ""Partial Pass Condition"".

This trainer has so much potential, but it's SO frustrating and at times buggy.

Sometimes you'll get stuck with long pauses or blank screens.

The trainer will tell you that speed is more important than accuracy, and then on the exact same page also tell you that accuracy is more important than speed (before giving you a game where speed is the only option because the target life is so short anyway).

Robot gibs will inexplicably fly towards you, obscuring your sight lines and breaking your concentration.

And most frustratingly, it'll leave you stuck on the same level for dozens and dozens and dozens of attempts, and no matter how well you think you did, it'll fail you (""partial pass"") without actually telling you WHY it failed you. Then it'll say you did great and you'll probably pass ""soon"", before going on to fail you a few more dozen times for no clear reason.

It took me a matter of minutes to get to level 2.3 and then I've been stuck there for hour after hour after hour of play time (currently >15hrs) invested over multiple days, with zero sense of progress and no idea why it won't let me continue. There's only so many times you can be told to replay the same level for no apparent reason before you start wanting to throw something out the window.

It's so nearly what it deserves to be, but it desperately needs more work on the reward schedule in the trainer (and an editable FOV there too) before it deserves a recommendation.",1584218492,1584310757,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561197971166919,301,1,1168,0,203,1584362753,,

blank screen after last update, please solve that problem as soon as possible

------------- after struggling for 3 days -------------
yes i solved this problem for now. the fact is we cannot successfully connect to the training mode server. However, we can still access the sandbox server. it is because Kovaak forces us to connect to its meta server before switching to sandbox mode, that we cannot get into the game but sadly face the blank screen until it crashes.
Think about that, it is not possible that everyone has the same networking environment.
now you know what the problem is, please give us an update and solve the problem as soon as possible! (i'll introduce a temporary solution below in Chinese)
and it will be even better if you give support for Chinese language, i'm glad to help if you need.

经过我的尝试，只要在打开游戏的时候先把网络断掉，Kovaak就不会持续黑屏，而是会提示说连不进去training模式的服务器，让我们顺利进入沙盒模式，然后再把网连上，就可以正常下载新的scenarios以及访问排行榜了。这显然是他们程序员做的网络功能做的不够好导致的问题，就想之前很多评论提到的，新更新的meta真的是差劲，我一玩儿apex的，你一练枪软件凭什么就更新支持和fortnite和overwatch的新功能，根本没考虑到用户的需求。想法是好的，正确的做法应该是把这个新功能独立出去，做另外一款软件，让用户各取所需

i can't help myself to give you more suggestions. it would be much better if you divide that training mode to another individual game from the sandbox mode. i've read many complaining about the training mode. many of us play games other than fortnite or overwatch, and we don't need it at all, and it even brings us so many bugs.",1583816488,1583907853,False,15,9,0.495649039745330811,0,True,False,False,76561198091236704,147,2,3828,2,1159,1601905332,,

When I started playing this game I was around 15% accuracy at my high points..  In less than a week I am now up over 30%...  I am shocked.  I have seen an improvement in APEX; so there is a direct correlation.  

*Side note: it is not as easy as sit down and play if you want to tune it to a specific game.  For Apex I had to use some videos and blogs to get the settings right and pick the right scenarios to practice.

Also I made a powershell file to parse out the CSVs and a Power BI dashboard to show and track my daily progress.  I will try to post this code and dashboard later.

Now back to the review.

Beware of the new ""Train"" mode. It's a bold statement from developers to claim that their training routines will help you. Expect wave of negative reviews after months with comment that Train mode has ruined aim of those players.

For example from my experience with other aim trainer - training routine ""flickshot as many big targets as possible in a given time"" had really bad affect on me, because I have started to subconsciously panicshooting into general direction of enemy (to at least try to randomly hit them in a given short time) instead of giving them a solid headshot. As soon as I have noticed this new patter in my aiming style - I have switched to different training mode with as small targets as possible, to train precision instead of speed. And my result in the games has improved since then.
I can already say this game's first row of flicking train routines will have a bad result on me. Been there, done that.

Don't get me wrong, it is of course great that they provide list of training routines and progression, and etc. It is fun to challenge yourself and complete them. But right now they will force teach you some bad habits. This kind of coaching should be done under supervision of trained professional, and not by some scripted game.

Another point - aim precision extremely depends on FOV (view angle in game). I can't even change it in the game int the Train mode. I don't even know what is default fov in Train mode. And what if I play different game with different fov? Noone should train on this game's default fov and then try to go back to his favorite game with different fov and expect improvements, result may be even worse after that.


tl;dr: developers have no idea about human physiology related to aiming. They will ruin your aim skills if you will blindly trust them and train according to their list.
There are a lot of things to consider about aim training. Players should not think about that, this has to be considered and done by ""aim trainer"" developers. But developers don't do that in this trainer.

Just use the old sandbox mode and enjoy nice workshop maps.",1579573804,1582404878,False,2,1,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,76561198042093172,216,43,250,0,50,1599424768,1579631492.0,"Thanks for taking the time to leave a review. 

We don’t pretend to have all the answers as there is no surefire “one size fits all” solution for improvement. What works for you might not work for someone else. We have done more than a bit of research into training fine motor skills and decided to test the speed-accuracy tradeoff hypothesis that training speed over accuracy at the outset results in performance gains. This proved out well in our alpha testing last summer, as our players saw significant improvement. 

With more data from more players, we should be able to effectively tune this and hopefully optimize the experience for more players. 

So, we consider the trainer to be part of the process, not the whole thing. Which is why we suggest and link to Sandbox scenarios for players to practice once they unlock them in the Sandbox. 

That said, we deeply value your opinion and know that, together, we can build the best trainer for the most gamers!

After using Kovaak for only 4 hours I have noticed a drastic improvement for my aim on CS:GO and I do think it's a good 'game'.

So why am I not recommending it? I wish I could have a neural response to add to it and my main reasons are that this is solely community driven. I personally wouldn't play it and I believe the majority of players wouldn't play it if it wasn't so community driven. You could argue that they still built the base mechanics but even that is something that can be done with little knowledge of game design and done in an hour or two tops.

All this to say, I think it should be free, since it's a community driven game. I do think there's going to be something better coming along that holds the same principles but adds more elements such as playing alongside your friend in a similar fashion to Osu!.

After about my 20th hour of Kovaak, my aim is way, way better than it used to be. I'm not close to perfect, but at least I can compete now with M&K. 

I do remember the first ~5 hours were very stressful, knowing how awful I was compared to everyone else on the leaderboard (I scored dead last on one of them). Now I'm above the Median on most things I try, and that feels good.

The guides that Aimer7 has contributed to the FPS scene truly illustrates and elaborates on the nuances and intricacies that many high-level FPS players employ and very honestly, pretty much make KovaaK's worth your money alone.

It can be hard to fully commit to long-term improvement over a daily routine, so all in all, I would recommend purchasing KovaaK's during a Steam sale.

Great levels to choose from by default, with many online ones to download. The level creator is good and has some basic settings. I wish there were more scripting options. 

As a closing to this, you will not benefit at all if you are not an educated user. You have to know the measurements for your mousepad, your dpi to pixel ratios, and the way each game changes those variables. If you don't you're building on nothing.

94,59262423,english,"I recently took down my review of KovaaK 2.0 as there has been major changes to fulfil community requests

After the most recent update it seems that the aim trainer now has TWO major sections, Sandbox and Trainer.

Sandbox-
probably the most attractive part about this, and what all older players are use to. you can download custom maps from the community workshop to train in your own way and style, there is also a challenge mode where you have 1 minute to try and score as many points as possible. 

Trainer-
something new i found to be interesting, its like a workout routine where after you improve you progress to a harder and more difficult level, there is currently 1 game mode, flicking. however 2 more are supposedly coming, tracking and scope. it seems that this game mode is only for overwatch and fortnite as those are the only 2 games available. however it seems it doesn't matter. it also seems to be very detailed as the targets aren't spheres or squares, but actual player models

FINAL VERDICT
this is currently the best aim trainer on the market, most people flocked to this in 1.0 which has now become the sandbox mode, this should be your MAIN reason to purchase this game as it is super simple and effective. trainer seems to be very promising in the future and if you don't feel like you are improving because of sandbox, give trainer a try.",1575524330,1581047993,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198878297205,24,2,1468,8,1111,1601436109,,

OLD REVIEW - THE GAME IS BETTER NOW vvv

I played this game a whole lot and it really helped me with getting better at aiming, which has been my greatest challenge in fps games. This most recent update, though, has completely ruined the game for me. The appeal of the game was the absolute 100% customizability and simplicity of it. You could train whatever part of your aim for whatever game you wanted (vertical aim, tracking, flicking, etc. etc. etc.). The new update destroyed that positive about the game. Now, when you launch it, you have to agree to a third party EULA AND provide your blizzard or Epic Games account in order to even use the game (even if you don't play ANY games from blizzard or epic)... Even after maneuvering the new, confusing ui, and getting to the main game that people bought (and not some random crappy fortnite simulator), you will see that all of your settings have been reset and the gun model has become about twice the size, blindingly white, and super distracting, along with everything on your screen becoming blurry as hell.

I didn't play the first release, but from what I just played, it looks extremely promising. I am loving the flicking stages, and like how it starts easy and slowly gets more challenging. In between stages, there's a recommended sandbox scenario to practice on, which I've been using because it's a focused training level for flicking. I'm assuming these kinds of recommended scenarios will also be added for the tracking and scoping modes

After the stages, the reviews of where your shots landed are super helpful so you know what direction to improve in. You're even given the option to spawn more targets in whichever direction your aim is weak in

DO NOT BUY THIS GAME IN ITS CURRENT STATE.

Recent reviews speak for themselves, and it's true. This game was once one of if not the best aim trainers around. KovaaK sold his game to 'The Meta' which I wouldn't be surprised if they were affiliated with Daybreak (thick skull game devs that don't listen to community feedback). This game is garbage now: many of the customization features were removed, you can only choose to 'train' for Fortnite and Overwatch, you need to create an account and include an Epic ID, and let's not forget the god awful UI and cringy menu music. Any rational person should know that this is a ridiculous decision and will kill the game, but coming from a company named 'The Meta,' I'm not really surprised. Have fun with your new dead game.

I will leave my review here for the sake of backstory until the new and remade 2.0 update comes live, but in light of these turn of events I am hopeful. Original review below:

New update. You're greeted with a new login screen where you suddenly need an account. I never needed one before. Then when you register you' are forced to choose either Fortnite or Overwatch and enter your in-game ID for the one of your choice. Why would I want to give that out? Why do they need that information?

I got this aim trainer to simply shake off some dust of my aim in Apex Legends which uses a modified Source engine, hence most training maps designed for Counter-Strike and other Source games worked perfectly.

Apparently those custom made exercises are still available somewhere but why on earth do I suddenly give out email adress and Fortnite/Overwatch accounts to access the product? This doesn't seem right in the slightest. This is not the game/trainer I bought half a year ago.

Sadly, I doubt Steam's refund policy covers this.",1575577355,1577289483,False,3,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,76561198039764947,344,1,571,46,490,1601393059,,

64,59303860,english,"First legitimate review + some advice, sorry if a bit all over the place.

I spent approximately a rounded 200 whopping hours grinding my aim in KovaaK's FPS Aim Trainer and I definitely noticed improvements more so specifically in my mouse control and the appearance of my aim also looked smoother across the board as my friends began noticing and would compliment my aim fairly often.

If you're looking to zone out to The Glitch Mob's Drink the Sea album and not think for several hours and aim at a hitbox, then the game is great... but if you're trying to legitimately improve your aim and dm than I highly suggest avoiding aim trainers because the artificial scenario training system that aim trainers provides more often than not builds bad habits and doesn't always provide the same 'aim under pressure' scenarios that actual gameplay provides. You tend to also develop tunnel vision and suffer from usual aimer symptoms that I noticed after more than half a dozen years of competing in various FPS games with aim-heavy players (i.e standing still, holding W, not being able to comm on your microphone and play at the same time, etc.).

Tl;dr - A lot of the features that KovaaK's provides CAN legitimately improve your aim and mouse control, but what is actually going to get you to where you want to be is focusing on your dm in actual scenarios in your games rather than relying on this artificial gameplay.

Something else I noticed about the game and more so specifically the Discord servers and Steam groups formed from the game are pretty reminiscent to MENSA in my opinion, where many of the players grind scenarios for scores rather than to build on their aim and many of the players who grind to place high on the leaderboards only really do so  to gain ""popularity points"" or even sometimes the social benefits in the Discord itself which I feel distracts players from legitimately seeking to improve.",1575579067,1576502201,False,1,0,0.504166662693023682,0,True,False,False,76561198074213978,146,8,10771,0,10347,1598626032,,

At 36 I'm a pretty below average FPS player but I was sick of getting beaten down and figured I'd check out this app I'd heard so much about. I'm so glad I did, I was concerned that the scenarios in game wouldn't translate to the FPS games I play and at first it really didn't. It's a bit overwhelming with hundreds of scenarios that are attempting to teach multiple different aiming techniques and styles.

I stuck with it though and it really wasn't until I found Sparky's Benchmarks and Aimer7's guide that things took off. These gave me something to strive for and really opened my eyes to how much I well... sucked. So I started playing their recommended scenarios, just trying to beat my personal records and get somewhere close to their benchmarks. I'm finally seeing tangible results! I've seen my KD increase in every FPS I play. In Apex it nearly tripled. I've noticed things about my mouse control and my mental approach to aiming that I hadn't even thought of before. The differences between arm aim vs wrist vs hybrid. How you shoot a fast strafing, close up target, how to deal with multiple targets at a distance... you can basically find weaknesses you have, then use the Kovaak's scenarios to grind that exact scenario over and over until it becomes natural, ever tried vertical tracking? Yeah me neither, at least not explicitly; it's a lot harder than I thought.

It's so much more satisfying playing competitive shooters when you actually ARE competitive. I feel like Kovaak's has given me the tools to improve my game with it's hundreds of scenarios and customization options. I practice 15-30m a day sometimes more depending, it's fun and really satisfying trying to break your records and seeing yourself improve.

[strike] -After 2 years the game is still unable to set solid wall colors, generally looks tacky. [/strike]
[strike]UPDATE: VERY CLEAN CUSTOMIZATION! VERY CLEAN COLOR SELECTION! AWESOME![/strike]
 UPDATE: See below.

[strike] -Mouse counts aren't read properly during fast motion. [/strike]
[strike] UPDATE: MOUSE INPUT IS BUTTER SMOOTH NOW. VERY SATISFYING! [/strike]
 
[strike] -Unable to create lists of scenarios or manage folders without tedious hacking into the game files. Devs claim to have it in their plans for past 2 years, no effort towards any changes. [/strike] 
[strike]UPDATE: THERE IS NOW A SKILL TREE OF SCENARIOS AND SKILLS, AND SEEMS TO HAVE A PLAYLIST FEATURE AVAILABLE SOON. [/strike]

-Menus load [strike] slowly. [/strike] 
[strike]UPDATED: New UI is very cute, and routes into the old ui in the sandbox but with an improved engine and lighting. Menus load faster but can still use more work in terms of LOAD SPEED / LATENCY. Very happy that it finally received an update. BETTER THAN BEFORE.[/strike]

-Toxic community
UPDATED: This is still mostly true. ""Offended by everything"" type of SJWs have far more logical and emotional resilience than most of the boastful, governing-circle-jerk community members. This point is irrelevant if you keep to yourself and just focus on improving. Buy whatever mouse and mousepad suits your comfort and preference, and grind away. Anyway, while you're chatting, you're not improving. 
SECOND UPDATE: The community is literally so toxic they bullied the main dev into reverting the entire update but not a word to the company. They didn't even keep the small improvements, they just bullied the devs into undoing the entire update because it didn't plump up their ""elitist"" idea of themselves. Check the streams, they launched it and instantly started whining over updates they asked for in the past and trolled through the first 2 levels then ALT-F4 and rage quit then ran to their circlejerk discord to bully the dev. Forget this game, just go for free alternatives like Aim Labs or Aim Hero. Better communities and devs actually discuss feedback and improve not just pander to loudest, proudest, lowest iq legoheads. Trash community was so bad they never even took notice of distance hit-miss feedback, target adjusting, lighting and input improvements. They asked for leaderboards outside of steam and then cried when they needed to login for it. Actually sad, imagine being a game dev, you work hard into a product, then you move up in life from your hard work, move your product into a direction to better compete with competitors in the future, and all you have to hear is toxic screeching 40 y.o. boomers that make up 90% of your unfortunate community, and you're stuck with the choice of either pandering under the toxicity to milk more cash out or jumping ship and getting hunted throughout the internet by a mass of losers because you made a name for yourself and they'll stalk you everywhere you go to try to develop. Ridiculous. 
 
[strike] -Basically the stock unreal engine with free default assets and a bot AI that generates pseudo-random circular motions but resold as a ""game"". Again, no updates or leaks of updates for years. 
Not really worth the $10. Worth a giggle if you get it on sale but theres free alternatives that receive more updates. This one appears to have been abandoned. Save your money for a future ""2"" release maybe? Who knows. [/strike] 
[strike] UPDATED! THE GAME UPDATED! IT IS KOVAAK 2.0 NOW, HUGE CHANGES, WITH WORD OF FUTURE UPDATES! GAME NOW USES ITS OWN 3D MODELS WHICH ARE VERY AESTHETICALLY CLEAN, AS WELL AS ENEMY MODELS, AND PLAYER MODELS. UI GOT A BIG CHANGE, AT LEAST ITS A BIG STEP UP FROM THE OLD ONE. AESTHETICALLY CLEAN AND SIMPLE BUT HAS A NICE HINT OF CREATIVITY. THERE IS NEW FEEDBACK SYSTEM, OFFICIAL SCENARIO SKILL SCORING. [/strike]
Kiss my ass. 

[strike]THE NEW UPDATE AND THE UPCOMING UPDATES EASILY MAKE THIS GAME WORTH MORE THAN IT'S COST. WOULD NOW HIGHLY RECOMMEND BUYING OR GIFTING TO A FRIEND WHILE ITS STILL $10. 

AMAZING CHRISTMAS GIFT TO GET ANY GAMER. ;) [/strike]

EDIT: What the actual fuck just happened!!?!?!? You destroyed the game. I cant even register, and its making me use my fucking fortnite account, even though I quit fortnite months ago and Ive been using this nonstop for CSGO and Halo MCC. WTF!!! give me my money back or the old game back!!!

EDIT2: I finally got into the game after figuring out how to register as it only accepts specific characters for the password and doesnt accept other characters. I went straight to the Sandbox mode and immediately noticed some issues. 1. My FPS went from 150-200 down to 80 or even below 60 on some faster scenarios. This renders it basically unplayable for me. 2. The sounds and colors got overriden by some horrible sounding sound affects. I went into the settings and managed to fix the sounds back to what they were, but the colors for the targets are still stuck at a nasty piss-yellow color. Luckily the crosshair color can be changed still. Overall I pretty much cant play this until the FPS issues are fixed at least.

Did someone smooth out your frontal lobes with an angle grinder? What kinda reprobate troglodyte thought that this update is gonna be passable, and what bumbling buffoon could have ever considered this a ""new and improved version"". I think a good parallel to that would be me getting neurosyphilis and calling it an improvement to my overall health. I swear how does someone who had a brain-brick transplant get in a position to fuck with such games as Kovaak's. I thought that picking the extra chromosome special package at birth was a disqualifying factor, I was certainly proven wrong.

You can use a calculator online to see what sens this is for other titles. Follow a routine for one hour a day at least 5 days a week to improve your tracking as well as reactions and you will see insane improvements. Honestly I can't thank this game enough.

For a solid update all they needed to do was to make an option to disable the loading-in of *every single* Workshop item when you first load up the game - and perhaps release this new mode as an optional beta.

Will change the review to a positive one when the game is fixed because Kovaak's sandbox is still very good.

Here's the rub.

The flicking training that is out now is lazy. In a game about aiming, I'm unsure what changed from the first iteration to make the aiming of the shooty stick so awful. What used to be responsive target practice has now devolved into me walking my mouse off my desk and out into the yard for it to frolic in the beautiful fields on wheat. It's almost as if the vertical sensitivity is off from top to bottom. Feelsbadman

If they figure out how to make this better, great! I love the idea.

 For someone who wants to grind a game to get better at aim, consistency is important. That's why the new update is pissing people off, it's not improving upon what's always been there, but adding new things that core audience don't want to cater the new players.

 The amount of aim trainers out there are increasing, and the number of people who's willing to grind trainer everyday is not a lot, most people try it and quit.  kovaak's had a healthy amount of dedicated audience and now it's sacrificing the quality of life of them to attract the new players, who, for the majority won't play this game for more than 1 hour.

83,58287260,english,"Made me less bad and helped me understand my aim.

[u]About my aim history: [/u] All my life I've been ridiculously oblivious about my aim - just accepting any mouse sensitivity that a game threw at me and never realize how my mind behaved to my 3D zone. Every time with every new game I had mouse sensitivity set to game's default and used to try adjusting to it by making minor tweaks. Though it helped me, it was a far cry from developing consistency. Was never critical about my aim until I started getting my buns handed to me in Rainbow Six: Siege which is my first competitive FPS shooter and it is harsh. Now Siege isn't your regular shooter like where you can effortlessly run and gun people. You get only 1 life per round and you need to make it count for your team. Over that, your death can negatively impact the entire round / team plus you need to dynamically strategize how to approach the enemy and site based on your in-game consciousness and situational awareness.

So, here I am. I wish to improve my aim to a point where it becomes my second nature to precisely be able to  click (while control recoil) as soon as I see an enemy's head on the screen. So that I can think about other things in game and to be able to strategize on-the-go to have an edge over the enemy team without worrying / focusing on my aim too much.

I did a bit of research on aiming in general and muscle memory and can definitely vouch for the fact that - One should not expect immediately results while training, muscle memory accumulates overtime just like experience.

I'm just over 20 hours in - so couldn't find anything ground breaking about it. I'm still crap, and it's my fault for ignoring my aim for past 10 years. I'm a casual gamer with a busy work life though. However, with persistent grind and practice, you will definitely see improvement over time. It might take me months or years to accomplish what I wish to but I can certainly tell you that improving your aim will help you have a better experience at FPS games overall not just Siege - be it getting stomped by skilled opponents who are way better than you or you shredding through your opponents like butter.

[b][u]Few tips based on my research: [/u][/b]
1. Though debatable, low sens most of the time is better than high sens in terms of accuracy. So I'd suggest lowering your mouse DPI to your comfort. If currently feel comfortable with your high sensitivity, then step out of our comfort zone and try lower sens for a few days. I'd suggest starting off by 5-6 inches per 360 and work your way down as you practice.

2. Muscle memory is comparatively easier to accumulate on lower sensitivity than using something like 1500 DPI where you're able to do a 360 within 3 inches of surface area on your mouse pad. It takes me 9.67 inches to do a 360 on my mouse pad at 500 DPI. I'm not telling you that you should be able to a quick 360 in-game. [b]Inches per 360 here is just a measure[/b] of how low/high your sens is.

3. Do NOT keep changing your sensitivity drastically just because you had a bad day at a game. If you do so, you'll only hinder your consistency. Think maybe the opponent was better than you? Or maybe your mind is still developing an understanding towards the sensitivity? Just chill, enjoy the game and keep the grind going.

4. Contrary to above, also don't be afraid to make minor tweaks to your sensitivity. You feel comfortable at 8 inches per 360 instead of 8.25? Sure, tweak it. Remember you are learning. However, don't do this too often and think through before making an 8 to something like 7.

5. Try to have the same mouse sensitivity i.e. same inches or cm. per 360 in all the FPS or TPS games you play. Just measure your 360 turn in centimeters from the game you're practicing and apply the same in other games. This is help you build consistency overtime.

[b][u]Few personal tips while playing any game:[/u][/b]

1. Blame yourself when you lose, not others.

2. You need to get better for yourself and to have a better experience while gaming and NOT to flex in front of your friends or to demean your team mates.

3. Be very self-reflective i.e. always criticize yourself not your team mates. Remember, there's always something you could've done better.

4. Your team mate did something wrong or incorrect? Tell them what they should've done and why but not shout at them. But don't try too much to teach them how to play unless they want to learn from you or take your advise. They very well know how to play, it's just their choice on how they want to play.

5. When you ignore your own mistakes and blame it on your team, you will NEVER learn from your own mistakes. You are simply reinforcing your own mind from learning by not accepting things that could've been done better. Never do this.

6. Most importantly, no matter how tense the time is or was, how bad your mind might urge you for the win - always remember, it's just a freaking game. Memories you create while gaming are far more important than screaming / shouting at your friends to win a silly game. Not everyone is equal when it comes to learning anything in life.

To actually benefit you have to do use it right. It's a tool, not a magic steroid that'll instantly make you a god at aiming. If you don't use the tool right, you won't benefit. If you really want to benefit, I recommend reading Aimer7's guide and mostly using the scenarios he recommends. I don't think you have to follow it exactly, but use it as a starting point. Make sure to match your FOV and sensitivity settings with the game you want to get better at. I suggest measuring your sensitivity with a ruler to make sure you don't mismatch it and throw yourself off. I also don't recommend overusing it. If you're spending too much time on it when you could be playing a game for real, it's probably not an efficient use of time.

Using Aimer7 guide (available on his twitch channel page) and practicing daily or sometimes over the week, will improve your aiming habits a lot. Also, if you want to actually learn to aim while MOVING (most scenarios you are a turret, sadly), you can find a couple of good moving scenarios such as 'Pasu Dodge', 'Pasu Track Dodge', 'Air Dodge', 'Anti-Mirror' scenarios, 'lgc3 Reborn'. 'T1 Drop Punish', 'Pistol Strafe Gallery' and more!

I recommend reading Aimer7's guide and mostly using the scenarios he recommends. I don't think you have to follow it exactly, but use it as a starting point. Make sure to match your FOV and sensitivity settings with the game you want to get better at. I suggest measuring your sensitivity with a ruler to make sure you don't mismatch it and throw yourself off.

I also don't recommend overusing it. If you're spending too much time on it when you could be playing a game for real, it's probably not an efficient use of time.

I thought I had decent aim but i felt it was lacking at times so I decided to try kovaak's. At first I was disappointed at how simple the top rated games were and I was skeptical that it would translate into other games. On top of that the challenges felt very taxing on my brain and I would get burnt out after 20 minutes. The median scores were surprisingly high and seemed out of reach. However I kept playing for 20 minutes a day during my down time and within a week the challenges were no longer exhausting me mentally and became very fun. I found myself playing kovaak's over my other fps games, trying to top my high scores and climb the leaderboards became very addictive, especially coupled with the fact that I knew I was becoming a better gamer in the process. Now after just  3 weeks of playing I consistantly score in the top 80-90%. I've noticed a huge impact in other fps games; I get compliments on my aim from spectating teamates regularly now. This game also was immensely helpful in finding my optimal DPI and sens, which i was way off from and had no clue.

This game has made my other shooter games more fun as I'm better at them now. This is possibly the best $10 I've ever spent on a game.

77,54304478,english,"This is coming from someone who had good aim before they used Kovaaks Aim Trainer. For starters, don't think using an aim trainer will automatically make you a god at the games you play. Refining aim is like taking the frame of a car, getting the best parts, washing it, and polishing it. Then using it to rule over the people who didn't do what you did, and it allows you to keep up with the people who have also got the best parts, washed it, and polished it. But the people who refined there engines will always dominate the people who refined there frames. What I'm really trying to get at here is game sense and decision making dominate good aim. You can have an aimbot but get dominated by a pro with a ball mouse, without the right knowledge of the game. Kovaaks Aim Trainer worked really well for me. I started in the 4 digit area of the leaderboards an in about 13 hours of gameplay made it to top 100. I use it to prep for a gaming session as it gives me the best ability I can have aim wise. It has also brought me to a point where I feel like I'm improving in my aim at a really fast pace. Kovaaks Aim Trainer hit right in the spots I needed. Now taking the information I gave you here I hope you can see if this this game is right for you.

90,54093993,english,"I've always been pretty good at first person shooters. First BR was pubg, was extremely inconsistent and was only good with teamwork/strategic play. Was tired of getting fucked up in pubg and moved to fortnite. Got pretty damn good at fortnite but was still inconsistent with aiming, and i carried myself through the game by just being a great builder. Was so tired of both pubg and fortnite that i was just about done with gaming in general for a bit till the gaming industry shaped up. Apex legends released and i was hooked instantly. As my love for the game grew, so did my desire to be a competent, skilled shooter. I started browsing for aim trainers,  and found kovaaks and bought it. Barely used it for a few weeks, and even tried to refund it... Glad i didn't.


At first i started off by doing random scenarios that looked fun. Eventually noticed that i wasn't making progress so i looked up a guide and found aimer 7's. Started at the very beginning to build a great foundation, did a whole sensitivity/dpi overhaul and it's all been uphill from that point. I've grown to be extremely competent and very consistent and i constantly improve. My best advice it to dedicate ATLEAST 30 minutes to kovaaks a day. Always take 1-2 day break every other week or some. This will let you improve much faster. I dedicate anywhere from 30minutes to 1 1/2 hours of my time to kovaaks every day.


Is it worth $10? Fuck yes it is. Don't buy it if you want a quick fix to your shitty aim. Your improvement is based on how persistent you are with it. I didn't start kovaaks just to be a tryhard. I started kovaaks to have more fun in games. The better i am, the more happy i am in games. 

I'd like to thank kovaaks for helping me have an enhanced gaming experience, and for allowing me to meet awesome people that comes along with being decent at any given game.

All of them can cover games like CSGO, Fortnite, Siege, Overwatch, you name it. I personally play Siege, TF2, and Call of Duty. I’ve seen growth in all games thanks to this tool in terms of aim, you won’t be a god just by playing this for 1 hour. Make sure to use it as a way to warm up and never overtrain. 1-2 hour train sessions for me are so boring and accomplish nothing but tiring me out mentally and physically. But back on track. The different scenarios cover many thinks like tracking, flicks, hell even recoil controls. Some even have mini games like Quake. All of these mini games keep training interesting and fresh. There’s always something new to try out. The game runs smoothly. Once the workshop content loads. It’s all smooth as butter.

33,53018431,english,"As I write this review, KovaaK's FPS Aim Trainer is my favorite of its kind. Its a bare-bones, ultra-customizable program that is fully capable of providing a workout for your FPS (and even your TPS) niche. Yes, it comes with a price tag, but for those looking to get the most of out a training program I recommend the investment. It should go without saying that KovaaK's (or any aim trainer for that matter) is not a magic formula for improving your FPS game. You'll need to apply yourself and commit. You may also need to do a little research on good mouse/recommended DPI settings, in conjunction with a training routine that is right for your current skill level. And as always, KovaaK's can greatly improve your reflexes and hand-eye coordination, but gamesense is something best learned on the field. Highly recommended.

Kovaaks is a game of process, and I would only recommend this FPS trainer if you have the will and time to train your raw aim. It took me 80 hours of 'tracking only' to see significant results. Don't get this game if you think playing Tile Frenzy to warm up for your Apex session because you can literally download CS:GO and play Aimbotz for free.

33,50967193,english,"This game is wonderful. I bought it after my friend started playing it, and right off the bat i loved it. I saw improvements in my aim immediately. The sens converter alone makes this game worth buying (off the context that you know its an aim trainer). The maps though which is the other 50% of this game, just makes Kovaaks 50% more amazing. The staple maps are GREAT like Ascended training v3/Pressure aiming 7 targets/and all the title frenzy's to state a few. With the hundreds and hundreds of other maps been and being created open up so many opportunities and possibility's. The game runs very smoothly and its so simple, but hits the aim trainer holy grail design philosophy nail straight on the head.

I do have slight criticisms though. I bought this game specifically for training my aim in Rainbow six, and here is where one of the only bugs/lack of features I've encountered. If you are in full screen and you tab out, it doesn't minimize the window. Another thing is that if you have a second game open for whatever reason like you are waiting for a queue to pop, the mouse wont be anchored to the center of the screen once you start a map. That means if you move your mouse and start to shoot, you WILL click off the screen over and over again, because you move your mouse a lot during this game of course lol (which is another dumb thing about full screen in this game, it doesn't keep your mouse inside your main monitor). The last thing is how you change mouse sens for specific guns per each map. In each specific map It gives you a lot more control for gun sens, like zoom sens and FOV. The problem though is that its way too annoying, there are so many random guns in some maps for some reason that don't even have settings for sens, and some that do have sens options but don't do anything if you do change them. I ask if kovaak would just force map devs to put the main gun with the ACTUAL sens options in a new tab he would patch into the game that only has sens settings for that map and nothing else. (so custom cross hairs and whatever else can stay in its original tab)

How i would rate this game outta 50 is 49/50. it completes its task better than every other game for aim training, it has intuitive mechanics, easy to understand useful maps, and a really extensive range of map pools with an amazing sens converter, with nominal annoyances altogether.

It's nice to get closer to my old skill level and it's really satisfying to play well (even got called a smurf :D). 

==Sort of negatives

If you're looking for a game, there isn't one, at least from what I've seen so far. The game to me is the challenge you set for yourself, trying to break your own PR. I mean that should be obvious, but just in case you were thinking there was an actual game behind this. You would be mistaken.

The UI is ugly as heck and can be a little wonky at times. 

For some reason I have to click play for the challenge to start, but it just starts instantly. Would be fantastic if there was a count down before the challenge started. 

Overall, 100% worth it so far. It's actually been fun grinding and trying to beat my numbers and hearing the little ding sounds.

Add a change existing bind notification or go even further and allow us to bind a total of TWO KEYS TO ONE BUTTON!  (Which most fps games allow) I know totally radical ideas right?!?!

Unfortunately the engine isn't exposing which monitor to select to me, so I can't even make it an option without digging into a lot of things right now.  But there is a workaround.

When you are in game (and not in menus), press alt+enter, then use windows key+arrow (left or right) twice, then alt+enter again.  It should move to the correct monitor and be full-screened.  Sorry for the inconvenience.

Also, I see you are probably outside of Steam's refund window based on time played.  If you are still having troubles and want a refund for the game, I'd be happy to paypal you the money.  HMU on Steam if you want to talk about that (I sent a friend req)."

17,41433959,english,"Easily the best aim trainer on Steam. This actually helps training 3D aim unlike the many other aim trainers which are either restricted to 2D aim or flick training. If you want to hone your tracking skills this trainer is definitely for you. There are less options for flick practice, but a free trainer like Aimtastic is already sufficient for that. 

The customisability (both in terms of UI/graphics/input and in terms of practice scenarios) is fantastic. No matter which game you're playing you can easily replicate it in this aim trainer. The wide selection of scenarios from the Workshop makes it even more comfortable. 

On the technical side of things it's pretty much flawless as well. FPS cap can be set high enough, input lag is low (although a cl_input_subframe setting like in Reflex would be nice) and the most important yaw values for sensitivity multiplication are present as well. The only thing missing would be a full integration of Povohat's accel driver, but you can use just that of course. 

In short: Don't waste money on Aim Hero or similar stuff and get this aim trainer instead, it's definitely worth it.",1523541098,1523541098,True,2,0,0.54356849193572998,0,True,False,False,76561198053322619,303,6,5613,0,60,1600117283,,
18,41426025,english,"Would I recommend this game?
Yes.

Do I think this game is a reasonable price?
Yes.

Has the game got any technical issues or bugs?
No bugs as far as I can tell. There seems to be the occasional frame drop when a bot spawns, this could be due to my PC as it drops like this in other games too.

Has this game helped me with my aim?
Yes, only a short time on this game really improved my muscle memory for tracking. 

Does this game contain the features promised?
Yes, I can manipulate the bots and there are many preset modes for different styles of aiming such as tracking, flicking and predicting enemy movement. 

Really happy I bought this. Extremely challenging modes that are sure to help me on this
