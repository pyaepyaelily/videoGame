1,Sid Meier's Civilization® V,34137538,english,"(Note: I am reviewing Civilization 6 with all of the expansions and the New Frontier Pass in mind)

It's a really fun Civilization game to play when you want to switch it up, but it's not quite as good as Civilization 5. If it had these main things then I would consider this my go to Civ game:

1. A better world congress. Civ 5's world congress was PERFECT and besides the fact that the AI loved to ban luxuries for no real reason, it was great. It allowed for trade embargoes, world ideologies / religions, and other sanction-like resolutions to be passed. Civ 6's world congress acts as a competition for temporary bonuses rather than a true international council. The worst resolution in Civ 6 has to be the one that removes a player's nuclear stockpile if passed. This is like if the UN voted for the complete disarmament of the United State's nuclear arsenal and the next day it completely disappeared. Not realistic at all! Also, I do miss how the world congress was created in Civ 5, where it was only founded when someone discovered all of the civilizations in the world. I don't like the idea of having a world congress session and not knowing who the other players participating in the votes are.

2. It needs a better ideology system similar to Civ 5. The moment when you get to pick an ideology in Civ 5 is always fun. Whether it's fascism, communism, or democracy, being able to influence another Civilization's government to flip to your ideology is one of the best parts of Civ 5. This can create Cold War like scenarios between the superpowers of the atomic era. Seeing my friend's empires on multiplayer hanging on by a thread as they try to keep their ideology alive despite their large of amount of dissidents, only to end up flipping to join mine is one of the most satisfying experiences ever. In Civ 6, you pick an ideology and you don't really face any consequences besides being disliked by leaders with different forms of government. Having tourism being used for more than just a victory condition is a must have!

3. Finally the AI. In my honest opinion, I think it's worse in Civ 6. No matter the difficulty, the AI always seems to be lackluster. When it comes to war, the AI doesn't know how to properly make use of their air power. I usually NEVER see the AI using bombers or fighters in Civ 6, where in Civ 5 the AI did use them almost always (even to intercept my bombers using their fighters). They also don't even know how to properly use support units, I never have scenarios where the AI attacks my city with siege towers or takes advantage of anti aircraft guns. Another issue with the AI is how unbalanced they are even though they're all on the same difficulty. I would often see majority of the AIs in the Renaissance / Industrial era with one or two AIs in the atomic / information era. This sort of ruins the immersion because it's very unrealistic to see nuclear capable Civilizations with modern infantry fighting against Civilizations with cannons and musketmen. In Civ 5, you may see this at times but usually majority of the AI doesn't stray too far off from the top players. The ones who are behind technologically are usually there because they suffered huge losses in a war. This could probably be fixed if the AIs had better and more balanced spawning areas where they can all equally take advantage of adjacency bonuses and available resources.

Ultimately, I do recommend Civ 6 if you're an established fan of the series. It's still really fun as long as you don't directly compare it to Civ 5 and view it more as its own game. Though if you're a new player to the Civilization series I highly recommend playing Civ 5 first before trying this one out, you'll see what I mean.",1502332987,1602031317,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.66E+16,140,6,19858,1468,19858,1601767954

7,Sid Meier's Civilization® V,77148015,english,"Long time Civ player. I've played every version and knockoff. Extensively modded Civ 2, built scenarios for the public, created art, etc. I have not played nor intend to play the latest Civ 6 DLCs even though I did buy the base game early to get the initial free nations. 

Would I recommend the game? Sure, it's Civ. It's a playable game that allows some historical fantasy to creep in. The graphics are beautiful. Would I recommend spending more than $40 on it, with ALL the DLC's included? No. Spend your money on some indie studio game that offers more depth and way better gameplay. 

The Bad: 

1. Poor AI (which is no surprise from past games) AI units get lost, move around habitually from point A to B and back again. Wars are won based on attrition, production, and tech advantages- not clever strategy. 

2. Poor optimization in late game causing AI turns to take minutes. Just no. It's 2020. 

3. Small maps compared to previous games. The game becomes unstable with large maps, exacerbated by the poor optimization. 

4. Form over substance. They prioritized graphics over gameplay. This is less a strategy game and more so a pretty Settlers of Catan. More so a board game and less so grand strategy. It's obvious they aimed for tablet players.

The Good:

1. No other game does Civ better than Sid Meier's Civ. Until there comes a City Skylines for their SimCity, Firaxis can just keep churning out eye candy and overcharging for DLC.

2. It's fun to pretend you're leading a famous nation, but there's always some immersion breaking issue with Civ 6 that causes me to drop it for a year.

3. It's pretty. Gorgeous really.

All the other Civ versions through Civ5 were just Civ1 embellished with bells and whistles.  Civ6 has significant changes and while it plays a bit like Civ1, it does feel fairly different.  The differences among the civilizations can be substantial and even game altering.

But the game is a bit tedious and there is zero chance that while playing I will look up at the time to find out that it is 3:30 AM.  

Overall, I like the game, but it is a long way from Civ1 on my list of all time favorite games.

62,Sid Meier's Civilization® V,77067668,english,"Civ 6 is a great game, but I am only hesitantly recommending it. The reason is because of all the dlcs. I am of the opinion that dlcs are meant to add side content, and should not just be paid updates. The dlc for civ 6 includes a lot of features that should probably just be included in the base game. I understand the developers might need money, but in that case would it not be better to raise the price of the base game then to sell it incomplete? As someone who cannot afford the dlc, it is very frustrating when everyone else has a better version than you, making it hard to play multiplayer and find videos about the base game only.

Which brings me on to the next point, which is that this game's tutorial is pretty bad. While it teaches you some of the fundamental mechanics, there are TONS of features that arent told anywhere in the game. Combine that with most people playing the dlc version and it makes it extremely rough to learn all the little rules of the base game, which is something you need to know to play any strategy game seriously. The game has an in-game guidebook called the Civilopedia, but it is a nightmare to find what you are looking for and some things arent in it at all.

All that being said, if you can get past these hurdles this is a really great game. The strategy goes pretty deep and the different civilization benefits combined with the randomness of the map can make each game feel unique. There are also smaller updates that happen to the base game over time to improve it that don't cost any money.

My first civilization game was civilization V which I played for many hours and I thoroughly enjoyed playing that game, coming over to Civilization VI quite a bit late after its release but I must say my timing feels right because I have played the game with Rise & Fall and Gathering Storm DLC's and I feel without the DLC's the game isn't  as much fun so buying the game with all DLC's seems perfect to me, btw I am a huge fan of natural disasters.
