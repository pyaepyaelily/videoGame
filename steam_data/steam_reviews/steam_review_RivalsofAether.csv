5,Rivals of Aether,77055035,english,"One of the few platform fighters that have a separate identity from Smash. All the characters are extremely unique and deep, combos are freeform and creative, and movement is tight and expressive. Has a lot of the good jank from Melee now integrated as official mechanics (like wavedashing and platform cancelling) without any of the dumb jank (L-cancelling, ledgehogging) and a few interesting ideas of their own (hitfalling, parrying).
It completely gets rid of the most awkward part of most platform fighters, the ledge, and replaces it with a much more interesting walljump system which leads to crazy offstage plays and interesting edgeguards.

However, it's mostly a competitive 1v1 game. With the addition of workshop content and weirder modes like FFA, 2v2, and Tetherball it's getting better for casual players but the core audience is people who like playing platform fighters like a subgenre of fighting games.

Online is decent depending on where you are. Where I am I can usually get a good connection in a couple minutes at the worst.

38,Rivals of Aether,68429885,english,"Many people are buying this game solely for the workshop. Keep in-mind that your options for multiplayer are more limited with workshop characters (and as expected, workshop characters do not all operate at the same performance level, which can very easily create severely unbalanced matchups, not that this should surprise anyone), and the game still struggles from a lack of singleplayer content that was not addressed at all in Definitive Edition. If you are thinking about buying this game just because of the workshop, I would advise strongly considering if you're willing to spend the money on what will essentially be a platforming version of MUGEN. Do not expect random matchmaking to be useful with the workshop, as its use is restricted to characters that both players have downloaded, and overlap is extremely rare. This issue is compounded by the game's already extremely small playerbase that is at-odds with the workshop so you will frequently meet players that outright have no characters downloaded because they only want to play with the base roster (not that they're in the wrong for wanting to play the game differently, but it is an issue if your goal is to enjoy the workshop).

If you're unsure about this game, don't buy it. The people that picked it up are a very specific audience that was going to enjoy this game no matter what. The play environment is very strongly geared towards players already highly experienced with Smash Bros Melee. You will be constantly told that the game is fun when you get good at it, but unless you're ready to put hundreds of hours into playing the exact same people, it doesn't get better. Playing against the same people over and over is the exact experience you're signing up for.
There are 14 characters in the base game, 6 of these were formerly paid DLC until DE. I'll give the devs credit for finally realizing that was a terrible system, it's still better for it to take 4 years than if they were to never realize it. If absolutely nothing else, I commend the developers for finally making this change as it was previously an enormous flaw in the game's design. Despite this, I still feel the game is horrendously overcosted because it significantly relies on its P2P online with extremely shallow singleplayer content. Most people can probably finish all the offline material before the 2-hour refund period expires.
The abysmal playerbase size combined with how the skill floor is comically high means you will never, ever see a new face. If you're new to playing games that use a Smash Bros Melee playstyle, you will not be able to pick this up. Do not even try, it will not happen. I know there's a lot of you out there that would enjoy a challenge, but this one has no payoff. The only resource for new players to find games is a single Discord server that has such a low playercount that you'll take weeks to find a match with anyone even near your skill level.
Random online matches are a joke where you will sit through an endless cycle of the same 200 ping opponent being suggested until you both finally accept the match, and they pick Kragg to abuse the high latency.
The userbase puts on a face of being welcoming to new players, but it's just that - a face. The game will still take about 100 hours (this is just an estimate based on statistical averages, it is obviously not an exact figure) for a new player to even begin having meaningful matches online, which are precluded by a constant stream of just losing with a strong feeling of helplessness. As it stands it is unlikely the issue of the skill floor and horrendous learning curve will ever get addressed, and it appears that the existing playerbase has come to embrace that, for better or worse. The only way in is if you bring a friend who's equally new and committed to playing the same game against you over and over, until you can branch out to playing the same people online over and over.
Probably the worst-kept secret of this game is how it's really just Smash Bros Melee but for furries. I don't think I need to convince you of this when the game's own roster does all the explaining for me.
For a perspective of how many people have dropped this game, it sold around 750,000 copies (source: SteamSpy) at the time of this review, and has 500 active players (source: Steamcharts, monthly avg players) total. It appears even the release of DE wasn't enough to spark lasting interest, because although I'm writing this review very shortly after the update, it appears most of the playerbase interest has already fallen off. (However this is based on volatile information, being written on the day of DE's release, as a result this statement should not be taken as a fact; I'm drawing a conclusion based on limited information). Even Brawlhalla is able to crush this game with player retention and Brawlhalla is free. This game's playerbase has not grown in years and with good reason. This game's skill floor makes it struggle to keep players.
The fanbase is very avid about defending the quality of their game, but because of the immense entry barrier, it doesn't matter. $20 is a steep price to pay for a game that relies entirely on its very humbly-sized multiplayer scene to carry its weight, and it comes bearing the burden of your first 100 hours being wasted if you aren't already heavily experienced with this very specific type of gameplay. If you're already good enough at Melee that you dominate your local scene, then maybe you can give this a shot if you want to move to a game with an even smaller playerbase.

In short: It's literally just Melee with less content. This game has generally been obsoleted now that Melee on emulator has working netplay, but ultimately it's your decision if you still want to buy. I would be very, very careful with buying this game though as its cost is a joke for what it offers unless you are already extremely committed to playing with a very small community.",1588425710,1601783994,FALSE,2,0,0.461267591,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,54,3,6282,52,6282,1600933272

90,Rivals of Aether,76943810,english,"Rivals of Aether is an indie platform fighting game with competitive elements as well as some casual elements to attract all audiences and does so extremely well.
When it comes to graphics, it's about as well as you'd expect from indie game graphics with pixel art and assets on par if not better than the likes of games like Celeste or Shovel Knight. Each menu is well optimized to get you in and out of the fight as fast as possible. Stages are made with vibrant colors, animations, as well as little details here and there to breathe life into this world.
The music in this game is simply something to behold, if you don't get the game, then please at least listen to the music. Flashygoodness, the composer, did an absolutely amazing job making new songs, as well as recreating well known songs from other well known indie games. These are songs that will end up in your head after just one listen for the rest of the day and will eventually find their way onto your music playlists. The music is for sure the 2nd best part of this game next to the gameplay.
Now when it comes to gameplay, it captures what a competitive platform fighter should be like, complex movement and mechanics with unique mechanics for each fighter. However, many of these mechanics remain accessible to those who want to play with their friends casually with more difficult mechanics for the core game and characters taking time and practice to master. Rivals does have side modes, however they're something to distract you from the main game for a couple minutes before heading back to said main mode. Furthermore, Rivals has a milestone system that gives you incentive to try new characters and they definitely have payoff with new skins, stages (with more unique music), and pets to keep the game just a little interesting.
The weakest aspect of this game would most likely be the online. Now the connection isn't poor, but it is very likely that every other game or so you'll end up with someone whose way up higher in the rankings than you are with no way of checking before you accept the opponent into the room.

The unlock system however is a pretty big disappointment, the milestone system essentially just comes down to grinding and I'm genuinely confused about who thought it'd be a good idea to have grinding in a fighting game. It's a shame really but I guess it explains why they never elaborated on what the system actually meant in any of the promotional videos. It's not a big deal at all but I figured I'd mention it.

Either way, the thing that completely sells this to me as a relatively casual player is the absolutely incredible workshop support and community. Playing with the user created content with friends or just messing around with it in singleplayer is amazing.

I bought it close to when it came out and was hoping for 2v2 but no luck :(


I still don't like the idea of games that make us pay for DLC if there is little to no characters

The small team are dedicated to making this game the best possible experience for people who love the platform fighting genre.

It strays far from the realm I'd consider a ""smash clone"" with the introduction of new mechanics and the refining of old. The 10 frame buffer system makes the game feel buttery smooth and much more beginner friendly than other notable games of a similar competitive caliber. I love grabs and shields being ditched for a more interactive style of play. It encourages aggression and rewards reads and timing. Grinding out tech skill and practicing matchups is extremely rewarding. The level of depth combos can have once you master techniques such as hitfalling, baby dashing, etc. feels phenomenal. 

The workshop gives this game new life. The doors that are opened once any character from any game or anyone's imagination can join the fight make the game feel fresh at any given point.

- actually balanced
- fast gameplay

- competitive playerbase

Some issues:
- netcode is not the best, but its not as bad as some will tell you [improved since definitive]
- relatively small playerbase [improved since definitive]
- needs 4 player online [now included with definitive]

Overall, very fun game, very nice community (definitely get involved over discord). 
When new characters come out they're always stupid good for a couple weeks. Then they get nerfed (Unless you're Ellliana, then you get buffed a week later lul). Wait for when a new character comes out to get it. Goes on sale super cheap and all the old dlc is half off for like a week.

update:
900 hours later I can honestly say that if you are competitive person who enjoys the challenge of the platform fighter genre then you will absolutely enjoy this game. If you have friends who are at your skill level, then you will enjoy it even more. If you are a casual player, you will very likely still enjoy this game now that definitive edition has come out, since the default branch now comes with workshop support. Any character you have ever though of being in a platform fighter is probably in workshop already. Game now also has 4 player online, more abyss content, all the characters are out, and the balance is pretty much fleshed out at this point.

TLDR: If you like platform fighters with fast, satisfying gameplay, great chiptune music, and games with pixel art, get this game.

If you're a fan of Smash Bros. or platform fighters in general, this game is DEFINITELY for you. It's fast, easy to learn, incredibly fun to play, with 12 characters designs that feel familiar, but unique. Each character has their own short tutorial that helps you learn their moveset/play-style and they included a staggered tutorial for game mechanics. These range from the very basics (walking, running, what button does what, etc.) to more advanced tech like Wavedashing and Reverse Aerial Rushes (RARs). 

 There is a good amount of single player/ co-op content as well. Story mode, to me, feels similar to classic mode in Smash. Unfortunately, it is limited to the six original characters that they had in Early Access. Essentially, you pick a character and face off in a series of 5 fights, which steadily increase in difficulty, with the goal of finishing as fast as possible. Now there is lore to the characters that is revealed, so if that's your thing then I think you'd enjoy it, but if not they grant you the option of skipping the story and cut straight to the fights. There's Abyss Mode which is pretty similar to the Endless Smash mode that has been included in many of the Smash Bros. games. The major difference here is that its not entirely just yeeting a bunch of low level CPU players off the stage until you get yeeted. Each level is a wave that comes in with different a challenge that you (and a friend) need to endure. Some of the challenges they throw at you range from facing an armored enemy, staying withing a circle of light while being attacked, or destroying an obelisk while (you guessed it) being attacked. After each completed wave, they reward you with this blue crystal that you get to beat the shit out of to gain EXP and level up your character. Every time you level a character up, you gain the ability to equip custom moves that buff your character. These custom moves are unlocked by spending the gold you get from completing games and can make you invincible during certain moves, or make your special moves stronger/go farther. One of the big attractions that Rivals has introduced is Tetherball. Sadly, this is the one mode that I haven't played yet so I can't elaborate much about it. And naturally, like all fighting games, there's a training mode where you can go to practice your character. Here, you can adjust how the CPU will react,  toggle hitbox visualizations, and do so much more within the pause menu. 

Online play is usually pretty good. You can choose to play casually or ranked. Casual online play lets you play 1v1's or 2v2's and allows the use of Steam Workshop characters if you want. However, the only downside is that the person you're connected to MUST have your character downloaded or else they are completely unavailable. I've played a little bit of ranked and got my ass handed to me more times than I'd like to admit, but I still had fun. In both casual and ranked, there are preset messages you can send while on the character select screen. They're pretty tame, and are intended to come across as friendly with messages like ""Good Game"", ""This will be easy"", and ""Ready when you are"". Local play is about what you would expect. You and three others can fight it out and any of the 15 stages included in the game. You can adjust the rules similar to the way Smash does it, where the amount of time/stocks can be adjusted and rules like Turbo mode can be toggled. 

The inclusion of the Steam Workshop was a phenomenal idea. I currently have over 15 pages of characters custom made by the community, which have provided for some of the most insane and hilarious fights. One of my favorite things about Rivals, is the options for creating custom color swaps for each character. They allow for you to create two different variations for each character and I found creating them easier than expected. They break down the characters' renders into sections (i.e. head, tail, fire, horns, etc.) which actively change as colors as you shift the sliders around. To give you an even better idea of what your custom design would look like, they include the sprite that you'd see on screen as you fight. Speaking of sprites, the sprite work for Rivals is beautiful. As someone who is a sucker for good sprite work, I can't help but feel a bit of bias by saying that, however this game just looks and sounds awesome. The music that plays on each stage, or even in the menus, absolutely slaps. Most of the music is chiptune and catchy as hell. The sounds when you hit opponents is very satisfying, especially when playing Shovel Knight. They got that metallic smacking sound absolutely perfect.


I know this review is long as hell, but there's a lot to talk about. Rivals of Aether is incredibly satisfying to play. It's fast pacing, great character designs, catchy music, awesome sprite art and familiar mechanics make it one of my favorite, and most played games on Steam. This is one of those games that I find myself playing all day and never growing tired of.

Almost every core feature of the game, like characters and stages, has additional user created content that are incredibly easy to install. For the creatives and aspiring designers, the tools and documentation provided by the developers makes getting into modding significantly easier for anyone with even minimal experience.

71,Rivals of Aether,44735707,english,"Dev's finally cleaned up their act and realized locking half a roster behind a paywall in a competitive fighter just wouldn't work. The definitive edition may be more money but at least when you by the game you aren't at a passive disadvantage without dlc (explained in the old review). This is the second best platform fighter out next to smash ultimate, mechanics are great, characters are pretty varied and unique (although I wish the tutorials were more indepth like absa's tutorial has a lot but wrastors is pretty much nothing). I love the workshop's extended cast that just adds on to the uniqueness of the cast with pretty balanced characters. Haven't messed around that much with the story mode but its a cool addition.
It is however, kind of difficult to get into a match and even more difficult to get into a balanced match, you are most of the time going to get destroyed or destroy with pretty much no close game inbetween. It's also a damn shame this game couldn't have rollback, rollback netcode would make this game feel so much better but right now it just feels like smash ultimate with less base input delay.
All in all good game, still would recommend smash over rivals but I think they can keep improving and become a top fighter (ROLLBACK WOULD DEFINITELY HELP THIS even if it is only for PC).





___________ OLD REVIEW BEFORE DEFINITIVE EDITION ____________
Stop locking your roster behind paywalls. 
Ranno, Clairen, Sylvanos, and Elliana are all original characters there is no reason they should be locked behind paywalls. You are a competitive fighting game in what serious competitive environment would you have almost half your fucking roster be locked behind a paywall?

The reason why this is anti competitive is because locking characters behind a paywall no matter how balanced they are there will always be an imbalance. The guy who payed money has more options and can do more than the guy who didn't pay up.

Until this company realizes this, this review will stay a not recommended.

POSITIVES:
+The game is amazing Smash Bros. Melee inspiration with it's fast and fluid gameplay with very interesting and dynamic character play styles and it's own art direction use of sprites. It burrows very entertaining abilities such as wavedashing and wavelanding.

+The game creates very unique ideas of it's own, examples like making your own skin colors for each character and also play testing your character within the character selection screen as you are switching your mapping on your controller, before a game can start.

+Inclusion of Mods and steam workshop expands a game's life span and they seemed to have understood that, allowing people to make characters they always wanted, or use of skins.

NEGATIVES:
-It truly was an amazing game around 2017-2018. 
The story mode is nothing to write home about, as it's shallow story telling only pertains to cutscenes only at the beginning and at the end of a character you have chosen. It's just nothing, but 1-on-1 matches.

-In 2020, the release of the Definitive Edition, I strongly recommend you do not buy this game unless you plan on only playing offline matches. 
The game's online was mediocre before, but it's now in all time low, matches take FOREVER to find, ranging from 10-30 mins, only for you to find someone with a horrible ping. Tried numerous times, in different days, and no dice.

-The online was bareable before, but now, you will struggle to at least get into ONE match. The Dev's have not made any official statements for a week and a half since the release of this game, still no response.

-This game does not also use Rollback netplay, and uses delayed based online play, which is another negative as the netcode is awful.

-The fact that online multiplayer is cut from the game because of the bad online net code, even with the little amount of characters within the roster, and the small stage selection, this game is NOT worth the value $30, not even $20. Wait for a price drop.
I strongly urge you to play Melee instead as this game most likely has no future with it's dwindling player base.

Melee Slippi isn't only FREE and has Rollback netcode, but also provides matchmaking that never exceeds over 15 seconds upon searching!",1524694692,1601388007,FALSE,1,0,0.523809552,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,83,4,2107,39,2105,1601388247

I also like Clairen because she's like if Lucina were a furry and if Lucina were a Marth, also because in the dating simulator, looking at her makes me feel good in a way that makes me feel bad.

Jokes aside, this is a really good game. The game's mechanics are very satisfying to get the hang of, it's less about physically being able to use them (since they're pretty easy to pull off) and more about knowing when's the right time to use your skills in a fight. The characters are all a lot of fun and are very unique, compared to both each other and the Smash Bros. characters they took inspiration from. The stages have straightforward designs that work for competitive play, but you can also play their ""Aether"" counterparts, which are more like the fun, illegal stages you'd find in Smash. There's just a lot of fun to be had here.

While I do want to stress that the base game is still great on its own merit, the workshop is also worth noting. People are able to make characters, ""buddies"", and stages for others to download. These range from carefully-made original characters with intricate mechanics like the Rivals cast, to flashy, overpowered and exaggerated meme characters. Both ends of the spectrum and everything in between can be a lot of fun when you want to goof around or take a break from the base game.

Definitely pick this game up if you're into competitive platform fighters. If you're a casual, the workshop has endless hours of fun for you and you're friends!

63,Rivals of Aether,67237810,english,"Old Review: This is a very good game, i've played a lot of it with friends on my old account but i've spent these 42 hours on completing all of the achievements. The story mode gets a 3/10. 3 points for what they wanted to do, having all of these characters story intersect in a satisfying way, and no points for anything else since it was bad and no one had an actual character arc. (The main issue is that you can play it in any way you want, the story is already flawed but the way you'll end up playing it will probably make less sense than it already does. If they revamp this in the definitive edition they should make the fights matter more to the story.) I give abyss mode a 1/10, it took way to long to get all of the characters to level 10 and I got nothing for getting to/past wave 45. The only thing abyss mode was good for is letting me use something other than the default skins on ranked mode for the base game cast. I give ranked mode a 3/10, I thought it'd be fun to try and get some of the special kill achievements on ranked mode and I kept getting matched up with people ranked in gold. I dunno if the online is so dead that I can't even find someone even close to the starting level but it's kind of annoying. Overall, 10/10, good game. I like the funny Penguin skin for Absa.

New Review: The story mode still gets a 3/10. The only change they made to it in the definitive edition is that you can turn cut scenes off... Yay! Abyss is still getting a 1/10. It's going to take an ungodly amount of time to get the DLC characters to LV 10. I appreciate all of the cool abilities and stuff but it's waaaaaaaaay too long. I got nothing for getting to/past wave 45 when I downloaded the definitive edition so i'm going to assume it's still just an annoying achievement. I'm pretty burnt out on this game so I haven't tried ranked mode. I'll update the review if I still get matched with some guy in gold on my first game in my journey to get random to diamond.

I really like the development team and all the people behind it. They all seem like nice people and i liked the Rivals Directs theyve put on so far. The workshop on this game is definately the best workshop in any game on steam (that i've played at least), giving players the opportunity to make their own characters and stages is a fantastic idea. I love seeing all the creative characters and moves people create and playing as some classic characters as well.  Speaking of characters, all the characters that are part of the game are really well balanced, fun to play as, and just good designs in general. I really hope this game continues to get updates as i really want it to succeed as a little indie gem like among us has recently.

The reason i think it wont, however, is it's barrier to entry.
You have to be at least in Elite Smash on Smash Bros to stand a chance in Rivals. I've put about 200 hours into Smash Ultimate and a lot into Smash Wii U and 3ds as well. I've also put 30 hours into Rivals of Aether, so i consider myself to be pretty good at it.

I go online, and get my ass handed to me every single time. I have played like 10 online matches and haven't won yet.
I think the reason for this is that the game simply isn't popular enough for ""casuals"" to play consistently and online, and so the game is dominated by people who have tons of experience in the game and so the skill gap is massive, and definately daunting for new players.

58,Rivals of Aether,67108556,english,"I purchased this game on Steam as my first ever game on steam, and mainly for the reason that I knew it was inspired by Super Smash Bros, which was my most played game as a kid, and it was on PC. I was delightfully surprised at how much this game brings to the table that is unique, and lets it stand apart from other smash-clones. It's somewhat small cast of characters each have their own different playstyle and beautifully animated set of sprites that I can tell went through a lot of work to get down. With this diverse cast of characters, I haven't found any of them to be lame or not fun to play as, either. Each character feels perfect for this game, and that's a feat I haven't seen many fighting games conquer: having a full cast of fun characters to play as. The music in this game is also phenomenal. I can't tell you how many times I've told my friends to play on the ice map just so I could hear that stage's amazing music. The multiplayer locally is fantastic, and my only complaint about that part of it is that 2+ players online have to be playing on the Workshop branch beta of the game, which means I constantly have to swap between normal and workshop if I want to play with more than just one of my friends online, but I have a great feeling that this problem will be more than fixed in the future release of this game's Definitive Edition coming in the future. The way this game now support workshop is pretty amazing. There is so much you can add to your Rivals experience using workshop. There are custom stages you can find, custom cosmetic ""buddies"" that follow your character around, custom game modes, and even custom playable characters. This level of options is one of the best Steam workshop experiences I have ever seen. It's just a shame that attempting to play with these custom workshop items online with a friend causes the occasional crash or two, but Rivals does support Steam Remote-Play, so there will be a way to use workshop items with your friends if you so wish. Single-player wise, this game is just alright at, however. As amazing as this game is multiplayer with friends, single player wise, you might find yourself a bit bored out. There is a story mode  for you to complete with each of the original cast of rivals characters, but it really isn't anything too special, as all it consists of is a series of quick matches against various rivals opponent cpu's, and maybe a boss battle. I blew through it in about 30 minutes, and it shouldn't take anyone much longer than an hour or two to get everything they can out of it. It does, however, unlock a pretty interesting mode in the form of Abyss Mode, which in an of itself isn't anything spectacular, but it is a nice little arena challenge to see how long you can last against a huge wave of easily killable enemies. It even comes with it's own separate sub-mode, where you can use custom moves for your Rivals characters that make your character much more powerful depending on which moves you select, such as Zetterburn having no time limit between fireballs, and Kragg being able to have more than one rock in play at once. It is unfortunate that none of the current DLC fighters in this game have access to these runes quite yet, but again, this game will be receiving an overhaul in the Definitive Edition coming out soon. One more thought I'd like to share on this game is that this game is absolutely for everyone. I have gotten friends who were into games like competitive Melee into this game, with the ability to Wavedash in this game, and I have gotten friends who weren't necessarily into competitive smash, but like the series anyways, and love playing this game. It sets the entry level quite low for new players, but the skill ceiling is so incredibly high that you can always find a way to improve at this game. It's a great reason why I love this game's online ranking system. It allows you to practice with others who are probably much better than you in a casual, unranked match, and test your skills ranked in a system that puts you in a match with an opponent that's around the same ranking as you, the player. If your want to get good at this game, it'll implore you to. If you don't really want to pick up a fighting game right now, and just want something to play with your friends casually, that's what this game can do too! It functions very well for both casuals and competitive people alike.

It's a very quality game here on Steam, and I'm giving it a fat 8/10. If these complaints I've mentioned in the Definitive Edition of this game become addressed, this game can easily achieve a 9 or higher.

I actually bought and refunded this before about a year ago. It was the same problem, i literally couldn't find anyone online to play against. I guess i somehow expected that it had been a glitch, bad luck, not enough people playing at the time? After a year surely things had changed, and since there's a definitive edition coming out it seemed like a good time to give it another chance. But no, it's the exact same. 

Be it ranked or casual, independently of the region i pick, it takes on average 20 to 30 minutes to find someone, that is if it finds someone. I don't have high ping or bad connection on any online games, so it's not on my end.

57,Rivals of Aether,76226938,english,"Достаточно долго я искал не особо требовательный к компьютеру файтинг,с механиками аналогичными Super Smash Series, так как игры с опорой на знание механик особо привлекали внимание . Случайно наткнувшись на пиксельартовую и не особо примечательную (на первый взгляд ) Rivals, я начал постигать азы этой приблуды.

Мягкая и достаточно живая графика, пул из 14 персонажей,неплохо для начала. После пары часов игра и не наскучила и даже появился азарт к победе.

На данный момент ,кажется я нашел как одно из любимых развлечений с друзьями, так и крайне любопытный и проработанный способ доказать свое превосходство перед пользователями сети.
Основная особенность обучения этой игры ,это креативность в использовании способностей конкретных персонажей и их влияние на поле боя. К примеру, Kragg, жук с навыками покорения земли создает препятствия для противников,что может быть как преимуществом ,так и помехой для создателя. Zetterburn контролирует поле боя, оставляя за собой огненный след ,который вынуждает оппонента смотреть под ноги и выбирать правильную позицию. К слову,каждый герой в игре имеет подобные особенности,которые формируют уникальные площадки сражения .

В отличии от своих братьев в Rivals of Aether нет механики блока,но все компенсируется большей подвижностью героев и значительной разнообразностью атак. На каждое направление движения,включая стационарное состояние ,есть обычный ,сильный и специальный прием. Соответственно вариации комбо редко наскучат.

Из минусов могу отметить только возможность играть онлайн с друзьями лишь вдвоем( все решается переходом на версию игры с поддержкой воркшопа,появляется возможность создать лобби на 4х) и возможно не самая простая кривая освоения игры(хотя в игре есть обучение,оно не особо раскрывает всех мелочей и фишек )

Я говорил что в игре можно играть на созданных комьюнити персонажах?

Могу посоветовать игру новичкам,которые погружаются в мир комбо брейкеров, казуальщикам ,которые просто хотят получить удовольствие от доминирования над друзьями,так и ярым фанатам серии Super Smash.

Only problem is that the roster's a bit less if you only bought the game, not the DLC included. Plus, the DLC characters do seem to be a bit costly (though they do feel good to use).

EDIT:

After getting some playtime and learning about the game, it really feels like playing with mods from workshop is more worth it than playing online due to the fact that skill difference is HIGHLY noticeable and that the server connection isn't the smoothest/fastest compared to other games.

It's ok (for me atleast) since I'm used to playing offline/single-player games.

EDIT 2:

After having a definite date of when Definitive Edition will be released I think it is worth the price now to buy the game. Workshop mainly is the content of the game if you don't want to dive too deep into the chaotic casual/ranked queues with only the original roster.

Implementing workshop definitely skyrockets the potential of the game.",1555131669,1600443232,TRUE,0,0,0.512423098,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,17,5,10731,948,922,1601784829

21,Rivals of Aether,76018714,english,"When I bought this game I had hoped for a fun competitive experience that would allow me to enjoy a fast paced experience with cool combos and movement options. The problem with this game is that the experience gets increasingly slower and more boring as you get better at the game. This is mostly due to 3 things, parrying, character design, and balance.

1. Parrying
There is no blocking in this game, instead of that, the devs thought it would be a good idea to give all characters Bayonetta Witch Time. Essentially its a counter that will stun your opponent if it connects. This means that any move, no matter how weak or strong, can be punished with a huge combo or get you KO'd. It's a mechanic that heavily rewards defensive play and punishes people for trying to rushdown their opponent and go for cool plays. Parrying a projectile reflects it and gives you invincibility for a bit but your opponent can just parry the reflected projectile and now you're at a disadvantage because your invincibility will run out before theirs. 

2. Design
In a game that seeks to be a spiritual successor to Smash Melee its character design has taken a lot of inspiration from the game's NEGATIVE qualities. Pretty much every character in this game has dishonest hitboxes and/or incredibly strong and spammable projectile(s) you can get combos off of, and the characters who don't have been sitting near the bottom of the tier list for most of the game's life. Characters like Kragg, Ranno, and Orcane are everywhere online because parrying projectiles is very unrewarding. The meta is all about zoning and whiff punishing which makes the pace of the game is much slower than you would expect.

3. Balance
These issues I've brought up are nothing new. People have used these reasons to justify why they do not want to compete or even touch the game and yet nothing has been done about it. Balance patches are released almost every month (which also means you lose your replays very quickly) but in the 300+ hours I've had on this game I have yet to see any productive changes made. I wish the devs would take notice of these things but it seems like they are relatively disjointed from the community and want to do their own thing.

74,Rivals of Aether,40777406,english,"Edit: Will update this review after Definitive Edition comes out, since it will change the part about the value of DLC.  Also the workshop update means this game has more content than any vanilla Smash Bros game.  Because dan4nace enjoys fan content like a real human being.

This review is written without online in mind; I hated the online, but I hate online gaming in general, with my favorite games being local MP.  Moving right along.

Well built movement system that I feel really captures what makes Smash Bros Melee such a hit, while at the same time lessening the punishing mechanics that Melee had, leaving you with a much more approachable Smash-like platform fighter with fast speed and depth.  While I feel like tutorials in fighting games are ultimately pointless, this games tutorial does a very good job of showing the advanced, hidden mechanics that separated competitive and casual Smash play.  On a similar note, Training Mode includes several features such as Input Advance and display hitboxes/DI lines that I wish every modern fighting game would put in.  I'm not too steeped in the meta, so all competitive comments I say should be taken with a grain of salt... but I feel like the character balance has taken the ""everyone is super"" approach.  Many characters excel so well with their own abilities that they are viable, even when matches between differently skilled players can seem one sided.  At the time of writing this, I hear complaints of Ranno the Frog(the most recent DLC character, with another one on the way), though he with his somewhat recent arrival to the game, he hasn't taken over the comp scene so?  All the characters feel capable of playing aggressively, and all do so while having their own unique quirks.

On the topic of the DLC, its hard to come to a conclusion on this one.  I generally dislike DLC because of its inflated price compared to the original game in comparison.  Truth is that relative to the DLC, the original game didn't have that much cotent to begin with... but I'm getting ahead of myself.  The DLC is well built; the new stages and characters are of equal if not better quality to the base game.  I feel like Ori is a bit steep in his price, most likely cause Micro$oft royalties.  Clarien/Ranno seem fair in comparison, $5 for 2 characters and stages seems fine for this game.  A “Definitive Edition” is confirmed down the line, so keep that in mind if DLC is putting you off.

Base game doesn't have much content, but the content it does have is extremely well polished.  I had this game since early access, and the stage/character art has improved significantly since then(community page has some artwork of the old sprites, if you want a flashback).  Stages are simplistic with little variety, probably reflecting Melee's issue of how many stages were un-viable for serious gameplay.  All base stages do have Aether forms though, to spice up casual play(just like Melee, there is still some of them I REFUSE to go to).  Single player is mostly forgettable, consisting of a bland story mode and an Abyss mode featuring Multi man fights and short mini games.  Abyss mode is interesting, and the level up/customization it offers is pretty interesting, especially in the additional versus mode it offers for silly brokeness.

Overall worth the asking price, a definite if on sale.  The value of well made gameplay throws this to #1 in my Smash-like games on PC, and has even put a dent in my interest in Smash 4.",1520904566,1599766364,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,818,37,10342,280,10014,1602013912

85,Rivals of Aether,75713221,english,"Even though I already owned this game long beforehand, I only came back to it after the addition of Steam Workshop support was announced. I have to say, even without the workshop, this game is a lot of fun and I'm almost ashamed of myself for putting this game aside for so long.

I honestly believe that this game is a better platform fighter than Super Smash Bros, and stands out well enough on it's own with its own unique features, a couple examples being the parry mechanic replacing shielding, and no ledges to prevent overly campy playstyles. 
The characters themselves also feel very unique, each having their own gimmick that their moveset is designed to compliment, and while some characters do borrow a move or two from Smash, this game doesn't rely on taking moves from it.
I think the only thing Super Smash Bros. holds over this game is how casual it is, quantity of characters, and being harder to execute techniques like wavedashing, but almost all of those issues are solved with the addition of workshop mods, and makes up for techniques being easier to do with how deep the character movesets are.

It's a shame that barely anybody plays this game compared to other games, because it's genuinely such a good one. Many people may complain about constantly being matched up with good players, but I think that's to be expected with a game that doesn't have as many players as other games. If you really want a competitive platform fighter experience, this game will definitely be for you. Or if you're putting this game aside purely because most of the cast is consisting of animal characters, it'd be good for you to fall out of that mindset, because you're seriously missing out.

In all seriousness: extremely fun indie game for fans of Super Smash Bros who might be overwhelmed by ultimate having three hundred characters. 

Its similar to Melee in the sense that characters feel sluggish before you learn how to play but once you start learning the skill ceiling is very high. 

In alot of ways its superior to Smash. There is an in depth training mode that goes over everything from basic movement and attacks to more advance tech (wave dashing/ landing, Reverse Aerial Rush etc).

70,Rivals of Aether,74108804,english,"TL:DR at bottom

The game itself is amazing, each character has its own unique moveset (unlike others like brawlhalla which just have a lot of common weapons that are virtually the same as eachother with signature moves making the difference between legends). Each character also has its own gimmick. For example, Kragg is a super slow and super heavy stone golem thing that is able to create terrain (either a stone pillar or a square boulder that can be thrown around and placed) to change the map in his favor. On the other hand, etalus is a polar bear that can create ice on the map, which either allows him to slide around very quickly or smash it to gain a type of hyperarmor (basically he cant flinch from being hit easily).

So, all this is well and good. The main problem with the game arises with matchmaking. The ranked gamemode is fine for the most part, a bit iffy. But if you just want to have fun, this is the absolutely wrong game to come to. The casual gamemode has no matchmaking whatsoever, which means if this is your first game, welcome to being put into a stunlock until death and then getting taunted while you respawn. It is an overall nightmare. Even 46 hours in, whatever matchmaking the ""friendly"" gamemode has hasn't picked up that I am unable to deal with someone who probably plays the game 8 hours a day, 7 days a week and that I should be put with players that are also in this predicament.

This game is fun with friends, but that is about it honestly. the Story/Campaign is nonexistent and is basically just a tutorial for learning the basic characters (oh, btw you start with 8 basic characters but the other 10 characters are much better but are locked behind paywalls with no way to obtain them otherwise, kind of EA of the devs but w/e.) The game is basically dedicated to people who either want to play with friends or want to go pro with the game with nothing in between.

TL:DR

80,Rivals of Aether,74078428,english,"This game is amazing. Came for the workshop, stayed for the solid gameplay. While this game is clearly inspired by Smash, it definitely finds it's own footing and makes for a really fun experience. Every character is fun to play, each with their own combos that you can master. The stages look really nice and feel great to play on, and having the option to turn hazards off means you don't have to feel scared about trying to play in a more competitive fashion.

There are tutorials not only for tech in the game, but each character too, so you know the in's and out's of your character when going into a battle. The story mode is interesting and fun, even if it is short. It's kind of like Classic Mode in Smash, but if each character had an interesting-to-follow storyline to go with it. Abyss Mode is interesting, pitting you against endless waves of mini challenges, whether it's knocking out loads on enemies or destroying hexes in a short amount of time.

Now, on it's own, this is an amazing game. But the real fun starts when you go onto the Workshop.

The Workshop turns this game from great into amazing. There's geniuinely something for everyone, whether you want to play as the really well designed OC characters, characters from franchises you already know whether they're a recreation of Smash incarnation or they go a step further and try making original movesets (and either way are really fun), or hell, even meme characters like Ronald and 100% Accurate Fox, where they're clearly designed to be OP, but they still make for a great time none the less. There are also many custom stages on the workshop for you to mess around with, whether it's something as simple as Final Destination to full-out Boss Fights. 

My only problem with this game is that the Workshop kind of holds you back from progressing. When in the Workshop Beta, Aether coins aren't saved, Points toward achievements don't count (Even if you play as the default characters) and Story Mode won't save your ranking in each story. I kind of understand why it's like this, but on the other hand it kinda means you play one or the other instead of being able to do both at the same time. It is easy to switch between the Workshop beta and the current version, however to do this you must restart the game. I kind of wish they made it so you could still gain achievements in the Workshop Beta, but you have to be playing with Default Characters on a Default Stage, or at the very least so Aether coins save in both modes.

As a side note, I wish I could access Abyss Mode while in the Workshop beta. However with this one I fully understand why it's like this (Would be hard to program runes for Workshop Characters), but even then they could make it so you can't use the Workshop characters in that mode, similar to how you can turn them off in Vs. matches while still on the workshop beta.

The game is good. it is VERY. VERY GOOD.

but there's very little content. not even ten caracters to choose from, and the DLC honestly feel pretty extreme - I could buy whole new games for the price of a single character.

I hoped the Workshop content would still make it worthwhile.
it doesn't.

quality is all over the place, and even the more curated options just... don't seem to fit with the game.
There's also some more major grievances. the control setup options are atrocious to me, as I'm used to having more options as well as the ability to bind multiple actions to the same key, such as up and jump, allowing me to perform tilts, up-finishers, short-hops AND jumps... using only two keys, instead of a total or four. this results in massive frustration at knowing exactly what I want to do, knowing I normally could pull it off with a more effective keyboard setup scheme, but being foiled repeatedly because such options do not exist.

I'll stick to Super Smash Flash 2, a free game with three times the content, better response to controls and customization, which also includes online play. This is just not worth it, for me... Sorry.

If you don't buy most of the DLC, you're kinda left with a small character roster and not too many stages. 

And that if you're more of a casual player and don't get competitive with these types of games too often, this might not be for you as I feel a lot of the characters moves and ideas lean more towards competitive play rather than general.

75,Rivals of Aether,73396531,english,"This game is very good when it comes to style and art design. From the element inspired characters, to the lighting fast game play. Players can find themselves doing amazing combos to secure a KO or engaging in a intense neutral game with these fun and often exciting characters, fitting to most fighting styles. The balancing is very nice between characters so anyone you pick wont be hammered down by their level viability. Top this with a community workshop and you got a great game!

But this review is a No and here is why

I said in the good side of the review this game has lighting fast game play. That can be part of the problem for some players. the speed in which characters move can be a bit daunting for players new to this game. That in itself is not a bad thing but I will like for you to keep this in mind when  you keep reading.

another issue i have is the controls. in my opinion, they handle weird... For instance special moves. in order to do a special move (lets say we want to do a up special move) you must push in one direction and while holding that direction press the special button. what makes it weird is that you cannot press these at the same time. it has to be move then special. This results in a lot of players moving a bit before the do the input they meant to do.for new players it makes their movement quite clunky which is not bad....on the ground. when you get to the situations where you are in the air. it is a whole different story. that weird but normal input. becomes paramount to you getting back on a stage. and in a game where it is fast. one wrong input can spell death in a lot of cases. 

another point of for annoyance me and this game is the defensive options. You can see that the developers want players to engage with other players on the map but for me it really makes the game oppressive on players who want to play defense. I also said in the good side of review that characters are fitting to most fighting styles. But I feel like one of the styles that are kinda weak here are defensive ones. From the lack of shields to not being able to hold ledge even the size of the map and how small they are on average makes a defensive player really uncomfortable. I can imagine this being polarizing since no one wants to get ""zoned"" out on a big map. That also is not fun. I think this hurts the experience because there is not a lot of down time. to compare smash brothers and fighting games in general have blocking. this allows the player to relive some pressure when in a undesirable situation for a small moment the player has a time to breathe and get out of getting hit over and over. ledge grabbing the same thing. giving the player a second to get themselves together if only just a small bit. instead when you are on the defense you are left to DI. a tech that relies on you moving your character in a direction to  escape the combo or avoid the blast box. 

now do not get me wrong, there is defensive tools. but the problem is these you need to time it in order to work. and to replace ledge grabbing characters get a wall jump. this may seem cooler but now it  makes recovering harder. and  for the one who is defending you from grabbing the ledge it makes their job somewhat easy. this makes a very offensive environment. 

From the small stage, the odd input combination, fast game play and the lack of defensive option to relieve pressure. inexperience players will not feel as if this is game where they have a fighting chance. To put it simply- the skill floor is high and player will easily find themselves demoralized. 

when i played online ranked for the 1st time. i was a bit confused when I  saw a sort of striking system. but after a few seconds. I knew what kind of game this audience was catering to. This game feels like a more inherently competitive like say street fighter. but it has the mechanics of a platform fighter like smash brothers.

Now even though I do not recommend this game. I wont refund it. I am quite used to this competitiveness in games. But I do not write this as if I am experiencing  this i write it from someone who is new to this type of game. to put it simply the appeal will draw players in but the difficulty, weird input and speed of the game will draw some of the same players out. 

For those reasons I will not recommend this to most people. I just do not think it will up a lot of people's alley.

though i will say the workshop has been amusing to look at. Thanks for reading :)",1595904543,1595904594,FALSE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,28,12,494,0,494,1595899865

57,Rivals of Aether,73143692,english,"I do want to hit ""Yes"" as I do think the game in it's skeleton is good - however looking at it from the point of view of enjoyable play, it's a no. Your character cannot grab ledges, there is no grab function at all actually and you can't tech in the air, only dodge. Once you are in a ""combo"" which is really just a mash of buttons from the opponent, you cannot escape. Although there is a tech and dodge feature, once you are locked in being hit, you cannot use them, they can only be used pre-hit. 

So basically if you are playing against someone who's perfected the timing of most of the basic moves you will be hit from 0% to death in one motion. This to me makes the game niche and kind of lame. It will limit the amount and type of players to only those willing to grind out the skills to time hits as there is little wiggle room for luck or just that hidden equilibrium of a fair fight. This is of course fairly true with most fighters so it's not like i'm trying to single this one out. If you like watching yourself get smashed around on a screen with little chance of getting to play the game, this ones for you. Otherwise the game is actually great.

*Pros 
- Graphics are great
- Gameplay is smooth
- Sounds and soundtrack are great
- Very small game, easy to download and very easy to get into a friends game or lobby
- You can make your own characters which is sweet but you'll need to do a little work in order to make them

*Cons
- There are a total of 8 characters that you can play unless you pay to unlock another 4 so a whopping 12 characters 
- You cannot tech in the air, you can't hold onto ledges and you can't grab. This in itself kind of limits the casual playability of the game.",1595476620,1595476620,FALSE,1,1,0.407516301,5,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,449,18,188,0,188,1595475576

67,Rivals of Aether,33864852,english,"Rivals of Aether is a technical platform fighter, with the kind of gameplay you might see in a tournament set of Super Smash Bros. Melee or the competitive Brawl-mod Project M. There are no random items in this game.

What I really like about Rivals of Aether is that instead of being some kind of blind copy of Melee's physics and quirks, it reimagines this technical fast-paced gameplay that's unique to Melee (and PM) as something intentional. Melee's competitive scene is a result of a decade's worth of discarding parts of the game that make the game a bad competitive game, finding ways to exploit the game's physics engine to do cool stuff, and grinding tech skill way past what the developers ever expected.

You have a game about two (or more) players fighting to knock each other off a small stage with some platforms, using only their character's unique moveset and their own skill. The game's physics, character controls, and hitboxes make it possible to move around the stage quickly and effectively, letting you chain attacks together to defeat the other player in a satisfying and rewarding way. But you also have the tools to escape combos and recover back on stage, and when you play another player you're always trying to get in each other's head. Melee's competitive play is unique and interesting, but it's not what the developers had in mind when they made the game.

Rivals of Aether on the other hand has this kind of competitive play as its vision, a reimagining where everything is designed from the ground up with intent and purpose. And it shows.
-Characters are constantly tweaked and the game was patched according to player feedback to keep the game balanced.
-The game's singleplayer offerings complement the multiplayer by teaching you how to play and building on your fundamentals. Getting good at Abyss, the most arcadey mode, still involves learning how to move your character quickly and learning the range of other characters' attacks.
-Inputs are streamlined, customizeable, and buffered. You don't have to do frame perfect hand-breaking button presses just to move around the stage and do what you want, and this makes the game a lot easier to get into at any level of play, and is one of the big reasons I play this instead of Melee. No l-cancels, wavelands feel great. The fact that you can use whatever controller you want and customize your controls helps, but the main factor is intentional design.
-You can play solo, play locally with friends, or play online. Though its ranked and random online modes aren't very active outside of the US, joining one of the discords lets you jump in and play another player online at any time through Steam. And trust me, the online is way better than Ultimate's.

RoA manages to preserve the genre's depth while rejecting the artificial difficulty you get from frame perfect button presses and unintentional game design, and I'm a big fan of that. If you ever watched Evo and thought ""wow Melee looks cool, but there's no way I can play like that"" then you really need to check this out. The fact that it's a lightweight indie game that you can purchase for a fraction of the price of an old nintendo console + old nintendo game controller + old nintendo game also helps.

Obviously this isn't just ""Melee: the indie game"" and I think there's a lot in this game that appeals to people who just can't relate to Melee's appeal, I just wrote this from a competitive Smash point of view.

Finally, I'd just like to say that the characters are cool and I like the art a lot and the music's really good too. Kragg is cute. That's all.

Edit: 
Matchmaking through discord is the most common way to find people to play. If you're considering picking up RoA I recommend joining one of the main RoA discords:

I enjoy fighting games where you can easily string together huge combos to deal tons of damage, as well as fast gameplay. One problem I have though, is that there are not buttons if you use a PlayStation controller, but that's not an important problem. My biggest problem is that characters like Sylvanos and Ori are extremely powerful, but they're DLC. This makes it a pseudo-pay2win but not by a lot. Also, this might just be me, but the online could use some optimization, big-time. When it works, it works perfectly. But when your opponent has only like 100 ping, you just lose connection immediately.

57,Rivals of Aether,72218277,english,"This is just Smash Bros. if the creator actually gave a fuck about wanting to make a well balanced fighting game. The movement feels amazing, all characters have interesting and unique styles and gimmicks and the game features an in-depth tutorial that explains every single mechanic, from Wavedashing to DI, in painstaking detail.

The netplay has near unnoticable input delay if you play in same region, only downside at the moment is the matchmaker that can honestly barely be called a matchmaker as it chooses seemingly random, local play is a bliss however.

The roster is a bit small compared to most other fighting games but not a single character is a lazy copy of another, not even slightly. All 14 characters in this game are made to be as unique and distinct from one another as possible and learning to play each character feels like a comepletely new experience every time.

Also, the workshop is a gigantic clusterfuck of one stupid memefest, if you're into that sort of thing. And many people have and will continue to buy this game just for custom workshop characters, but if you happen to be one of those, I implore you, give the real game a chance while you're at it, you might end up loving it.

Though while we're at trying out. Biggest repulsor of this game is without a doubt the learning curve, which is so steep it might as well be a cliff wall. When you start this game and are still quite bad at it, you WILL get your bright red beaten ass handed to you. Learning how to net get combo'd by your opponent is something that takes a lot of practice and cannot be achieved by simple tricks and since the matchmaker is an unholy abomination (mostly because so few people play this game) you can't really help but be matched against people who will, mostly involuntarily, absolutely demolish you.
You can somewhat forego this issue by using the various Discord servers that the community has dedicated to helping you find opponents of your skill level and helping new players learn the game, which I sincerely recommend. The learning curve will still be just as steep but at least you got people throwing you some ropes instead if kicking you down.

Other than that, this game is a really solid, fun and competitive fighting game. It emulates what Smash could have been if Masahiro Sakurai dind't just want to create a party game and it succeeds flying colors.

5,Rivals of Aether,72182447,english,"I first got this game a while back thinking it was just your regular smash clone. I was hoping the game would be sorta like smash because I was into platform fighters. Dang was I surprised. I started off playing the game and doing the in-depth tutorials on movement, combat, and on each specific character. It started to feel better and better as I started progressing as a player. What I realized is that this game is heavily inspired off of Super Smash Bros Melee. Wave dashing, wave landing, dash attack canceled up smash (DACUS), you name it. All of that tech was taken from Melee and improved on. No ledge camping (or ledges at all) make for an even faster paced game. They even added some new tech to separate from Melee. The game is incredibly made and each and every character is unique and balanced (unlike smash). This game was built to be competitive and has been since day one. If you're a casual player who isn't really looking into the competitive part of Rivals, they even came up with workshop so you can play custom made characters from tons of people in the community. Overall it's an outstanding game and really shows what platform fighters are meant to be. The true rival of the smash bros series.

1,Rivals of Aether,33151240,english,"A lot of people have recently been buying the game solely for the workshop content Rivals of Aether features, and while the workshop content is great and absolutely a reason to buy this game, my review will go more into the vanilla content it has to offer. 
The big question: is this game worth getting, even when disregarding the workshop? Hell fucking yes. The gameplay alone is a reason to buy this game. It's definitely the best platform fighter in terms of movement (feels even better than Smash Ultimate), the combo system is incredibly satisfying to experiment with, and the characters don't really feel like a complete rip-off of existing Smash tropes. 
I will admit that the single-player content is a bit lacking at the moment, but the Definitive Edition (which is coming pretty soon at the time of this review) will hopefully improve the single-player experience.
Overall, great game. Definitely the best platform fighter that isn't Smash, and that's not even considering the Steam Workshop (which is obviously another plus to getting this game).",1499027159,1593843535,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,75,3,17701,259,17163,1601515793

16,Rivals of Aether,71828180,english,"Rivals of Aether is a spiritual sequel to the Super Smash Bros. Melee competitive scene. It takes elements from the competitive Melee scene and expands upon them. In some cases, it removes certain aspects entirely, like the ledge for example, but it always adds something in return. In this example, for instance, every character can wall hop AND retain their jump after air dodging. Every character has more options to recovery than in Melee.

Wavedashing is there. Ledge teching is there. L-cancel is there in the form of ""whiff lag"" if you whiff moves in the air (with a reduction to end lag if you connect). You'll be right at home if you play competitive Melee in terms of how the game controls from your first game; only you'll be better because Rivals is designed for these mechanics to be streamlined.

The most important thing to know about RoA is that this game is extremely punish heavy. Meaning that every character in the game can zero to death you. DI is just as important in Melee, if not more, in RoA. If you like the combo game of Melee, you will like the combo game in RoA. However, if you're someone who is easily frustrated by getting hit many times in a row, you'll likely find RoA frustrating in that regard. I'm not going to claim any ""git gud"" excuses. While I don't think it's a fault of the game that new players tend to get beat extremely hard, I don't blame someone for not wanting to continue because of that either.

That being said, however, I think RoA, once you start to understand how to DI and combo game work, is extremely rewarding. It is very, very satisfying when you pull off a sick combo. Another huge plus is that the entire cast is viable. Yes, there are tier lists, but they ultimately do not matter. If you put enough time in, you can beat any character with any other character, it may just be a bit harder in certain matchups.

Overall if you enjoy competitive Melee, but want a more fresh experience, I think you'll really enjoy RoA. If you're not from the competitive Melee community, but you're interested in Rivals, I think you can still get a great experience out of the game (and grow as player playing it), though it may take some time to get to that point. I was trash when I started, my friend who was very experienced would beat me 25 games in a row without breaking a sweat. Now I win maybe 1 out of every 5 games we play, but the time and effort I put in to improve my skills was very satisfying and rewarding. I honestly enjoy this game more than Melee now. And there's my opinion, hope it helps you.",1593631455,1593631659,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,42,1,17329,2059,11731,1602043360

50,Rivals of Aether,71754753,english,"This game is great,the best smash clone to be made,it's both familiar and new enough to stand on its own two feet as a game.

The game has a very small cast of characters each with charming designs to them.They are not as iconic as the smash characters for obvious reasons but they are effective and stand out from each other. they all play vastly different from one another,even though the game is very aggressive.They each have their own fun mechanic that only they have that makes them pop and stops them from just being like fox but a lion.The cast itself is also really well balanced more balanced than any other smash game beyond maybe ""Project M"" but that barely counts the whole cast is viable in this game.

Unlike smash bros there is no shield or grab,making offense key in winning and zoning limited.This can be jarring when starting out because it feels like you just eat damage but once you get used to it,then the gears start turning and the gameplay feels great.It's way more like ""Melee"" than ""Smash 4""/ ""Ultimate. Parrying feels great to do and it's not too hard to master.It also takes the best parts of melee and leaves out the the more painful taxiating stuff.There is no more ""L"" cancelling instead aerials are just fast landing lag,wave dashing is also way easier to do in this game.It has all the smart second by second thinking of ""Melee without the extremely taxiating execution barrier.One thing I do love is the ability to test out characters in the character select it works wonders.

Customization in this game is great,you can change the controls, have little pets that just hang by you for fun.The best part is you can make your own custom colors for your character which is amazing.

My biggest problem with this game is the lack of content,now I don't mind the small cast it works well but most of them are dlc sadly.Also the single player mode sucks minus the ""abyss mode."" and the final boss the rest is real lazy and boring.I'd love to see break the targets especially and I'd let people make their own break the targets stages as well with the steam workshop.Also since the game lacks items it less appealing to more causal smash fans.

Presentation is great,the animations are real clean and nice and the music is catchy.Never had a problem with clutter at all.It all oozes charm and fun.

I give it 8/10

Now steam workshop I get a 10/10 fixes all the flaws of the game and makes a whole new experince.Now you have dozens of stages ranging from good clone of final destination with a nice aesthetic, a new competitive layout or remake of a smash stage,or just a memey mess.You also have infinite characters that range from garbage to play to complete god of the game and sometimes you get golden nuggets of a character that feels fresh and is balanced.This makes the game a lot more casual and silly,my only issues with this is that I wish there was a way to organize modded characters with folders or something,making the game just a 9/10.

I recommend this game to pretty much all smash fans if not for the solid base game do it for the steam workshop.

Menuing is poor, can't use mouse (or WASD initially), button key is for Xbox/ Nintendo controllers. Playing the game with keyboard requires you to change control  scheme. Try playing a casual game and you'll get stomped, try playing a ranked game to play players of your skill group, you'll get stomped. Not a friendly game for new players of Smash-like games.

I discovered the game from a YT video by Akshon Esports and as a Brawlhalla player who enjoys Melee content I was excited to play a game which was more similar to Smash than Brawl was.

[h1]The Actual Review[/h1]
[b]Chapter 1: I Can('t) Make You Move[/b]
The most basic controls have been bastardized by an incompetent developer who think he's hot shit because he has the autism to sit through a Melee frame analysis video. You stop on a dime with no regard to the laws of inertia, barely nudging the joystick is an actual thing you HAVE to pay attention to in the tutorials, and the overall combat is clunky. Dan Fornace doesn't actually know how to make parrying mechanics, and I embarrassingly sat there as I timed my button presses, only to be punished for not waiting right before instead of right now. Go play with the Royalguard style in DMC3/4/5, it's so much more satisfying to do than parrying with whatever the hell this is. 

[b]Chapter 2: Character Design Do Not's[/b]
To say the official characters are nothing short of easy furbait is low-hanging fruit. ""Furry"" characters can be done right if you know what you're doing, which of course is the one requirement Danny-boy doesn't meet.

He's literally just an anthro Pyroar (for reference, this game was released in 2017; Pokemon X/Y was four years old at that point).

The same as Zetterburn, except he looks like the female Pyroar instead. Like, really? You had ice and water, air and thunder, grass and earth, but you decide on fire and... fire. Not lava or embers, you wanker. [i]Fire.[/i] Again.

Falco, except annoying to look at.
[u]Absa?[/u]
Absa is peak furbait, and that's why I hate him so much. You take one look at him, and you know he caters to the fetish-y femboy look.
[u]Kragg?[/u]
Actually a very good character design. He's bulky, he's muscular, he's intimidating. He's the archetype you should see in fighting games.
[u]Maypul?[/u]
This character is just stupid. He hits people with leafs. Fucking leafs. Like, am I supposed to believe they're sharp leafs? It's just dumb as hell.
[u]Orcane?[/u]
Likable for the exact opposite reasons. In a game that obviously takes itself too seriously, Orcane is the breath of fresh air that can be both goofy and practical. He's a killer whale with legs, he's surely a scary thought.
[u]Etalus?[/u]
A good design. Big, intimidating; do you see the pattern yet? Big and intimidating designs are good designs because they take away from any sort of pandering for the furry audience. Any anthro character either looks hyper-masculine or like a bitchy, feminine bottom. If you're going to do that, give them clothes.
Oh, speaking of which, Zetterburn's loincloth isn't even visible in his sprites. GG Danny.

[b]Chapter 3: All Video Games (but this one) Are Art[/b]
Inconsistent art style was the biggest problem of this game. The backgrounds use a dozen colors and stray away from pure black. Why don't the characters do the same thing? They have mostly flat colors because they use, like, four to six colors in general. You can argue this is done to distinguish the characters, but you can also do that by making them more colorful in general. Maypul easily stands out using light mint greens in his own stage, which is more brown, lime, and dark green in color. Besides, the ""stand out"" rule is already out of the question thanks to custom palettes. Come on, even pre-3DS Pokemon can get this rule down, all of them are capable of carrying up to 16 shades of color in each sprite! The Aether sprites lack shadows, dithering, etc. and really take away any visual pleasure you might have. At the very least, they could stop using pure black outlines and add a little color into the lighter parts (again, like pre-3DS Pokemon would).

[b]Epilogue: Judgement[/b]
This game? Boo. I bought it because I thought it would have been fun to mess with the Workshop creations, but the controls are just garbage and take away any joy I would have doing that. It's not MUGEN, it's a shameless Smash clone that tries way too hard to be competitive despite how mediocre the gameplay is. Just go play Project M or something if you're desperate for a Smash fix from your PC, I don't fucking know.

At least it's not Slap City, I guess.",1593316121,1593316121,FALSE,0,3,0.349804312,17,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,31,14,27,0,27,1593311676
50,Rivals of Aether,70557834,english,"It's really weird that none of these reviews mention the terrible peer to peer connection for matchmaking because that is definitely a pretty significant downside. The game is really fun to play with friends, but unless you are into the game enough to tolerate constantly playing against players with terrible connections that actively impact your own ability to play the game, I would avoid general online play. Also, the barrier to entry to even reasonably compete online is insane, but I guess that is to be expected with this kind of game. Prepare to get utterly destroyed over and over by players who choose to play this game all day in lieu of bathing or going outside. These are people with 1000+ hours in the game who are overjoyed at killing people who just installed a few hours ago to the point where they taunt after every single kill. I know that people who are more concerned with their ego than fostering a positive community is a ubiquitous problem in online gaming (if not the world in general), but I would be remiss in pretending like this game is any exception. If none of these things bother you and/or you are willing to put in a large amount of effort towards practicing so that you can stomp those degenerates into the dirt :D, you will enjoy this game thoroughly. I just not sure I care enough to do so at this point in my life, and if you are looking for a more relaxing, casual experience online, look elsewhere.

Edit: Alright... after playing the game a bit more, I don't think I can reasonably give this game a bad review.

74,Rivals of Aether,71254299,english,"the characters are unique and balanced, the mechanics are unique as well. It really extends the platform fighter formula to places that it just hadn't been before.
The only things I dislike are some of the early characters' sprite work (okay maybe its just Wrastor, and to a much lesser extent Orcane) just feels like a rough draft of a final version. However custom color schemes helps make them a bit more dynamic. Additionally, wall jumping in this game works differently than every other game I've played. Instead of flicking the stick in the direction you want to jump when wall jumping, you have to hold in towards stage to perform a wall jump the whole time. This is not too bad until you need to use your up special to recover because it will not read your wall jump input as a directional input, so you have to dramatically double tap the stick in the direction to angle your up special the way you want to go. A little inconvenient.
But these are extremely minor nitpicks in an otherwise wonderful game! I'd highly recommend it for people looking to get into the platform fighter genre.

Sure, you have to get used to the controls, i get that. 
I'm rather oldschool ok, i have a Xbox360 controller, so why is the jump on the Y-button as default ? Oh right, i can change it in the settings, so dumb of me, so why do i have to set the controls and change it again on the character selection screen ?
Oh that might be because i might have a friend over and we play together. Alright.
A few stumbling blocks at the beginning. My bad !

I hated Smash Bro's for its controls and i hate this for its controls. The rest is fine with me, really good even.

Rivals of Aether is a well balanced, action packed game! It provides loads of fun for both a solo player and a party of friends.

Beware that using this feature does take a sufficient amount of bandwidth and the more players you add the more the quality of gameplay will suffer. I have no issues hosting two other friends, but when we introduce a 4th player the game lags out on almost every map.

They also provide several character bundles for relatively cheap prices. Overall, they are definitely worth picking up when the DLC's go on sale, but for $5 you can't beat that. Buying the bundles also unlocks the maps associated with the characters, however, if you set your map selection to random you have the opportunity to play many of the maps that are DLC locked.

Some characters are either too slow or take forever to attack.
Some workshops characters are more fun than the ones in game.

Story mode is okay.
Stages are pretty standard.

[*]The two of them are definitely similar, right down to the coins for unlocking goodies. You've got your stories to go through with the characters, Abyss Mode as something unique for survival, and online when you're ready to take on some players. You'll feel right at home if you've played anything like it.
[*]I was honestly surprised by the tutorials compared to Smash. They're a lot more than clips of how to play, going over things such as DI and tech skill. Each rival has a lesson of their own as well.
[*]Mod support in fighting games is cooler to me than any other genre. Bringing a character to life and creating matchups yourself is something great being able to do.

Not only am I much better at this game now, I also enjoy the game much more. You don't have to be a master at this game to enjoy it, hell, you don't even have to be good. Not that being good is everything, but the point is this game can be fun for you regardless how well you play it, and with the Steam Workshop now out and running wild, you can play characters that you never expected to!

The lack of an 'ledge grab' is something that I find really refreshing for me, in the smash games its implied in the game design that the center of the stage is supposed to be the strongest position to hold. However, character with good ledge dashes can practically eliminate the disadvantage by just grabbing ledge to gain invincibility (Hax has a great video about this), but characters like Peach have incredibly bad ledge games so it creates a big disadvantage to fighting near the ledge.

I rate it up moooooostly because I can play Mr. Game & Watch from ultimate but only against friends..

It has so much MORE potential and I hope the devs see some of these things and implement them but with even no mouse input for over 4 years of asking to me spells trouble...

32,Rivals of Aether,53865058,english,"This game is dying. The amount of people playing is so short and it's rapidly declining by the day. It once held about 1,000 people playing a day. Now it is around 60, with a good number of those people playing local. Why are they playing local, you might ask? Because the only ones who play online are the ones who've played this game since release, and are typically looking for a combo gif clip to show off to their friends. At this point, there's just no real reason to play the game if you're new to it. If you even WANT to be SOMEWHAT good, get ready to literally waste hours upon hours constantly losing with barely any way to improve unless you get someone to teach you character-specific fundamentals before you can start winning a single game. 
Now, I managed to get a good number of wins in this game, as I previously played Melee and PM competitively, so my skills managed to transfer a bit into this game. Nonetheless, the game is still obnoxious with how insane and unwelcoming the skill gap is online—The community is dying, therefore only the hardest of players are playing, which only encourage new players to simply go away and find something else to play. In a way, the online system and community is killing its own playerbase with how massive the skill gap is, and how little people tolerate new players. And no, there is no matchmaking system, unless you play Ranked, which is more or less abandoned. I'd love to continue playing this game, but honestly with how irritating it is to play, and with how much hours is required just to simply HAVE FUN with the game, all I have to say is it just isn't worth it.
Also bear in mind: this game's community is honestly just very toxic. There's constant T-baggers, constant taunters, a MILLION people who tryhard on new players (and honestly, after being CONDITIONED for so long to fight at my absolute BEST without ONCE giving my opponent room to breath thanks to all these tryhards, I've ended up becoming one of them, and I feel terrible when I end up doing it to a new player), and a lot of people who lag switch to make you mess up your combo and neutral game (and just so HAPPEN to almost always be a zoner character...huh...)
Overall I really honestly think this game isn't worth it until there's a PROPER matchmaking mode and a more mature / open minded community, because right now literally everyone just says ""go on discord lol that's where you'll be able to cherry pick the nice players from the toxic ones (trust me, most of them are sweaty homophobic conservative gamers who think playing fighting games is a personality, so you won't find many who aren't).""
No one should even have to do that. Not even melee net play or anther's ladder is this monotonous. Heck, smash ultimate's QUICKPLAY has better matchmaking than this, which is kinda sad.
All in all:
Melee has a better community. And that shit had someone throw a crab.

33,Rivals of Aether,70117626,english,"So... Rivals of Aether. A 2D Super Smash Bros style fighting game with a cast of original characters of the anthro persuasion. Doesn't sound like the sort of thing I normally play? Yet here I am playing it.

Let's be honest, I got the game for the Ori DLC. And stayed for the workshop integration. Whilst the cast of official characters is tiny compared to Super Smash Bros, even with the DLCs, the fact that the game has workshop integration, and has a large array of well-balanced, well-drawn community-made characters, including well-known favourites from other franchises, really makes all the difference. I've seen the Knight from Hollow Knight. A host of Sonic the Hedgehog characters. Undertale and Deltarune characters... and plenty of custom stages to match.

Of course, the gameplay is great too, of course. The tutorials are a little on the frustrating side... even more frustrating than trying to do the tutorials for Soul Calibur III with a dodgy controller, but that's neither here nor there. Tutorials aside, the fighting is fast-paced combo-based fun with characters boasting specialisations that are of varying difficulty and host various playstyles. Zetterburn may work well for just getting in there and smashing your opponents to pieces with fire, but try that with Orcane and you might end up biting off more than you can chew. There is a story mode, a survival mode, versus mode... and online multiplayer. Local multiplayer is also possible too, as is RPT (I still haven't gotten around to trying RPT on any game on Steam, so I have no idea whether it works well enough for a game requiring these kinds of reflexes).

So yeah, I do recommend this game. I won't give it a rating out of 10, because I don't play this genre enough to have sufficient comparison.",1590962477,1590962477,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,320,47,517,0,285,1593790612

64,Rivals of Aether,70020161,english,"funny how everyone is trying to say this game is the next melee or successor to smash. In reality, the game is extremely flawed when it comes to casual and competitive match making. Input delay is an obvious problem, but is more game breaking in Rivals of Aether than Smash Ultimate - smash ultimate being connected through wireless connection vs Rivals of Aether being on ethernet. As much as everyone has hopes for this game, the game truly consists of being queued against players with 500+ hours even in casual. I beat lvl 9 bots (highest difficulty) around 10 times in a row, which should mean I am ready for online casual at least. This is completely false. I would not recommend playing casual online with under 100 hours put into this game. You will get put into casual games with people who have obvious hundreds of hours, not allowing you learn anything. After getting whiped and not being able to move for around 20 games, you will go offline to practice, only to beat extremely easy bots that don't teach you anything about how to actually play the game.

tl;dr - game is current state is trash in a sense that online casual is unplayable for new players - bots don't teach or prepare the player for online play. There is an obvious reason why smash ultimate is so much more popular than rivals of aether even as a PC platformer that came out 3 years before for 1/5th of the price. Wish I didn't put 5 hours into learning because I would like to refund - not worth spending hundreds of hours getting rolled in casual to learn basic mechanics",1590802103,1590802103,FALSE,3,6,0.46403873,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,86,1,1271,0,356,1591816742

27,Rivals of Aether,69796858,english,"I've had this game for only about 3 days, and almost all of my free time has gone in to it so far.

There are a few key differences between this game and the Smash Bros series.
The removal of grabs and shields make it so that you have to play aggressively to perform well, but you still have the ability of defense with a parry. There are also no ledges, but you get a single wall jump to make up for that. Even if you use all your normal jumps as well as your Up-Special, you can wall jump to get said Up-Special back. Each of the characters are unique and interesting in their own rights (8 Base game, 6 DLC). While I've only gotten a decent amount of experience with one of them for now, I am confident I that will put a great amount of time in each character in due time. The music is stellar, not much else to say on that topic.

And then there's the workshop. Where do I start? 

There are limitless possibilities in the workshop, both in creating characters, and playing others'. There are pages full of quality content for you to enjoy, both in terms of Meme and ""Normal"" fighters. It's the aspect that easily caught my attention on this game, as I'm sure that's the case for many others. But even without it, you're still left with a great game that has such a high skill ceiling.

If you're not keen on playing the online, there's still the Abyss mode. I see it as a sort of way to test how good you are as your character in different ways (Ariel control, ground movement, etc.). You can also spend tokens you earn while playing to buy ""mods"" that will change your character in one way or another. There's also local multiplayer if you have some friends/siblings who wanna play with you.

Also, you can play as Sans with a Gun if you're using the workshop, that makes this worth it alone.",1590434401,1590434401,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,16,1,7903,1073,1041,1601765137

62,Rivals of Aether,63077501,english,"Awesome graphics, cool characters and fun to play. Also tutorial mode is great and very descriptive. 

Unfortunately though as a new player trying to get better at the game, there isn't much by means of doing that. The online mode is restrictive in that you cant casually play 4v4 (with this option like in brawlhalla the matchmaking is more likely to be somewhat even). Also on top of that you're likely to get absolutely destroyed by some very capable players (where are the other newbies?) and if that isn't enough there is also the issue of lag in the matches and Ping issues. (Yes, even within the correct local region)

Would be nice if the difficulty of the CPU could be increased to at least something like 15-20 (for fun but also training purposes) because against lvl 9 CPU on versus mode with less than 3 hours of gameplay I'm able to win with large margins, yet go online and run into almost competition ready players who are pros with the whole wavedashing, parrying, wavelanding, DACUS, edgeguarding + recovery - you get the point. 

Overall its a great game; fun to play, nice visuals and interesting characters. Would be nice to see an expanded story mode including all characters background stories. Also it'd be great if you could select a character to do the beginner intermediate and advanced tutorials so you could get a decent feel for the game with more characters than just Zetterburn. Also would be nice if you could customise the cpu actions is practice mode more ie getting them to spam certain moves like FSpecial to practice parrying etc

Update after some months playing:

This game is awesome and very underrated. The learning curve is a bit steep for those who have never played any platform fighters, and definitely isn't very forgiving to casual players.

83,Rivals of Aether,69575947,english,"I think overall RoA is a good game, but it's definitely not for anyone. Once you understand the game the game flows well akin to melee or any good competitive smash game. I suck at the game and starting to understanding slowly (only 9 hour in so far), But i do see myself improving and starting to pull things together, despite getting my ass handed to me 95% if the time. However, climbing the mountain to be competent at this game is not gonna be easy, this is where the game not being for anyone comes into play. For starters, the tutorial isn't really robust, a lot of the time you will end up going into youtube to see how some of the mechanics are performed. Secondly, if you're new at this game 9 times out of 10 you will play someone who  is a veteran and won't let you play the game. What i mean by ""won't let you play the game""... he will combo you to death and you won't know whats going on and won't land a hit. In other words you're gonna be someones highlight reel that  will probably be uploaded on youtube.  That said, why do i recommend it or even like the game? Well i played street fighter/smash growing up so I'm use to learning games through getting my ass beat and exploring the internet for how to perform tech. So for someone like me I recommend this game. I get satisfaction in finally taking a stock off someone better, performing a combo and successful edge guards. So assuming you're someone like me with patience and with a background in being a noob in fighting games and learning, you will like this game. The game has insane combo potential/creativity and nice diverse characters, on top of finding opponents quickly when you queue up. If you  wants to learn through playing people your level or new.. then i wouldn't recommend it. Nor would i blame you for disliking the game because of it, the game isn't really huge and composed of vets at this point which could be demoralizing if you just touched the game.
 
P.S  the art and soundtrack is awesome.

15,Rivals of Aether,68259879,english,"*Edit* I HAVE DISCOVERED TILT STICK, so i will leave my old review below to kinda show how a player (myself) who isnt very familar with Smash bros i only have owned SSB Brawl and i didnt remember the controls for it and the Wii controles didnt translate over to my PS4 controler it has made things much simpler and im enjoying it alot more now

First off the perception of this game is that its not for casuals and on some level i agree with that but its not required to have fun with them game. I think the main problem is the lack of information and complicated terms given to you in the tutorial in other words.. THE TUTORIALS ARE GOD AWFUL if you want to learn the game i would look up people playing through the tutorial on youtube while your doing it because this is a BIG problem it give you no visuals, examples or anything besides text and they use terms that make understanding things way more complicated then it needs to i hope they make a new tutorial with this next update.

Now the tutorial is my only problem it made things seem complicated when they wernt this game is INCREDIBLE it just doesnt have enough information to new players and the default button settings i beilve are trying to replicate a gamecube controler witch is a very poor decision. For example on a PS4/Xbox controler the jump button is Triangle/Y and you can only use the analog stick to move witch i found is very inaccurate for me now i went in and changed everything till i found it enjoyable but this process of just figuring out the button layout along with the frustrating tutorial took me about a month because i didnt know what i was doing wrong i love learn complex games of all kind and i am very collected while learning but i need to know what im doing wrong to learn

All this seems like a negative review but i cannot ignore that after a couple months of trying to understand and learn after giving up multiple times im having a AMAZING TIME, The Steam Workshop Charaters can be a whole reasion in itself to buy this games you can play/create ANYONE you want and there are many helpful mods to help learning/experimenting in the Practice zone

Over all i reccomend this game highly but know that you will have to do a little external research right away to help learn the game but its honestly not that much or complicated, its just the reasons i stated above can be very frustrating right when you first boot up the game",1588190978,1589841855,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,174,19,3271,70,1271,1601352466

27,Rivals of Aether,69324339,english,"Rivals has a lot going for it; it's a visual treat, the soundtrack is excellent, and there's a lot of discernible variety between the characters. If you've got a friend who wants to grind the game with you, then I'm sure you and this hypothetical person would have an excellent time. However, from the perspective of someone playing it on their own, there are a couple things that really soured me on the game as a whole. This review is not intended to flame or saltily justify quitting, just some gripes that I wish I had seen in more places before I invested some time in the game.

1) The online needs some work. Part of the trouble is the size of the community, but as far as I can tell the matchmaking could stand balancing out. Casual pits you against basically anyone, including the same person you just passed on three times because their PING was shit. The imbalance of casual is to be expected; of course you're going to run into a bunch of players who are better! Just mosey on over to Ranked and...get matched with Gold players as a Bronze. 

A number of folks will counter by mentioning the Rivals discord. Obviously this helps, but it also does not change the fact that the game's online is messy, nor is the discord an official part of the game, so thus not really germane to this review. I am sure that a great many games are improved by external resources; the existence of these resources does not make the game itself any less wonky. Speaking of online presence:

2) The online player-base is surprisingly mean-spirited (the surprise being, in my eyes, that these players are by no means a small minority) . A ton of folks will no doubt advocate a mindset of, ""It's the internet, what did you expect?"", but this toxicity is compounded by the aforementioned matchmaking troubles. It becomes, on some level, impossible to avoid or contend with these people, especially without a report function. Once more, many reviews for this game did not mention this element, so I would like to stress its relative prevalence.

3) The tutorials are very frustrating. While it is no doubt difficult to teach a player concepts like fastfalling and directional input in a tutorial setting, many times I would swear that I had performed the move despite the game not counting it. With two of them, it got so bad I even googled it to see what I was doing wrong, only to instead find steam threads detailing Rivals' inability to read these specific tutorial inputs correctly.

These might seem like nit-picks given that I've praised the game's roster and aesthetic elements, but the aforementioned issues create small annoyances that honestly just made the game less and less fun as time went by. If you enjoy this game, great! You have undeniably good taste and a level of tolerance that will serve you well in life. If you're looking to buy, the best advice I can give is that the game will annoy you frequently in small ways; it's your call if that makes you apprehensive or not.",1589742014,1589742014,FALSE,5,3,0.488565475,4,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,19,1,5595,0,2609,1596578626

Fun platform fighter that has smooth easy to learn hard to master game play, combos, and especially movement. has a lot of inspiration from smash melee featuring things like wave dashes but lacks ledges, shields, and staling which is my biggest complaint. Has a smaller roster of characters but each one of the fighters has vastly different gameplay and strategies. features 2 indie game characters ori and shovel knight which is great too bad that 6/14 characters are payed dlc until the ultimate edition releases. loads of fun with friends and online is pretty good.

The controls, frankly, suck. I don't know what's wrong with them. I don't know what would need to be done to fix them. But I'm at over a hundred hours and most, yes MOST, of the actions I do in the game are not the inputs I want.
Git gud you say. Well I've been playing Smash Bros (the real game) for many, many years, never really had trouble missing inputs. Sure, sometimes I dash attack when I wanted to smash every now and again, but everyone does a bit of spaghetti sometimes. In Rivals, spaghetti is the only order of the day. I've put up with it for over a hundred hours now, hoping eventually something would ""click"" and I could start enjoying the game.

Outro ponto é que o jogo tem Workshop disponível, então você pode baixar ou fazer personagens do Workshop para utilizar com seus amigos ou alguém que você encontrar por ae no servidor do Discord.

20,Rivals of Aether,68242650,english,"So this is a mixed review. I liked the game from a conceptual standpoint but not quite on its own. If you're looking for a smash-like game that captures the frenzied high level tournament play of melee, go for this. If you're looking for a fun party game that feels more like brawl or the new smash games, try Slap City or Brawlout. I'd actually 100% recommend Super Smash Flash, which is 100% free, has over 20+ characters in base game, and feels exactly like the PC Smash Bros experience we all deserve.

PROS:
- Solid gameplay with fully customizable controls (you can ACTUALLY MAP THE SHORTHOP!!!!)
- Slick Digimon-esque character designs! (Renamon who?)
- an ENDLESS array of free expansions in the Steam Workshop, from characters and stages to skins and game modes! (SANS IS IN SMASH SANS IS IN SMASH SANS IS IN SMASH)
- A fully implemented and realized story mode with challenging gameplay. 

CONS
- No shields, no grabs. Perfect parry or die. 
- Very floaty, very slippery. Slide and perish. 
- Not a good game for anyone who is new to Smash-likes. tournament level competency is a prerequisite as there is no difficulty settings for younger/newer players. Git Gud or lose $14.
- You have to buy all the actual extra characters instead of having an option to unlock them through regular gameplay. Rather than giving us a fun challenge like the insane character unlock requirements in Smash, you are REQUIRED to pay more for content that should have been included at launch. Unless you only want to play with workshop characters in the beta builds, or the 8 characters that are included in the base game.

32,Rivals of Aether,68210804,english,"I absolutely love the mechanics and design of this game, and one of the best things about it is that there is such a skill gap between fresh installs and pros that it's nuts, this is a double-edged sword however. due to the relative unpopularity of this game, ranked is not even an option, making finding players at your level a fool's errand. the only concievable way to get better at this game as of right now, is to go through the process of getting destroyed over, and over, and over, and over again, until your on the cusp of uninstalling. as great as this game is, the most fun way for me and my friends to play is on the workshop beta, where no one cares about getting better or learning a new rival. just having a good laugh. the reason i chose to reccommend this game to other players is because the only real thing keeping this game back is the relatively low active player count. my estimate is that there are only ~10ish people on at a time, making the ""new opponent"" button completely defunct. so until this game has more than 10 people playing i will keep getting destroyed by people who have 1000+ hours on the game. I dont care about any of the other flaws of this game, such as the lacking story and pretty lackluster singleplayer modes, all that matters to me, and i think everyone else, is the fact that until you ""git gud"" you will be getting six stocked until your mind is on the verge of melting. everything about the mechanics and design of this game makes it fun to play and watch, so it deserves all the credit it can get. but you can only get so far off of just good design. I will continue to play this game, but. if you dont want to go through the feeling of not even wanting to launch the game because it will yield the same result, (getting six stocked.) then i suggest you ask yourself whether playing as obama and sans on the workshop beta is worth your money. if yes, great! if you actually wanted a serious platform fighter, i suggest you let this game sit on your wishlist until you get some kind of notice that people are actually playing the game. the growth of this game, is however, inevitable. no game this good flies under the radar for too long. 

also if you buy this game now you get all dlc characters when definitive update comes out so consider that.

NOOOOO! you cant just play weegee and obama on the workshop beta this game is a masterpiece and its mechanics are second to none!

Pros:
Really good gameplay.
Runs very well.
Controllers run perfectly with it.
Good soundtrack.
Extremely well balanced, every character is viable.
Small cast allows for better balancing.
Mechanics are great; there's so many movement options and clever ways to recover.
Spammers are almost nonexistent due to the mechanics this game has.
Next to no toxic players in online.
Airdodge mechanic is great; makes the Smash airdodge mechanics go to shame.
Workshop version with custom characters and custom stages.
Custom colors for your characters.
Good DLC characters.
Good devs.

Cons
Online Workshop can be pretty dang laggy.
Mindgames are a bit hard.
Rather high learning curve.
Vanilla version isn't very good for casual games since this game was build with competitive in mind.
Sometimes the hitsun can be a tad excessive.
Some things can be a total chore like the Opulent Rival, the Endless Abyss, and the Ardent Rival achievements.
Roster is pretty small so there's not as much variety.

Really good game overall. If I had to rank it among Smash games I'd rank it second behind Ultimate, with SSBU winning just because of the variety of characters and music, and more causal, and first if it's just gameplay.",1587989852,1587989852,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,33,3,4028,189,3141,1601664637

Whether it be fighters, stages, or even Steam Workshop support, allowing an endless trove of goofy, but also very creative and entertaining content. It feels natural to play right from the get-go by offering many of the same mechanics from Smash games, like wavedashing and DI, while also replacing some core concepts like with ledgegrabbing -> walljumping, and shielding -> parrying, giving Rivals a unique feel that's unlike any other game on the market. It's easy to pick up and play casually, while also offering a lot of depth, making it a great competitive game with a high skill-ceiling.

This game is literally a 2D smash bros game where you don't grab ledges, instead are given an extra wall jump. Giving different approaches and opportunities when it comes to combat. 

Instead of shield you are given a parry that can stun the opponent for a couple frames.

The cast of characters you are given is a good and well structured, but what makes this better is that this game adds workshop content that can virtually be any character. (Master Chief, Mario, Luigi, MR G & W, Sonic, Shadow, Talis, Etc.) And some of the effort creators have put into these characters, being workshop or not are quite awesome.

The combat overall is smooth and satisfying.

Edit:
after playing for a while i have a lot more to say, there are a lot of problems with this game and has definitely helped me shape my idea for MY OWN fighting game that i will develop one day.

Cons:
-Lack of Characters
-Online Is Nearly Dead: you have to go out of your way to guarantee a good match
-Dlc is right in your face and really depressing, if you have it you're disappointed at the lack of characters and if you don't you feel like you don't have the full game.
-They wont be adding anymore characters which suuucks
-They'll probably make a sequel that you have to rebuy

Pros:
-Fun, very fun.
-Interesting mechanics, 
-Workshop has infinite potential
-You will get the DLC for free this summer
-Nice (but limited) music
-Good Balancing

The soundtrack is fantastic with a track for each stage and then some. The price is reasonable with a lot of dlc to buy if you want all the dlc fighters you will be looking at at least $19.96 not including tax including the $14.99 for the base game. The devs also included a workshop which can be a bit of a crap shoot to find what you are looking for with guest characters from other franchises, characters from smash bros, joke and meme characters who are designed to be broken, and original characters which fit perfectly with the base game there are also stages, buddies, and experimental things such as new game modes.

4,Rivals of Aether,67698012,english,"Rivals of Aether is easily the best Smash clone out there. It basically takes Smash's core gameplay, and expands it much farther than Smash ever has. It has a lot of extremely good ideas that Smash wouldn't even dare implement.
For example, Forsburn's smoke and clone mechanics use deception as a strategy, something that has never been seen in a platform fighter, and even at low level play, this makes Forsburn fun as heck to play. Wrastor, on the other hand, has insane aerial combo potential, and can finish combos with little trouble thanks to the fact that he can use his strong attacks (smash attacks) in midair instead of on the ground.

I originally became interested in Rivals of Aether because of the Workshop, as I wanted to create something custom. I originally saw Rivals as Smash Bros but you could make any character you wanted. As a matter of fact, the reason why the vast majority of the Smash Bros. community plays the game in the first place is for the immense cast of characters coming from the four corners of the video game universe, and this interest in any characters I wanted in Smash being creatable for Rivals got me into the game. But as I played more and more, I started to see how a platform fighter didn't need recognizable characters in order to be fun, and the chaacters' mechanics, which go beyond Smash's simplicity, shone through.

Basically, Rivals of Aether is an amazing game, thanks to the characters having original and fun ideas which go beyond Smash Bros.' simplicity, and it doesn't need an infinity of recognizable characters to create a devoted fanbase. If you're a fan of the mechanics that made Smash Bros. great, give Rivals of Aether a try.

Having started playing this at the same time as BH, I can safely say that this is the superior game. Far more technical, with a diverse set of characters with unique movesets. BH is much, much easier to play around with. RoA is clearly where the elite Smashers show off their combo skills in the PC realm.

Exploring each characters abilities in game takes you back to the early days of Smash on the N64, where you just wanted to see what everyone can do. The inclusion of Ori & Sein just opens the door for more characters as well down the line, which will keep me invested as time rolls on.

The effort that has gone into the characters, the world they live in, and the vibant fighting arenas should be appreciated by any fan of retro gaming, not just die-hards of the Smash community. My inner 10 year old can't get over how gorgeous the presentation is.

If you ever enjoyed Smash Bros. and wanted that same experience on PC in a new world with a new cast of characters, then this will bring you a lot of joy.

12,Rivals of Aether,67671346,english,"Great mechanics and character design. I had played this game only a little bit before a few days ago but had been interested and watched a size-able amount of content a while ago. This game had been in my steam wish list and with me getting back into playing games on steam fairly recently, seeing it go on sale for 50% off peaked my interest. I sat on it a little bit but bought it about 3 hours before the sale ended. I've had a lot of fun with the game so far, racking up a little over 16 hours I believe in the few days I've had it so far. That being said I wanted to make sure I was as good as I could be while just starting, I played through the full tutorial including some of the character specific tutorials. Not wanting to just assume I'd be decent at the game just because of all of the hours I've put into the Super Smash Bros. series. I've had my fair share of experiences with all of the titles in that series. I've gone to Melee tournaments a good number of times, no majors like EVO or Genesis, just locals. Although I considered trying to be a pro player for a while. Those ideas are long gone from my naive mind, closest thing to that I think i could become is a content creator in the fighting game community. Point is I'm in no way a god at fighting games but I've sunk hours and hours into Smash especially melee and i wouldn't consider myself a casual player or very awful. All that being said the tutorial was straight forward enough but doesn't really teach you how to utilize the tools it teaches you in a real scenario. I'd say I definitely learned some from the tutorial but I would hope as a new player the story mode at least if not the tutorial being more in depth would add a little more to learn. Like have the player have to do something specific to beat the other Rivals like implement parrying into counterattacking or something. I feel like they could have done a lot more than the bad CPUs that will just randomly kill themselves just cause sometimes. Also I know everyone who complains about this game complains that the story doesn't make sense, which it doesn't. All the characters backgrounds and themes are interesting enough but the way their paths cross in convoluted and frankly not explained well. I played through the whole story mode hoping that I'd get some more practice or learn some more before i just jumped into the online mode. I didn't really get that and my first few online matches at least I got destroyed. I feel like most new players to this game will be very put off by the learning curve of this game and how it doesn't help you too much along the way. Getting beat very badly over and over again can be very demoralizing I know there is a discord linked in the game for people who want to learn the game and I'm sure that is a very good resource for new and older players alike. I personally have not used it at least yet, maybe eventually I'll check it out and give it a try. The online connection can be bad sometimes and I know that in the definitive edition they plan to have region filtering and such which I'm glad for. Also I personally haven't bought any of the DLC characters even though Ranno looks very fun and I'd like to try playing with him. I've decided I'm not going to get any of the DLC and just wait for the definitive edition which thankfully will include all of the DLC characters and stages. I like this game a lot and I'm very excited to get definitive edition on my switch so I can even bring this game with me on the go. I'm hoping for a sooner than later in the summer release cause i just can't wait. Overall I'd give this game 4 out of 5 stars because I really like it a lot but I feel like it could have more for newer players to do to help them improve and not just get thrown into combo city with no idea how to deal with pressure or mixups or anything like that. I'm sure with definitive edition coming out it will bring a good amount of new players in as well as bringing back players that had stopped playing the game. I have my hopes up high but I could very well be disappointed with the results, we'll see. I play Kragg and Zetterburn by the way if anyone happened to be wondering.

53,Rivals of Aether,67306701,english,"One of the best fighting games on the market.  The movement feels amazing, with the buffer making said movement incredibly smooth.  Honestly that alone makes the game incredibly fun to play, it is probably the most fun fighting game to just move around in.  Combos are decently long and free-form, allowing you to string several moves together and adjust to how you opponent reacts to your combo.  Additionally, these combos for the most part aren't incredibly technical, allowing for the player to improvise combos on the fly.

The only real complaint I ever had was that there was a lack of casual play.  However, with the addition of workshop, that issue is completely solved.  There's plenty of fan-made characters that are a lot of fun to play, ranging from those who were created with balance in mind, all the way to the completely broken ones.  If you want to play Rivals and not worry too much, get a couple of friends and play those broken characters, it'll be a blast.

Overall, a great game to pick up.  Relatively inexpensive, even with all the DLC, and offers a lot of fun for the competitive or casual fighting game fan.

Pro's: 
Good music
Fast and solid gameplay
Fairly friendly community willing to help improvement, or willing to goof off if thats what you prefer.

Cons:
Super steep difficulty curve online.
Very few choices of how to improve and practice outside of online play.

Cons that are likely to be fixed in the near future with definitive edition:
Wired internet connection is kind of required, and even then there is occasional unstable ping.
Limited to 1v1 multiplayer outside of local play, and steams couch play.

now for some joking character overviews:

(Seriously these are just jokes, don't dive into the salt mines.) 

Clairen: Future cat uses bubbles to hide from projectiles. Opponents find her sword stunning. They do not mean that positively.

Zetterburn: Fire makes fire, While also making it so that this lion can hit harder. WHY???

Forseburn: The most intense game of hide and seek I've ever seen. 

Wrastor: CAPTAIN LITERALLY A FALCON. 

Absa: Local goat kills everything with one very well-placed kick. 

Elliana: Essentially bowser jr. but interesting.

Sylvanos: I am anger salad. I speak for the trees, and the trees say F@#$ you.

Maypul: Gets one of the worst recovery moves in the game, so uses it to kill people instead.

Kragg: KRAGG THROW ROCK AT FACE. KRAGG THROW ROCK AT FACE. KRAG THROW ROCK AT FA-

Orcane: Adorable water dog kills people with his own ass. 

Etalus: (the magic school bus theme grows slowly louder as he slides towards you)

Ranno: Less damaging but harder to get rid of passive damage than zetterburn AND a more powerful stun mechanic than Clairen. Why was this even approved?

Ori: Dies at 70% but can kill you at 70%. Seems like a fair trade.

Shovelknight: Somehow can do bayonetta style combos... with a shovel?

     This game is great because it has a story mode, online, and practice without being too involved in any specific game mode. I also like the the characters and physics in this game. The characters really remind me of Super Smash Bros 64, because its a little harder to string along a combo, and the main point is to have your opponent off the stage. The physics remind me of Super Smash Bros Melee, or Super Smash Bros Ultimate, because it's like ""punching a balloon across the room."" 
     Some downsides to this game it's really hard to start playing online, for your first time. For me, I would never be able to beat someone online because they combo me so much. Maybe I'm just bad. I still love the game though. 
     The community in my opinion is really nice compared to some other games I have played such as Geometry Dash, and Team Fortress 2. 
     Overall, i would have to give this game an 8/10 mainly taken down points for originality, and difficulty. I hope you enjoyed my review of Rivals of Aether and continue to/decide to play this game.",1485032471,1585188752,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,37,9,2769,0,1971,1595968485

62,Rivals of Aether,65521636,english,Having played many different platform fighters and all the smash games I can confidently say this is some of the tightest and most well tuned and engaging game play. The characters are all unique and balanced and the online is better than most other games in the genre. The only negatives are a bit of lack in single player content and having multiple payed DLC characters that in total cost more than the base game. This is at least partially excusable as the developers are always hard at work and the support goes along way unlike say  a company like Nintendo. The workshop has some super cool and insane characters and is a great way to introduce new players to the scene.

Ultimate's deal with literally copying off a character they already made like Zero Suit Samus to regular Samus or Ness to Lucas. The pixel art style with background, design, and sprites are extremely polished and flow smoothly. I like the fact you can even download mods for this game to further expand your experience to infinite possibilities. With that, you can pretty much make your own characters and stages if you know how to code and and draw pixel art or sprites. Because of that, I can even say that this game could blow Smash Bros. Ultimate off the market because of the fact you can create. I can even make as many league of legend modes for this game as I want.

56,Rivals of Aether,35566569,english,"EDIT 3/16/20: Bit late to the punch on this one, but my goodness the workshop content is incredible. It's only a matter of time before every fictional character is in this game. 1000% recommended.

EDIT 8/10/18: Shovel Knight was announced, which is cool. That likely brings the grand total of all the DLC's cost to $20 (excluding a possible sale of course). Coming from someone who has all current DLC and intends on buying the final DLC fighter, it's... kind of a bit much. It's not like the game is incomplete without them, but when you're playing with the same 8 fighters, it leaves a lot to be desired. Especially when you know that lot to be desired is THERE, just locked behind a price. That said, you probably shouldn't buy this game unless you're willing to fork out at LEAST 25 dollars instead of the up-front 15. That way you can either get 4 more original fighters or the 2 guest stars, or a combination of the two. That, or you could wait for a monstrous sale and get everything for less than the game's original pricetag.

That said, I love this game.
 

If you enjoyed the competitive aspects of any of the Super Smash Bros. series, you've got a high chance to enjoy this. It may take some getting used to, but the gameplay becomes very rewarding and satisfying as you learn to utilize many of the game's techniques. Especially once you get used to each character's unique mechanics, but, as with every fighting game, some tend to be more powerful than others. However, due to the relatively small roster size and the active team, you'll find that no character is particularly unfair to fight against (Except [i]maybe[/i] Ori and Sein, but they're supposedly being changed soon). Some things to note before you purchase, though:
[list]
[*] Not everything will be unlocked initially. You will have to play quite a bit to unlock everything.
[*] You will likely want a compatible controller. I've had someone refund the game because the keyboard controls were really hard to deal with.
[*] The price for non-cosmetic dlc that we know of (which is 3 characters and one stage) goes up to ten dollars. Only one character and one stage are available right now. There's more dlc on the way as well, so don't expect the full package with your initial $15 purchase.
[*] Singleplayer content may be a bit on the short side. There's no slough of extra gamemodes like Smash 4 has, but this does include a story mode, an Abyss Mode (think of an endless Multi-man smash, but with a lot of customization elements and some boss fights and unique challenges interwoven), online play, and, of course, a local versus mode (with AI if you don't have friends nearby)
[*] Currently, you can only play vanilla 1v1 on the stage hazzard-less versions of stages online. The developers said that the online mode will be expanded in the future, but just know that as of this date, it isn't quite complete yet.
[/list]

And as far as the gameplay itself compared to other Smash-esque games goes...
[list]
[*] No ledge grabbing.
[*] Airdodge is that of Melee's, but you don't go into freefall afterwards and it can be used to cancel some special moves.
[*] No basic grab (some characters do have command grabs)
[*] Shield is replaced with a Parry, which is essentially a counter that stuns the opponent briefly, even if they use a command grab. Has strict timing and the stun can be ignored entirely if it's triggered by an opposing jab (with an exception of the last hit)
[*] Every character can wall jump, and can do so even out of free fall or some special airborne state. Walljumping in these circumstances removes freefall too.
[/list]

Also, something else worth noting is that the game's music and artwork are beautiful and refreshing, despite following the infamous and in some cases boring pixel art style. In turn, due to the graphical style, you'll find that this game can run on just about anything at a smooth 60 fps. Your old computer, your laptop, your gameboy, your refrigerator, your couch, your soul, you name it. ...Okay, maybe not ALL of those things...

Overall, I recommend that any competitive Smash Brothers player try this game. Heck, maybe you'll enjoy if you like competitive games in general. It takes inspiration from the Smash Bros. series while providing many new and unique mechanics to keep it from being a clone. While the game is missing some things that will be added in the future, what it does currently have will keep you occupied for quite a while. If you have 15 dollars to spare, this game might be worth picking up if it's many high points intrigue you.",1507452408,1584417571,TRUE,4,1,0.56349206,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,29,7,16613,268,9571,1601155520

The standard online lobbies are rather hostile to casual players, but remote play and a number of Discord communities make it easy to find players of a similar skill level to jump in and have a blast with now and again.

The game's biggest weakness is a drought of good singleplayer content. The NPC AI is rather lacking compared to what can be found in similar fighting games and the solo story mode... needs an overhaul. Abyss mode is pretty fun, but it's nothing to write home about.

Overall, this game is great and the robust workshop support really elevates it. You need to put in some amount of effort to get much enjoyment here, but having a good time isn't only down to system mastery like some of the negative reviews would have you believe.

2. get some characters from the workshop (You can't play as the costume characters without getting them)
3. right-click Rivals of Aether, click Properties and click Beta (Now this is when it starts)
4. click ""Select the beta you would like to opt into"" and scroll down until you see ""Workshop Beta"".
5. click cancel and enjoy playing.
If it works, your welcome.
if it didn't work, try to do 3 to 5 again. (Keep in mind the game's cover will change to Purple to Green)

There are 8 base game characters and 6 DLC characters (Two characters per $5 pack, with an exception for some third party reps) as well as a story mode based around the 6 characters first introduced to the game, and an ""Abyss"" mode that tasks you with completing certain challenges one after another in a wave-like function. All of these features are great by themselves, but the game starts to get even crazier once you boot up the Workshop Beta.

The workshop for this game is pretty great! A ton of characters and stages to download and play with/on for yourself, whether it's as OP as Ronald McDonald or The Duane or as weak as Motivational Lizard (he tries his best though). There's something for every type of player on the workshop, and matches can become crazy if you get some friends and some workshop characters together. Unfortunately, as it's still in Beta, there are some issues. It's inevitable that your game could crash when playing a very demanding workshop character (such as Base Joker) and menu load times for workshop characters can be annoying. There are other things that annoy me slightly, like not being able to use Workshop characters online with friends or coins earned not saving, but those I can understand.

There's online play as well. Of course, you won't be able to play as any Workshop characters or stages online, which makes sense. There are many workshop characters that are stupidly powerful or underwhelmingly weak, and having those characters flood online matches wouldn't be that fun. I personally haven't tried many online matches, as I'm not as good with the base roster as I am with the workshop characters.

Overall, I enjoyed this game. It reminds me of games like Super Smash Flash which are PC friendly clones of Smash Bros. I think what makes this game more enjoyable than Smash Flash is because of how different it is compared to Smash. There's different characters, different mechanics, and different customization options, like making your own custom color. If you want a PC fighting game with similar mechanics to Smash Bros but still being different, Rivals of Aether has you covered!",1583783471,1583783471,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,27,8,6977,241,4960,1601840031

I never felt so much progress as I improved with smooth mechanics that allow for fun matches. A development team that ACTUALLY cares about its game and strives to improvement. Its getting a brand new netcode, something capcom wouldn't do. It has a fun workshop mode where you can download and make your own fighter.

84,Rivals of Aether,64468292,english,"I can't believe ive left off reviewing  this game for as long as I have considering its one of my favorite games of all time, but you should know that this is the most enjoyable platform fighter ive ever played, including every smash brothers game. people say this game isnt for casuals, but I no longer agree with that. with the workshop the game brings in the potential audience of any casual, which is amazing to see. 

the workshop is amazing and all, but im not going to be talking much about that. when it comes down to it the base game and its dlc, are some of the most fleshed out, interesting characters ive ever played, focusing on quality over quantity to the highest degree. every character played super different, and super unique even if at first glance, they seem super basic. the fact that I enjoy playing as literally every single one of them is a huge achievement.

If you've ever seen competitive melee, you may be discouraged to get into it with how technical it is. however, this game tries to imitate the feeling of those games when you are really good, keeps its high skill ceiling, but gets rid of the barrier of entry. instead of L cancelling, there just isnt much lag, wavedashing is incredibly generous, and the knockback paired with the hitstun is incredibly combo based. 

offstage is the most fun that ive ever had in a platform fighter, if you just played offstage it would still be my favorite of the genre. in games like smash bros, you get a standard ledge that grants invincibility, which is where most edgeguarding takes place. however, in rivals there is no ledge, instead you get a walljump, in which grants you your up-b again. this allows offstage to be threatening, without being strictly a death trap like it is in games like ultimate.

other things that are drastically changed are the grabs, which dont exist, giving more emphasis toward using your regular moves to get the opponent where you want, instead of just grabbing to start a basic combo. The other change is to the shield, instead of a shield every character gets a parry, which acts like a standard counter, but if activated, stuns the opponent like when you get a shield break, which emphasizes true combos or aerial combos. if its not true or confusing to the opponent, they cant parry at the correct time, which allows you to keep a combo going

on the topic of combos, in games like smash ultimate particularly, combos are quick, done in a few moves, or highly technical. Take mario for example, marios notorious combo involves a shit ton of up airs, a few up tilts sometimes, a throw, and an up b, but mainly a shit ton of up airs. in rivals, I have never looked up any combos, seen any and tried them myself, or anything, but I came up with a bunch for myself. They happen almost subconsciously, its really something you have to play for yourself. just know that if you look up a combo video, they arent THAT hard to do. with a little practice you could probably do something very similar, be it worse or better.

People say that the singleplayer is horrible in this game, and for the most part I agree with them. however, abyss mode seems often overlooked. the ui is really confusing but if you find it, unlock it, and play it, its very fun. you use coins you get from playing the game to buy runes which change up your characters moveset in minor or major ways. you start with nothing, and you wont get farm but overtime, you get more gear and get better. another bonus is you can play it with friends which goes a long way.

you wont regret buying this game if you put the time in, its that good. definitive edition is on its way and I highly HIGHLY reccomend it. Im personally getting switch because I already have the regular pc version obviously, but on the topic of portability or workshop, go with pc first. workshop does add a lot to the game, but dont look over the main game, its a damn good time.",1583264870,1583264870,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,225,5,19862,1822,9398,1601933295

It plays beautifully and there's a huge ammount of depth in each character. Game is hard as balls and extremely frustrating though. Certain characters feel like their dominant strategy is extremely degen.

Parry is a bad and one dimensional mechanic and probably what drags the game down the most for me personally. 

DLC characters feel kinda wacky, especially elli, sk and ori. game got alot less fun when those lads joined the roster. 

Pick it up if you're interested in a really hard plat fighter with unconventioanl mechanics. Netplay is ass but is being worked on.

Rivals of Aether is The Game for you!

Positives:
+ The game has a really good art style
+ while the selection of characters is smaller than Smash, it does provide characters with unique moves, --personality and all things that makes a good fighting game character.
+ Gameplay is Easy to pick up, fun to play, but it's hard to master all mechanics in the game
+ Luckily it has a great Tutorial that will teach you from the Basics to the most advanced techniques
+ Soundtrack has a really good 16-bits vibe and it's always great to listen to it
+ It has Shovel Knight and Ori (as DLC) 
+ Online is really good and probably the mode you're probably gonna be spending the most time with

Negatives? sadly there is some
- 6 of the characters are DLC, even if they are cheap like 5 dollars 2 characters, 2 of them (Shovel Knight and Ori) are separate and cost the same ammount of money which is a bit of a bummer
- Single Player Content is lacking in many places
- It's probably not gonna be for everybody since it feels Heavily different from Smash in gameplay, like the lack of Grabbing Ledges, Guarding and actual Grabs

but despite some issues here and there, Rivals of Aether is a great game. i can't even call this a Smash clone because the game stands out on it's own and it feels really good to play! in fact parts of the gameplay i prefer it over Smash Ultimate (and i love that game). and now with the addition of Workshop this will make the game even more interesting and insane! i simply love this game~

11,Rivals of Aether,63043830,english,"Do you like Smash Bros?  Then you're gonna love this game!

This is the closest thing we can get to playing Smash Bros. on PC.  And that's just fine because the characters are all well-designed and fun to play as.  I mean they have AN ORCA-CAT (ORCAT?) for Pete's sake!  And if for some bizarre reason you don't like any of them, you can just play as custom characters from steam workshop! (Sans and Ronald McDonald, anyone?)

As far as being a Smash Clone goes, this tries to provide more tournament-friendly play and thus has no items and has stages that are less gimmicky than many stages found in Smash.  So if your absolute favorite part of Smash is throwing around green shells and poke balls at each other, you may be a tad disappointed.

What you have you have here is a game that is not only perfect for serious play, but is a ton of fun to casually play with your friends & family.  And if you don't currently have anyone to play with in the same room, then you can play online Currently limited to 1v1 as of Feb-6-2019, but 3p & 4p online matches will be available this Summer with the upcoming Definitive Edition.

tl;dr  This is an amazing Smash Bros. style game you should totally play!",1580974682,1580974682,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,109,4,1637,7,1537,1601162840
12,Rivals of Aether,63038614,english,"Rivals of Aether....is a fun game. Despite what it may appear to be on the surface, this game is not a Smash clone. It may be a platform fighter just like Smash, and while the overall speed of the game may be more akin Smash Melee, the distinct lack of grabs, ledges, or shields make this game pretty unique mechanically. Not to mention the unique roster that Rivals brings to the table as well. Not to mention, Rivals is CONSIDERABLY much more balanced than Smash. The community is somewhat small, yet dedicated. Which makes this game not too appealing to casual fans, as there are likely dozens of players with thousands of hours in this game who have been playing since day 1, leading to a very frustrating cycle of getting beaten time and time again. Until suddenly, a miracle happens, and you start getting beaten less often. Even after 150+ hours in this game myself, I still often get beaten by players of higher skill level than me. So getting better at the game isn't something that just happens; it's something that you have to be dedicated to and work towards. Something that, more casual players who aren't interested in that kind of time-sink, may find off-putting.

If the game isn't very casual friendly by itself, then what is there left to do? Well, you can always try out ""story"" mode, with art that looks like it was drawn by a 4th grader and a ""story"" that makes Smash Brawl's 'Subspace Emissary' look like Homer's 'Odyssey'. Not to mention that for new players, the CPUs are hard. For players who have played the tutorials, the CPUs are nothing more than an obstacle between them and earning that second custom color option. But what about besides the story mode? Well, there's Abyss Mode. Where you can spend hours and hours doing the same easy thing over and over again, just so you can get special runes that just adds an extra helping of jank into the game. But only on local mode and only with the base 8 characters, not the DLC ones (more on that later). But besides the game modes, there is one last thing that makes this game appealing to casuals: [b] The Workshop [/b]. With the power of the workshop beta, you can play as an infinite amount of characters that have been lovingly made by dedicated and (mostly) creative members of the community. There are SO many great workshop characters, and lots of them have very unique ideas that haven't been seen before. Now, keep in mind, the Steam workshop beta is just that: a beta. It is prone to crashing online and workshop replays have had a tendency to cause crashes as well. But if you're able to look past that and instead see the sheer abundance of creativity radiating from the workshop, you're bound to fall in love with it. Not to mention the ""modding"" that uses the replacement of game files that helps in adding custom music, skins, and more.

Now let me address some of the other concerns new players may have, which is either related to or can be answered by the Definitive Edition releasing Summer 2020. Plenty of people will, and already have, questions about what this means for Rivals. Well, we don't know everything. But what we do know is that Rivals of Aether: Definitive Edition will replace current Rivals of Aether. And yes, this does mean that if you buy Rivals now, you will have to buy it later. I understand the feeling of frustration on hearing this, but that's just the way it is. [b] HOWEVER [/b], the developers have confirmed that if you buy the game and all of the DLC characters, you will NOT have to buy the game again. The devs have not made it known how this will work (because they don't know how either), but they have confirmed that it will happen one way or another.

Definitive Edition, while still replacing the current Rivals, will, bring along many new things with it. This includes:
-Better netcode (better online experience, however the game will still likely be P2P)
-All DLC characters added to the base game
-Abyss mode will be finalized along with runes for all DLC characters
-New cosmetics (stage skins, chracter skins, etc.)
-Some older characters will have updated sprites and animations
-Workshop support will hopefully be finalized and out of the beta status (will NOT be available on Switch)
-A new platform (i.e. Switch) (RIP Xbox. No, we have not heard word as to the exclusion of Xbox for Definitive)

[b] IN CONCLUSION [/b]: Rivals of Aether....is a fun game. It may take dozens of hours and lots of dedication in order to even get remotely good at the game, but personally, I think it's all worth it for the hundreds of fun experiences it's given me. If you have any questions or are looking for help in how to get better, you can always ask the Discord server. It's widely active, and there is surely to be someone there who can help you. Comments will also be on for this review, so you can ask me anything if you'd like. Thanks for reading.

and when i write this review it Isn't just me saying that this is a bad game, far from it, but it comes from frustration. I know platform fighters and I know that there comes a lot of frustration from them and the games feel unbalanced. But for some reason whenever I play aethers i feel like im getting combo'd into oblivion and nothing helps. 

I know for a 100% fact that my 6 hours of playtime means i have little experience and i don't know matchups. But i the Directional Influence in this game feels utterly useless and once you get hit by a certain move by one character it just feels like its over and lose the stock or get around 80% of damage on you. 

I'm mainly writing this review for help. Maybe some of my complaints are valid and maybe its the inexperience that I have so I am just a noob complaining. But the only thing that I can say that really makes me not want to play is when I play smash i feel like when im losing its my fault, when i miss its my fault, and when i do the wrong option its my fault.

Grabs, shields, and ledge-grabbing are completely removed. This means gameplay is faster and more kinetic than smash, and in place of shielding is a parry which takes a lot of work to master using correctly. there are still air dodges and rolls though, making the game more focused on spacing and aggression.

It also helps that every character feels entirely unique, with their own special mechanics and ways of being played; playstyles range from placing puddles or air currents to buff your character, to creating shadow clones or earning money to buy new special moves. there is a playstyle for every type of player here.

The game has a lot of optimisations to many types of play, such as turning off stage hazards or uneven level design. Sadly the online is missing a few features i would love, there is no way to make big lobbies for all your friends, which makes it a hard sell to my discord buddies.

77,Rivals of Aether,62522240,english,"Debatably the best take on a platform fighter.  If you like smash then you will likely love this game.  

Important things to note are:[list]
[*]No shields.  
  Instead you have a high-risk, high-reward option called a ""parry"" which if timed correctly will stun your opponent or reflect any projectiles depending on the move.
[*]No grabs.  
  No shields, no need for grabs which I find to be one of the lamest things to ever exist in any fighter.  You'll have to be a lot more creative with your combos/punishes that just grab down throw into aerial.
[*]No Ledges.
  With no ledge to grab onto you're forced to recover in a lot more creative and interesting way.  Because of this you're given more options offstage to help you get back onto stage.  For instance, you can air-dodge once before landing and you won't go into special fall.  Also, you can walljump from a special fall state so you can perform your up special, walljump cancel it and up special again.
[/list]
There's a lot more to it than just that but I want this review to be brief so if you're interested and want to learn more about the mechanics of Rivals of Aether than looking online is a great idea.  If you're the kind of person who likes to ""learn as I go"" then you'll really want to pay attention when playing because there's a lot you can get punished for not knowing.  DI is very important as is knowing when and how to tech and whether or not you can throw out your own move before your opponent's next one.

If you like playing aggressive and having a very high skill ceiling then this game is a must-have.  Also SHOVEL KNIGHT",1580143275,1580143298,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,126,9,11416,1616,5415,1601633038

80,Rivals of Aether,62508322,english,"[h1] Honestly I Just Love the Workshop [/h1]

I don't have the same experience as other Rivals players or even the time and practice that comes with being a Smash fan and fan of games like it.  I only got into these games since Super Smash Bros. Brawl.  

However, I do think that the gameplay of Rivals feels really, really [i] nice. [/i]  Rivals of Aether has a fast, clean flow to its combat.  Leaping around with Zetterburn, burning the dude then chokeslamming them into the abyss.  Throwing chunks of earth with Kragg and bashing everybody into the same earth.  The gameplay of Rivals is so intense and speedy and it gives me a thrill that the newest Smash game just hasn't been able to replicate.  

But...I'd be lying if I said that I wasn't more thrilled by the user content.  Now, I understand that Rivals has a team that worked on the game, originally crafting this platform fighter to be as smooth and sleek and badass as possible.  However, since the workshop was created for this game back in 2019, I've been more hooked on the game's user content than nearly anything else.  

You have people making OCs that could fit into the Rivals of Aether universe very well.  You have people adding stages from games I haven't heard anyone talk about in...ever.  You have the most meme-like garbage I've ever seen that is something you know is gonna show up on YouTube.  But most importantly, you have some of the most fun and unique interpretations of existing characters in Rivals that Smash never has yet.  People implement Garou: Mark of the Wolves characters with mechanics from MOTW itself, you got mechanics from 3D platformer characters worked into their moveset that nod back to physics exploits from the game.  You got fighters who people have wanted in Smash fully playable in Rivals with their own movesets.  

God, the workshop content is so good.  I've had so much fun just being offline and testing out so much workshop nonsense, characters that are so broken or fun to use that you'd probably never see them in their own crossover game like this.  The guys in the workshop are really good at what they do.",1580126215,1580126215,TRUE,1,0,0.523809552,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,176,27,1345,0,552,1594513109

better than Melee

sometimes it randomly changes your control scheme and it's super fucking frustrating

93,Rivals of Aether,62248479,english,"Very good game, If you like Super Smash Bros, you will definitely enjoy this, all the basic gameplay features are the same so it is easy to get into the game if you are coming from Smash. The main differences to consider is that you get a parry mechanic rather than a shield, and there are no ledges to grab onto. Every character is unique and has their own special gimmicks that work well with their movesets, and the roster includes both Ori from Ori and the Blind Forest, and also Shovel Knight from, well, Shovel Knight, which are very cool additions and also very fun to use. 

The singleplayer content is sort of lacking but fighting games aren't known for their singleplayer content. The game has a story mode which just consists of a series of fights for each character and a cool final boss battle where all the characters act as your lives, similar to how it worked in the Subspace Emissary from Super Smash Bros Brawl. There is also an Abyss mode where you try to get past wave after wave of fights and minigames, which is fun every so often but gets repetitive quickly as the waves are not randomized so you do the same order of things every run. 

If you like customizable content in your game, this game has a lot of it. Playing Abyss Mode lets you unlock and use Abyss Runes, which change the way attacks and physics work for the characters, and they can be used in fights against other players as well locally. In the extras mode you can create your own custom colour palettes which can be used in local matches or online in casual matches. There is a collection of various buddies that can be equipped for a little bit of flair in a match. The game also recently added support for workshop content. This includes custom characters, buddies, and stages, adding a limitless amount of content and makes the game more than worth the price.

All in all, this is a good game and I highly recommend it.",1579729108,1579729108,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,163,3,20490,177,18422,1601429111

The only thing i'm not a huge fan of is the DLCs, the roster isn't huge and the DLCs are a bit pricey, I will probably eventually break down and buy a few but that's only because i've enjoyed the game so much already and i'm irresponsible with my money, not because it's a deal.

94,Rivals of Aether,61504765,english,"man if you hate yourself this game's perfect for going online and getting your ass stomped. doing casual matches online is like playing the lottery in how badly you want to get whooped. for some reason a lot of really good players hang around in casual match mode? i personally am fine with it but totally understand the frustrations that other people have getting into the game. the learning curve on this game is so unbelievably high; you just have to pray that you get matched with someone who's only just slightly better than you instead of leagues ahead so you can learn something instead of get 0 to death'd three times in a row

that being said, after about 50-ish hours of playing, it feels nice to be able to stomp on some other people. i've played PM, Melee, and ult and probably have over 1000+ hours combined in those games so i think i was able to pick it up a little quicker since the mechanics mostly carry over aside from parrying/wall jumping/hitfall. i think the main thing i'd complain about is how awful ranked mode is; i'll sit there for like, five minutes and not get a match so it's just better to play roulette with casual mode and hope you have some amount of fun. i mean, at the very least, the netcode is better than ultimate's so learning how to play online is bearable

the game is super well-designed and each character has their own quirks/playstyle that really make them all feel unique. everyone's got a different combo game and different ""objectives"" to fulfill while playing; i really wish that there was an easier way to learn the game than getting stomped on but sadly that kind of seems like the main way to learn. gonna keep playing for now; if you're okay with losing a lot, this game's honestly really fun to learn and playing when both people are on even playing grounds feels so fair; never felt like i've lost due to a matchup. it's really just about how you play.

RoA distinguishes itself from Smash by replacing ledge-grabbing with wall-jumping, removing grabbing and shielding, and adding a parry mechanic. Each character also has an environmental ability of some kind, such as Wrastor's ability to create a horizontal space which he can move more quickly in. These abilities add a lot of interest to the game. The stages were thoughtfully designed, and the player is free to switch between the gimmicky casual version and simplified competitive version of each stage as needed (unfortunately, the gimmicky stages cannot be used in online play, only local play). In general, the online play is as good as the connections on either end and the distance between the players will allow. Using a wired connection and playing with people in your region will help. This game will run on any machine.

Daily players for this game average from 200 - 500 players. This isn't a completely unreasonable amount of players, but in my personal experience I was playing against the same person in matchmaking repeatedly who kept leaving due to not wanting rematches. When I wasn't getting the same person I got people who would take a couple rounds, then leave and leave me in queue for awhile.

Aside from that problem there's also the massive skill gap. The only way you're going to be getting 'gud' at this game is if you have a friend who is already experienced that is willing to teach you how to get there, because the absolutely gigantic skill gap between you and the people that have already been playing this game will be so insane that you will find yourself being frequently 3-stocked and styled on. Aside from that you can also bash your head against the wall of top tier players this game has to offer and hope that some of their skill will rub off on you.

56,Rivals of Aether,61308585,english,"I'm writing this review after my two xbox360 controllers stopped functioning correctly for playing this game so much. This game is the closest thing to a proper platform fighter that you can get on steam with a relatively healthy playerbase. It's not a big community, but if you have too much ping playing with the built-in matchmaking system there is always the possibility to find players on discord servers that are always eager to teach and play with you. There's also a definitive edition coming out soon (tm), which should bring a much better netcode along with other features.

The game is simply phenomenal, from the music, to the tight, frenetic gameplay, but I'm going to be honest with you. If you are getting this game just because you saw that the characters are animals and you are a furry, don't. You will get destroyed over and over by the players who actually like the fighting aspect of the game and tore each other to pieces while learning. The game can still be great for playing casually, but if you don't have other casual friends to play with, you are probably going to get frustrated and leave after 10 hours like most people do. But of course, there's always the possibility of being a furry and also liking fighting games.

Rivals of Aether is a love letter to smash bros melee, you will see good players using wavedashes, wavelands, edge cancels, crouch cancels, multishining, etc., I hope that's enough to convince you to get the game if you like melee. If you come from other platform fighters tho, the game is still very accessible, as techs are not as hard to perform as in melee. While it's true that Rivals is very inspired by melee, the game still has very unique mechanics, like the parry replacing the classic shield, or the walljump replacing the ledge, which make Rivals a more aggressive game than Smash, and a much more intense game than the floaty and shallow brawlhalla.

As for customization, the game allows custom colors (free) and skins (mostly paid), which is awesome. The game also lets you play with a ton of different controllers, and all of them should be viable (xboxONE, xbox360, dualshock 2/3/4, gamecube, keyboard, switch pro controller, etc.)

I love this game and the friendships that I gained along my ~700 hours of playing, and I plan on playing it further after getting a replacement controller. Get this game if you like being competitive, and buy the dlc if you want to try new characters. Every character is viable, and you will surely find one that suits your playstyle.

71,Rivals of Aether,23734018,english,"Update 1/3/2020:

Almost 4 years later and the online mode for this game is brutally incomplete still. For starters, matchmaking is especially rudimentary as there are extreme deviations between you and your opponent in ranking. This game thinks it can imitate Smash Bros without actually having the infrastructure to do so. Oh, and DLC has also effectively ruined this game as the best characters are available to those who have some extra cash available. Pay to win at its finest!
--------
I want to like this game, I really do. And that can happen if they make the necessary fixes to get this game back on track. Playing this game locally is very fun, and I have done so on many occasions with friends. However, the big issue I have with this game right now is with its ranking system online. If you're just an average player, you'll either be matched with someone who is ranked significantly lower than you are or you will be matched with someone who is ranked significantly higher. I have rarely been paired with another player whose ranking deviated from mine by 30 ELO points or less. So needless to say you'll either be bored playing someone who doesn't have a ranking comparable to yours or you'll be frustrated by getting destroyed by someone who is light years ahead of you in ranking and overall skill. Furthermore, the community is fairly small so don't count on getting a lot of lag-free matches if you're outside the U.S., especially if you live in Asia or Australia. 

The gameplay on its own is fantastic and takes me back to when I first got interested in Smash Bros. Melee. But there are just so many glaring issues with Online gameplay that I can't say that the game is worth it right now. If you aren't prepared to spend several hours a day getting better at this game, don't bother or wait until issues such as the ranking system have been fixed because the way ranking is structured now, newbies will be obliterated. The game may look bright and colorful and welcoming but to say that this game is newbie friendly (particularly online) is an absolute misnomer.

My main gripes with the game come from the single player perspective, the story mode isn't too interesting and is over before you know it. There's a handful of side modes but mostly time wasters. Nothing is bad here, more then likely just not my cup of tea given what I personally play fighting games for, the VS modes. My fun came from playing against humans, mainly online which is smooth from my time playing. The games balance feels great, I've never felt like i've lost because of my character being bad, but rather I lost because I didn't understand my character or the matchup for my opponents character. Nothing feels impossible if you're willing to learn.

None of the buttons on my controller worked. disconnected the controller and restarted the game. none of the keyboard keys worked. went on google. people said press Z. still nothing. Validated my steam files, nothing. Uninstalled then reinstalled the game and same as before, nothing. Went to the official discord to ask for help but no one responded to my problem. Sent a private message to the official twitter account and also got nothing from them. A day later somebody on their discord finally told me to DM one of the developers, which they @'d in the message. I sent a message and guess what, no response for the entire day. After getting frustrated with the lack of support I went and figured it out all on my own. Dunno why the team never bothered to try to help me but at least I got it to work now.
I put it on build 1.0.1 and it started working. switched it back to the workshop beta and it continued to work.
weird and kinda stupid but hey I can at least play the game now.",1577340084,1577340084,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,200,9,501,42,24,1600991731

The game is a really fleshed out platform fighter that draws influences from Melee but puts it's own take on the genre and it has really good community behind it. There are quite a few platform fighter games (Brawlhalla, Brawlout, Slap City are ones that come to mind) but Rivals is arguably the best of the bunch.

The game has a really good competitive scene, showing up at tournaments along side Smash, though obviously without as much attention as Smash. It's also really fun as a causal game though they are some things to learn (no ledge grabbing, only wall jumps)

I made this review in 2016 and I think it still holds up well, although there are some dickheads in the community, it's generally very cool and the game itself has only gotten better since I played in 2016. There's also steam workshop support now so we're MUGEN now I guess. If you like SSBM, absolutely pick this game up. Even if you're like me, and can't play Melee for shit, this game is so good that even if you just enjoy watching games like Melee, it's still worthwhile.

So I will be voicing my opinions as a new player picking up the game. I download the game and it only take 5 minutes. The game looked nice and I heard great things on youtube about it so I tried to pick it up. I new there was a tutorial and it took a little bit to find it. I completed all the tutorials with some difficulty, but I was just starting so who cares? I then have to preform a up light attack, then jump, then sair. I spent 7 minutes trying before I got fed up and quite. This was a game right? Lets get to the playing! So I go to local vs and fight a lvl5 bot. It was close and sloppy but I pulled off a victory. After two more fights I start looking for a real challenger and go to 1v1. after multiple people with high ping leave my lobby I finally get a opponent with good ping. I great them and ask to take it easy on me. They reply with ""Let's go!"" and the fight was on. for 2 minutes I get juggled from one end to another. I sometimes break through the ass whooping to do a little damage then quickly get thrown off the edge. The lion continuous shoots fire at me and knocking me back off before I can do anything. He taunts copiously then leaves right after the fight. Soon after I asked for a refund. I am well aware I need to ""get good"" but I have no desire to spend the next few weeks training to become the type of person I despise. I show off who taunts between every juggle, then leaves before I can be criticized. I get enough of that from the absolute radioactive cesspool Brawlhalla offers. I'm know Brawlhalla is different then Aether, just a comparison. This game has a dedicated following and I really don't get it. I'm sure many who play Aether feel the same way about Brawlhalla so who am I to judge? Recommendation? Maybe make the tutorial more practical. Chasing around a orb and dodging when the timer hit zero really didn't help with any of my fights. In fact, I could get the timing down at all when put up with a robot player, let alone a Aether god.

It is good, but also not as good, and sometimes even bad.

By the time of this review the final omega ultra edition of Rivals is still in development (it's been more than half a year since the last straight update to the main game), so most of the problems will surely be solved in the future. Yes, there is a steam workshop beta out now! And you have to know how to code and make pixel-art to do any sort of custom character.

Gameplay is great. I mean the non-competitive one, with friends and family and the likes. If you go online after completing the story mode and tutorials, you will want your money back. The people there are grinding it; the moves, the techs and DIs, recovery and parries. If you don't have time to grind and train, if you don't have friends of somewhat similar skill level, like with any fighting game, you better not buy RIvals. AI here is also not that good, it just can't compare with the real player, too weak and too unsystematic, but maybe it will see some improvement later in 2020.

Music and Art Style are simply amazing. It is pixel art. Precise, thought-out, pleasing to the eyes and the soul fluid and expressive pixel-art animation. I would give the highest score to Rivals only for that. As a person who wants to become a pixel-artist, this game is a treasure. Ok, enough of nerding around, music here is amazing too, fitting, beautiful, energetic and a bit catchy, Flashy Goodness know their shit.

What deserves the praise more than anything about this game is the continuous (or I would say ""unstoppable"") support from the developers: balance patches, skins, holiday events, tournaments, both on- and offline. Although, most of the skins are only available through smash.gg, which sucks, and a lot of the coolest looking skins are sold limited time only, so... Nonetheless, I respect Dan Fornace LLC's pixel-artists, both former and current, since I realize how much work has to be put in for each and every skin and buddy.

There are a lot of modes you can play, but not online... While playing online, you can't have: Abyss Mode, Aether variants of Stages (the biggest downside, since it is the most fun factor thing, as I see it), Training. For now, free-for-all and online team-fights are only available at betas, Ranked games and ranking system are going to be revamped, and it is a welcome sign.

Community of Rivals is nice, if you want to improve, simply find the Rivals Dojo Discord server and that's it, go beat CakeAssault already. Daniel, please, let us buy all the skins in the Steam DLC section right here, it would only give you free money and cover more players who wish to support the continuous existence of this game :-)

Characters are all different. There is not much of them (especially if you don't plan to buy 4 separate DLCs), but they are certainly all different and almost flawless mechanically. Balance is nearly perfect, that's for you fighting games gamer guys out there.

I truly want Rivals to have a much bigger player base, but it is too unfriendly to the new players. Maybe, if there's a bunch of them online at once, they all can have fun?",1575227894,1575227894,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,126,4,12579,516,4425,1601922802

Also, the workshop mode is probably the best version of the game, where you may add characters and even stages from the workshop! Although you can't use workshop characters online, (except for friends) it's still a blast!

As of writing, I have 42 hours played, I main Orcane, and haven't played online (excluding friendlies). Sylvanos and Elliana have just been released and am starting to pick up Elliana out of the two. I am a player who knows what they're doing, but constantly messes up inputs on my own accord. Though the character list may be small in comparison to other platform-fighters, I think it works in the game's favor as they become more memorable. The art is great, the music is sick, and the gameplay is fun as heck, despite me being bad.

-Fun Platform-Fighter
-Appealing and Well Done Aesthetics
-Small, but Memorable Cast
-Play Water Pupper

Rivals of Aether is a Smash Bros styled game created by Dan Fornance (who is also the creator of Super Smash Land)


As a big fan of the Smash Bros. series, I love Rivals of Aether and bought it the game Day 1
of its release. Some of you might find it a little harder to get ease into but for someone who's played a lot of Project M, albeit casually, it wasn't too difficult to get into as I felt I was playing in familar territory unlike my expericene with Brawlhalla. 

Don't get me wrong, Brawlhalla is not a bad game, its rather enjoyable and it's free. It just didn't click with me on a personal level. It didn't give me that fluid feel that Rivals gave me (Again, the game is pretty good)


Speaking of familiar territory, while playing the game you might notice that some characters might have similar moves to other characters. Zetterburn is literally PM Wolf, Orcane is Vaporeon from Smash Land, Kragg has moves like Bowser and so on. 

I feel like the characters have enough diffrence to keep them original but enough for Veteran Smash players like myself to fit into. As a Bowser main, I warmed up to Kragg the quickest as he just felt good to play as. Always was a fan of Heavy-weights. 
While the Roster is small, if you're like me, it won't change a thing.


Speaking of familiar territory, most of the Melee/PM and Smash mechanics are here: you've got Dodging, Wavedashing, Dash-Dancing, erm... um... a lot of the other stuff?... Did I mention I play Smash casually?

However, not everything is the same. There is no edge-grabbing or no grabbing and the shield is replaced with a Parry. The Parry works is when your opponent hits you during the parry frames it will protect you and cause an increase of endland for your opponent. Think like 3rd strike but much... slower.

To be honest, The Parry is my least favourite part of ROA. It causes everything to come to a screeching halt before the flurry of attacks begin again. For a game so fast paced, it just feels out of place. 

It don't think they'll be changing it anytime soon though since they've had it from day one, even before the steam release. I just wish it was a bit more quicker like 3rd strike.


As for Online... Well, it's been a while since i've played and the amount of players have declined for the moment so finding a game is a bit hard. Though it might be because I'm Australian. From what I can remember it's pretty ok, it can vary but not nearly as bad as my expericences with For Glory in Sm4sh... oh god the lag was really off-putting.


Anyway. At the moment of the publishing of this, Dan and his team still have a lot more to give us in the future and it looks great.

If you're usually a bit sceptical of Early Access games due to how it can be a quick buck for something unfinished, Don't. We've seen what Dan and his team have given us and what they are capable of. They care about this game and it shows. They won't be trying to run off with your money anytime soon.

If you play a lot of online with these kind of games... erm I'm not sure. I haven't seen a lot but I think you'll still find enjoyment in this title.

Like the Melee / PM type of smash but actually kinda redesigned so it's even more combo heavy and has less defensive options, making attacking, stringing moves and zoning even more important compared to these aformentioned games; reminds me of a mix between PM/Melee fastness and Smash 64 comboing, but with its own original things in it as well. If you have a rather aggressive playstyle, it will be fantastic to play. For begginners, it's actually not bad either, and has a tutorial that explains and trains you for advanced stuff like wavedashing and DI. There is a workshop branch that makes custom character, stages and modes possible which leads to cool or goofy stuff (or both!)

[h1]In Details[/h1]

The games controls are similar to smash with a few things removed, like shielding; grabbing; or edgegrabbing. It's usually replaced with another option (parring; jabs that can resist parries; and walljump in freefall that resets up special). A few notable things that may influence how you will like it (if you know Smash technical stuff) are : 
[list]
 [*]Long hitsuns
 [*]landing lag (no need for L-cancel) and plenty of autocancelled moves.
 [*]No airdodge on damage fall and no momentum canceling.
 [*]There is DI and Drifting (taught in the advanced tutorial).
 [*]There is also wavedash and waveland (also taught in the tutorial, thank god for new players).
 [*]Something that might be worth pointing, you can't (AFAIK) flick stick + attack to do heavy (smash) attacks. You must use a dedicated button or the right stick on controller. Thankfully, they are less used than in Smash due to comboing with ligther and air attacks being more present.
[/list]
The physics are on the fast and heavy style, but air combos are still easy, if you know you character. A number of things like jumpsquat duration is universified, so it's easier to learn.

You can feel the polish in every part of this game, wether in gameplay feel, sound design, music and animations. The pixel-art is pretty and smooth, the music is very good, the hits pack a punch.

I can't comment on balance yet as I am a relatively new player who mostly played agaginst bots, who are not really that good. Nothing really surprising.

Note that unlike most other platformer fighters, there is not option for random items, or items at all. This is a less wacky game that might not click with the more casual players, but the tradeoff is a fantastic feeling competitive experience. It can still be played 4-player free-for-all for a little ""what the hell is going on"" feel.

The characters have some Smash Bros. inspiration, but none of them are copy-pasted, and have plenty of unique moves or attributes.

In the Betas, there is a workshop branch, and the community have made some amazing characters, stages and mods (thanks to the companion system); original creations or stuff brought from other games, some even from Smash Bros. You can honk your oppoennt to death with the untitled goose, add back shield and grabs, play some aetherball (kinda like custom stage soccer/basketball from smash). It's goofy, I like it. Might attract people looking to just wank around.

Melee-style gameplay, fast paced, with wavedashing and great combo potential, but with plenty of differences that set the game apart from Melee. When I heard that the game didn't have shield, throws or ledge grabbing I thought this wouldn't work, but boy was I wrong. Parrying is a fantastic replacement for shielding, and it doesn't require ridiculously tight timing, which, added to the lack of L-cancelling (for those who don't know, in Super Smash Bros. Melee you can reduce landing lag from an aerial attack by pressing one of the triggers) and being able to act after an air dodge makes the game more accesible, or maybe I should say ""not as daunting as Melee"" to beginners/newcomers. 

Tutorials for all levels of skill are pretty damn good, along character-specific tutorials. Character movesets are pretty cool overall. Plenty of moves are taken from Melee and other Smash games, sure, but there are some pretty interesting specials in some characters that you don't really see in Smash. Visually, the character designs are good, but not memorable. There are only 8 characters, but if you feel that's a low number don't worry, more will come in the future. Also, if you want to play with a Gamecube controller, you absolutely can! Full support for them, plus customizable controls, and one of its coolest features: being able to playtest characters ON CHARACTER SELECT SCREEN.

On Early Access it already had a fully implemented online mode, with exhibitions and ranked mode with leaderboards. Being from the region I am (South America) I admit it was tough to find matches with good ping. But playing at 180-190 ping it felt pretty good. Not ideal, but very much playable. With the upcoming full release we get a full ladder reset, alongside the single player modes it was lacking and more stages.

Accompanied by a TOP NOTCH soundtrack, this game is definitely recommendable for fans of Smash/platform fighters, and if you've never played a game like this, it's a good place to start.

Unfortunately, I, and most people, are not good at video games, so I have to give this game a ""Not Recommended score""
The developers should have realized that most people are bad at playing video games. Games should be for everyone, even if they're terrible and nobody wants to play them over harder games. I suggest the Devs to dumb down their next game so we can suck the lif- I MEAN- so that people who aren't good at this game can have fun.

89,Rivals of Aether,54260155,english,"Sound cue problems: dodge sound plays even when dodge was interrupted prior to sound beginning. Some characters share the same skill effect noises, making it sound dumb when you fight each other and use different skills with the same noises. (I noticed it in ori v wrastor)

Visual cue problems: many arbitrary rules in this game suffer from a lack of visual cues. Fast-down is one example where there's an arbitrary period you can press down after reaching the apex of your jump that has no visual indication whatsoever. This means you're stuck doing guess-and-check until you get a feel for when it can be done. Lazy design.

Consistency problems: the devs keep changing the game balance because they can't get it right. Why bother mastering this game if the rules (hitboxes, skill reach, etc) are going to change every patch?

Sprite problems: the training room shows off how terribly disjointed the actual damage boxes are from the character sprites. The devs don't routinely update the sprites to reflect all the skill / hit box changes. 

Community problems: they'll make fun of you for not using their old smash-based terminology if you come from a different game and aren't familiar with what they call things.

Online problems: the devs didn't bother setting up servers, so player IPs are exposed to toxic brawlers via p2p connections. Unfortunately the network performance is still awful and often times you'll be paired with players that are so laggy you have to play in slow motion. It feels like slower characters with more punishable moves are stronger online as a result of the slow-down.

Amazing smash-like, cheaper and with a great community, many good players willing to help, cool pixel graphics and great music, cool devs.
If you are a fan of smash bros and want a fast and ""easier to play"" version of melee then give this game a try!


full version:

Rivals of Aether is a great way to get into smash-like games if you don't want to pay so much for the smash bros games.
Its fast paced, has a great community and most of the tech is easy to do but hard to master which gives it a nice learning curve.

At this point, most of the people playing the game are veteran players with a lot of practice in the game, but in my opinion this is not a negative thing since you have so many people who can help you get better!
The people I have met through the Rivals of Aether Europe group are always up for helping anyone with any problem they might have about the game. We also have weekly tournements for people who are interested in testing themselves.
The pixel graphics work really well and the music is really cool. ( + if you don`t like it we have mods ;)

Right now we have the full roster of 14 characters, 8 of which are fully available and 6 of which are DLC, however you are allowed to test all characters before you buy them in the games tutorial mode. There the game teaches you all the mechanics of the game, how to use them and a separate tutorial for each characters abilities.

Over the 3 years from early access to now the game has only grown and gotten better!
I would highly recommend this game both to any fan of the smash series and anyone interested in getting into it. 
Because of the great tutorial and the easily executable mechanics, Rivals of Aether is a great starting point if you have never played a smash game before!

So come join us and enjoy a competitive smash-like with tons of potential ^^",1479984457,1574793994,TRUE,1,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,203,4,80835,399,55056,1601476937

I'd also recommend the DLC too if you really like the game. All of the DLC characters are great.

89,Rivals of Aether,57074389,english,"Rivals of Aether is a game similar to Super Smash Brothers, but with far less characters, no items, and yet is still loads of fun. I started playing as Zetterburn, but as I played the game more and more, I found myself gravitating toward Absa and Shovel Knight. After an hour or so of practicing the controls, I gave ranked matches a try and wow, the difficulty curve is there. A lot of players play as a very niche set of characters, specifically Zetterburn and Etalus, but primarily play as Clairen and Sylvanos, both DLC fighters. What I noticed about the game was that Zetterburn, Clairen, and Sylvanos are all extremely powerful with attacks I can best describe as extremely unbalanced. You can tell me to ""git gud"" all you want, but there's no arguing the size of these hitboxes. In the case of Clairen, the most used fighter online, her attacks stun players, making the tutorial on damage influence absolutely worthless on top of her energy field attack making recovery impossible while making damaging those that try trivial. It's not even a technique that needs practicing like parrying. It's just a standard attack. For Sylvanos, his attacks are massively disjointed and hard to counter. Quite frankly, I'm not a fan of attacks that can reach two Sylvanoses away and sweet spot at the tip. It's not cool. Also, his recovery is absolutely broken. While everyone else has to walljump and use up specials, he just touches a wall and makes it back to the stage. This makes spikes like Shovel Knight's down special less powerful. Then Zetterburn. A lot of his attacks have a sort of flair (Flare?) animation indicating a sweetspot. I feel the placement for this sweetspot is in an unfair position as even things like a dash attack do around 30% of damage and deal knockback like a strong. Additionally, his playstyle relies heavily on projectile spam, similar to Simon and Richter from Smash Ultimate and anyone who's played against them knows how that feels. 

In conclusion, while I like this game, I would not recommend it. I wouldn't recommend it until it receives an update balancing these characters. When that happens, I will gladly revise my review.",1573606038,1573606038,FALSE,0,1,0.468924552,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,28,5,1788,14,700,1601171724

Also after completing a match I for some reason cannot choose P4's character which would have to bring me back to the menu and restart the whole character selection again.

Each 'Rival' has a special gimmick that makes them bar-none separate from one another. Zetterburn sets people on fire and deals more damage against them when they ARE on fire, Orcane can teleport to puddles that he makes on the stage, and Wrastor's aerials are smash attacks that can be charged. In addition, this game's workshop access has spawned one of the most amazing communities on Steam. Basically, you can create an entire character and play as them in the game.

Yes this game doesn't have a lot of people playing and it is not a very beginner level type game, and it will be difficult to play online because of the community being really good.
But it does have some amazing features like the newest update to the game STEAM WORKSHOP!! (download my character ;) please). But maybe workshop character are not your thing. Well there is an functional online with AN FANTASTIC net code that far surpasses ultimate's net code. Nintendo's official game...

So, I will give this game a 9/10, I chose a 9/10 because it has almost everything that a good platforming fighting game needs like amazing characters, fantastic mechanics and the fact that this game has become a  smash bros mugen. But i did have to knock down a point for being a bit too hard for the new casual gamers to the mix of this type of genre of game and the fact that it is hard to find people online. But these are kind of minor things in my opinion, I have had a blast with this game and I bet so will you.

Everything feels satisfying to hit, from combos to strong attacks to parries, it's all super satisfying.
The inclusion of a MUCH more indepth tutorial is absolutely amazing as well, though i wasn't able to finish some of the higher end stuff. For those that could though, this makes it an EXCELLENT introduction to some of the deeper mechanics in some of these games [it'll help particularly well in carrying over to Melee, which this game was heavily inspired by].

27,Rivals of Aether,55605226,english,"Rivals of Aether is Smash that advocates offensive play.

The gameplay is fast, thrilling, and precise, with each combo string or move you bust out feeling very good and powerful. There's no shield, instead having it be replaced by a parry that reflects projectiles and stuns your opponent when used with good timing. There are also no grabs (save for some characters with a command grab like Clairen), which makes the focus of the game stay strictly upon combos. The ledge grab has also been replaced with a wall jump, which allows characters to use their recovery move again after the initial jump.. All of these things make Rivals of Aether satisfying to play, not to mention that there's an extraneous amount of tutorials you can go through in order to learn the ins and outs of each character, as well as sharpening up your DI and learning mechanics you may not have known about before.

The music within the game is breathtaking, too. While some tracks are somewhat short, they're all incredibly ear-catching. I find myself getting lost to [i]The Forest Floor[/i] whenever I need to focus, and I can always enjoy [i]Full Steam VENGEANCE!![/i] when I want to be up and about when going around. [i]Sorrow[/i] is a touching tune that can jerk tears from my eyes, and [i]Formless Onslaught[/i] lets me know that I'm in for the fight of my life when I start playing Abyss Mode.

Don't even get me started on the Workshop for this game, either. Whenever I meet up with some of my college friends, we all get together and see who'd win in a fight: Obama, or Squidward? That being said, some of the original characters on the workshop, such as Ash, Guadua, and Mollo, are genuinely exciting and fun to play. It's also neat to see your favorite characters come to life. I quite enjoy playing as Kirby and as Emerl, personally, and I can't wait to see if people'll start doing commissions for custom characters! I'd pay a pretty penny to put someone through the workshop.

The Good
I like the fighting and how they made most characters balanced, I also liked the story mode even if its a little under whelming due to very little content there but non the less its only really used as a sort of getting used to some of the characters, the DLC is cool adding shovel knight and Ori which is one of my favorite games, the other single player stuff is also fine, the online almost never slows unless my internet starts to act up, and the music is AMAZING.

The Bad

This next thing annoys me a little but isn't much of a problem which is how much all the DLC costs, now I don't expect a whole lot but I think paying $56 for all the DLC should get you some other things except new some cosmetics and a few new fighters, like maybe adding to the story mode or extra single player stuff but thats just my idea.

The Worst
Now I said that almost all the fighters are balanced which is mostly true except for the most know fighter which is Zetterburn. Now lets dissect his move set, up first is his jabs and ground attacks, all seem ok but noting to bad, his left/right tilt attack is powerful but it makes sense. Next is his air attacks which all seem very generic but are fine, his up air can be annoying but all fine. Now here is where it gets a little unfair, his specials, his neutral special isn't all too bad, it adds the fire defect which makes sense since its very close range, his down special is kinda op with it having a lot of knockback and leaving an area where the fire defect but its not too bad once again, his up special is just fox's/falco's up special from the ssb games which is a very good move but not too bad again. Now his side special this is why all Zetterburn mains almost always win, what it does is shoot a burning projectile that gives the enemy the fire debuff, this doesn't sound bad until you realize that it can be used over and over again, takes no thinking compaired to the other projectiles and, and as said before causes the fire debuff which if you didn't know causes all smash attacks to kill on lower percentages, this wouldn't be a problem if we could shield but we can't and even when we reflect it they already could've shot another one... Oh yeah an his smash attacks aren't much different from the other ones but do more damage with the fire debuff. So in total Zetterburn is a mixture between melee fox's fast moves, ness's annoying projectiles, and ultimate ganadorf heavy smash attacks and weight but buffed because no shields. So in total please nerf a little

42,Rivals of Aether,54901384,english,"Every negative review I've read is either that the DLC is handled poorly or that the community has too much smash autism.(the latter is a positive as far as I'm concerned)

Let me level with you. This game actually properly captures Melee autism but with no game ignorant tech spam or pinkie jank.

No character can regurgitate a 7 input pattern to insta-win the neutral game, nor can they chuck turnips, spam back air and fish down B's, or bait an infinite grab combo.

Imagine if melee was made so that every character was within a 20% viability range of eachother, and every single one had to engage with the physics system in a meaningful way to perform well. That, and each one had an interesting macro strategy to bait aggressive play.

The only actual problem with this game is that it is slightly too combo heavy. In that hitstun lingers longer than in other games. 

So in melee, if someone performs a sloppy overlong/loose combo, you can just hit A or dodge out of it and punish them.

In this game, that is an impossibility. I don't know their reasoning behind it other than stroking semipro boners, but any competent player upon landing a hit can combo unavoidably to 80% until the opponents increased knockback peels them away from chase long enough to permit them to act again. When struck, you need to wiggle that goddamn control stick and wiggle it well. Anything else is death, and also strokes the opponents ego as they tickle your anus from nothing into the void.

Certain mistakes can be teched out of, and not all moves lead to this situation, sure. But I've played casual and ranked a fair bit, and both me and my opponents opening combos lead to one step from lethal typically. In smash terms, two neutral state wins is a kill, almost always, like clockwork. This is a tad strange, and takes some getting used to. Managing to land the first hit of a jab shouldn't mean 60+% more damage regardless of how good I or the opponent are at predicting left-right waggle. But I digress.

This game is tightly and excellently woven in a unique way that cuts the fat and flaws from other platform fighters.

Despite what I said, and my likely 10000+ hours of melee, I consider this to be the most perfect iteration of the genre I've encountered. 

It's lively enough as of this review that you will always find players to match with, and further, they have an 80% chance of inverting your anus. Which is what you want if you are interested in this type of game. 

The music is good, the art is good, the degeneracy has been expunged, and the melee autist community has been explicitly and effectively pandered to. I consider myself blessed to have experienced this game, and anyone whose fingers twitch with the fever dreams of smash inputs ought to buy it. It is a game engineered to please you, and you owe it to yourself to experience what that particularity of constructed gameplay feels like. 

It's better than a breath of fresh air, that's for people who don't know what they want, and have choked on staleness only to find momentary relief in the obscure or eccentric. This is a game for men who know what goodness is, and would recognize it immediately when they see it.

- Very good art style 
- Amazing sound track
- Its a good smash like fighting game that does the core mechanics of smash really well
- A lot of game modes and fun features in the game
-Every character is unique

- The tutorial doesn't teach you much
- The players are very sweaty
- The game costs 15 euros and then you have to pay more for the characters
- Small roster with only 8 characters and 6 more you have to pay for
- No one plays ranked or team match so you just have to play casual against all the sweats 
- Characters are not balanced. Some of them are broken (Wrastor and Ranno) and some of them are trash (Elliana and Forsburn)

Conclusion: The devs need to put all the characters for free because the game is expensive enough already.
The devs need to put a system in the game so new players don't get matched against gods.

Also, the dedicated community, are very established and are good at the game.

To start, the gameplay is fast paced and fun, and the art and character designs are very good. The story could use a little work but the characters themselves are enjoyable and memorable.

However.

The online is actually terrible. The connection is very bad and lag is almost a constant throughout every match. Ranked is dead and no one ever goes on there, and on casual you're not up for a casual match. Everyone on casual is ridiculously skilled and you will not learn. There isn't a way to get a hang of the game without putting extensive amounts of time into it.

14,Rivals of Aether,53865976,english,"As of writing this, I've been playing this game for 10 hours, tried out a bunch of the different modes (I think most if not all). I had seen stuff about this game in videos every now and then and I was always interested but a bit unsure. After having plaid it, however, I've had the time of my life with it and will probably continue on with it for quite a while. This is a very easy recommendation, a fantastic party game that really is more than just a Smash clone, and plenty of fun on your own too.

PROS:
This game has some beautiful artwork throughout, beautiful music, nice clear usable menus, and slick controls that seem to almost always work as you expect them to. The 8 base characters - all I've used as of writing this - are very distinct in play styles, and it can be a bit difficult to get used to multiple at once, but they are all extremely fun to play with, and are all effective with enough practice. The only one I've had significant difficulty with so far is Absa, and I can easily chalk that up to it just not being something for the way I think and play.

Online play works pretty well, out of around 30 or so casual matches I only had significant problems with lag during a match once. There are some troubles with the online systems I'll get into, though. Most of my cons are about online, so don't mind the fact that the cons section is longer than this one.

Local multiplayer is the best way to play this game. So far I've played with my brother, and while I think this definitely works best with controllers, keyboard controls work well too. That said, the best way to play this has to be with 4 controllers and a bunch of your mates huddled up on the same couch. It'll be endless fun.

CONS:
The ratio of base-game characters to paid DLC characters seems pretty large at 8/6. The roster does feel pretty small generally, and even smaller when half the board is grayed out (I do plan on getting some of the DLC fighters though). This is more of a personal thing, I certainly don't see it as pay-to-win, as none of the Clairens or Oris I fought online seemed too unbalanced or anything. Every character seems to have some one or few thing(s) that seem way overpowered at first but all have reasonable counterplays.

Actually finding an online matchup is extremely difficult. If you want to play online, you best have friends that already play as well, because the random lobbies are pretty harsh. Having tried at (all times in EST) around 8 PM, 12 AM, 3 AM, 10 AM and 1 PM, I haven't come across the right time where people are playing and I'm not waiting for ages for someone to connect. Then, often when someone does connect, they end up disconnecting for whatever reason very soon after. When you get a match, cherish it - no matter how easy your opponent is, or no matter how hard you're getting bodied, just stick with it, because you're gonna have a wait before you can find another player (and you might just end up with the same player again anyway).

I saw a couple of reviews that said basically something along the lines of 'git gud before going online' and I can agree with that testament. I'm not sure, but the reason may have something to do with the fact that it's impossible to get a match on ranked. I tried this at several different times of day as well, and I only got one pairing which promptly disconnected. There are some really good players just playing casual possibly because that's just what's available most of the time.

The stages are all good if none of them are truly great or innovative, at least in Basic mode. My experience with Aether stages, however, is that the stage hazards need some consideration. In a lot of stages the hazards are just way too intrusive and far too decisive in actual gameplay, with some just killing you instantly without any real way to do anything about it (that treetop place).

BUY IF: You're looking for a fun platform fighter that is both a great cheaper PC alternative to Smash, but also its own unique experience with its own quirks and skills associated. This is great if you just want something to kill free time, or if you want a good party game to play with two to four friends on a couch.

AVOID IF: You're looking for a Smash clone - this simply isn't it, it has a lot of inspiration from Smash, but it is a completely different animal playing this game. Also avoid if your intent was just to play online or, in particular, ranked.

There are some things I didn't talk about here but they're kinda just side stuff that isn't really the core of a game like this - Story Mode, for example, is pretty fun and does help to ease the learning curve of the six fighters available in it (Etalus and Absa are not part of this mode); and Abyss Mode still gives me mixed feelings, as it kind of just felt like I was turning my brain off for a lot of it. Overall I think this game at its core is well worth the asking price, and during the summer sale it's an absolute steal for a super entertaining game.",1562466592,1562466592,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,15,1,25697,1204,600,1602035739

52,Rivals of Aether,53427828,english,"Great Game. Long Time Melee fan here. 
I've been looking for another game similar aside from Melee to invest time into. Somewhat chiller or different experience in the same genre
I played a lot of games, and even mods: 
[list]
    [*]All Smash games (64, melee, brawl, wiiu, ultimate)
    [*]Project M, Legacy, Super Smash Flash 2, Brawlhalla 
[/list]
and yet it was Rivals Of Aether which was my favorite to have in addition to melee.
It's a great game. It's amazing. It's as if they took melee, said the wanted to make a ""lite"" version of it and while they were at it fixed a lot of bugs and issues.

My [b]only[/b] gripes are that the online could be tweaked to feel better and the minor little glitch. I personally prefer servers and lists, but I can see they wanted to go for a cleaner ""It Just Works"" kinda feel. very plug n play.
That and I have a bug/glitch where trying to access the CEO Ring skin brings a prompt to their website. if I click yes, the game deletes the executable and requires me to reinstall the game and then reboot my computer. odd, but i can live without that skin. doesn't bother me too much.

90,Rivals of Aether,52272863,english,"This game is an absolutely fantastic smash-like fighter, but don't be fooled by its similarities to melee - it's a unique and entertaining experience. Every character is distinct and fun, there is a near-infinite skill ceiling, a passionate community with tournaments, minimal but consistent activity on ranked ladder, and multiple helpful and friendly discord communities to join with. 

Now if you come from smash, you'll have to adjust. DI is different in some ways, ESPECIALLY if you come from ultimate, and the change in how recoveries work is fresh and fun but takes a little getting used to. Once you've got a half hour under your belt though, you should be good to go and able to adjust and have fundamentals carry over. Seriously, get this game!

If you're also looking at DLC characters to try, my personal recommendations are as follows:
Ranno/Clairen - I love swordies, and if you do as well you'll like Clairen. If you don't, Ranno is a lot of fun and has some serious potential. IMO, easy first purchase for DLC
Sylvanos/Elliana - Neither character is the *most* beginner friendly, but they have really unique mechanics and movesets that freshen up the game and allow you to change the pace a bit. Probably not an auto-buy, but it's two unique and fun characters for 5 (2.50 if on sale) so not a bad idea at all
Orio and Sein - If you're an Ori fan, you're probably gonna buy this anyways, but be warned these two can be a lot to handle early on. However, if you're not new to platformer fighting games you may find these guys the combo fiend you've been itching to play. Easy pickup for experienced players, less so for new ones.
Shovel Knight - this one is... weird. Not bad, don't get me wrong, but weird. Like Ori, if you like Shovel Knight as a game you should buy this as well, but if you aren't a fan already I think this is the most skippable DLC pack of the four. Still a really fun character with potential and interesting mechanics and options, but ultimately is one that I would urge you to decide you really like the game before picking it up over either of the packs with two characters in it.

Maps are pretty cookie-cutter and most of the roster rips pieces from Smash Bros. fighters, but it's still fun.

Additions to the game take a while and cost too much for what they're worth (like some DLC are literally $25 plushies just for a taunt buddy like wtf)

Their original fighters are pretty boring to look at but they got Ori and Shovel Knight to compensate for that (even though Ori's menu sprites are ugly af).

Some characters have unique gimmicks, like Wrastor can only use his strong attacks in air, and Ori becomes more powerful the closer he is to Sein. This creates a more unique identity for the game, and makes mastering certain characters more individualized.

You can also personalize the game by easily replacing music in the files with your own, given that you can make OGG files. You can also find a mod installer that lets you rip and replace sprites in the game (I've only been playing again because I replaced Ori's bad sprites with good ones).

Anyway, it's ok. I think what it needs the most is better maps: they're all laid out really similarly and their gimmicks kinda suck.

1. I love SSBM
2. I love RoA just as much, if not a little more
3. What makes RoA shine, is the fact that it maintains almost all of the iconic and game-shaping ""mechanics"" of SSBM, and refines them. What I mean by that, is that the most important things in SSBM, like wavesdahes, techs, float cancels, turnarounds, DI, are essentially glitches/bugs that can be abused. The best example of this is the wavedash, which is not necessarily a glitch, but rather an unintended mechanic of SSBM. As it is unintended, it is super inconsistent and completely unrefined, making it unnecessarily difficult to consistently pull of perfect wave dashes.

79,Rivals of Aether,50710055,english,"I friggin' love platform fighters. And I love the Smash Bros. series. But this game is really special to me, for some reason.

It's difficult to explain, but most platform fighters don't always respond to my inputs the way I expect them to, and I'm forced to adapt and evolve in ways I wouldn't have to otherwise if the game initially responded the way I expected. This is the only platform fighter that fully responds the way I want it to, 100% of the time. I try to do something, and if I'm capable of it, it happens. I try to make a certain combo happen, and if I'm capable of it, it happens. There are no ands, ifs, or buts; the game just does what you want, and doesn't restrict you in arbitrary ways. It just feels amazing to play. And if you need a rundown on gameplay mechanics, the ingame tutorials do a great job teaching you.

And it doesn't hurt that the graphics and sound are beautifully done, too. With amazing pixel art and a jaw-dropping, mind-blowing, awesome and catchy as hell soundtrack, there's not much in this package to complain about.. The online is a bit hit or miss, but for the most part, it works as intended and it's due for an update in the future. In fact, multiple things are due for an update in the future.

[b]Upsides[/b]

+[u]Very unique roster of characters[/u]
Although some moves may appear similar to the original moves in characters of Smash, they always keep a separate mechanic or certain move set that makes them really stand out from the rest. 
Unlike in Smash were you usually got your guy with sword, heavy-weight guy, speedy combo guy, small/light guy, projectile guy, all-around guy, or slow brute guy, there really is no such way you can categorize a set of characters aside from their type of region. They all got their own separate moves and mechanics. Even the DLC characters appear to keep a good separate feel when playing them.

+[u]Great retro soundtrack[/u]
Always feel adventuring and keeps you at the edge of battle. Also may get you into humming, whistling or singing along while you're at it.

+[u]Balanced and unique stages[/u]
I think they did a pretty good job with this one. If you want casual play and enjoy hazards, obstacles, and sudden movements in stages, then play the stages in Aether mode, but if you want a good competitive play and no hazards, you can play the basic mode in stages. The best part about these stages is that they're all unique even if you're playing competitively without hazards. The stages will feel just as unique and balanced no matter what mode you put it on.
Unlike with Smash, where almost everyone likes to play the same old Form/Final Destination stages, Battlefield stages, or Animal Crossing stages which usually feels the same. Mostly just because it's how ""the championship plays it"" with no ""banned"" stages. Which really ruins the uniqueness that each stage carries. 
There's also given info about the Stages' and fall hazard sizes if you want a stage that suits your sense of fun.

+[u]Staying in with the Smash lingo[/u]
This one might be a weird one, but it is great for the people that's been with competitive Smash players. The game does call such types of moves for what they are, the tilts, the specials, the aerials, and other such. There's even such things like money match requests in some online games. (For those who don't know a money match is when someone starts betting cash on a single match or best of 3. That's right, some kids, teens and young adults will attempt to gamble with this game) But instead of actual money, you are bidding in-game currency so it is all safe. 
For newcomers of Smash, the game is happy to explain the lingo.

+[u]Tutorials[/u]
Now this is great for the new beginners. Especially for people that had never experienced Smash themselves.
Not only does it tell the basics like tilts, specials, and strong attacks, as well as a few combos, but it also give tutorials on each individual character. This is a huge benefit for trying to find a main, or learning what a character is capable of in certain situations. For example, I didn't know Maypul could tether a marked opponent by holding her UpSpecial or that Wrastor's strong attacks can only work in the air. Not without seeing their tutorials that is.
Also this is something that not just Smash, but all fighting games should actually have. A tutorial mainly based on the individual character. It is much easier and better for someone to learn a bit more about the character they play rather than just throw 'em into battle with nothing but a move/combo list and/or [i]a few bits of info at a 3-5 second loading screen.[/i] *ahem* [i]Smash...[/i]
While some may like the discovery of finding the different movesets or different benefits a move can have, I think it's better for the discovery of the combos one can learn in their movesets.

+[u]Good and easily adjustable controls[/u]
The controls are very similar to Wii pro controllers, but only with an added [i]smash[/i] button. That way you can easily separate a strong attack from a tilt attack. You can also adjust flicking up to jump or flicking the joystick for strong attacks as they are options you can switch on or off.
Joystick sensitivity is also adjustable as well as the joystick flicks which is a huge benefit for trying to separate a strong attack from a tilt, an UpTilt from a jump, or a walk to a run. Overall the controls are easy to adjust and easy to get used to.

+[u]Story[/u]
Now this is a [b]HUGE[/b] thing for me. Especially in appealing characters like these. An actual story mode for these array of characters. A story that actually gives the emphasis and interactions between each character in the roster. Smash does seem to do this but recently hadn't done a very good job of it and tend to struggle at it. World of Light does less character interaction, relations, and emphasis and rather just throw them all into a shocking situation and straight into a sudden environment. That's about it. No emphasis on the characters, why they're there, and how they came together. In fact we don't get much interaction with the characters after saving them. Just one big baddie, everyone's together and that's it. That's already 90% of actual story you'll get from there
Also, Smash isn't the only one guilty for this.



[b]Downsides[/b]

-[u]Unbalanced DLC pricing[/u]
Now I find the DLC to be excellent and reasonable, but what isn't reasonable is the prices for the DLC. For each character it's about $6 and that is more reasonable when it's only the DLCs with 2 characters in one. When I'm buying a single third-party DLC character why would I buy it at the same price of two DLC characters?
The DLC skins/recolors are also ridiculous in their pricing. For something as small as getting a recolor, why would I spend about $4-$2 for something as simple as a pixelized recolor/skin? For something as little as that, the prices should be no more greater than $1.

-[u]DLC characters have no Story Mode[/u]
Now this one might be a minor complaint and I know that they've already given some story within' their reveal trailers, but I would still like it a lot more if they allowed us to take part of it and be the ones to continue it. Even the Third-party guests if they can.
After all they've given them their own individual tutorial, their own stage, why not give them their part of the story too? 

-[u]No Free-For-All online matches[/u]
This one might be a minor one as well. Now I know we got 1 on 1 and team battles which most do play, but really? No classic online Free-For-All? I would at least appreciate it if friend battles would at least add this gamemode.  



[b]Mid-sides[/b]
(this can be interpreted both up and down sides, depending on what preferences is to your liking)

=[u]No shield/grabs[/u]
Now this can be both good and bad. Bad due to the fact there's no blocking, but then again good by the fact that they've added their own original mechanic when playing defensively.
Instead of any blocks, there are now parries. Which is kinda like a well-timed block that allows you to stun an opponent and be able to quickly strike another hit. However, this doesn't work all the time since it's all in the timing. Personally I really love this separate mechanic because it encourages every player to move around in combat instead of just standing there, waiting to block and counter almost every attack.
It's still got its rolls and airdodges, and again I like the way it is encouraging others to move around instead of standing in one place.

=[u]DLC[/u]
I know I've stated about the prices, but now it's time for the DLC itself. I'm fine with it having DLC. After all it is just a $15 game and not a $60 game with another $60 worth of DLC or more. Plus if you add up the DLC with the game's price so far, it should add up to about the average price of a new game.

32,Rivals of Aether,49919963,english,"RoA is a great game. This is probably one of 2 games that can literally replace Smash as your platform fighter of choice. It has great characters, good adventure mode, ranked, in-game tutorials, great stages, advanced melee mechanics, tight and in-depth gameplay.
This game is pretty good, I definitely do have fun whenever I play this game.

But I can't recommend this game.
Why? You may be asking if I have great things to say about the game. I'm not denying anything good I have said. 1 thing. Well 2 technically, but 1 major thing prevents me from recommendation. 

I'm getting it out of the way now but my first one is relatively small:
No Grabs and no shields. This really only bothers only me specifically but I feel like I should mention in case it would help in deciding in your purchase. Since there is no shield or grabbing, there is parrying and dodging only. Parrying is like a spot-dodge and a perfect shield. If someone hits you, they get stunned depending how damaging it was, allowing for some really sick reads. Its a great mechanic, but I just do not like it. Yeah I know git gud, its great, yadda yadda. It is a great mechanic I know it is.
But I don't like this mechanic, and that's it. It sounds weird I know, but its just one of those things we come across that we will just not like. It's like when you meet another person and they're really cool and what not, but you just can't seem to like them.

Now for the real main issue here.
DLC.
Not just any DLC here. Character DLC. 
This is a massive issue with fighting games, not just RoA. 
I hate character DLC. Why? Its rarely ever done right. Take a look at Ultra Street Fighter 4. That is the best way to add characters. ""But Krayken! How will this company earn money? They need to feed families and whatnot"" A relatively obvious way of doing this is selling skins. Don't tell me skins do not sell because this is a way brawlhalla makes their money. This is how Fortnite makes their money. This is how League makes some of their money.  DLC skins are the best way DLC should be sold. ""Well its only 5 bucks!"" So what? The price doesn't matter if the skin is well made and is a reasonable price then it will sell. Yes some will get more skin treatment than others because it will make them more money, but skins aren't required in the first place. ""Well smash has DLC characters individually"" That is true, but here's the thing. Compare the amount of characters in smash ultimate without DLC to the amount of characters without DLC in RoA. 8 characters in RoA, 76 Fighters in the base game if we count echo fighters as part of that, otherwise 69. At the time of this review, Piranha Plant and joker are the only 2 DLC characters we have right now. 6 DLC fighter in RoA thats nearly half the roster!!! I very much do not like this form of DLC. 

It is for this major reason that I cannot recommend this game. DLC characters are not meant to abuse your wallet, they should be instead used for skins or when you have plenty of character content to back up and justify the creation of character DLC.

As a side note if you're still reading I hear they're in works of a definitive edition for this game with character bundled in apparently, this is what you should spend you money on. Not the character DLC. Save your money for the upgraded edition.",1554257144,1554257533,FALSE,66,11,0.555437922,10,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,398,25,1720,0,1392,1586648917

Rivals of Aether really needs to fix the servers. Why are the servers so bad? If I were to play Brawlhalla (bad game), I wouldn't lag nearly as hard. I have 100Mbps+ download speed yet my ping is practically 300 every game. The sad thing is that the bad players will have bad connection while the people that sweat on casual have good connection. The matchmaking on casual is also a problem. As I said, the sweaters have good connection so the moment I see less than 100 on ping, I'm expecting to get destroyed. Why can't they fix the matchmaking? It's so bad. The final problem is that some characters are just plain better than others. Zetterburn has stupid dumb strongs that easily kill that low percentages (70 min) just by spamming side special and Clairen basically has enough range to abuse most of the roster. So annoying.

I love the design, lore, story mode, pretty much everything about this game apart from online, which is a vast majority of playing time because of other people's trash connection and terrible matchmaking.

12,Rivals of Aether,48606614,english,"Easily the best Smash Bros-like game not made by Nintendo. The combat feels smooth and fun. Characters control pretty well with a gamepad.

I only have 2 (minor) gripes with it:

1) You have to press a face button to jump, instead of just hitting ""up"" on the gamepad. There's an option to change this in the settings, but for some reason it keeps forgetting that I changed the setting on the next time I run the game. It's not saving the new setting for some reason.

2) No mod support?? Please please add Steam Workshop and mod support. I guarantee this game would have a MUCH larger playerbase if people could create their own stages and fighters, and easily download new ones from the Steam workshop. I know the developer probably doesn't want to do this because then they won't be able to sell new ones as DLC. But with mod support, the base game would instantly have a ton more value, which would convince many more people to buy it. I'll tell you right now though, I ain't buying any of those DLC characters. But if the game got mod support, I'd convince everyone on my friend list to buy the game.

Despite these two issues, I still recommend this game. It's the closest thing you'll find to Smash Bros on Steam!",1548673646,1548673948,TRUE,1,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,618,58,89,0,65,1549540255

46,Rivals of Aether,48249368,english,"This game plays absolutely fantastic. I honestly like its gameplay a lot more than Smash proper, since the comparison is inevitable. It feels a lot tighter than Smash ever has and all characters feel good and unique to play as. It's fast paced and honestly addictive once you get into it. Parries (which replace shielding) are a fantastic mechanic. It just plays really fucking fantastic. I'm too sleep deprived to put that any other way. I played it one day for like 4-5 hours in a session with my sister because we both were just fucking hooked to it, and the vast majority of those matches were using the same characters for both of us. I think that tells how damn good it plays.

It also embraces the competitive Smash mechanics, giving the game extra depth, but it also embraces the silly gimmicky side of Smash with its Aether stages, though there's also Basic stages for the more competitive-minded (or the not-getting-fucked-by-troupple-king-minded, when Troupple Pond comes up). Bonus points for the basic stages not just being Final Destination/Battlefield, they all remain unique just without hazards or gimmicks. 

The game also has great graphics, with lovely colorful spritework with really good animations, nice UI. The music is also fantastic and the sound effects are great.

So the flaws? This game's one flaw is probably its lack of content. The base game only has 8 characters. Granted, they're all quite unique and fun to play as. There's also only 14 stages, I believe, though each with their Aether and Basic variations (though a couple few are identical in both Aether and Basic, but I think it's only 2 like that). A few of the stages have to be unlocked, too.

As for modes, there isn't much either. You have your local versus, a story mode, abyss mode and online modes (ranked/casual/friend). Oh and a fairly meaty tutorial too, in which you can learn even character-specific things or try out the DLC characters before buying them, so that's pretty good. Story mode might sound meaty but it takes like half an hour to complete.

In story, you pick one of 6 of the base characters and fight a series of 5 matches with cutscenes telling a story in between. The matches sometimes are completely random and nothing to do with what the story is, either. Then lastly there's an epilogue which is some cutscenes and one boss fight. Then you unlock Abyss mode, which is a fun survival-ish kind of mode with some RPG elements, but sadly you can't use the DLC characters in it (yet) so I haven't touched it much since I main a DLC character.

Now, the DLC. The DLC is in my opinion quite fantastic, but I bought it all at half price. Gotta say, though, the characters are definitely worth it at half price, at least, though I dunno if I would personally pay full price for them. They're all incredibly fun, I personally enjoy them more than the base game characters. As Shovel Knight fan, I ended up maining him, too. Of course, whether you like the characters or not is a more personal thing, but I think they're all fantastic unique additions to the roster.

The DLC in total adds another 6 characters, 2 of which are from other indie games (Ori and Shovel Knight), along with another 6 stages again with 2 of those stages being from Ori & The Blind Forest and Shovel Knight. Also the Aether version of the Shovel Knight stage is fucking garbage because the hazard is incredibly harassing so you can't properly fight in it, but the Basic version is great at least. 

So with DLC, you have 12 characters and 20 stages, though I think the DLC stages can be played online even if you don't buy them. At 5 bucks per pack, it's a total of 20 bucks of DLC and 15 for the base game. I got it all (game + character DLC packs) for a total of about $14 on sale. So if the game's lack of content bothers you, wait on a sale. Though you could just try out characters in the tutorial and only get the packs you want, also.

I've barely touched the online modes yet, because my internet is only good enough really late. When I did, though, it was really good, using delay-based netcode. Though the player I fought against was an absolute scrublord and disconnected during the 2nd round of our matches, sadly, then I couldn't find any more matches. Most of my play time has been local multiplayer.

So anyway, this has gone on longer than I wanted to, and I feel it sounds more negative than positive, but I gotta say once again that the game plays absolutely fucking fantastic and is the most fun I've had with a platform fighter. It just lacks content and is best bought on a sale unless you're the kind of competitive player to really sink the time into it. But it's an easy YES recommendation, because what IS there is all pretty fantastic.

55,Rivals of Aether,44768618,english,"A Super Smash Bros style fighting game. I'm still a beginner, but it is very fun! Good music, gameplay and pixel art. Too bad that I don't really care about the original characters in this game. They are all based on animals and their designs feel very boring to me. The game only has 8 characters and other 6 characters are behind a DLC paywall. One of those DLC characters is Shovel Knight, and I will admit, he was a big reason that made me buy this game. Still, I'm glad that I did!

If you are a PC player who wants a Smash style game, this is a good choice.

The game also has online, which is a very good thing. It seems to work fine, as long as the other player is not too far away. When the ping gets high, the game will be unplayable, so avoid playing against people who are from another continent.

By the way, there is one thing where this game beats Super Smash Bros. in every way possible: TUTORIALS! Actual Smash games are pretty bad at teaching beginners to play. This game has very good tutorials, and even seperate tutorials for each character! The developers did a good job with this, and it's just a little weird that this indie game does this while the actual Smash Bros doesn't even try!

+ Fun gameplay
+ Good pixel art
+ Music is great
+ Shovel Knight
+ Easy to learn, hard to master
+ Good tutorials for beginners
- Original character designs
- Many characters are DLC
- Online play will often match you against players who are living too far away",1537113529,1546639322,TRUE,3,0,0.539594889,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,181,55,700,0,592,1597345545

This game plays fantastically with almost no input delay online even over 100 ping. Don't be afraid of those high ping values!

To everyone else: Now that this game is out of Early Access, it is a STEAL for $15. Honestly, it's my new favorite fighting game on Steam. I'm a bit biased since I've been playing Smash Bros. competitively for a couple years now and have been playing since near day one of Early Access, but considering you get nearly the same amount of content for $15 as Street Fighter V gets for $60, this game is well worth the money I spent on it. Also if you're worried about buying a game for which the community might be dead, don't be. The game's community is incredibly active, and I've never had a time where I just couldn't find a match.

It removes unnecessary tech checks such as Lcanceling and perfect wave dashing as well as adding input buffering, while still retaining many of the varied neutral options available in the likes of melee and PM. In addition, it removes irritating mechanics such as ledge invulnerability and flowchart chain grabs while also encouraging aggression with the replacement of shields with a parry. This game is a joy to just move around in and I would highly recommend it to anybody interested in fighting games.

Cons: Online play needs much more work put into it. There is no way to search for a minimum ping, and when you inevitably find the common >75 ping game in casual, there is no way to decline so you must exit matchmaking and renenter, after which there is no way to guarantee that you won't be matched with the same player over and over. However, this IS getting fixed by the devs soon as a netcode rewrite is underway.

18,Rivals of Aether,47157153,english,"Rivals of Aether is a Super Smash Bros. esque fighting game with a bigger emphasis on speed and tech skill (similar to Melee) while still not compromising what makes platform fighters so fun and accessible. Aether was created by a team that clearly understands what people want, and care immensely about the community. Easily the best platform fighter available on PC, and it's not because others haven't put up a good fight for the title. 

Pros: 

-A cast of characters that, while seemingly small, are all incredibly unique. Not one character plays remotely the same, and each is as fun and deep as the last.

-Gorgeous art and animation. This game looks as good as it plays.

-A comprehensive tutorial mode that goes over some of the more complex aspects of the game as well as a series of character specific tutorials. 

-Excellent online options with a recently revamped (for the better) Ranked mode, a casual exhibition mode, and of course online friend matches. Each mode has stage striking and counterpicking.

-Incredible OST. Seriously, every track is just glorious. 

-Amazing community. With a dedicated discord server and a few community run servers for player help and improvement (and of course matchmaking), you're never left alone as to how to improve.

Cons:

-Limited single player options. There's a short story mode and an endless gauntlet mode with a bunch of fun gimmicks, but ultimately nothing exceptional. 

-Can't play teams with a friend over the internet. I'm not sure if this is just a limitation that doesn't really have a way for them to implement it, but it is rather sad. 

-Can't play with more than 1 friend at a time over the internet. Yet again, still not sure if it's a limitation or not, but a bit dissapointing. 

-Fast movement options allow for insane combos. The game is exhilarating to play.

Final Thoughts:

If you enjoy fighting games like Smash and want something with a unique aesthetic as well as deep gameplay, you're in the right place. I would recommend you wait for one of the frequent sales though, as you can rather often get the game + all the DLC for a massive discount. The DLC characters are so much fun to play as, so I do recommend picking them up. Also, an ""Ultimate Edition"" is planned, but as of now no info has been shared on it. I believe it's assumed that all existing owners will be given an upgrade option, so I would say it's still a safe purchase.",1543368576,1543368576,TRUE,17,0,0.711114824,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,247,32,2580,0,1933,1576441565

27,Rivals of Aether,46177732,english,"[b]What I liked:[/b]

I have 45+ hours logged into Brawlhalla, and based on that I can say that I like the gameplay of Rivals of Aether a bit more.

Rivals offers less characters in total (and half of them are paid DLC), but I feel these characters are more ""fleshed out"" than the characters in Brawlhalla.

That is to say, the fighters in Rivals have more intricacies - more things (like different types of moves) that make them different from each other. In contrast, to me, the characters in Brawlhalla tend to feel more ""samey"".

Overall, the controls are pretty tight, and the overall gameplay feels pretty good to me. I enjoy the pixelart, and I didn't expect the music to be so GOOD! I wish they added the OST as ""buyable"" DLC.

The beginner tutorials, the Story more, and the Abyss mode are pretty good. Oh, and the advanced tutorials are a nightmare, so prepare to become frustrated :)


[b]What I didn't like:[/b]

Once I'm done reaching level 10 with all characters in Abyss mode, I'll probably never touch this great game again, except for playing with friends.

As of right now, Rivals doesn't offer casual 4-player online matches - only 1 v 1 or 2 v 2.

And the people you play against, even in casual matches, tend to be god-tier good, so... as some other have mentioned, this game isn't ""online casual"" friendly, so to speak.

This is something Brawlhalla does well (I think), as I was able to win many 4-player casual online matches (and lost a lot more, of course) with only average skill.


[b]Conclusion:[/b] If you enjoy this genre of fighting games (brawler, platform fighter, etc.), either get it on sale, or maybe wait for a supposed Definitive Edition to come out in the future.

If you have friends to play with, even better! If not, you'll probably play this game regularly only if you want to become competitive.",1542866936,1543275187,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,1054,216,1427,0,720,1577566445

Overall, it's awesome. It's coded in an older game making program that still does great today and I personally love it (GM2 still getting into it). Combat i fluid, very smash like, and you really do have the skill to push to make it like that. The roster of 13 is small but it has Shovel Knight and Ori, great to see guests but would love to see more.

IMPORTANT: There is a definative version coming out. From what I'm understanding from topics, anyone whom owns the game and the DLC is getting this version free. Hopefully some new chracters will come as this can easily be one of the best smash clones if the levels are better and more characters added, needs at least double the roster and this takes time. 

So, because of this, and it's on sale BUY ALL OF IT. The game will hopefully keep going and you got a great indie fighter for cheap and a new version free. This is awesome. Brawlhalla is still my favorite but it's just because the roster is so packed. This game is much better in both combat and execution of controls. You cando a lot. Things like grabs and edge grabbing is missing, but wave dash is here, so hope these things can be added. I would say for the cost, it's expensive for what you get but Indies really need funding, so buy it at the discount at least and we may get a very healthy new contender in the smash style gaming scene for PC. This has pretty much all you need. Brawhalla is still beating it but it also beats your wallet for skins and stuff you want ha. I bought the 100 supporter pack twice, my wife and I, so this wasn't a big deal, but overall for me, it's an 8/10, for the cost and on average a 6/10 for content. But hoping this dev really pushes this series, it can become something great. Maybe a non pixel graphic style one day, but it still looks and feel great. I just think the levels in both mmentioned games (comparison) are sort of meh, very little to do, smash has so much interactive levels, many things to compete over, and crazy areas to really bounce people around. Here it's barebones levels but so is Brawhalla. And Brawhalla has no excuse, they made a ton.

Second of all, i love this game.
It's basically [h1] Pixel Melee. [/h1] The game currently has a decent amount of characters.
August 10 (2018) The final guest character will be revealed, im pretty hyped for it.
But, yeah. Enough r a m b l i n g, Let's get into the new- Let's get into the review..?

The Story Mode: I'm gonna be honest 
What is this? Nothing made sense AT ALL.
Basically, you play as all original Rivals (Zetterburn, Orcane, Forsburn, Kragg, Maypul, Wrastor.)
Through different locations, against other Characters.
Why do you fight them?
no idea.                                           !Spoiler Warning Below, btw!
[spoiler] At the end, there's a boss battle. (when you beat all story modes.) 
Choose your Rival of choice, and beat up...two eye things. [/spoiler]

Gameplay: This game is basically [h1] PIXEL MELEE [/h1] 
Not like that's a bad thing, Alot of Advanced Techs are present, for example Moonwalking, Wavedashing. This game is pretty easy to learn, Once you play it for abit, You start remembering the controls and stuff. Basically, Imagine Smash Flash 2. Combined with Melee
Has a different graphics style, and removes all Nintendo Characters, and makes new ones instead (Apart from Ori he's from ""Ori and the Blind Forest."")

Is the Game worth full price?: Depends on who you are.
In my opinion, Yes.
If otherwise, Wait for a sale, i guess.

DLC: The DLC'S pretty cheap. There's also additional Recolors for characters you can buy.
Though, if you're gonna buy any of those...B U Y A M E R I C A N W RA S T O R.
Is Ori worth it? Yes.
Are Ranno and Clairen recommended? Only if you like MARTH and a Frog who does Vore.
Are Elliana and Sylvanos recommended? if you like heavies, yes.

Online: Pretty good, when i fight one of my friends, we only really have Input Lag.

Conclusion: Rivals of Aether is a GREAT game. i recommend it 100%, 10/10.
you must like platform fighters though.",1489777570,1542984924,TRUE,1,0,0.523809552,2,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,104,24,8937,154,8007,1601321554
77,Rivals of Aether,46532246,english,"Rivals of Aether is the best ""smash bros clone"" imo. The movement is crisp and the game is very fast paced (which I like a lot). Each character is slightly similar to Smash Bros. characters but not exactly like them, which makes it pretty interesting if you're coming from Smash to Rivals. Every character is viable and there are no unwinnable matchups. No matchup exceeds 60-40 favoring either. Rivals is probably the most balanced platform fighter out there. DLC can be slightly overwhelming at times, but not much to complain about, really.
This game also has a very in-depth tutorial that you don't see in most games. It covers essential fundamentals and explains them properly, like good DI, wavedashing, edgeguarding, etc. Playing this game for so long helped me develop a proper neutral and DI. It's very useful for building your fundamentals in any of the other platform fighters. 

With relatively low defensive options, Rivals of Aether keeps you on your toes. Every decision counts because combos are VERY long in this game. Combine hitfalling and the opponent's bad DI and you've got yourself a nifty 0-death. It's hype AF. DI is VERY influential in this game, as it changes your angle by 18 degrees. 
Parry and dash dancing (just outside the opponent's area of influence) are the only true universal defensive options, so be careful in neutral, Smashers. 

There are no grabs (only command grabs) and no ledges to grab. Since there are no ledges, you walljump and recover again (you can walljump out of freefall). This teaches you to save your jump and airdodge for when you need it. 

The community is absolutely WONDERFUL. There are a lot of nice people who are super supportive of their favorite players and friends. Lots of us are also willing to help others learn the game and improve. There are crews and learning groups out there and plenty of great resources like the RoA Academy and character-specific discord servers. We're always welcome to new players and you'll feel right at home with us :D

The only issues with the game (as of 11/2018) is the increased input lag and frame drops due to GMS2. Hopefully that will be fixed soon, as it affects both online and offline. 

Hopefully you enjoy the game as much as I do. I quit Smash entirely for this (minus Ultimate if it proves to be as great as I hope).

From what I can tell, it really is quite difficult to find players similar to your level of skill, especially ones with stable ping. This goes doubly so if you're a newer players. If you don't have anyone else to play this and intend to get this just for the online games, you might want to avoid this if you're not a veteran in this genre.

That said, locally or playing with friends, this game is close to flawless in my opinion. Combos flow naturally into each other without giving your hands all sorts of diseases, asthethic and sound are great, character designs are mostly unique (Some characters do have some smash attacks, but I can appreciate the familiarity), and distinguished animations make it easy to recognize attacks. I like the flow of this game a lot more than any other platform fighter I've played, though I honestly can't quite pinpoint why.

An issue people frequently seem to complain about is the DLC. First off, no, the DLC characters are not stronger. They all have their unique playstyle to them and do take practice to counter them properly, so if you haven't faced them too often, it may seem like they just have better alternatives. And yes, they are pretty pricy, but the base game comes with 8 characters playable, which I think is fair enough.

I've bought most of the DLC, and though that totals up to 35€ already, I've had over 75 hours of fun so far, and I don't see myself dropping the game any time soon. I'd say that's wel worth it..",1538975716,1542895987,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,194,12,6175,0,5197,1581624173

13,Rivals of Aether,25405490,english,"What I had said in my early access review pretty much stays true. (I'll keep what I wrote at the end. You may want to read that first.)

The developers have added a few single player options, like story mode and Abyss mode. Story mode is you're traditional arcade mode where you fight a series of opponents. Abyss mode is a more unique gamemode, where you complete a variety of tasks as your chosen character. Your character can level up if you play as them enough in Abyss mode, in order to open up slots to equip runes which alter your stats and abilities.

I think at the moment, these two single player modes are not enough to engage a casual player. It's day 1 of full launch and it seems as though there aren't too many new players, it's still a lot of veterans, so it'll be a while until newbies get into the swing of things. Hopefully this will change.  

The game is still fun, and a must have from Smash Bros./platform fighter fans, but I was really hoping this game would not become a niche competitive game. It's picking up steam in the Smash cicuits, but if you start looking at the stats, games far more inferior to Rivals like Brawlhalla always have thousands playing. Rivals on average has hundreds.

The game is realatively cheap and can still only expand in content. I personally recommend, but I'd be sure the experience is really for you before you buy.

EARLY ACCESS
Rivals of Aether is a platform fighter in the vain of Super Smash Bros. Melee, that has a strong focus on competitive viability. The game does act as a great jumping off point for those who wish to up their game in Smash, as well as stand alone as it's own platform fighter. Just by changing a few core mechanics, the game is new and it's exciting. Though with all this said, the game is not without flaw, and all the issues I have will be covered later in this reveiw. 

If you are unaware of what a platform fighter is, I recommend you do some research first as I will not be explaining every detail. To start, a big departure from games like Smash is the lack of grabbable ledges. The games recovery meta revolves around wall jumping and heavily mixing up your approach back on stage. This game also replaces sheilds with the ability to parry. If timed correctly, parrying an opponents attack will freeze them for a short period of time. These two changes alter not only the core mechanics of platform fighters, but also up the pace of the game. Games are blood pumpingly quick.

The game makes heavy tech skills in Smash like wave dashing and L-Canceling much simpler. The timing for the former is much more forgiving, and everyones wavedash is quite large making it quite versitile. All ariels, with a few exceptions, automatically cancel making for huge combo potential. With all this said, what's easier for you will also be easier for your opponent. Although most pro players stick to ranked mode, you will still get bodied by those who are even more comfortable with the easier controls elsewhere.

The general meta of the game has it's flaws. Most character's tool kits have a very potent dash attack, making it a viable option in almost all combos.I find some characters can get away with dash attack after dash attack at low percents. Not only are they good in combos, but also amazing for starting combos. In Smash, dash attacks are very situational with plenty of ending lag, leaving you open for major punishes if wiffed. Since RoA doesn't have a sheild option, it's much harder to counter a dash attacking opponent (especially online where lag is a factor). To mention one more smaller gripe, the games art style, although very good, makes it difficult to know when to tech.

Rivals of Aether is a step in the right direction when it comes to putting platform fighters on the map. The game is fun, vibrant and captures the style and hype of the genre perfectly. The game does lack features for the casual gamer, but the game is still in Early Access. Rivals still has plenty of time to grow both in balance changes and in features, and I hope we as a community will support it in it's growth.",1473302552,1542854653,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,282,7,3993,0,3879,1571941139

27,Rivals of Aether,43898930,english,"As much as I get bodied in this game, to give it a negative review because of the difficulty leaves a bad taste in my mouth.

In short, Rivals is a great platform fighter that has a unique blend of mechanics that I actually prefer to any of the other platform fighters out atm (including all Smash games).

-DIRA (Directional air-dodging) is back, allowing for wavedashing, wavelanding, etc. from Melee
-Speed of the game matches Melee/PM
-More balanced roster than any of the Smash games (excluding DLC characters for some time after their release)
(Most low-tiers in this game tend to be less fun and therefore have less advanced tech and high-level players to boost their prestiege. This is what makes them low tiered, as opposed to them being completely useless like Smash's bottom and low tiers)
-No ledges, removing all of Melee's busted ledge options (luigi fuck off) and Sm4sh's magnet hands that nerfed edgeguarding

In short, if you are a competent competitive player of Melee or PM, you will like this game. Hell, you may even love it. Even if you're a competitive Sm4sh player, you will probably like this game.

However, for everyone else, you will probably not enjoy yourself. Like most fighting games, the community quickly becomes stratified into new players and everyone else. No one online is going to be at your level, as most new players get bodied and leave, just as you will once you buy it.

With friends, it's a hoot. I love playing locally and online with friends and that removes the only downside to this game.

Conclusion:

For the discerning Smash player who likes playing competitive rulesets but isn't very good at Smash, get a friend or get out. For competitive players, this is the best other platform fighter for you, and the only one to rival Smash in terms of genuine competitive spirit and design.

- Closest thing to Super Smash Bros - Improved Mechanics!
- Competitive mode is challenging and Intense!
- 4 Player Mode - 2v2 or FFA!
- Developer continues to release more characters and improve upon gameplay!

Cons:
- DLC is a little pricey, although I don't mind contributing to the Developers because they show much promise.

The gameplay is instense, and highly technical. You quickly forget that you're playing with pixel graphics.
The community around this game is very passionate about it. I'd say it has a following just as deticated as SSB.
You really have to play it to truly appreciate what has been accomplished here. If you're looking to get your SSB thirst quenched on PC then look no further. Great graphics, amazing sound effects, a soundtrack that will get stuck in your head, and last but not least, gameplay that will keep you coming back for more.

73,Rivals of Aether,45305741,english,"WARNING!: This is all subjective, as this is purely my opinion, and nowhere close to ""hard facts"", as this is just a review written by some idiot who doesn't know how to play melee, but loves smash, so don't go getting your hair in a knot alright? Ok? Good, let'sa go.

This game. OOOOOOOHHHHH this game. This, right here, is how you make a smash-inspired platform fighter, THAT ACTUALLY HAS DIFFERENCES, AND IS GOOD. It's combat is very melee-inspired, to put it bluntly, however, Rivals of Aether does many things differently than melee did in order to stand out. For starters, this game is very beginner friendly, and by that I mean it has tutorials for pretty much every basic action and many more. It has tutorials on movement, combos, sweet spots, and even character specfic tutorials for any character you may want to main. The tutorials helped me out a lot when trying to learn, and I know how to play mostly because of these. They are clear, concise, and best of all, effective. 

Enough of that stuff though, let's get into why this game is so good that Super Smash Brothers Ultimate may have some competition (I'm partially kidding), THE GAMEPLAY. This games gameplay is put as simply as can be, super fast, and high stakes-high reward. It offers many similar traits to melee, but changes up many aspects, for instance, the abscence of shielding and grabbing. Rather than a shield, every character now has a parry, in which, when pulled of successfully, can completely stun the opponent once their move is finished, leaving them open to a combo. Due to, well, not having a shield, grabbing is not in this game. I see you SSB4 Mario mains, outta here with them grabby fingers (Joking, I love you guys). However, one thing that truly makes this game unique is the status effects (that's what I call them anyway) that many characters can inflict on themselves or the enemy. Every status effect is different, whether it be Zetterburn's flames that slowly damage you and make you go even further by his strong attacks, to the speed boost that Wrastor gets in a certain area after using side-b, there are so many status effects that they shake up each and every matchup, and none of them are necessarily overpowered, of course, some are better than others, but nothing's perfect. Another reason why this game's gameplay is so great is that there is A LOT of hitstun, allowing for hype, long, strong, or just outright ridiculous combos. However, to balance this, most moves do less damage percentage than the average Smash Bros move, which was a simply brilliant move by the developers (seriously, good on you dudes!).

My next point is a short one, but a powerful one. The soundtrack of this game is simply spectacular, with plenty of memorable tunes throughout (my personal favorite being the newest smashville-styled stage's theme). Nothing much to be said here, just some fantastic music all around.

The graphics are spectacular too, featuring phenomenal pixel art animations, stages, and character art, surely a very pretty sight to set your eyes on. The game also features custom colors, so you can color your character whatever you want! Though, it can't be used on ranked.

Alas, no game is perfect, and Rivals is no exception. The roster size is very small, consisting at only about 14 characters, with 6 of them being paid DLC. However, the original eight are still great options and plenty of variety. This is more of a personal nitpick, but having almost half the cast be DLC just doesn't seem too great, but I'll let it slide. The legal stages are pretty much ripped right from Smash, but there are still some very cool and beautiful stages, and there are still plenty of stages to play on casually.

So, final verdict? This game gets a 9.5/10 from me. A simply fantastic platform-fighter I would reccommend to anyone,

BUT, for those who are looking for something similar in gameplay and fun, stay and check out both this review and game! Rivals of Aether is an interesting take on the Platforming Fighter in how it closely compares itself to Super Smash Bros Melee. A decently sized character roster, multiple skins, DLC characters, and a quick and fun story mode make this game feel more than its original counterpart. The graphics of this game manage to feel deep and beautiful with its seemingly hand-drawn backgrounds and well-detailed pixelated arenas and characters.

Got to say, it was hard learning this game's mechanics, but because I love Smash Bros. so much, I still learnt all the mechanics of the game. This made me love the game more. So much, in fact, that I went to buy all the DLCs (except Shovel Knight). I main Ori and Sein, which I was surprised to find it in when I first heard about the DLC characters.

Now, if you want a fast-paced platformer fighting game, then you should check this out, especially if you play a lot of Smash Bros. The stages are simple to manuever, characters are a bit overpowered even with today (and future) nerfs/buffs but, with enough time, can be dealt with, the pixel art design is splendid, and the music is great too.

95,Rivals of Aether,45161087,english,"After playing it on two accounts (don't ask) and playing for around 2 years, I have to say I like Rivals of Aether. The gameplay is fast and fluid carrying many things from the Smash Bros. series (mostly Melee). I think it's the best Smash Bros. fan game but to be honest I think it's even something more than that. However, this game is not perfect. 

This game has DLC characters, 6 in fact. The thing is, not only is the roster already pretty small, they aren't cheap either. For 15 dollars it's not that bad but if you want DLC expect to pay over 30 dollars. 

Now that wouldn't be so bad if the DLC characters weren't notably better than the main 8 characters. I'm not gonna lie, I'm not amazing. I don't win every game I play, but I think I'm good enough to realize that the DLC characters feel way better than everyone else. It adds an unfortunate P2W aspect as in some cases it can make you win games (An example is someone who is obviously better than me beating me, but then I play Clairen and win 2-1 online)

Even though the DLCs are a little better, I wouldn't call any character bad. Which is another good thing, in this game you can play as anyone and win due to the developers' constant care and updates of the game. 

For this reason, I can't say I wouldn't reccomend it but at the same time I wouldn't reccommend it to someone who doesn't want to spend too much.

Now the gameplay.

Minor bug, I'm sure, but it can be fairly annoying. As for content though, It seems pretty consistent with the characters and skins.

 The story mode doesn't really make sense and is something you the person have to put together yourself for it to make sense.
 The most worth while mentions for the game is giving the characters their own seprate identities in terms of gameplay and design as none of them seem similar at all. Along with offering the ability to make your own custom colors and see other people's ping online before playing them so you aren't forced to play through a laggy match if you don't have to. The combo system is too important to skip out on and heavily punishes the newer players and cheap strats. The game does offer tutorial mode that teachs you all the advanced tech and try out the dlc characters before purchasing them but I feel like if you don't put in the work to be a good player, then you will get smoked.

I think there's something about the length of time that your character remains unresponsive after being hit. Rivals seems to ignore inputs long after you'd regain control of your character in Smash. The result of this is a fair bit of frustration as you try to attack, jump, or air-dodge in response to the enemy's next attack, but the game just ignores you and you get hit again and again. Each time you are hit, the timer is reset, so the game ignores you even longer. So, if your enemy is any good, they just juggle you across the stage for multiple seconds while you can't do anything. This feels really unfair when it happens.

If the online matchmaking were better, I could forgive this. Rivals is a fun game when two opponents are equally matched—I've had some enjoyable matches. But as far as I can tell, matchmaking makes no effort to pair opponents at a similar skill level. So you will play noobs and pros alike. 

(Well, I say that, but if you're against a pro, you won't actually be allowed to play as they juggle you into oblivion...)

It took Smash Bros and got rid of the annoying parts of the game and replaced it with a new recovery and parrying system.

Instead of shielding, you can parry, where, when you time it right, stuns your opponent and makes you invulnerable for a short time where you can quickly punish them. Ledge grabbing is also gone, instead, every character can walljump off the stage to restore their recovery. Other features, such as not having your moves get staled, no rage mechanic from Sm4sh, no need for L-cancelling, easier wavedashing, and being able to go into a smash attack while sprinting really adds to this game. The only thing that all of Smash really has over this game is their roster, as you know, all of their liscensed characters are there.

NOTE: This is before the Definitive Edition
Pros:
-Graphics wised is awesome, the art style, sprites, animations, and effects are done very well with such a 2D Pixelated game.
-Super Fast Paced Gameplay
-Game is more balanced on the characters
-Plots in the story is interesting and the player fighting other Rivals doesn't even matter, it gets intertesting over time. You can even get a better time for each character's story
-DLC is worth buying with 5 bucks for each DLC Character, not only more characters but stages and a EA Access skin for the DLC character if you buy the early access version of the game.
-Online is perfect and works really well, there is even a ping displayed that tells whether or not your opponent has a good connection and the Ranked is really fun for experienced players.
-Abyss Mode is really fun with abyss runes being way fun and overpowered than custom moves from Smash 4. Abyss Endless is the greatest, you play wave to wave and every wave it gets harder and harder with some challenges. 
-Tutorial mode gives players a good way of how to be good with Movement, Offense, Defense strategies and even some Tips, Tricks, and Techniques that are for beginners and advanced players.
-The Achievements are also a fun task to do and or some things to be unlocked, you would have to do some achievements to unlock them like the Aetheral Gates or a Second Slot for a second custom color slot.
-Custom Colors are really fun to make because you can make your own OC or a skins made by you.
-The Replay system is fantastic, you can disable the HUD, look at DI lines, hitboxes, number of frames, restart the whole match, or sped up to skip each part of the match.

Cons:
-The online Team match sounds dead that it seems outdated. No 4 players free for all. No Aether versions. And no Abyss runes online.
-No DLC characters playable in Abyss mode.
-Ranked Mode needs some attention for more players.

An aggresive smash-like game with no shields, infinte combos and a very interesting way of edgue guarding. All characters are unique, and have something special to them. This game is amazing.

Here are my Pros and Cons.

Pros:
+Smooth gameplay
+All characters play completely different, and have their own side objectives
+Beautiful art
+Balanced
+Next to no bugs, which is a huge plus for an early access game
+Endless possibilities. You can basically combo anything into anything
+Unique features, which makes you play completely diffeent from Smash Bros 
+Shovel knight

Cons:
-Online rooms (both private and public) only support 2 players
-No team mode online (I'd love to be able to play 2v2s)
-REALLY hard to find matches if you're in Europe. Play with friends or use online chat rooms

Having only played this casually without having touched online mode, this game is lot like Smash in that its barrier of entry is really low. You don't have to go online to enjoy this game - beating up level 9 bots and vsing local friends is still pretty damn fun. Also great for competitive players since the skill ceiling is pretty high. There's also a good tutorial on not only the basic actions but also character specific tutorials and tutorials on the more advanced techniques that can be performed in the game like Wavedashing (which is a lot easier to do here than in melee.)

For single player, there's a story mode but its pretty lacking. But there's also an good endless abyss mode which lets you level up the characters, unlock skills and progress further into an 'endless abyss'. There's an achievement for getting all characters to level 10 which is probably *the* achievement that will take you the longest to do. It's a fun mode to sink a lot of time into.  

If you're looking to pick this game up, you are going to want to decide whether you want to pick this up as a party game to play amongst friends or if you want to go competitive and look online for opponents. There's not really a middle ground.

65,Rivals of Aether,44736953,english,"I'll be honest here. I wasn't expecting much out of this game. I remember hearing about RoA thanks to RelaxAlax and Alpharad posting videos about this this game and it definitley had my interest. So I bought the game early access. I believe it was version 0.0.5 and spent a good 4 hours into the game learning the mechanics, fighters and so on. As the game progressed with development with balancing, adding Absa and Etalus, and confirmation of DLC, I think Rivals was in a good place. I even bought the Xbox One version because I loved how fluid the game was becoming. I thought to myself, this would never replace Smash Bros. for me obviously, but Rivals set out to do something new. It did its own take on what we know as the platform fighter genre that new ideas can differ the game from similar platform fighters. Rivals of Aether has a huge softspot for me on how much fun I had with this game with friends and even learning the competitive mechanics. Currently I bought all of the main DLC (yes that means ALL fighters and Steam skins. I would say same for Xbone but...) because I wanted to support this game further. I'm so glad this game turned out to be amazing to me.

*The version of RoA is 1.4.0. Will represent balances, fighters, content, etc. in that state.
*Note: This isn't too in depth as this based on my experience for the game.

Story: The world of Rivals has a neat concept. Elements of fire, wind, water, and earth along with subsidiary elements exist. The games story mode details six of each Rivals occupation, their conflict and of course the resolution at the end. This isn't a deep story by no means it's very simple but I think it's simple enough to pass as an actual story. Sure, it's not the main focus, though I kinda want to see the lore build up upon the next game whenever that comes.

Presentation: Rivals goes for a 2D sprite presentation which, to the games credit, looks great. The stages are nicely detailed, fighter sprites are big enough to see them and very fluid I might add. Looking back at Early access, the sprites flet a bit stilted (i.e. Kragg) to where it still needed some work. Now, All the fighter sprites are very smooth which I really like. When studying frame data that's pretty essential. Also, I love how attacks pop when they connect. It gives a satisfying feel that, when you hit, looks like it hurts. Listen, when you get hit offstage or hit at high percent and see that colored aura just explode out it feels good. Plus the new stages like The Forest Floor and Julesvale are very well animated. My favorite stage, The Burning Capitol, has this awesome heat effect with the flame sparks. Feels so majestic. Also, the promotional skins for Rivals I love. Each of them has say, a particle effect or lighting, that makes a fighter stand out. When you see Genesis Forsburn and that lighted flames gives a cool vibe. The soundtrack for this game is just awesome. Flashygoodness once again makes really upbeat, energetic music for the OST and is definitley worth a listen. My favorite track The Earthern Division has a nice build up that lead to what I consider an iconic tune. Though I will say, there was one track that left me unsatisfied. Lightning Pandemonium to me feels like it's missing something. Incredible build up then halfway through the track it loops. I was honestly expecting something epic but I lost it when it did. Otherwise the rest of OST of definitley worth a listen. Also, custom colors. GENIUS!!! Oh and, thank you.

Gameplay: Then one thing I was worried when going into this game was its gameplay. I was afraid that this will copy what Smash fans love and basically Melee for PC. I was so glad I was wrong. All fighters have their own original movesets, bringing forward fresh, new ideas to the platform figher genre. I'd say most unique goes to both Sylvannos and Eliana. Both fighters have unique passives (grass, steam gauge.) that really change the course of a match. I've been trying out Shovel Knight and really like the idea for his passive (treasure hunter). Overall the whole passive abilities for every Rival is very creative. As for overall control is what they nailed so great. Each Rival has their own weight to them, feeling different from one another. If there's something I look into a platfrom fighter is control. Not too much floatiness, doesn't feel stilted. I can easily do wavelanding, wavedashing, RAR. I'm in complete control. As an Ori/Kragg main, I wanna make sure my speed is kept and confuse my opponents. Sure, the game does crash sometimes for me but that's what hotfixes are for. Abyss mode is loads of fun. I love the challenges it brings. The pace is constant, when I die it's fair, and the custom moves really help out. I would say something bad about this game but most issues have been fixed thanks to updated and hotfixes. Though if you do want me to complain online can sometimes choke but playing with friends and others had mostly good connections on my part. That and the occasional connection error. 

Conclusion: Rivals of Aether is a platform fighter that isn't afraid to try something new. Most of the roster is unique, stages, presentation. This game prides itself for being a Smash Bros. inspiration and not imitation. While I still wish for stable internet matches, online Abyss mode and more options for online, that's what the upcoming definitive version is for right? But as one last harah from and early access member, Dan Fornace, I'm looking forward to whatever you do next with Rivals 2.

I played both Smash and Rivals and it holds up realy well I especially like the physics engine in other platformer fighters besides Smash like Brawlhalla feels wierd to jump and change directions in mid air but its perfect here.

But the game is one of it's own kind so it's not necessarily BAD but It could use some work when it comes to combos and hitboxes cause they're super easy to hit and feel off when you hit them.
Characters are fun and unique, unlike Icons who blatantly copied Melee characters, these guys made unique characters!
Wavedashing really doesn't serve a purpose in this game if I'm gonna be honest, though it quickens the game, it doesn't support combos at all due to the easy hitboxes making it quite useless since you'd be better off just standing still and spamming (Basically half of the players I met online)

- Fun/Unique characters
- Nice design

Cons:

83,Rivals of Aether,20582549,english,"This is my second review of this game since it was in early access in 2016. 

Rivals of Aether is an incredibly fun game. It's fast, complex, and is a spectacle to watch. The depth this game has makes me want to never stop playing, which is something I can never shame a game for. It's just so fun. The gameplay is similar to Super Smash Bros, specifically the Gamecube iteration, Super Smash Bros. Melee. It's a bit more simple, making things like wavedashing easier, and the complete removal of L-Cancelling. It makes it so that you can do sick combos and master movement a lot easier and worry about that less at a top level of play. 
I think that Rivals of Aether is either my favorite platform fighter, or second to Melee. Its characters are unique, the music is fantastic, and the gameplay is solid. I'm gonna keep playing for years to come. If you don't have the game, it's on sale for half off this week (as of the time of writing this) and you should definitely pick it up.

99,Rivals of Aether,44366460,english,"The simplest thing I can say about Rivals is that it cuts the bull. This is not just the best platform fighter I've ever played, but I'll take this over just any fighter. Period.
 
Defensive options that promote sluggish, campy, obnoxious habits are removed for a more aggressive, fast, and frantic fighting experience. You get a parry with 3 frame startup and 20 frame end lag that cannot be spammed and a very predictable roll. That's it, but the parry is very satisfying, skillful and rewards you for parrying medium and higher attacks with some i-frames and a stun on the opponent. And no ledge so goodbye BS ledge hogging or planking. You're forced to get creative with recovery which the game really lets you do.

This game is HARD. But it's wholly fair and somehow still accessible. I never feel cheesed out. The balance is just right that you don't need staling or dumb cop out comeback mechanics like rage. If you're good at the game, you can get very creative with conversions and combos but it's very easy to get out of bad situations. The game is quite flexible.
The base mechanics aren't needlessly difficult to do and there's some minor input buffering so you don't need to have the mechanical dexterity of a factory robot. It's a very human game that just lets you get immediately to understanding *concepts* instead of spending time worrying if you're even hitting the buttons properly. Rivals is simple. That's the whole point of the platform fighter genre. Simplicity. Everything just works as it appears like it should.

The movesets are just incredible. Characters just have amazingly wild and inventive options of approaching, zoning, and recovering. 
I often see folks say that the game pulls too much from Smash Bros in terms of moves. And that's just not fair to the game's main draw in that every character has some elemental based variant on stage control/pressure. It's just brilliant and along with the perfectly implemented parry, this acts as your bread&butter keep away and defensive tools. They require extensive experimentation and understanding of a character to utilize efficiently. It also lends itself well to the slight stigma the game has of being ""furry Melee"" or ""Smash for furries"". 
The art style is great. I can't really think of anything more perfectly fitting than an anthro cast for fighters focused on such creative elemental abilities...despite Shovel Knight being in the game now. But maybe he's a fox or rabbit under that armor. Who knows?

On the note of art, the graphics are just right. Another unfair criticism to this game was it's pixel art which I personally find beautiful and inspiring. I love the crisp, GameBoy Advance graphics. The characters are so cute and simple on screen with minimal detail. Certain frames look questionable, but in motion, these animations are just incredible for what they are. They're about as fluent as Third Strike and it makes for a visual fidelity that is very legible and easy on the eyes. Everything is crystal clear and lines up sensibly with hitboxes. You won't say ""that actually hit??"" in this game. And the backgrounds are just as beautiful. I love them, they make me yearn for simpler handheld times on the GBA playing classics like Advance Wars, Minish Cap, and Gradius.
There isn't a lot of extra fluff either. The pixel graphics allow for a mostly fixed camera that doesn't pan and zoom and rumble so fervently. The contrast of the characters and their attacks on the backgrounds of the stages are perfect. There aren't any needless effects to attacks or stages (even on Aether mode) either. I can focus. I don't get a headache due to eyestrain playing this game as best as I can.

This review is getting too long so I'm gonna wrap up with bullet points because there's too much to praise, and I do have a few kinda-sorta cons at the end...

Additional Pros:

+The music is fire. Very fresh, lively, consistent soundtrack that doesn't feel like it's trying to be something else or generic (*cough* Icons: Combat Arena *cough*)

+It had some of the best Early Access. The game was just clean from day one. Consistently. Even had online play immediately that didn't DC on you like mad. Though it could stand for some more options. Lobbies like Slap City would be welcome.

+DLC is cheap. If you're complaining about the characters not being free, you're being unfair. These were made from scratch and fighting game characters are not an easy task. The art, animations, movesets, trailers, balancing, QA, and everything else is worth the asking price. People have bills to pay. $2.50 or in the case of Ori $5 per character is wholly justifed. 

+Custom. Character. Colors. GOD yes.

+Great extensive training mode. Frame by frame, DI lines, extended CPU behavior options, hitbox visualization. The works.

+Playtest right on the menu. Wanna test a new control setup or just pass the time waiting for a player to connect? Even lets you beat up each other.

+All aerials auto cancel. It just makes sense.

+Basic mode did what Smash 4 failed to do with Omega stages. You actually get fun and different stages layouts that are more than just aesthetic differences but are still competitive.

+GREAT spectator game. The speed and depth of the game makes tournaments hype as Hell and exciting. And the visual clarity I outlined earlier makes things extremely easy to follow even at top level. Seriously, go to VGBootCamp and look up some CakeAssault or FullStream VoDs. It's great!

Cons:

-Playing randoms online needs work. No matter what time of day or what day it is, I often just find myself running into the exact same people multiple times in a row. This has been the consistent biggest issue I've had since early access even during big events for the game where it's popularity got a spike. This game isn't huge, but it's not THAT unpopular. I've never played another online game that does this so I think it's something server side as opposed to the number of players. You really have to join a Rivals Discord if you want to play online with different people.

-Single player content is a bit weak. I know this game was competitive multiplayer first, but if you're going to add SP to a game, I feel like it should have the same kind of polish for people who like it. It is *fun*, but just not lasting. The story mode is just way too sparse and not that engaging. And until Rivals Definitive, Abyss mode only lets you play the base 8 roster which is kinda lame. And there's nothing else beside those. :c
(The cutscene art could also be better, but that's so minor.)

-I feel like the original 8 characters are due for slight design tweaks. They're a bit lacking compared to the DLC characters.

But all in all, this game is outstanding. Would buy again...and I will next year.",1535192101,1535860081,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,238,16,10751,4,8480,1601562823

84,Rivals of Aether,43654530,english,"If you're a fan of Super Smash Brothers...then I'd recommend you just stick with that game instead.

The thing is that this game tries to be Smash Brothers, but decided to try and do a few things of it's own. While that wouldn't be bad (because then you'd just be a clone), it ends up failing in actually trying to be both things.

For one, a few of the characters are very blatantly copying commonly used Smash characters (Zetterburn is Fox and Wrester is Falco), so much so that they even borrow some of their signature special moves. The second problem is that when they try to implement their own ideas into the game, it just seems like odd choices. Like are Kragg has the move to create a giant pillar to save themselves. Or how Absa's basic side-attack is able to reach all the way across the stage and could be done repeatedly with little chance of escaping. Or how Forsburn has the ability to cover large portions of the screen with smoke, obscuring both your vision and your opponent's.

There's just so many questionable design choices that went into this game that it just becomes annoying to even continue playing. I bought this game while it was on sale for around $5, but even then, it's not worth it. I can't imagine why it would even be worth it to buy it for it's full $15 price point. Along with the DLC characters being so few and not even worth buying...and including Ori as well (how and why they got the okay to put Ori in the game is still a mystery to me). I know some will argue that the mechanics presented are just part of the experience and I just need to ""get gud"", but no. I will not abide your crappy behavoir in giving shit game mechanics a pass just because you can find a way to work with them. They're still shit, regardless.

In short, don't buy this game. Buy a Switch and wait for Smash Ultimate to come out.

But it's not even the fast paced action or the fact, that even the dlc characters can be defeated in a 1v1 matchup.
Sure, they are a bit stronger, but what would be the reason for purchasing them be if they wouldnt be? :smirk:
Despite that, some of the original 8 or even 4 can be really op too...

But not only is the gameplay super comfortable, but also the presentation couldnt be better.
The crisp graphics, the catchy music, but also the outside-of-the-game presentation, that peaked with the rivals direct this april, when they put up a whole april fools not-nin***do direct, making everybody expecting nothing, but then suddenly referencing the smash ultimate reveal when showing of elliana in an awesome, never seen beast of a trailer.

The amount of mind games that go into reading an opponents DI and knowing what will follow up with itself is insane. For me, Melee will always be on top but this is a breath of fresh air and I hope the community stays active for years to come.

6,Rivals of Aether,43432425,english,"To start off, I am an extreme fan of smash brothers, and I am very happy to play a fighting game with the same style, using all the techniques of literally all the smash games combined, for example, wave dashing is so fluent and amazing, saying thatI love it is an understatement.

Now on to the actual game. The story mode is eh, but the gameplay is still fun. Some backgrounds for the Rivals are strange, especially Kragg, which is just ""I go around wall, wall broke, must kill wall breaker."" But seeing how this game was more centered toward the actual gameplay, I can understand the lack of character development, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. With the introduction of DLC, I'm sure things can be explained more clearly. 

After beating the main story, the abyss mode is unlocked. I'm just gonna come and say it: This mode is clearly better than the story mode itself. I enjoy every single challenge and miniscule thing I have to do. It's obviously inspired by all the smash minigames, like multiman smash and the like, but done in a unique way in that it's somewhat all combined. I also enjoy the alternate abilities or ""Runes"" you can unlock to make the mode easier. I would honestly like to see a mode online where you can activate these runes and play against your friends. I think it would make up for a very chaotic and fun expierence. 

Another thing I am very happy to see is the tutorial mode. It is by far one of the best tutorial modes I have experienced in any game I've played (although, I am guilty of not completing it). First of all, you can CHOOSE whether you want to do it. And the fact that it teaches new players advanced mechanics is amazing. Smash on the other hand, only shows a video of ""how to play"" during the title sequence, which is helpful, but fails to help new players in that it's not interactive at all. The one small gripe I have about it is the edge guarding tutorial. For some reason, I cannot, for the life of me, complete it. I can't seem to  get the damn Zetter off the damn stage but whatever. But that's the whole point right? To do it until you do it right. So I guess I can't really complain.

Next are graphics. They're good ,what can I say? Sure it's pixelated, but where it really shines is the effects, like Zetterburn's double damage smash attacks and what not. Seriously, graphics don't make a game, and this is a prime example. 

Finally, my one main problem with this game, MY ONE ISSUE. The recovery. I am a huge HUGE HUGE fan of how wall jumping gets you out of free fall, HOWEVER... The lack of ledges really hurt me. I've come to the conclusion that once you go off the stage, it's literally over if your opponent knows how to edge guard well. And I am aware of Orcane and Sylvanos' recovery, that automatically put them on the stage, but Rivals like Zetterburn and Eliana are done once they're taken off the stage. I honestly think that ledges could fix these issues, so that people could air dodge into them, and have an option to get back onto the stage.

In conclusion, this is slowly becoming one of my favorite games. I can see myself putting many hours into it, like I have in smash 4. Playing a new fighting game of this genre is really refreshing. It makes it even better that I don't have to deal Bayonetta mains, which seriously puts a smile on my face. If this game every gets an HD remake with 3D graphics, I will buy it in a heartbeat, you mark my words. 

P.S. The music is great, but some of the music on the stages can get kind of repetitive.

9,Rivals of Aether,43403093,english,"Let me preface by saying I love this game. Straight up, if you like Super Smash, Brawlhalla, etc., buy this. I personally can't decide whether or not I prefer this game to smash (and its obviously better than brawlhalla). The game plays and feels a lot better than smash, and the pace is much faster due to the lack of grabs and sheild. 
In all my time playing, I have encountered a single bug in this game (a small graphical error with custom skins against a friend online), that had no effect on the gameplay. In Smash 4, for instance, glitches are strangely common (Especially since I main Dedede who is glitchy af). 
There is, however, a downside to this game. That is the fact that every new character so far is DLC. Don't get me wrong, I bought them ASAP, and will continue to do so, but with such a small roster compared to other games of the same style and genre, having so many of them as DLC is counterproductive if you want to keep the playerbase growing, and keep them playing. In terms of gameplay, I feel this game is superior to Smash 4. Even the characters are better. Each character is very intricate and complex, with many of each characters moves having several effects, uses, and combinations with other moves. Each character is more fleshed out than in smash. Not to mention, smash has characters like Lucina, which is just bad Marth. The characters take more practice, and are just hands down better than those in Smash. 
The game is also much more balanced than smash when it comes to tier lists, with little difference from the bottom-most character to the top-most, and with all characters being viable competetively. But, I am a smash fanboy, and that makes me biased when it comes to saying that this game is better. 
I would rate them as equals, but any way I slice it, ROA seems to come out as being better. I highly recommend. One thing to know beforehand, this game is not for casuals, and FFA games are impossible online due to their matchmaking system.

26,Rivals of Aether,43287121,english,"         Rivals of Aether is an excellent indie platform fighting game specifically catered toward any player that has a competitive drive for a Super Smash Bros. like fighter.  It boasts a serviceable story mode, a great training mode, as well as an outstanding tutorial mode for any player trying to break into the competitive arena.  The story mode for this game is very typical for fightings games.  It serves as a decent way to get to know the backstory and playstyle of half the roster of characters this game offers.  The only drawback to this mode is that not all the characters are included in it (...Nor are the developers willing to include the other characters in the future).  Only six characters have a route in story mode.  This game is fairly fun casually however it won't last all that long without people to play.  The tutorial mode that this game offers is a great way for newcomers to learn the mechanics of the game.  If you want to play the game competitively, then you would have to complete at least the novice and intermediate portions of this mode to even stand a chance online.  This tutorial mode will show newcomers how to perform multiple super smash bros-like mechanics that fit into the game seamlessly (wavedashing, teching..etc.).  It is really neat how this game has a replay mode, Statistics data sheet, and a custom color mode for each of the characters this game offers.  These modes all really help to give the players all the tools they need to be successful at playing the game. 

        Each of the character designs look fairly detailed and interesting to look at (albeit the DLC characters have alot more effort put into them than the others).  All the characters have their own unique moveset and playstyle.  I would say the roster in general is very well balanced.  Any character is viable competitively in this game (unlike most fighting games).  Some characters are played alot more than others (Be prepared to experience alot of Zetterburn, Clairen, and Ranno play online).  The main draw to this game though is the multiplayer (like Super Smash Bros.).  The online modes are made up of competitive ranked 1vs1, exhibition 1vs1, team match, and free-for-all modes.  My main problem with this game is how inactive the casual team match / free-for-all modes are.  Nobody online plays these modes!  Having casual play would definitely add to this game by giving it more playability and fun factor.  So, if you really like casual play, you're not going to like this game all that much and would need to invite some personal friends over to your place for local matches.  However, the games makes up for the lack of casual modes with the 1vs1 modes.  These modes are absolutely thrilling and incredibly competitive!  

       Online the connection is very dependent on how well you're lag matches up to your opponents'.  When it comes to online matches, you will experience a wide range of ping.  The green ping means that the match has great connectivity, while the yellow means that the lag will somewhat dodgy occasionally but steady.  The red ping generally means that the connection will be very bad.  The online connection for this game is just decent.  Usually, one would be wise to avoid the lag that a red ping connection would give you and play the opponents with the green and yellow.  However, I have had experiences where the red ping players would give me more steadier connections than those with green and yellow strangely enough (vice versa too).  It is always a good idea to just wake up whenever you're side of the world is awake and get on.  Usually, I have more good connections than bad.  Still, the game may have multiple moments where the connection will play smoothly only to be totally interrupted and dropped later on.  With the community as active as is, the online scene will keep the game alive for hundreds upon hundreds of hours in the next few years.  This game has a fairly high learning curve (if you go online, you'll encounter many players who have placed many more hours into the game than you).  You can play on those modes for many, many hours and still not be very good at playing the game!  Keep in mind, this motivates someone like me to learn more about the characters and their matchups.  I highly recommend that newer players who are interested in playing the game competitively interact with the Rivals of Aether community as soon as possible.  The community is fairly friendly and helpful.  You will get better more quickly.  In general, this is a game that is definitely created with mainly the competitive aspect in mind.  If you don't like that, then you likely won't have as fun with the casual modes the game offers...  I highly recommend this game to anyone who likes competitive platform fighting games.

While the game introduces you to Smash Brothers style fighting and lingo through some extensive tutorials, I can't say how faithful it is to the formula, because I've played almost no smash brothers.

I can say that throwing rocks at someone's face as the earth turtle Kragg, having it rebound, and then punching the rock in midair to shower the enemy with shards of the rock that just hit their face is great fun, as is jumping backwards through the air as the fire lion Zetterburn, only to kick behind myself into the enemy. All the characters have cool, unique and fun moves.

I've mostly just played singleplayer - the AI isn't super great, I'm a terrible player with old man reflexes and can beat it pretty much every time, but the single player game is still challenging because of time attack goals and endless mode.

The one multiplayer game I played tells me the netcode is rock solid - my current internet is utterly horrible, with lag spikes, packetloss, and all the bad stuff, but the match was still playable. I look forward to playing more multiplayer once I no longer have horrible internet.

48,Rivals of Aether,43128523,english,"Note that I have played both this game and Smash 4 competitively.
My humble review of Super Smash Bros Melee... with furries.

Visuals:
The graphics arent the best and are stylized towards a pixely look. This isnt a bad thing because it doesnt take a very good computer to run this game. When I was watching this game I thought the graphocs were to simple for me to figure out what was going on and what move the players were doing, but this never ended up being a problem.

Music:
The music is fantastic. Thats all I really have to say. If you dont like the music though, you can add custom music to the game.

Sound design:
The sound design in this game is fantastic! When Maupul does her strong attacks the whiping sound is clear; when Ranno  hits his sweet spot forward air there is a satisfing thud; and when sylvanos gets his tipper up strong you hear a very deep thump. All of the sounds in this game make it satisfying to do what you are supposed to and help a lot in terms of helping the player differentiate some parts of moves from the other.

Gameplay:
(Im gonna break this down into multiple sections)
-Character balance:
all of the characters are relatively balanced. Sometimes the tier list will rear its ugly head but any character has a good chance against another.
-Movement:
coming from smash 4 (where there was no advanced movement) I was scared that things like wavedashing and wavelanding would be too hard to learn and implement into my gamplay. But it wasnt that hard to learn what i needed to.
-Characters:
this game has the best designed characters out of ANY fighting game ive played! I remember that it was crazy in smash 4 when Mega Man had a projectile for his jab. Well the characters in this game have so much depth and are so unique that it puts any other fighting game to shame. In other games I cant stand playing any character other than my main or secondary. But in this game (I main Maypul) I love (not like, LOVE) playing Maypul, Slvanos, Forsburn, Ranno, Wrastor and Clairen. And Those are the only characters Ive tried out in my 72 hours pf playing and I am looking to try out more. And learning all of these characters arent hard because of the amazing indepth guides that are in the game.
-Flow:
the flow of the game is a lot more fast paced than other games and I like that. Its flashy and satisfying to pull of a cool combo.

I would 100% give this game a yes to anyone I ever meet.
PS - you dont need a controller to be good at this game :)",1530191936,1530191975,TRUE,2,2,0.504984736,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,49,9,65916,2069,4590,1602022802

Instead, Rivals replaces shielding with a mechanic called parrying, basically a counter from the Smash series, which puts the opponent in a stun state. This single mechanic makes the game far more agressive than Melee and gives the game a flare of its own. It has competitive tournaments, both online and local, and has both online and local multiplayer, though right now online is only 1 v. 1 which will be changed to 4 player online play somtime in the future, hopefully.

--Serious bit--
Really good game! There are a lot of similarites to Super Smash Bros. but this game is no way a clone. Each character has their own ability (ie. Wrastor has a slip stream that increases his speed and Zetterburn's fire increases knockback by 2x (plz nerf)). Each character can also perform a parry attack by perfect guarding an attack. Depending on the attack, the opponent is either left unable to move for a short period of time or the attack is reflected back at them. There are still a lot of balancing issues, such as Zetterburn's fire as it can result in a KO at ~50% - 60% from the center of multiple maps. Other than that, this is a fantastic game that should be given a try.

+  balanced:  There is a meta, but the characters are so close in balance that I wouldn't say anyone is the ""worst"", at least at the level we are capable of playing the game at.
+  community:  The developers and players are a tight knit community, often raising money to sponsor tournaments or to help their own.  This has always been something that seems to really shine about the platform fighter genre.

I came into it with basically no experience with platform fighters (I just like furry characters, aha), but I was able to pick it up pretty quickly! The tutorials do a fantastic job of teaching you just about everything you need to know when it comes to playing the game, down to more advanced techniques that are pretty vital if you decide to venture into online matches.

A few pros:
-If you like a story mode, it's got one! It does a good job of giving you a taste of each of the featured characters' personalities.
-You'll get a lot of playtime out of trying to complete all the single player stuff, if that's your sort of thing.
-You can set a custom palette for each fighter (and a second if you unlock it) meaning you'll never run into an exact duplicate online, or be forced to choose a different color from your favorite one.
-The community is pretty friendly, and welcoming to new players! There's even a group dedicated to helping them improve.

A few cons:
-The aforementioned story mode is pretty basic, and only covers 6 of the full 13-character roster. It mostly exists as a sort of time trial with some story bits mixed in.
-Even though the single player options will take you a while to finish, there's really only two of them. Three if you count versus mode against an AI, but-
-The AI isn't really that good, even at max level. It's VERY good at parrying and teching, but not so much at anything else.
-As with all fighting games, it can be hard to find someone online in random matches who isn't insanely better than you when you're starting out.

Rivals Of Aether is an exceptionally well-made platform brawler that, on the surface, resembles Smash very much. But it has its key, game-changing differences that make it stand out as its own thing. 

Shields and spot-dodging are replaced with a parry system, ledge grabbing is replaced with a wall jump system that allows you to use your recovery twice and still manages to not be broken, Smash attacks are relegated to their own button and grabbing is done away with entirely. Keep in staples such as Melee style air dodging and wave dashing, throw in interesting new character designs with a unique playstyle for each one, and you have a fantastic and different entry in a genre of game that sorely needs more original content. 

I picked up the core game during a sale and bought all the DLC when it was on a later sale for the release of the latest DLC, which I paid for full price. That's aproximately $17.50. I feel like this is a good value.

15,Rivals of Aether,18175040,english,"Full disclosure: I was part of the early beta testing period before the game went into Early Access. Take that for what you will.

Rivals of Aether is arguably the best platform fighter that wasn't made by Nintendo. Dan Fornace and his team have a clear understanding of what the competitive Smash Bros. community enjoys about platform fighters while making the game more accessible to newcomers. While most of the playable characters are amalgamations of pre-existing Smash Bros. characters, they at least have some unique mechanics in their move-sets that help them stand out. My favorite characters thus far are the ones that are wholly unique to this game. There's a reason why Orcane is the de facto mascot. 

Having said that, the single player content is a bit lacking. The story mode was clearly an afterthought, with each of the characters' individual chapters consisting of five quick matches before you get to the final boss. Kragg and Wrastor's campaigns in particular feel like what would normally be one scene in any other video game being stretched out and padded over several cutscenes.

Abyss Mode is where all the single-player effort went into. It's essentially all the bonus challenges in previous Smash Bros games mashed into a gauntlet-style challenge mode. You earn experience to level up your character and unlock various abilities with the coins you obtain from playing the game in general. Unfortunately, it's a huge grind to max out a single character's level and unlock all their runes if you do this by yourself. You can speed this up through local multiplayer, but I hardly have anyone to test that out with. A form of online multiplayer would've been neat.

37,Rivals of Aether,42065356,english,"While I can't say much for the playerbase, as it seems far and few between, I can say that the design, mechanics, and quality of the game are that of someone who deeply cares for this genre. I absolutely loved playing through the story mode, though I wish the final level wasn't as confusing. If you like Super Smash, Brawlhalla, or any fighting game for that matter, then you will love this game. Just, make sure you get yourself a controller as the keyboard doesn't quite do the game justice. That being said, using the keyboard isn't any less smooth. Truly a game worth your time and for a cheap price, if you're willing to play with only the base characters. The unlockable characters are purchased through DLC, and that's my only beef with the game.

If you wish to hear more, I'll tell you my experience of the game when I first started playing. I saw a YouTuber playing it and thought it looked pretty fun, and to my surprise it was even more fun than I expected. I started in multiplayer, which was a bit of a mistake because I knew none of the mechanics, I figured my Super Smash knowledge would suffice, but there are quite a few differences that really polish this game. So I decided I would try my hand at the story mode, just to get a feel for the characters, and that's exactly what it is designed for. The story mode will prove challenging enough for the first-timer but get easier between levels as you learn the moves of the character. There is also no penalty aside from adding a minute to your timer when you die. You can even compete with others through the story's time trials. Once I learned the characters, I hopped into multiplayer again and did much better, but still got my ass kicked. It wasn't frustrating, though, as those people have been playing for a while I imagine. I just kept at it and eventually learned how to do a lot more. There are times it feels like bullshit, but you just have to keep trying and you'll learn how to combat it. At no point did I ever feel like quitting. I wanted to keep rematching the same person over and over again so I could improve. There are not many games that can do that to me.

If I were to rate the game, I'd give it a solid 9/10. The only problems I faced were ping issues from people in my region, but there was luckily a setting to change the region, so I was able to keep playing with other people who didn't have such a bad ping. The other problem is the issue of DLC. I don't like that I have to pay $5 per character unlock. I can understand where the developer is coming from, they have to make their money somehow, but I don't personally want to spend the money. I wish the in-game coins could be used with the option of the DLC adding certain skins, that would make the game more enjoyable in my opinion. That way I could play all of the characters. Also, those characters aren't available for practice if you don't own the DLC, just to test them out, and there is no story mode with them as far as I can tell, but I haven't purchased them, so I can't say with 100% confidence that that is the case. It might just be something I can't see until I buy the DLC. Either way, I don't like that you have to pay $5 for a character unlock. I would pay that for only skins if anything. But those are really minor issues that don't affect the overall enjoyment of the game. You can easily play with someone who has around 150 ping, anything higher and you'll notice the lag a lot, but again you can just switch regions to play with people who have better ping.

Dan Fornace took the machanics from SSBM and amplified their competitive feel, making exploits into mechanics (alla the wavedash) and making certain techniques that seemed impossible to concistently pull off much easier. The game also is much better optimized for competitive play. The smash bros games were always made to be party games. This makes the competitive scene in any game very wonky, with a roster of unbalanced characters and movement exploits that will give you carpel tunnel when you try to pull them off (despite being basic parts of high-level play).

Every character is given a moveset inspired by various top teir characters from SSBM, with each character having a different feel and playstyle. Also, each character has the potential to win high-level tournaments (In each smash game, there are only a select few characters that have this potential).

No type of fighting game is more guilty of this than the ""Smash-like"", and RoE is about as close to Smash as you can get on PC. The playerbase is so small that the best matchmaking system possible wouldn't help in the slightest (not that there is one in this game), so unless you are one of those seasoned Smash veterans or you are planning on playing almost exclusively with friends, this game will fill you with nothing but salt.

As a long time fan of smash im sure you will be all to familiar with shielding to defend yourself from attacks. In this game however its replaced with a parry that stuns the opponent for a short time based on how powerful the attack was. I hated it at first but now its very rewarding to time the parry just right and then finish them off with a smash attack. The game truly shines in its small linear maps with excellent opportunities to combo your opponent. The characters all have different play styles with different kinds of abilities that feel very unique. This includes, traps, stuns, bleeds, teleporting, Ice armor, suspending foes in a bubble and much much more.

85,Rivals of Aether,41617050,english,"Heard about this by chance. Boy am I glad I did. Because at this point, I realized it's better than Super Smash Brothers - y'know, the big indie platform fighting game that really got the genre going.

The roster is small, but creative and fairly balanced. The art style is simple but lovely. The music is to die for (ty Flashy Goodness!) It's easy enough to learn but hard to master. Tutorials are there for the game in general and each character (even if you haven't purchased them!) Story mode is lacking, but was a requested feature the devs honored. Abysss mode adds a fun way to practice, as well as challenge, custom moves, and general replayablillty, even in a crazy/casual matches.

Quick, high-skill movement (wave-dashing) is made accessable to players like me at a relatively low learning curve. I know I'm not that good, especially agaisnt any skillled people, but I can still feel rather good at the game in general. It's an amazing experience.

Also, normal modes and hazard modes of stages is toggleable - play only with combatants and the ground provided, or around dangerous (but fair!) world hazards. Custom colors for characters is a great addition. And if you're interested in supporting the developers, fancy skins like American Wraster are available for cheap too.

It lacks some polish here and there, most notably with limited multiplayer options online, but I'm sure that as the game continues to be supported that concern can be addressed as well.

[b] Graphics and system requirements [/b]
This games  style is amazing with fluid animations. Every cutscene, menu and movement has animation which makes the game very immersive and fun. This game has very low requirements so anybody can boot it up on any system.

[b] Difficulty [/b]
Just as all fighting games. The difficulty completaly relies on what you do. The game is fun and easy if you are playing the singleplayer but you can easily go herdcore and try to face people in competetibe battles.

[b] Game length [/b]
The main story in this game is max 2 hours but considering the story is like 1% of any fighting game, this game is endless. You can spend hundreds to tens of thousands of hours to become the best or just spend a little bit unlocking some characters and get destroyed the second you go online.

[b] Bugs/ glitches [/b]
There are no bugs or glitches which I have come across which is good.

[b] Extra content [/b]
This game has lots of extra content with tuns of maps and characters but the bad part is every character is over $1 and there are no bundles. But i'm not complaining since $1 for a whole new character to master is really cheap.

[b] Overall [/b]
Overall this game is amazing and I recommend it to anyone who likes fighting games.

3,Rivals of Aether,41495525,english,"[h1]~REVIEW~[/h1]

I adore this game. Smash is what got me into the fighting genre and I hold that game dear. It helped me branch out into SF, Tekken, BB, GG, UNIEL, Skullgirls, etc. I picked this game up in early access around 2015 if I'm not mistaken and played with it a little, but at the time I was very heavy into SM4SH, Melee, and Project M, so I let it sit around. With the announcement of Smash for Switch, I got the urge to play some Smash/Smashish games and looked through my list. I remembered I had this and installed it alongside brawlhalla, Melee, PM, and a few others. I booted this up, setup my mayflash GC adapter and off we went. 

I haven't gotten this much enjoyment out of a game in a very, very long time. I happened to pick it up again around the time of Sylvanos and Elliana launched and it couldnt have been timed any better. The game feels polished, fast, easily played on all systems just about, and has something thats been lacking in a lot of recent games imo which is fun and hype. 

[h1]~PROS~[/h1]

[list]
[*] Super fun characters
[*] Custom skins
[*] Hype combat
[*] Uses Smash techs. (Wavedashing + etc)
[*] Platform fighter
[*] Pretty Balanced
[*] Melee Like
[*] Awesome pixel art
[*] Great soundtrack
[*] Incredibly fun to play online and off
[*] Easy to pick up, hard to master
[*] All characters can parry
[*] Awesome technical combos if you're willing to invest the time
[/list]

[h1]~CONS~[/h1]

[list]
[*] 13 Characters as of [4/14/18], this is more of a want than a con. The characters in game are flushed out and great as is.
[*] Cannot get a lot of custom DLC costumes if purchased recently or missed previous opportunities. Excalibur Akin/Shine Skin/Genesis Skin/etc.
[/list]

[h1]~CLOSING~[/h1]

It has the hype and pacing of melee while being its own unique fighter with epic characters and a great design. The only con I have is I wish there was more! This game could really keep up with smash if it got a bit of a bigger roster and a fleshed out story. (No slight at all against the small dev team, they are talented ballers as far as I'm concerned.) Good platform fighters are rare... we pretty much wait on Nintendo. It would be awesome for RoA to fill the gap that Nintendo refuses to fill, such as Melee style tech in newer games and competitive competition at the core of the game. This is a fantastic competitive game as well and I really hope to see a RoA 2, or hell make another edition with some upgrades in the future, either way, I need more RoA in my life. 

I honestly wish I would have played this game seriously sooner.

~ Really tho, its a great drinking game and fun as hell to play with friends or solo online.~

23,Rivals of Aether,41404191,english,"At the time of writing this review, i have only had 5 hours on this game, and already im having a blast playing it. Yes. The game IS a smash bros-like game, however it doesnt feel like it is anything like smash brothers. 

Each character has got a really unique ability, and while there are very little characters to play as, new characters always has some new interesting specials, or a really cool ability.
Some examples are:
Zetterburn can do more damage with his strong attacks if the enemy has been burned by his attacks.
Wrastor can only use his strong attacks in mid air, which honestly balances out any characters that have >2 jumps.
Elliana has a machine that needs to cool down, and as you use it and it starts to overheat, you can shoot steam, to cool it down.
Clairen has a tipper effect similar to Marth's, but this time she stuns the opponent for a bit. 
Ranno has a poison effect, pretty sure it causes ranno to do more damage? (not sure)
Maypul can recover to any character which has been affected by one of her attacks, similar to burn, but no damage overtime. 


While the game does have a really unique cast, as the game stands, its way too overpriced. 
The main reason is because there arent many characters, so for the moment the game is overpriced honestly. Also, even though the games initial price is overpriced, the devs still decide to add new characters, that you have to pay £4 to get. Most of the time it is 2 characters though but honestly, i think you should be able to atleast buy them for an unreasonable amount of coins in game anyways, so then:
1. Players will try to play for longer just to get the character
2. Players won't be let down for not being able to play any of the DLC characters.

However im sure that in the future when there will be much more characters, aside from the default 8 characters, there will be a rotation where you can play 2 characters for a week.

Overall the game is really unique, the characters dont feel the same when you play them and each character is fun. However not worth the money though so i recommend to wait for a discount.",1523389147,1523389147,TRUE,1,0,0.523809552,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,42,15,881,0,494,1535284563

1. Not a huge deal, but a ranking system would be great. The competitive community around this game is a barrier to entry for new players. Not noob friendly at all. Matchmaking needs work.

2. Here's where you lost me: the new characters are behind a pay wall. Each one is $5.00, so if you want the full experience, the price of the game is doubled at this point. I did the training mode and really liked the gameplay of Ori and Sein, and what's that? I have to pay for the newest update I've been anxiously waiting for? Nice tease, but I'm out.

It pains me to say I can't reccommend this game. I loved it at first, but there are some things that really bug me, and a fighting game that has new characters come out for $5 a pop is one of them.

Don't be afraid to buy this if you can't play with others locally, practice with the coms till you have a good grasp (don't forget the tutorial that is equally informative to complete newcomers and Melee gods), then go online and test yourself.
A new base game that will have you discovering new things well after 100 hours
Dan Fornace is very active in the community and is responsive to criticism and, as mentioned, applies input into frequent updates
cool ""Make your own outfit"" option I never saw coming
After playing through the turorials and getting a hang on how the game works, hidden tech and mechanics come very organically and a frame display in practice mode will teach you anything you didn't learn otherwise.
Awesome music (especially the airships)
great stages with a sort of ""Omega"" switch that makes them more tourney-legal, and base stages with fun and wacky active factors.

Cons

Graphics can be described as simplistic and certain frames during animations can look pretty wierd
DLC is necessary for a little less than half the cast
because it's this type of game, regular keyboard controls are probably foreign and confusing (Although I've only used keyboard maybe once or twice, so I'm not even sure on that)
Although it is much better than earlier versions, there is still just enough lag in some matches that can trip up your inputs and cost you the game, but still better than sm4sh's average online experience.
Some say the game can be a bit scary to newcomers and is really meant for smash players looking for a new game or migratory melee players. I don't believe so myself, but I've been playing smash my whole life so I may have a bias.

This game deserves a lot more attention and praise. Truly a game that is easy to pick up, but difficult to master. The Pros vastly outweigh the cons, not to mention all these cons may be removed with the constant updates the game gets. I beg everyone to pick this game up, and if you like it, spread it as much as possible. There is a community, but mostly people that have played from the game's start on early access. Spread this game as much as possible to all gamers!

The combat, oh boy. Wanna play with controller as any good'ol brawlers? Well, good luck, cause this is NOT that game.
The combat focuses heavily on timing and button presses, and honestly, keyboard feels more satisfying than controller. 

Secondly, there is not much explained about combat. I got to the Intermediate ""tutorial"" where i need to stop an NPC, to reach the platform.The game gives you a hint: you need to hit him hard down. Well, problem is, you cannot. The guy channels his special, gets a flame shield around him, and, lands on the platform. And, that's all, you get to see it repeat that, over and over and over.

Story wise, there are, 5maps with 5 stages, if i remember correctly. And 1 map is basicly the ""mega boss"", But, it's kinda a clusterfuck (sorry for expression), since you basicly need to avoid laser beams, missiles and constant dark heroes that spawn. At some point, the eyes start exploding the whole platform you are on, and they can be surrounded by some dark spooky energy, that basicly deals too much dmg to deal with. Oh, at some point i had like, 4 enemies on the map. I had no idea where the hell i was. (Did i mention that it also deals a MASSIVE BLAST on the whole platform, instakilling you?)

I remember the first time I heard of Rivals of Aether. I wrote it off as an attempt to cash in on the hype with Smash, and I thought to myself ""Those pixel graphics looks awful""

Boy was I ever wrong. I absolutely adore this game. Even more so than it's inspiration at this point. I love the characters, I love the lore, I love the music, and I especially love the gameplay. Rivals of Aether does so much with so little. It took what made Smash Bros great and added a layer of techincality and aesthetic that absolutely works to the game's advantage. Every character is unique, fun to play, and great to look at. The music gets you excited, and fits their respective characters and stages very well. I love the music to the point where I actually bought the OST. The stages are all designed to be tournament legal, and the ""gimicks"" provided in the casual version of the stages make for interesting casual play. I have never played a fighting game and felt like I don't have a main, but this is the first time that I feel like I can't decide on a character because they're all so fun to play. Every time you think you've figured out a character you find new tech, or some sort of creative way to use their moveset. 

The developers and community are wonderful as well. Dan makes an active effort to communicate with the community over timeframes of upcoming content, The devs constantly post art on twitter and are very active within the competitive scene. For the skill required for this game, I've never come across a sour community member on twitter, reddit, etc. 

Even the skins are cool. Every single premium skin released is great to look at, and adds a unique taunt. The plushies sold award gold skins and are cool to look at. I even used the Orcane plushie to help teach a lesson about volume to elementary schoolers. The only real complaint I have about skins is that some are hard to come by, such as Twitch Absa and Excalibur Zetterburn, and in the case of the Gameboy Early Access skins, no longer available to get.

Rivals of Aether is the first indie game I've ever bought. Ever.

Unfortunately, one thing that stuck out so very much to me was the community. The way newbie players are matched with people with hundreds of hours. This is an issue with some other games, and usually ended up with an extremely limited community that has a toxicity equivalent to or greater than League Of Legends and are all exceptionally skilled to the point where new players are immediately turned off. (See titanfall 2.)

There are some neat solo modes though, they're pretty fun. AI is a bit wonky but it's pretty good without being too easy or too difficult.

First time: Some friends turned it on during out weekly Smash Bros night. They completely destroyed me and I had no idea what I was doing. Thought it was really hard and my pride was wounded.

Second time: Downloaded a demo on Xbox and played with a different friend who'd never played it. He beat me almost every time. Pride wounded even more.

In the meantime: Purchased and played through Ori and the Blind Forest (10/10 by the way, beautiful game and a must-have)

Third time: Friends decided to turn it on again for Smash Bros night. I chose Ori and started wiping the floor with KO's and actually won a few times. Turns out they did a freakishly good job of replicating Ori's playstyle in this game. I think I succesfully performed more spikes in those three hours than I think I've ever done in my entire Smash Bros career in the same amount of time played. I was good enough that my friend, who leads the weekly event, told me he's not sure that Clairen is his main anymore after going up against me as Ori and that I'm officially a contender for the crown with Rivals of Aether.

On my third time playing it. 

Ever.

All because I played Ori and the Blind Forest between games. That's how good the devs did with her.

The tutorials on this game are great too, they explicity explain the mechanics of the game, basic tutorials, and in depth character by character tutorials. You can pick this game up and know how to play it in 5 minutes, yet there's a depth to the mechanics that will take you a long time to master.

Expect a learning curve if you want to get competetive online, but the solo modes are fun to play too. Just grab a friend and convince them to play if you want a noobie on your level to spar with.

10,Rivals of Aether,34393403,english,"Update: The roster expands. My point about the roster is now rather irrelevant.

So I've been meaning to pick this game up for a while, finally got around to it. It's pretty damn good.

At this point, you probably know what it is. It's a Smash-Like game with some nice pixel art, catchy
music, and elemental animal-like characters instead of guest characters like Smash.

What's good?
-It looks awesome.
-The music is pretty catchy.
-All the characters are fun and interesting to play, and feel relatively well balanced.
-Gameplay is enough like Smash to feel familiar, but unique enough to feel refreshing.
The combos in this particular game are very fun and solid feeling to string together, and
there's a good enough balance between power and speed to make each character feel like
they have a good variety of options. Plus, there are a few major differences to Smash, namely,
no blocking, but instead you can parry, to temporarily slow your enemy for counter attacks.
-Though it's nothing major, there's a little story for each character with some nice artwork to boot,
an Abyss mode to challenge for fun that you can do with a friend, and local multiplayer of course
is always a blast with a good friend or two.
-Nice little features such as custom colour palettes for each character.

What's eh?
-The roster is not huge like the recent Smash titles. At present, we see 8 playable characters, which is fine, because it means each character has a good variety of ways to play and there isn't many balance issues from a normal players perspective. However, for those who like large character
rosters, this isn't the title, even with two more characters coming.
-The story mode won't last you long (I beat the entire thing casually in around half an hour), and the Abyss Mode gets stale after a bit because it's a lot of the same repeated challenges. These
aside, you have your standard normal and online matches, which are fun, but not particularly deep for those looking for variety.
-For whatever reason, you now need to buy non-base characters with an easy to obtain in-game
currency. This presents no challenge as the money comes from practically every mode and is plentiful, but it seems unneccessary, and some of the alternate stages you can buy feel unneccessarily barred.
-Online play is kinda hit or miss. To my understanding, it's a p2p connection, so sometimes it's great, other times it's terrible, and apperantely it's hard to find matches sometimes with just random searches.
Overall?
An awesome game, in my opinion, the best Smash like game on PC emulation. It's an absolute blast
to play once you get the hang of it, with satisfying combos and cool characters. It's best played with friends locally, and though the single player isn't particularly big, it's a bit of fun for a short while.

+ Good music

+ it has very good stages

+ A competetive Smash Bros. for PC
+ has a great community 
+ Developers are still listening to our feedback and doing community livestreams every week 
+ custom skins and dlc if you want to buy it
+ runs very well and rarely any frame drops 
+ has a story mode 
+ The graphics are quite good for a pixelated game
+ Really balanced

-CONS
- Has only a few characters for the base game 
- only a few stages 
- Not too much content for the very casual players
- Skill ceiling is not the highest but better players will still win
- DlC can get kind of expensive 
- achievements can be EXTREMELY difficult to get (I had to get top 500 in story mode leaderboards to get an achievement)
- A too small of community

It's in the perfect level where it has more technicality than Smash 4, but is easy to pick up without spending hours upon hours playing like you do in Melee.

The game's really fun and all the characters are supprisingly unique.  I think all the characters are balanced in their own respect.  The graphics are beautiful and easy to run.  I do wish, however, that the game would (when queueing in casual) allow you to turn on/off selective match making.  For example you could check a box off on whether or not you want players to be around your skill level or not.  And this could be rather difficult to do unless you're playing ranked but the game can be hard on new players if they do not have a friend to pratice with because it is very likely that you're put into a game with extremely varying skill level players.  Overall the game is great.  But unless you intend to play with friends, I dont think this game is all that great of an enviroment for casual players.

87,Rivals of Aether,40405055,english,"Rivals of Aether has been on my radar for a long time and when i finally got around to trying it, it didn't disappoint. A mixup of technical skill and gameplay similar to the Super Smash Brothers series is what really brought this game home. Wave dashing, Directional influence, Teching, and Fast falling are all found in Rivals and it gives the game an even higher learning curve than other fighters. Althought this is true, Rivals lacks a deep defensive game found in other fighters, in favor of a more combo heavy and offensive based game. This forces newer players to figure out what their opponents want to do in the neutral before they get run down by better and more experienced players. It also means that newer players will have a lot more games where they get smashed 2-0'd before they even get a single victory. This maybe frustrating, but in the end it is worth it because when they finally connect the dots and become more experienced players they will be able to see through a players strategy and counter effectively.

Theres a great cast of characters each with their own unique mechanics and it really brings the game together. My favorite character is Clairen (DLC CHARACTER), A sword wielding panther, whose unique mechanic is a tipper edge on her sword. Similar to Marth from the super smash brother series, Clairen uses great spacing in order to land her tipper attacks which lead into an insane combo game. Whenever her tipper lands the opponent recieves heavy hit stun allowing Clairen to combo into moves that wouldn't have landed if she hit with a weaker part of her sword. The range of her attacks forces enemies to find other ways to approach and it is Clairen's job to punish those alternate approaches. She counters ranged approaches with her down special, a counter that activates a force field which blocks all projectiles thrown into it.

The problems with the game lie in its' single player modes. The story lacks depth and is really short in comparison to games like Brawl's Sub Space Emissary. Although it does show the player the relationship between each region and the characters that come from them, but even that is short clips and pictures of one thing that each character manages to figure out as they fight their way to the final boss. The final boss is pretty cool but its un clear why he attacks the people of the aether and the ending is rather abrupt as they just roll the credits right after.",1519612158,1519612158,TRUE,2,0,0.531724989,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,39,6,628,0,604,1587674956

4,Rivals of Aether,40091867,english,"I only have about 10 minutes of experience on this game so take it with a grain of salt. This is not a bad game, in fact I would argue its on the right track. But there are a few issues with it. First off the controls for a Keyboard player are god awful. Its like they only thought players with a controller would play it (and thats what you should play it with). Instead of having the controls be user freindly like (I know these are two different genres of games) a First Person Shooter, FPS, this games wants the keyboard player to strain their brain and their hands to remember the controls. A simple way to fix this would to map the movement controls to the left hand, it would look something like this:

A=Move right
D= Move left
S= Duck/ crouch
W= jump
R= Run
E= Dodge

So on and so forthe. The devs could also map some controls to the mouse as well to make the gaming even easier and less confusing to a keyboard player. it could look something like this (use these along with the controls above):

Left click= Attack
Right click= Secondary attack
Mouse movement= Looking in that direction

The game devs should take this into consideration and hopefully make this a more enjoyable game. 
Now just because the controls aren't the greatest does not mean its a bad game. In fact the music is catchy and frankly it sounds pretty great. The charcter sprite are well crafted but some work can be done. The tutorial was well made, but perhaps the AI in the Defense and Offense sections of the tutorial could be a little easier to fight. The player has about 2 seconds to respond before being blasted into another dimension.

With all of this in mind its important to remember that new comers wont have a controler, wether its a gamecube, X-box, PS4, or any other hodge bodge thing a player can use.

PROS:

- Once you put in a little time, gameplay feels amazing.

- The pixel art is GORGEOUS. Plus the simple style makes all of the info on screen really clean and easy to interpret

- Sick soundtrack

- Great tutorial and supportive community can help you get past the initiation phase, where everyone online rocks ur socks.

- The devs are super supportive / active in the community and have worked really hard to add a lot of nice touches to the game.

- Tech skill is more accessible to beginners than any of the actual smash titles (because in the actual smash games, tech skills, ie. wavedashing, L-cancelling, etc., are things that players have figured out how to do but were never really intended by the devs, whereas in rivals, tech skills are baked into the design and have much clearer animations and inputs)

- At the same time, high-level play in rivals is so much more varied and fun to watch than traditional smash games. Part of this is probably the fact that the Rivals meta is still underdeveloped, so people haven't figured out what the optimal strategy for each character is. But at the same time, the game is designed to give each character a lot of options so it could be years and years until the meta really cements in any significant way.

- Characters have really intentional moveset designs, where all abilities work together to create a kit that can be played in a lot of different ways. In standard smash games, a lot of character designs feel similar and a lot of moves are either useless at a competitive level or are just a variation on ""wind up and do a big hit"".

- Smaller roster means that each character feels super unique and powerful in their own way. No real dead-weight, low-tier characters like you have in other smash games.


CONS:

- If you're actively looking for a non-competitive experience then this probably isn't for you. Although I wasn't looking for a competive experience when I started playing and I ended up finding one that I love.

- Initial learning curve is rough (but keep playing, do the tutorials and check out the community on discord / reddit and you'll be fine)


TL;DR: If you're into any Smash game or other Smash-like: get this instead, it's better. If you're more interested in watching competitive Smash than playing it, start watching Rivals :)",1518189037,1518189037,TRUE,2,0,0.529627383,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,54,1,49880,6,17642,1600965438
17,Rivals of Aether,39036054,english,"Rivals of Aether is a Smash clone that accurately replicates its core mechanics while making some alterations that still sets it apart from its predecessors. This review covers the game from the perspective of a semi-competent Smash player.

Movement is integral to any fighting game and Rivals has been able to take what made Melee's movement great and use it for itself. It's fluid and responsive and retains tech like dash-dancing and wavedashing which increase the skill ceiling. It gives the player snappy control over their character and doesn't have an excess of turn animations like Smash 4 which give the movement a sluggish feel at times. Those who enjoy Melee's movement should find Rivals to be to their tastes.

Combat at its core is the same as Smash aside from two main changes: the replacement of shields with a parry and the removal of the ledge mechanic. These changes are not necessarily bad but simply alter how the game is played. The roster while small is varied and each has their own playstyle with some familiar moves returning from Smash. The character balance is well done with no character feeling unviable unlike what often occurs in Smash titles. This is due to each character having a balanced kit with none having a crippling weakness such as being completely outclassed in frame data or range. Perhaps an advantage of a small roster is that there is enough space to have different feeling characters without resorting to gimmicks to differentiate new characters. 

The game's singleplayer content features an arcade mode style story which is I believe is fine considering most players will be looking for a competitive experience rather than story. It also features Abyss mode which pits the player against waves of weak enemies. More importantly, the game includes a tutorial that will teach players important tech skill in the game. Despite Smash's reputation as a casual game that is easy to pick up, many players are actually unaware of its deeper mechanics. The game features remappable controls along with other general quality of life features such as forcing results screen skip. Bots are available to the player at various levels of competency, however like most games, these bots don't play like humans do and are prone to taking unrealistic actions which can lead to developing bad habits which only work against bots and not human players.

The game supports up to four players but only in specific configurations online due to how the P2P connection works only allowing communication between two systems. Full four player FFA and teams works offline as expected but online is either 1v1 or 2v2 with two players at each system. Finally, online matchmaking. I live in Australia and have never connected with someone that has less than 250ms ping making matchmaking practically impossible. If you live in a low population area, be prepared to drag your friends over into the game if you don't want to be stuck playing against bots.

I bought this game the moment it got greenlit for full price in early access and now I have to pay for a quintisential part of the game? for real??? My fellow gamers we are on a slippery slope with everything having DLC and lootboxes attached to our games.  There was a time when a game came with everything.  I want to make it perfectly clear I don't mind paying for DLC if I think it is warranted.  I draw the line when I feel that key parts of the game get cut out and sold off for additional peices.  It is in my honest opinion a dishonest practice.  I will pay the full price required for a dev to make all parts of the game.  I actually believe that game prices need to be bumped to offset inflation and the growing cost to develop a game.

(yeah we exist) and another problem i have is the connection issues that ive seen everyone i know face with this game, its truly a problem. the gameplay is relatively slow and the recovery frames from anything isnt helping. the learning curve is as steep as a wall and the story difficulty scaling isnt exactly a handle. but ive played this game for about 15 minutes if not less so take my review with a spoonful of salt. ill probably make another review when i ""git gud"" at technical fighters and remap my buttons and try the controls to their default state.",1518016638,1518016638,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,21,3,53,0,14,1518371054

For one, it's very possible to be good at this game with a keyboard, but there's a threshold for keyboard users that cannot be passed and hinders gameplay. Once you hit a certain skill level, a controller is almost mandatory. Another is that for some reason--even though I'm sure my opponent and I both have good internet--I can rarely find a match with less than 100 ping, and it only happens in this game (yes, we're in the same region). My biggest complaint is that this game can be far too competitive. Even in exhibition matches, I can't ever find someone on par with me, it's always someone way better. While it doesn't bother me that much, and I know I'll most likely one day become one of those ""tryhards"", I can see how it can ruin the experience for a newer player like me.

42,Rivals of Aether,39664783,english,"Hi welcome to a bad players review of Rivals of Aether. TlDr:Good game not everyone made for ""competitive players"" with fast reflexs and good ping.

Pros:
1) Can be alot more rewarding and interesting to do combos.
2) A pretty big community of people who play.
3) Interesting characters and movesets with some background Lore.
4) Custom Colors and a couple of Skins free and not.

Cons:
1) As with most fighters hard to get into takes alot of time and mental skill to have fun expect playing for about 200 hours+.
2) Peer to Peer can make or break a game in this case its break because alot of people wont play past 120 ping as it affects the viability of specific characters.
3) This one hurts me to say as I left Bh cause of this but unfortunatly quite a bit of the community is toxic and unaware of it or simply doesnt care all fighters apply to this really but it goes a bit like: in judging others they became as toxic as the people they were judging for it. *im going to get hate for this one ;)*
4) Rivals of Aether is not really a good game to play with friends due to the skillgap and ping to be able to play.
5) The last point segways into without friends this game can be torture really when no ones nice enough to play games with a inexperienced player.
6) Questionable balance I am aware that its ""fair"" at top level play but what of the future? well some characters really make getting into this game awful for a player without friends for example i usually make it a rule to never leave in a fighting game but I honestly cant stand Rannos bubble/Tongue it kills the games pace completely and is more of a 1 sided move. another example is zetterburn which is a noob stomper I can actually deal with him since he just KOs early but I could easily see zetterburn being the reason this game wont get much bigger due to how traumatising he can be.

Overall: I really did want to rate this positive but the games flaws overshadow the game to much and before you tell me a mentor can fix the bad player problem it really doesn't just like how school does not mean everyone graduates and gets a nice job theres bound to be people who simple wont get better by being told how to play and thats where mentoring fails it only gets positive reviews never negative because the negative have allready quit the game also seems the paid dlc is imploding the community truthfully paying for characters could be much worse so theres that I think paid characters is fine. Also at the time of writing game does not support any more then 1 vs 1 online which kills it for our group.

Update:
1)Character Wise this was written around the time Slyvanos is announced.
2)Gameplay Wise I still am play Rivals to confirm this review and still convinced this game is just not good for getting into when all that happens is a demoralising loss in game and of time hoping to get better when it never happens reasonably.",1517085934,1517462792,FALSE,8,0,0.542899191,1,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,370,6,8780,0,8154,1595399371

also ori and ranno are too fun and you should buy the game just to play as them even though they're dlc, it's super worth

If you like melee and are looking for a game that is basically melee for you to play when you're not playing melee, or if you like melee and just can't get all the advanced tech of a character like fox down, this is definitely a game to look at. The game even has full tutorials that are 100% optional and a story mode to teach you all of the inner mechanics and workings of the game. Very accessible, easy to pick up, and although some characters are locked as DLC I feel as though $5 for a full character that deepens the game by possibly giving some weaker characters favorable matchups or being one of the few characters able to knock top tiers off their throne, hell even as far as just making a solid character with no real favorable matchups while still not being too weak to anything, is completely fine. With more characters like Sylvanos just being revealed at Genesis 5 two days ago at the time of writing this.

Coming from a melee scrub who mains Falco and secondaries Sheik, if you are coming into this game from Smash here are some recommendations I have for characters to start with based on your main:

Zetterburn - Fox/Wolf/Falco
Wrastor - Jigglypuff/Luigi/Meta Knight/Captain Falcon/MAYBE Falco
Absa - Pikachu/Mewtwo/Ness/Lucas/Zelda
Etalus - Bowser
Forsburn - Link/Ice Climbers/Bowser Jr/Captain Falcon/Wario
Kragg - Donkey Kong/King Dedede/Pac-Man/Robin
Orcane - Squirtle/Ivysaur/Duck Hunt/Mega Man
Maypul - Yoshi/Zero Suit Samus/Bayonetta/Fox/Sheik
Ranno - Sheik/Greninja/Falco/Captain Falcon/Wii Fit Trainer

Do consider this game has more of a competitive aspect to it, and that may make people shy away from it. All that being said, this is a very mechanically fluid game. Another thing that is a plus is that every character feels like they're great in some way, although some would argue that there are better characters than others. I personally never felt like this was the case.

The pixel asthetic is fantastic, and really reminds me of the GBA days. The music is incredible, with every song being memorable in their own way. This game even comes with a mode that allows you to customize the color of your favorite characters, which is something I wish more games did. 

If you're looking for a casual game, it does have a story mode and abyss mode (which pits you against back to back mini challenges like beat 15 weak opponents and destroy certain objects.) Outside of that, I wouldn't necessarily recommend this game to one that wants to play it casually. However, if you want a game that plays a lot like Super Smash Bros. Melee that has an incredible community and a great dev team updating the game, I definitely recommend this game. It's so much fun to play.

Rivals of Aether is a fighting game similar to Smash in many ways, although different in enough ways to create an experience that's subjectively better than it's inspiration.

While the roster is fairly small, the characters that are there fall under a lot of the major playstyles that people tend to use. There's Wrastor, and aerial acrobat with a quadruple jump and air-based moves and smash attacks, Orcane, a wily waterbeast with the ability to create puddles and use them to teleport or power up his smashes, Kragg, a rolling rock-monster with the ability to create barriers and throw rocks at his enemies, and a whole bunch of other creative characters.

If you played Super Smash Brothers Melee, and played it online countless of times with really skilled players this game is for you.


But for anyone in the casual side, the ones who loved playing Smash Brothers Brawl, even for all of its flaws, this game is not for you. I know this cause i am one of those people. This game personaly i did not like , but i can understand why people love it. In any case i canot recoment this game at all sadly because i am quite unhappy with its lack of extras.

The game features a story mode , a single player endless arena, and a ofline mode with stage hazards. This is all in single player curently. But in the multiplayer there is 2 game modes to choose from , Play for rank, Or play for practicing to get good at getting a higher rank. This is what bothered me , I went into this game expecting a mode so i can play against 4 people online and let the stage just screw us over or some strange item to all get us killed, But there wasent. For the community (witch seems to be strictly competative) they love that theres nothing more than fight for glory and nothing else. But for me I find this more tedious and borring the more i try to master these mechanics but fail due to my incompidence. 

I cant recomend this game because it fails to meet my expectations of just having fun, but this is probably cause i wasent the target audience, for anyone else that loves this style of game, this is for you and i know youll enjoy it.

I had the unfortunate luck of jumping right under the drone, which put me in an infinite loop of knockback, with no room for tech-rolling or any move whatsoever.  I suggest all avoid doing such as I did when you come to that segment.

Great Game though.",1515124481,1515124481,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,59,1,370,0,359,1515296140

Cons:
- Online games need improvements, I get 200+ms players connecting
- Option menu improvements needed, mostly around the visual tabs

Overall: 6.5/10
Must-Solve Problem: Server connection makes the whole game feel like trash, this game requires certain level of timing accuracy and the network just put it into the garbage truck and let it run away (Mine is AS server, others should be fine).

Online is really hard to play not because of the game's complexity (You can definitely play Melee on Netplay and the complexity is kinda the same) but because it's really hard to find a match outside a big region, so you can't actually enjoy the competition this game is trying to create unless you're from said big regions. Singleplayer has barely any content, that added to the fact the roster is pretty small and getting the DLC characters is super close to buying the game again, and before you say it's pretty cheap and complaining about this means you're broke, think there are more countries and realities than US/EU.

And before you say my opinion sucks because I only invested 8.6hrs into the game, I'll say I've invested way more time in the game this is based on (Melee, another game that I wouldn't recommend unless you have people to play with) and I didn't feel the same motivation to keep investing time, specially with characters behind a paywall (idc if they're not ""top tier"", it's still matchups you have to learn and understand otherwise you'll get cheesed) which also was one of the reasons I grew tired of Smash 4. I'll now just add my personal impression here when it comes to mechanics, I completely dislike the way the game limits your defensive options (parry instead of shield, I know they had to deviate from Smash in some way but try parrying something consistently with +160ms) and some mechanics just feel off for me (no ledge grab + being able to use another recovery special after touching the wall). Also I find some character design to be pretty questionable, but that's an opinion so personal it doesn't weigh on the review that much as the other points.

The controls are fine, not horrible. And I find the little campaign to be... okay, but they could add to it with other character stories; such as the icebear or goat characters. I mean, give us more than just the character and a stage out of that $5. 

You earn in-game currency but don't worry, you only have to buy 2 characters in game, the other 3 are DLC. I'm okay with Ori costing $5 because Ori is a character from a well known game but we just got 8 characters, which feels kinda small. One gripe I kinda do want to point out is that the stages feel small. 

This game is great for those who want to play something competitive and it has a good few characters. The best I can compare this game to is the OG Smash for the Nintendo 64, which this game surpasses in a great way when it comes to balance. But, at the least the first game gave us 12 characters (four you get from playing the game).

After playing it and giving it a chance my skepticism was completely washed away. I love the way the game has unique stage control options (related to the chartacters element) which really makes the game unique and adds depth to gameplay and gives Rivals its own feel and soul to make it stand out from other games in the genre (namely Melee).

It has everything a casual and competitive player needs, though I wish the individial character tutorials and advanced tutorials were more specific sometimes or would say what common incorrect inputs would look like so you know if you need to slow down or speed up the time in between your inputs.

Anyways back to the review. This game is awesome, The story has an interest history for each character. Every character has unique abilities and style. The gameplay is very fluid and fast kind of like Smash Bros. The netcode is very good in the game, the only time that they are bad is depending where anyone lives like far away. The downsides that your controls don't save. This is bad because I prefer to have tap jump on the joystick. I set the tap jump to the controls and enjoy. The next time I booted the game and go to online, I was wondering why I can't jump. So I went back and restarted to default. It's not good that the fact they always restart you controls everytime you start up the game, and always have to remember to change it before you go online. Also, the game only supports 2 players locally (unless if it's in teams) is not good. Sometimes, you wanna play with your friends and beat them up in a 4 player free for all, you cannot do that in Rivals of Aether, if you want a 4 player match, you have to go in teams.

25,Rivals of Aether,32332935,english,"This game is amazing, I love it a lot. But there are too many problems with it for me to reccomend it. Let's start with the pros.

PROS
+ (MOSTLY) Balanced character roster
+ Beautiful stage design
+ Very good controls
+ Satisfying to play

However, here starts a long list of cons with the game that I REALLY hope the devs fix.

CONS
- Roughly a quarter of the characters are locked behind a paywall. (AND THERE ARE STILL MORE TO COME TO A POINT WHERE NEARLY HALF THE CHARACTERS ARE)
- Clairen (One of these said DLC characters) is far too good. (However a couple of nerfs did happen, we will see how that goes)
- Cannot access Aether Mode (Essentially Non-Omega stages) stages in friendly matches.
- Cannot invite more than 1 person into a match.
- Story is extremely short
- Connection to games is awful
- Matchmaking is awful
- Customisation for keyboard controls are very limited

This game has amazing potential of being fantastic, but there are too many problems weighing it down. If the developers started actually fixing their game and stop making paid dlc characters, then this game will be absolutely incredible. But in it's current state, do not buy this game unless if you want to pay an extra $10 for the rest of the roster and only play locally with your friends.

Rather in a 2d platformer fighting game, or in any fighting game, I believe that all characters should be playable upon purchase (whether that changes the price of this game, which it most likely would, doesn't matter to me), so all players have the same set of characters to choose from when playing in an online competitive system and don't feel forced to spend money to get a character who is significantly stronger, but locked behind a monetary wall.  Regardless of your opinion on the game itself, I feel that Overwatch's system of free content and  micro transactions for skins is the best way to handle things (although loot boxes aren't necessary, just let people buy the skins).

TL,DR: I think it's easy to pick up even for non Smash players and you will have a blast learning how to play it.

67,Rivals of Aether,37619517,english,"If you're like me, then you found this game because you wanted to play a fighting game that's similar to Smash. Well ya found it. The only game in my opinion (and to my knowledge) that recreates the platform fighter formula and executes it well, so well. The mechanics are more leaning towards Melee in terms of frame data and tech (ie wavedashing) but if your familiar with Smash games in general then Rivals will definitely feel natural to you after the first couple matches. The terminology is also very similar like when playing through the tutorial, it will explain arials as Up-Air, F-air, Down-Air etc

The only gripe I have with the gameplay is that there is no shielding/blocking. It's instead been replaced with the mechanic of Parrying. Pretty much a counter. I understand the reason behind that switch which is to reduce camping and speed up gameplay/matches, which is okay. I respect it.

So if you want to play a more balanced game similar to Smash Bros. Then this is definitely the game for you.

72,Rivals of Aether,37587257,english,"Rivals of Aether is a platform fighter, much like Super Smash Brothers or Brawlhalla(among others). If you enjoy those games, especially if you enjoy the high skill ceiling they have, pick up Rivals. It's made by a small, dedicated team of individuals who continually update their game, and are incredibly involved with their community, both in the casual, and the competitive scenes. Below are my thoughts specifically on Rivals of Aether and what makes it stand out from its ilk. 

Super Smash Brothers has a sort of 'character triangle' when it comes to top-of-casual or low-competitive play. It is most evident in the newest entry of Super Smash Brothers, for the Wii U/3DS. The basic logic is such: 

Reflector > Ranged > Counter > Reflector...

This logic has basis in low-competitive levels ONLY, and is not applicable to higher levels of play. Low-competitive is essentially what you would see in the For Glory mode of this game, generally. Counter-Based characters are beaten out by Ranged as their specials are all but useless when they are being ranged out, but those projectiles are useless against a Reflector-based character. But as Reflector-based characters generally have no or very slow projectiles, they can easily be killed by counter-based characters. Obviously this does not hold true for all characters(Mewtwo, for example, is for all intents and purposes Ranged and Reflector in equal parts), but is a general rule when counterpicking(the act of picking a character more suited to beating your opponent) is concerned. 

Rivals of Aether does not have the same triangle. Every character is every single type, except for a few exceptions. Every character but Clairen and Forsburn have ranged attacks, but the parry(used the same way a spot-dodge is in Smash Brothers, or just by dodging with no directional input on the ground) is both a reflector and a counter, as it stops the enemy if you are hit with a melee attack up close and makes them vulnerable to a strong attack, or sends projectiles back to where they came from if used to block those, while alos granting a small amount of invincibility to help you close the gap and get in a quick hit. There are still metrics for the characters(as Dan Fornace himself put it, there are characters more geared towards rushdown tactics as opposed to spacing, and vice versa), but every character is viable and every character has no obvious counterpicks. This makes Rivals infinitely more interesting to the low-competitive player, and puts an emphasis on predicting your opponents' next move(commonly called 'reading').

Rivals also has much larger amounts of hitstun(the moment when you cannot move or take an action after being hit and launched into the air) than Smash Brothers, allowing for a more fluid and forgiving combo game that values that first hit even more, and not what comes after it as much. As long as you know what direction your opponent will DI(move away after they are hit), you can easily land a follow-up. 

In closing, Rivals of Aether is a heaven for people tired of Super Smash Brothers' limited combo game, tired 'true' combos, and restrictive character balancing. It is much more fluid, fast, and relies more on the players' strength when it comes to reads, as well as creativity in mixing up their approaches and attacks to keep their enemies on their toes. It's made damn well and runs like a dream, and has a lot of Quality-of-life improvements over other fighting games(such as the ability to see how good your connection is with another player exactly BEFORE you enter a match with them. 

Also, Dan Fornace's twitter is amazing. Seriously, look it up.

Or Etalus being able to wear armor once he uses his N-Special on ice. The list goes on and on! My favorite characters to play is Orcane, Zetterburn, Forsburn, Etalus, and Kragg. All 5 of those characters are all fun to play as. The other ones I don't main, like Wrastor, Maypul, and Absa. I don't like to play as them, but that doesn't mean I hate them, infact I kinda like them. (well that can't really said to Absa, :T) 

Moving on from the characters, why not I talk about the controls? The controls are well made, easy to understand, and feels comfortable for me. (I use the keyboard and PS4 controller) nothing much to say about the controls, other than that there great.

I honestly think that the modes are the strongest features (along with the characters) a Smash-Inspired game has ever had, this one has a lot and there all pretty good. Abyss mode is basically multiman brawl, but also a bit of the WarioWare stage? Except it won't time you for 5 seconds.

Bear in mind, this is early access and right now there is not that much to do. Story mode and other things are coming though. Might redo this review as time passes.

But for now this is a fun fighting game and deliberately reminiscent of Super Smash Bros., but has some mentionable differences. Most noticeable for me, theres no Block/Shield. You do have a parry though, which does lock your opponent for a moment if timed properly, but this is only rarely doable online, because right now you have to handle lag and thus input delay. That sucks for a fighting game, but might change in the future

As for the mechanics themselves: The characters feel good and pretty distinguished. Every fighter has his very own style of moving, fighting and using their special attacks. Controls are, mostly, Smash-Bros-ish. There is DI, there is Aerial Dodge and there even is wavedashing, if your into it. Racking up combos does require some skill, but feels very rewarding so far. This game seems to be supposed to be competitive. No items, only a few environmental hazards and skill oriented gameplay. This might turn out to be a great game in the future, if the updates keep coming and the network-issues get resolved.

1. Clarien

I hate the term ""____ is pay to win."" But this is the only instance where this term gets a pass. Clarien is OP. Not because she does lot's of damage, not because she has a tip hit stun, here specials is what suck. You can't look me straight into the eye and say a energy shield that does damage when going out and that you can summon at any time is not OP. She can also punish anything. Miss jab=combo, miss aerial=combo, miss anything=combo.

2. Ping

The ping in most games is so bad. For some reason this game has great ping when playing with a friend miles and miles away, but can't handle someone who may be like 1 mile away. Just why? Most of the matches are unplayable if your ping is bad. 

3. Stereotypes

Now what I mean by this is you'll have this group of people you mostly encounter in online, this includes...
Clarien
Etalus players who make ice platforms and slide across all the time
Books to read
Players who use one combo and only one combo
People who are kinda good with a non-DLC charecter
People who are trying to get better
And finally, people who can't play the game cause of there awful ping... you won't see them often, but I am one so...

Conclusion:
This game is good in play style, creativity, and charecters. But those can't balance out the problems of online play Now you may say to yourself, ""Why not just play offline?"" Because it is so easy to start up combos and there just no fun. Fix Clarien, fix ping, balance out every charecter, and buff Maypul, he just can't stand his own ground anymore.

If you wanna buy it, go ahead. But don't say I didn't warn ya.

7,Rivals of Aether,36028747,english,"Rivals of Aether’s greatest success was speaking to the young, imaginative child I once was. I recall fondly many instances in my youth when I was brimming with love for and inspiration from wild characters I would see in cartoons or video games. Many afternoons were spent playing pretend, as I embodied a righteous warrior of some kind with spectacular abilities only my youthful and energetic brain could visualize.

This game’s roster feels like an extension of that creativity, as if I, as a young child, were asked to come up with ideas for new and inventive characters. To what source of inspiration would I have defaulted? Clearly I would have put animals and the very elements of nature themselves together into a brawl so epic only I could truly appreciate the awesomeness and majesty of this clash.

Thankfully, Rivals of Aether had more care and work go into making it a good game, rather than smashing two cool ideas together and calling it a day. Of note is how each character finds a successful balance between feeling both fresh and familiar. I can liken certain moves to SSB characters and see their implementation in my mind’s eye, as I’ve seen and performed them myself countless times. But the way these abilities and character designs are remixed give this game a life all its own.

As a fighting game, Rivals of Aether’s endgame is the quest to achieve mastery of the game’s system or a particular character. So while I did not achieve mastery of any character, I did try out all of the game’s available modes. I have played a healthy amount of time as each and every character on the roster, both in the required sections of the story mode and in both local and online multiplayer. When I tried playing online, I got my ass kicked, hard. However, I think that goes to show more how technical this game can be, offering pros and newbies alike an experience that can be enjoyable, whether your goal is to play casually or competitively.

As a game trying to use SSB as a jumping off point, I think Rivals of Aether succeeds fairly well. Although I am constantly aware that I am playing what is tantamount to a “smash clone”, the uniqueness of this game’s roster and willingness to cultivate precise and fun systems shows that it has potential as more than just a SSB style game. The inclusion of in-game training tools also shows that the developer is willing to take a good idea and sharpen it to its perfect form.

For anyone with a SSB itch on the PC or console, I highly recommend this game.

42,Rivals of Aether,35892120,english,"This game has great potential, but I'm worried about their current business model.  That direction being releasing new characters as paid DLC when they only have a roster of 8 characters.  Super Smash Bros. on the other hand has a full roster of 47 characters already in the base game plus 7 DLC characters.  I give Ori a pass as a DLC as he is from another property and I love the original game, but realeasing two new original characters as paid DLC when your roster hasn't even broken ten characters yet is a bad business model.  Don't become like the AAA studios where they release a shell of a game and demand more money to get the full product, which is what you're doing here.  I view this game as the SSB people go to if they don't want to buy a wii u plus the game, but with the direction you're going Dan Fornance, I think the wii u will become the cheaper option.  Anyway, those are my words of warning.  

If you want my opinion on this game so far, it's great, if you play at 10-20 minute intervals vs. the AI.  Only played pvp a few times because server lag was terrible (dedicate more RAM to your servers, always helps).  However, I do like the game's art-style and soundtrack as it gives the game a retro feel to it.  Each character has a distinct personality to them.  Story mode... needs a bit of work.  One, have a rivial fight someone with purpose, not just dressing each story with fights in-between character's back stories.  Two, cut the one liners, yes I'm looking at you Wrastor.  I just spent an entire fight only to get one line of story before going to the next fight.  Introduce your characters more so they have more impact when you develop the story more. Anyway, keep up the good work, in it's current state I'll give the game a 6/10, which is a bit above average. You have the fighting down, now fix up the story mode a bit and stop releasing new original characters as paid DLC's if you want anyone to come back to your game.  Also fix your servers.

-great music
-has enough original design to make it more than just a clone of smash bros the (the lack of ledge-grabbing in particular is refreshing)
-features a number of options that the smash bros series is sorely lacking, such as custom colors and random character select

CONS
-the game feels terrible when playing online, ie most likely the only time you're playing against other people
-single player modes are very bare
-the parry system is dumb
-with the amount of patches and characters that have yet to be added, the game is essentially still in Early Access
-DLC is overpriced; this is especially apparent when you compared the base game ($15 for 8 characters) to the total cost of each $5 DLC pack for characters that have been released and have yet to be released ($20 for 6 more characters)

Smash 4 feels a bit slow with the lack of attack-canceling mechanics and generally longer end-lag on many actions.

For a time, Project M (a competitive brawl mod) was similar to melee but a bit more well-rounded and more fun for your average player. A C&D letter from Nintendo's lawyers shut down development.

This game lacks ledge grabbing and smash directional influence, and it really shows.

Edit: The game does have normal DI, but SDI as it is In Brawl/Smash4 lets you move all over the place when hit by a smartbomb, but while fighting this game's boss and getting hit by its similar multi-hit black hole attack, I was only able to very slightly inch a pixel at a time. Overall it felt like I had no control.

If you're not sure what I mean by SDI, skip to 2:41
https://youtu.be/UIdyVK1aDtg?t=2m41s

The existence of this kind of quirky movement helps you feel like you have more control over what's happening, even if it's not doing much, this is part of the game feel in being able to wiggle around even while in hitstun.

In any case, weak SDI isn't the worst problem here - there's no ledge grabbing and many of the up-specials (the ones that general are your main recovery tool in SSB games) are rather bad for recovery.

I'm constantly frustrated by scenarios I keep expecting to survive, [b]which overall makes this game feel inferior to real smash games.[/b]

In other words, you'll die to a lot of situations where it feels you've lost complete control of your character.

Don't think it's important? Going for a more ""competitive"" or ""pro"" fighting design?

Skip to 1:57
https://youtu.be/IwdekoJb3I8

In this case, the game has double jump, but the lack of ledge grab just has you dying in lots of stupid ways you could be recovering from if you were playing Smash 4 instead.

On top of that, a lot of the recovery abilities (equivalents of up-specials in SSB) are rather difficult to use in a pinch when you need them most. Aside from not being able to ledge grab, some of them require a bit of ""pre-planning"". This would be the dolphin's puddle that needs to be placed before you fall (and can disappear/be destroyed), or the maypul's leaf on the enemy that is needed for him to lasso onto the enemy who needs to be close by or unobstructed for you to be able to recover.

Not all of the up-specials give you upwards movement. In Brawl, almost every character at least had an upwards movement with their up-special, even if it was meant to be a ""heavy"" character or one that doesn't exactly have much ""verticality"". In SSB, the only characters who didn't inherent upwards movement were Ness and Lucas, but their up-specials could still be used in a pinch without any prior setup, so they're still better than what Orcane and Maypul have.

Even Ivysaur and Omar, whose up-specials are ledge grabbing lassos, still actually give them a little bit of satisfying upwards momentum, which helps the player feel in control, rather than helpless, even while falling off the map.

In its place, the game does have a walljump up-special system which technically does let you do more, as walljumps refresh your up-special, but this is far less intuitive and requires dipping into the tutorial or hearing about it beforehand to know about. This kind of thing will give you a bad first impression if you jump in after playing Smash and expect familiarity in the games mechanics.

I think the game would be vastly improved by improving these three things, because otherwise, it's unplayable to me.

Don't get me wrong, this game does many things right.

- Excellent sprite art.
- Excellent music.
- Excellent game feel. This one is actually the very reason I bought the game after seeing some footage of Clairen - I could tell that this game had very well polished and solid game feel.
- You can emulate SSBB's controls.
- No tripping.
- Second versions of stages without the gimmicks.

I don't plan to refund this game, and do plan to keep up with it in hopes that maybe these things will change.

Well, I'm not particularly hopeful, because I would imagine they've already had criticism about this kind of thing in the past, and that it's been out long enough that anyone playing would probably be used to how it is, but eh. I wouldn't want to keep this unrecommended if things do change.

----

There are good ways and bad ways to make spiritual successors to old games.

Here are examples of good things games have done:

SSBBrawl -> Smash 4
1. They removed tripping
2. They made competitive versions of every map
(Both things Aether has also done)

Team Fortress 2 -> Overwatch
1. Removed weapon switching from most classes, which makes it easier and makes players less likely to fumble.
2. Overwatch improves many systems TF2 has in order to make players knowledgeable of exactly what enemy is going after them, to give them every chance to succeed and have a fair fight.

2. Increased footstep volume, especially of enemy heroes you're weak to. Gives purpose to the normal footsteps TF2 has.

3. Every weapon/hero has unique sounds you can pick out from a distance. This feedback lets you identify enemies easily and know what's coming for you. Overwatch's sound design is said to be good enough that blind players can successfully play overwatch.

Again, an improvement of something that TF2 somewhat does, though it's not as easy to pick out different rocket launchers from each other based on the firing or explosion sounds, some things can be picked out, like shotguns vs rockets vs pipes vs miniguns.

4. Every projectile particle effect and hitscan tracer is unique looking, also allowing you to instantly identify your enemy.

This is something people never think about with the trails on rockets, pipes, and arrows in TF2, and Overwatch applies this concept to its entire set of heroes. It definitely is something that helps people succeed.

5. Auto-callout of enemy sentries/teleporters/stealth characters.

This is simply an improvement of TF2's manual voice chat, turning it into something that ensures these callouts actually get used and get used properly, helping your entire team identify what threats it should be dealing with (like sentries).

Super Mario 64 / Collectathons -> A Hat In Time
1. Improved movement with more recovery options.
2. A camera that's coded not to get stuck with bad camera angles.

----

The point is, these games add things to help the player succeed, be more in control of what's happening to them, and technically, ""make things easier for the sake of more widespread accessibility"".

Now, I know ""dumbing things down"" can be seen as a bad thing for players who want a less hand-holdy challenge, but I would say that all of these games are examples of making these improvements without hurting the main challenge.

The thing is, if you take A Hat In Time for example, if you decide that its movement controls are doing too much stuff for you automatically, that just means A Hat In Time could create more challenging platforming scenarios without frustrating the player, whereas it may have to avoid doing so if the controls themselves were a challenge to use.

Smash 4 and Overwatch are multiplayer games, so fighting humans with the same abilities will always be its own kind of challenge and making the controls easier only means more people will play and the good players will sit that much higher than the skill floor.

And since the skill floor will be lower, you'll have a bigger playerbase that can grow more over time.

More importantly, a lot of these top seller games all have this trait in common, and if you're going for a more punishing type of game, then your game will always just be [b]a niche[/b].",1507992976,1508178501,FALSE,7,2,0.471213967,11,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,192,71,287,0,287,1508176051
92,Rivals of Aether,35770055,english,"Very fun and underrated game. By far the best attempt at a competitive platform fighter outside of Melee and Project M that's out there. 

I'm a competitive smash player and this game is an amazing stress reliever for me. Even if you're not into competitive smash, this game is a lot easier on the hands and more intuitive to pick up and play than those games since a lot of the tech skill from smash isn't there, the only thing you need to learn is wavedashing which is very easy to do in this game since you can just input sideways + airdash at the same time for a shortcut. 

Despite being a much easier game to get into the game still maintains that fast, chaotic, destructive feeling that Melee and PM have and doesn't go to being a slower game like the newer smash bros games are. The skill ceiling is still huge, the combo system is still deep, you can still do a ton with movement.

This is also the only Platform Fighter game (other than Brawlout) that doesn't just rip off smash characters. The characters might take some inspirations here and there, but they all feel like individuals and not just bootleg melee characters. In an aspect I love, all the characters have a mechanic (or even several mechanics) completely unique to them that changes up the gameplay in a big way. I'm going to list a few of them just to show the MMO-like variety available here.

Zetterburn - Specific moves give a burn status that does extra damage over time, burned characters take more knockback from smash attacks
Wrastor - All of his smashes are in the air rather than the ground, one of his moves summons a wind aura that buffs his movement
Etalus - has several moves that coat the ground with ice, this ice coating greatly enhances his wavedash and dash attack length. Several of his specials also have different properties if used on ice, including freezing the opponent and giving Etalus ice armor.

Each of the 9 (soon to be 11 as of tomorrow) characters has something of that variety. The music, aesthetics, and presentation are all also very solid. This game has the potential to create an entire genre, and I wish more titles would follow its passionate example and give us a greater variety of Melee-like games.",1508151793,1508151829,TRUE,1,0,0.525862038,1,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,491,36,3868,6,3355,1601086644
93,Rivals of Aether,35762581,english,"Rivals of Aether is an indie brawler the takes its gameplay mechanics from Nintendo's Super Smash Bros. series, as such this game will feel [i]very[/i] familiar to veterans of the series. Being a long time fan of the Smash series, I was able to pick up and play this game without going through any of the tutorial/practice stages. For newcomers, the controls, mechanics and characters are very easy to learn, but very hard to master which is a very big plus in my book.

The mechanics, as mentioned earlier, are almost directly ripped from the Smash series but with a few changes that have a drastic on how the game is played. For example, Smash fans will notice that there are no shields with them being replaced by the parry system (time the button press before an attack hits you to stun the enemy and counterattack). These are one of the few major changes that make this game familiar to Smash fans as well as help the game stand on its own two feet. Rivals of Aether also takes a few techniques from Melee, such as wavedashing which is an intended mechanic this time around, teching and many more techniques that I won't bother to list.

All of this culminates in a very fresh and enjoyable experience that is fun for both hardcore Smash fans, and newcomers alike, both casual and competitive (though the game caters more so the competitive scene).

However the only very, [i]very[/i] minor gripe I had with the game is the controls which may confuse long time fans as the default controls have three face buttons set to attacks (one for jabs/tilts, one for smash attacks and one for specials), but the controls are configurable and I rebinded my gamepad's face button to the stock standard Smash control setup (two buttons for jump and B and A for jabs/tilts and special moves respectively), so this was only an annoyance for the first few minutes of play.

Overall, I strongly reccomend this game if you're a Smash fan, or a newcomer and are willing to drop 14 bucks on a very well made tribute to the franchise instead of settling for a subpar f2p knockoff (sorry Brawlhalla, but that's how it is ;) ).",1508117710,1508117710,TRUE,2,0,0.504950523,1,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,59,5,4854,626,556,1601877144

Rivals satisfies the Melee itch. 

Obviously some differences in gameplay such as:
-you can still do stuff after air-dodging
-wave dashing is easier (and more fun imo)
-wall jumping
-no shield, instead parry 

The No Shield might be a dealbreaker for some, but I think it just makes makes the gameplay more fast paced and a bit more offense driven. Without a shield, your defense relies on timing, spacing & movement- either parry, or dodge between hits or space away. Not to difficult to adapt to.

Each of the characters have much more depth and uniqueness.
They are well-balanced even with introduction of new character.
Multiplayer is great with a stable connection. Matches usually takes seconds to a minute for me (EU)

Developers also seem great, providing updates.
It would be great to develop the community even further with more players

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
That was my review when the game was on early access, but some things have been added since then like the story mode. The story mode is nice, but its just classic mode with cutscenes, and the characters you fight against aren't even related to the story the game is trying to tell, except for the rival fight at the end. Another mode they added is abyss mode, which is kinda like the Wario Ware games, you have to complete an objective on a time limit, like launching your oppoonent into a portal or killing a cetain amount of enemies, etc. Its pretty fun, and it gets really hard on later waves. This game is also getting DLC characters, the first one being Ori, which i haven't played yet, and to new ones that are coming out pretty soon, Ranno and Clairen, they both look pretty cool. Overall, if you don't mind the small roster, (seriously, even Smash 64 has more characters) and if you like the Smash games (especially melee) you will like this game.

Now, here's the few cons: The online can have a lot of connection problems, anything from input lag, frame lag, or just people who leave their controllers unattended, As well as that, the amount of stages and characters is a bit low, but of course the full game will have 8 characters and 8 stages, so that's nothing permanent.

41,Rivals of Aether,35252900,english,"Rivals takes the foundation of Super Smash Bros. but makes it better. Don't get me wrong, Smash is amazing, but I feel like it sometimes finds it hard to find a good balance between casual and competitive play. Rivals was built to be a competitive fighting game for tournaments, while still having some fun stuff for casuals.

Here are some major perks about this game:
-All of the stages have a ""basic"" and ""Aether"" form. The basic forms have no stage hazards and all of them are tournament legal. Aether stages have hazards and are meant for casual matches. This option is amazing. It is what Smash 4 did with Omega stages but so much better.

-All of the characters are super unique. No two characters feel the same, and all of them feel fresh and new. None feel like they were ripped from Smash or don't feel unique. All of them feel so different from one another and you can't play any two the same way. The cast is also a LOT of fun, no matter who you pick. There is nobody who is boring to play as.

-All of the characters are balanced. All of the characters in this game are extremely well balanced. No character is definitely the best. All of them have their strengths and weaknesses. Plus patches are still being added to balance the cast further.

-It was made for tournament play. There is even a ""tournament mode""  setting in the menu for local play for running tournaments. This mode gives you access to how big the sets will be, such as best of 3 and best of 5. It even shows the player's win count at the top in matches.

-The basic techniques from Super Smash Bros. Melee(Wavedashing and dash dancing) are made a lot more accessible, meaning that you spend more time focusing on learning combos and everything else and not having to spend lots of time learning movement options. It also makes you feel a lot more free and fluid in your movements, which feels amazing.

-The online mode is good. Unlike Smash 4, the online mode in Rivals is good. They are even played in sets instead of individual matches, further giving to the competitive vibe of the game. There are ranked matches, where you will fight players depending on your rank, which goes up or down depending on if you win or lose. Exhibition mode is basically unranked matches which pool all of the players together, no matter your rank or skill. There is also friendly matches, where you can play people on your Steam friend list.

-Great training mode. There are tons of options available to you in the training mode that are not available in Smash. For example, you can turn hitboxes and hurtboxes which are really useful for learning more about your character and testing combos out. You can also turn on frame advancing, which freezes time and lets you do movements on certain frames. There are a bunch of other options too, like changing the computer's DI, teching, action, etc, allowing you to practice all types of stuff.

-Fun single player mode. Unlike Smash 4, I found myself coming back to single player mode of Rivals. There are story modes for each of the six original characters, and I found myself coming back to it to try to beat them in the fastest time possible.

-At the time of this review, they are still adding content! This is what I used to love about Smash 4. Rivals is still getting new characters, stages, skins, patch updates, and features! It definitely keeps you invested in the game and excited for what they will announce next!

So, to conclude my review, you should definitely buy this game, especially if you like Smash or other platform fighters. It is a great fighting game and even surpasses Smash in many areas, in my opinion. It's fun to play both competitively and casually, and you will definitely get a lot of fun out of it, no matter what kind of player you are.",1506564022,1506564064,TRUE,30,1,0.673250318,1,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,50,13,33702,688,9723,1602025001

58,Rivals of Aether,35054713,english,"Game's good, plays like a quite frantic and technical Smash Bros. clone that mashes a little from each entry of that series into itself(obviously with major Melee emphasis in there, what with the wavedashing, fairly quick fall speeds across the board and all that stuff), while also adding its own unique spins(perhaps most notably the lack of proper shields and grabs, being replaced by parries, and the removal of ledges in favour of letting everyone cover ridiculous distance if they get to walljump off the stage). There's few characters, but they're built around unique gimmicks(that often linger on and affect the stage itself and can be used in unique ways by their characters, both to control area as well as amplifying their moves in some way) and fighting styles(many characters borrowing entire chunks of moves from different Smash characters and thus playing like odd hybrids of them) so the roster is quite diverse in spite of that.

Music and overall presentation is great, much better than any comparable game I could think off on Steam, and feels nicely polished. Singleplayer content does its job giving you something to do outside of good ol' PvP and adding some minor world building to the game's setting and characters(nothing big, don't expect an anime fighter worth of plot, just some small bits that add some context to the game beyond ""funny animal people with elemental powers punch each other until one flies off the screen"". It's no grand epic and it doesn't need to be).
The meat of the game is the multiplayer though, which you get to enjoy locally and online. Unfortunately the game's practice/singleplayer modes don't quite feel expansive and elaborate enough to quite get you used to the game I feel, which is a bit of a problem as it is a quite technical fighter all things considered, and due to the game's comparably low(but still acceptably sized) playerbase the majority of the online multiplayer games consist of you playing a lagtastic match with a dude on the moon or getting bodied by a guy that plays like his life depended on it. Gitting gud is a struggle because of that, and you should be prepared for that if you buy this game.

If you land a fully charged strong attack on kragg for instance, it plays a sound seemingly identical to the regular punching sounds. The sounds dont really have any cracking to them, and as such just dont feel powerful. Many sounds are reused as well, which leads me to believe that they intend to fix this as well in the future. As it is the largest of any complaint I could have, I definitely hope so, but an addition that doesn't force the player to lock in their account and controls EVERY SINGLE TIME you start up the game would be appreciated as well. The online play is surprisingly good, but there is always room to improve with that kind of stuff.


Each of the characters feel unique, and have their own kind of gimmick to them. Kragg, my favorite character as of now, for instance has his rock and tower which change the terrain of the stage. All charatcters have some form of zoning and stage control, and that rules. Ori-and sein, the dlc champion, also kind of strikes me in an odd way. For such a small cast it seems odd to have a dlc champ, but its not actually a big deal. My issue with it is that the character feels too good. Not super busted mind you, but similar to zetterburn in that you get a TON of reward from doing some very simple things that require minimal effort. I dont think they should be nerfed to the ground, but I do think some tweaking is in order.

It's got a few gimmicks, including..well, very unorthodox ways to go about attacking and combos with certain characters that wouldn't even remotely be allowed in Smash's gameplay.

Rivals of Aether is slowly gaining characters, and on their website, it showed that we'll be getting a new original Rival after Ori, plus 3 more, so that's 13, 1 more than Smash 64's roster. Well, maybe, who knows? I saw it mentioned in the Ori reveal on their website; maybe it'll even get to Melee's character amount, which would be really cool. The stages are all unique and have pretty much the equivalent of Omega Forms of stages in Sm4sh, built specifically for online play I suppose, or just to duke it out without stage hazards, which are also pretty cool too.

For me, Rivals feels like Melee, but plays a bit like Smash 64 in that it's pretty easy to combo if you know the character you're playing as. Each character plays very different to each other one, but it's pretty easy to tell which you like best. All in all I give it a really positive review in my book.

But in all seriousness, this game is extremely flawed and tries very hard to be a competitive game. This game is beyond fixing to be viable in a competitive sense. It would need massive gameplay overhauls to become a more well balanced game. The attempt to be unique with the removal of shields and grabs just makes the game even more one-dimensional. The dumbed down techskill and the removal of L-Cancelling makes the game much easier to pickup, and appeals to a much larger audience, but that is a bad move when you are catering to a niche-melee audience, who are all obsessed with techskill. But on other hand, it's alright casually, I guess. Not much content to begin with, so all there is to do is a story mode and 1v1s/2v2s online. Not to mention the 8 WHOLE characters, all with their own little gimmicks (Gimmicks do not belong in a fighting game, but I will not get into that).

99,Rivals of Aether,19704597,english,"Had an origial review two years ago, but it didn't do anything for proving how good the game was. So I'm redoing it (not like any of you care, though.)

As it has most likely been stated many times before, Rivals of Aether is a brawler which draws inspiration from the Smash Bros. series. With this, similar mechanics are reflected, mostly from the Melee era, with air dodging being a mechanic as well as wavedashing alongside all the basic Smash Bros. mechanics (apart from grabs).

First of all, the tutorial to this game is a masterpiece. It teaches you the basics as well as some more advanced commands and even some things about specific characters, be it a mechanic that they're based around (Absa cloud, Etalus ice etc.) to a certain move having more uses than one (sweet spots, Etalus Fair). This tutorial gets you set for a brawler aimed at the competitive design of this game perfectly.

Second of all, the characters. As most of you know, there's 9 different characters to choose from (if you're not poor). Every single one of these characters can be played toe to toe with another with enough time put into each. This is one of the main reasons why Rivals has been such an amazing game - the character combo possibilities. Every character revolves around a single mechanic, but they all still have 5 aerials, 4 tilts, jab and a dash attack, so the flexibility of how each character can eliminate a threat is completely up to the player. All in all, each character created is fun to play and master, while newer characters are fun to see how to play them. And most of all, the developers of this game are so in touch with the community, it's insane.

So now I'll go over the developers. These people put so much effort into this game, it's surprising that they even have time to intertwine with the community online and at events at all. The development team is extremely interactive and sociable (at least, from what I've seen - please don't hunt me down for errors Dan) to the point where Dan himself enters his own Rivals competition just for the heck of it. They even go online to prove how to counter certain champs (well, apart from Alpha's Ranno vid, idk whether you've done it before, but I'mma put you in a positive light, dammit) if someone can't understand how.

Finally, the community to this game. Holy heck, this community is luscious. First of all, I have never seen a community for a game so competitive so friendly before (mind me, I haven't really gone into the Smash community very often, so I can't make relations. Jeez, just realised how much this review is filled with a bunch of hollow comments...). These people create guides for characters, are willing to chat abut nearly everything, shake hands after almost every game at an event and even set themselevs up as MENTORS for people to learn characters with so they get better at the game! WHAT KIND OF DEVOTION IS THAT?!

In conclusion, Rivals of Aether is not a 'Melee Rerelease' or a 'Smash Bros. Ripoff'. This game sees Smash Bros. and thinks ""How can I make this better"" by implementing their own ideas and mechanics, giving a funky fresh new experience for all Smash fans, or newcomers, to enjoy. Well one of the ideas apparently was removing grabs, but hey. I ain't complaining.

Also, the reason I didn't go in-depth about stages is coz they're stages. They look cool, they're all fundamentally playable and always going Random doesn't tear your hair out from a particular stage (except Treetop Lodge, but that's just me).

25,Rivals of Aether,34474514,english,"SM4SH RANT! dont worry, review is below it.
I have played smash almost religiously with my friends for years. got better and better at it. then smash 4 came out. i chose my fave. then they savagely nerfed it into unusabilty for reasons unknown (greninja). ok, so i moved back to my previous fave from brawl, lucario. who has the WORST design in smash 4. they made him slower much slower, his moves have awful frame data and damage. his poorly thought out gimmick mechanic is his only saving grace. a character who was supposed to be quick and powerful and supposed to be one of the heavier characters. is one of the weakest, slowest, and most fragile in the series. he was horribly nerfed in his introduction to smash 4 who was then nerfed EVEN MORE because his recovery was ""too good"" which was the point. he was supposed to be sticky and hard to remove so he could make use of his gimmick mechanic which increases the power of his moves based on how much damage he has taken. in brawl, lucario just clicked to my style. and started my pokemon obsession. it hurts to see completely clueless character balancing in a former favorite game. nothing kills a fighting game faster than when all the characters you liked get changed and now you have to tier whore just to keep up with your friends with characters you dont even like. something my friends and i started noticing more and more was that we ONLY favored fast characters and could NEVER knock eachother out without grabbing. we would get to 200+ until a quick nuetral was enough to knock us out. what used to be a game about getting in eachothers heads, learning their style and acting to beat it disappeared. now its about using one of few characters that can combo off of grabs. smash attacks are never used and our fingers never leave the block button and we travel by dodge rolling. any other tactic is outclassed by simply doing that.

RANT OVER!!! REVIEW TIME!
dont let its furry pixilated cover fool you. This game is WAY better than smash competitively. character design and theming are diamond solid. its obvious that a lot of careful thinking went into every little move to give every character their own bread and butter combos and strats. every character has unique mechanics and abilities that you gradually learn from playing teh game and constantly keep your brain working fast while fighting. the downside to that is that there are only 9 fighters. but its safe to choose favorites because they are extremely well balanced with very creative movesets.

gameplay overall is very closely a replica of SSB melee. physics are the same and you can air dodge in any direction once. however, they removed grabs which i think was a good idea after smash 4 became what it is. and it forces you to play mind games and make predictions on your opponent which is what made smash fun in the first place. they also remade the block mechanic into perrying. so instead of turtling an attack by holding block then grabbing. you have to time it like a perfect block but only in that small window will it take effect. no more spamming grab combos after blocking.

now content wise there isnt much here. story mode is short. and abyss mode loops every 15 floors (recomend randomizing the challenges up to the boss creature to make it more interesting.) but honestly if you played smash competitively, then all you really care about is character design and what stage is the flattest, right?

DEVS!!!
for the love of all things smash related. please continue this game. add more content and hopefully more characters. im having pure fun playing ALONE already. this game if it were to grow could become something truly amazing and potentially redeem the smash style fighting games. this game has such huge potential!

Pros:
-Extremely stylized characters with unique abilities
-Thorough tutorials for beginner, intermediate, advanced, and character specific
-Custom skin creation
-Competitive play
-Runs very smoothly (besides some latency issues somewhere along the line)
-Deep lore and story mode for each character
-4 player local play

Cons:
-Small player base leads to small matchmaking pools
-One may only compete with one other player over the internet
-Steep learning curve for those new to the genre

34,Rivals of Aether,34455735,english,"Game was good before it stopped balancing their characters. A good compromise for a smash clone if you're on a low-end PC, but don't get in here and expect learning to be a thing. Matchmaking is just nothing but Ori and Sein (The new pay to win hero. Can do true combos that get you from 0% to 50%.) and Absa. (A hero who can infinitely jab you, shoot lightning bolts from across the entire stage, zip around like pikachu, and float like Mewtwo.)

Everybody is either so good that you can't get them past 50%, or so bad that they fall off the stage more times than they hit you. There is no in between, and no learning curve. Whereas Brawlout has nothing but horrible spammers, and Brawlhalla won't stop breaking the game with new ""features"" that make it 10 times harder to punish passive players, (Which the game mostly consists of.) both of which are learnable and have decent matchmaking. If you have never played Brawlhalla before, you can be confident that if you sit down and play for a while, you'll soon start to see changes in your skill level, because its easy to learn from your mistakes and learn to be a better player. Here, there is no way to improve your skills without going into training mode. And even when you go into training mode, you get a false sense of confidence after finding a few combos, only to be stunlocked by somebody with 5 dollars and a B button ten minutes later.

The most fun heros to play are the first four that came out. I finally found another Kragg main and we kept rematching over and over just to play against another Kragg. That was fun, but the developers decided fun wasn't a part of the game anymore. The newer heros are completely unbalanced and absolutely stomp the older heros. I put hundreds of hours into this game on my girlfriends account and I can say it was fun while it lasted.

I'm gonna start this off with a point that I can't say enough: this game has potential to be a really fun and really good game and I wish steam had a not good but not bad option because that would fit a lot more with what I actually think. However, as of right now I've encountered enough bugs that make the game much less enjoyable in only 20 minutes of playing and make me lean more towards not reccomend than reccomend. 

I hope that in the future these glitches are fixed but for the current build of the game it makes it hard to learn when you can't get past the tutorial because it wont progress. Another thing to note is that the game still is very limited in its content, as right now it only features 1v1 mode with more to come. Again, this is all subject to change and I hope that the future game modes turn out fun. 

Unfortunately, as of right now, the bugs that make its already small amount of content less enjoyable are currently, in my opinion, what stands in the way of this game most right now.

If you like melee GET THIS.
Brawlhalla is too simplified.
Brawlout is kinda shady (imo) and not very balanced.

 It doesnt require frame perfect L cancels, wavedashes, etc. and has a tutorial not only for ALL of the tech, attacking, and survivabiltiy (though its basic) but it also has specialized tutorials for each character. 

Me being one for aesthetics like that there is a way for you to customize each characters skin to what you like color pallet wise. Yes there are special skins (Shine Zetter, Burrito Kragg, 3 on the steam store etc.) these will run you $2-$5, the custom one cost you nothing. The speical skins are for supporting the game tourneys and/or participaring in them.

This game has an amazing practice room, easy (for the most part) tutorials, and even for the totally casual player a story and endless mode which is a lot of fun for a party game. What I think it lacks in is matchmaking which brings me to the next point.

If you play online and keep getting paired with people who 3 stock you they have a great community that is willing to worth with you through discord and MANY tourneys that nearly anyone can join in (MSB Ameture etc).

Pixel graphics are not for everyone but that being the case for me I can still say the game mechanics and gameplay are WELL worth the sacrafice in graphics. NOT TO MENTION I can play this on my on my little shitty I-3 laptop with hardly any lag (Minus maybe 4 Zetters burning the place down)

I have played this game since around the end of 2015 so i have seen it grow and i can say This game is amazing if you are into Competitive fighting games... It has a very active discord and monthly online tournements making it easy for anyone that wants to try it out and get more serious about it. Even with its competitive nature the community is very friendly and helpful not to include Etalus (or George) the Dev One of the most active and responsive developer in any game i have ever seen. He checks the Steam forums frequently and is on the discord and be contacted very easily. With all the positives of this game there are a few problems. At a glance the whole cast can be very OP and that makes it difficult for new comers to jump in and figure things out. How ever there are steps in place to make it easier. There are decent tutorials and The discord server allows people to find people of similar skill and people who are willing to help them learn. Another problem is the small cast how ever they will be adding more and have already announced a new character just a few  months after the whole release. With only 8 characters i find my self having spurts of Bordem(?) so i have to take a break from the game but i can always  come back. You may have noticed i Refer to the discord and the community in general as this game is more a community than just a game. Check out the discord and you can see that very clearly.

48,Rivals of Aether,33821681,english,"While this game does pay some homage to the infamous Smash Bros, this game has done something that most smash clones haven't done, stand from the shadows of its master. Rivals of Aether is a game that I feel like is the game that does all of the right things and I can say doesn't feel like a Smash Bros game. 

With all of that said, I can definitely say that this game has a high learning curve for beginners and people familiar with smash bros. If you're going in thinking you can do all of the stuff you think you can do in this game, well this game will glady and swiftly send you flying into the blast zones upon thinking like that. This game optimizes combos and character familiarization to its prime. Yes, it doesn't have a crazy 58 roster like Smash Bros for the Wii U, but with 8 characters that have its own strengths and weaknesses, I found it easier to learn about every character's strengths and weaknesses with it coming down to putting in the time to play the game. DON'T GET DISCOURAGED, keep it up and you'll do fine. 

Anything that I was messing up on or need some clarity helps out in Local mode where there's a tutorial, story mode and abyss mode that can help you improve. Online allows you to push yourself to the next level. There's so many small things included in this game that makes playing each match enjoyable. From controller calibration, color customization, to ranked matches, and playing your friends online. For a clone, this game is amazing. With Ori coming out this summer, hopefully this will attract more people to play this game.

I would say for its for price, I think its worth it. With 8 characters, online mode, story, training and small subtle things in the game, there's no reason not to pick this up if it appeals to you.

50,Rivals of Aether,30130964,english,"TL;DR: buy this game right now just do it trust me

This game is the best fighting game on the market that is not Super Smash Bros. or Street Fighter, in my opinion. 

While there are not many, the characters all feel completely different and fleshed out, which is helped by the storybook style of the story mode. Additionally, there are no ""clone"" characters, a common practice in fighting games (Fox, Falco). 

The gameplay is pristine and smooth and is an absolute treat no matter what you are doing. If there was ever a game to style gameplay after, it would be Super Smash Bros. Melee, and lucky for us, that's what Dan Fornace did in Rivals of Aether. If you've played any Super Smash Bros. game before (my personal favorite game of all time being Smash 4), you will feel right at home. Many of the characters even pay homage to the Super Smash Bros. series by including some of their moves. You will find that a few of the moves characters have originate from Smash Bros. veterans such as Marth, Fox, Meta Knight, and Mario. I would, however, strongly advise you play with a controller.

In short, I would definitely reccomend this game to anyone, especially fighting game fans. I can't wait to see what the team has in store for us, and I also can't wait for the Ori DLC  that is coming soon.

The online mode is really incomplete. The biggest thing here is that you can only play with one friend, even though the game supports four player slots. It doesn't make any sense. Another thing that bugs me is how there's only one stage selection method (a competitive, stage-banning one).

+Works well with most computers
+One of the only Smash clones that does its job perfectly and excels

-Poor online play in options and connectivity. I don't think I've played a game that lags me so much for playing with players worldwide. Being in an area pretty far from North America where most Rivals players live, I can never get a game with less than 200ms ping. It's extremely aggravating and makes the game's best parts seem inaccessible to me
-The AI enemies can't really be considered too challenging, and the same can be said with the story mode and other areas of the game meant for solo play.  I won't complain too much about this since it's pretty standard for a game in its area though.

[i]Rivals of Aether[/i] is what happens when you take competetive Super Smash Bros. Melee and make it accessible to everyone.

[i]Rivals[/i] is a competetive Platform Fighter (""PlatFighter"") which places extreme emphasis on movement and aggression. Many of the defensive maneuvers from Nintendo's Super Smash Brothers series are absent: you cannot grab ledges, and shields have been replaced with ridiculously strict (1/20th of a second) parries that leave opponents vulnerable. There is virtually NO defense in this game, so professional Smash 4 players need not apply (#ShotsFired).

As of this writing, the game contains eight playable characters, with an additional five to be added to the game before the year is out. They're all extremely different in playstyle, with each character posessing a unique gimmick that can affect the field of battle in some way. Zetterburn ignites his enemies to deal damage over time, Forsburn uses smokescreen and fake copies of himself, Wrastor lives and dies by his combo ability, Etalus can encase himself in ice armor, Kragg is [b]too f*cking versatile[/b] for a heavyweight character, so on and so forth.

If you're going to play this game online - and you really ought to, as the game's A.I. is garbage - then you will need to accept that you're going to get bodied. Like, a lot. I just got bodied three times in a row earlier today. [i]Rivals[/i] is NOT an easy game, and you will need to sink a lot of time into practicing the game if you want to start playing in the online tournaments and earning tournament-exclusive character skins.

Thankfully, the game's online community is generally non-toxic (most of the time), and I've met several incredibly nice people who have helped me improve my Etalus game immensely. There are myriad useful learning resources, such as the [url=https://discord.gg/ZcSNXDC]Rivals of Aether Academy Discord Server[/url], among others. Learning to play competetively can be a long journey, but you won't be alone for any of it.

The game's presentation is... mixed; and I'm not just referring to my personal vendetta against pixel art. Some characters seem to be lacking in animation frames when other characters have plenty of animation frames. The pixel resolution is at least consistient, and very rarely are any of the pixels 'rotated' like in games such as... well, 90% of all pixel art games.

The game's soundtrack is mostly excellent, though it's obvious which tracks were the first tracks composed, as they are only ~45 seconds long compared to later tracks which can be three times as long. My personal favorite track belongs to the Tempest Peak stage: [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne4Y_q1FZOY]Lightning Pandaemonium[/url]. 

The game's Story Mode is... uh... well, it certainly exists. The real meat of the single player content is Abyss Mode, where you can customize your character with overpowered enhancements and take on waves of unique enemies and challenges. It's great fun once your character is fully decked out. There is also a toggleable Developer Mode which lets you customize the game's characters as you see fit.

The game has two major flaws. The first is that the grind to unlock all of the unlockable stages and the second custom color slot for each character is unbearably long, so much so that I resorted to save file editing just to spare myself the grief. The second is the aforementioned character Kragg, who is genuinely far too heavy for a character with the most versatile moveset in the entire game bar none.

So, in conclusion, even though the game is far from perfect, it is nontheless a rewarding experience with a surprisingly level-headed community surrounding it.

There's a lot of depth here to explore like all the different ways Kragg can use his neutral special to wall off his opponent or all the insane ways Orcane can use his puddles to power up his smash attacks. If you like Smash Bros but want original characters, this is definitely the game for you.

But four warnings for those who want to pick it up:
1. There is no ledge grab. This seems small but it's definitely something to get used to for players who are just coming off smash and expect it to play similarly. Also expect to eat a few lives because your recovery came just short. No items too, but that's up to you if it's a good or bad thing.

2. Online has nothing stopping a pro from stomping a newbie. If you go online and you're not ready for it, prepare to be destroyed by someone three times your skill level. 

3. Blast zones are a hell of a lot closer than you think they are, just in general. The game wants you in the center to duke it out or on the side bars sparingly to style on an opponent, you go off screen, you're dead for the most part. No negotiating. The sky hitboxes tend to have the most leeway, but chances are if you're already up there from a juggle, you're not coming back down.

4. If you're fresh off Smash controls, be sure to hit the wrench icon on the character profiles. It can be very jarring to need a seperate button for strong attacks verses tilts or a seperate button to jump. Thankfully before you even hit start there's a great ""test play"" option to make sure everything's in working order before a match.",1499352676,1499352676,TRUE,3,0,0.555555582,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,247,14,1876,30,405,1602071706

6,Rivals of Aether,33206147,english,"On the surface, Rivals is a really fun game. I got it during the summer sale so I could play with my friends and luckily I was able to do that the day I got it. I jumped straight into the story mode to get used to the game. Despite it being blatantly tacked on, the story mode was a good challenge for me who has never owned a Smash Bros game but has played it countless times at friends' and reletives' houses for maybe 10 years. After story mode, I played with a friend who came over to my house and I introduced him to the game and he picked it up pretty quick, given that he plays Smash semi-regularly at home. After an enjoyable couple hours another friend of mine joined online, the friend who suggested I get this game. Strangely we found that you can't actually do a free-for-all online. Luckily you are able to damage your teamates so that worked out fine but the online features lack clarity (like how no one had any clue as to what was going on when picking a stage). Not having game setting customization is fine (to my knowledge; so no fun gamemodes like sudden death) but not having a free-for-all mode or being able to pick your teams is unexcuseable. At this point, I was still having fun but still was learning and decided to actually try the tutorial. Surprisingly, I found the tutorial very helpful and very in-depth even going so far as to tell you how many frames something lasts or needs to be done by and practice mode can show you the hitboxes of you and your attacks. But the more advanced tutorials show how the game wants to be played and I can't deal with that. The game not only teaches you how to play compettitvely like a pro; it expects it and the skill of some randoms I fought online compared to mine or my friends reinforces that idea for me. The tutorials teach you exactly how the game mechanics work and then immediately task you with abusing them before being alowed to continue. The edgeguarding tutorial alone took me around 30 minutes. Whether its true or not, you have to play dirty in this game in order to compete; you can't just get someone to 100% damage, hit them with a power attack, and expect them to die becuase few attacks have any real knockback on them and even then it's kept to a minimum. If you want kills, you have to push them over the edge and pummel them into the abyss yourself until they finally die. I like to fight a fair fight on the stage and I don't edgeguard becuase I'll either feel like a dick or be dead afterwards but this game doesn't facilitate that. There is no honor in this style of fighting. If your in to that, I highly recomend this game, otherwise, don't pick it up unless you are exclusively playing with friends you are comfortable with fighting.

con :
- if you're not getting used with how the command (attack/movement/dodge/etc) works in this game its hard cause some attack really had more delayed after hit animation, and can't move very fast if not used to

- region matchmaking currently is still bad, (maybe most of my region players didnt played this) but still meeting up with people 300 or more pings is just sucks to play

- the sound file of this game is in HTML document not SWF document, in my case, its making the game scenario/animation story lagged in fps really really bad, i thought my computer didnt had the enough requirement for this game but then i noticed it from the sound become buzzing resulting the fps become dropped, i thought this is the problem, considering most game even Tekken can be played really well on my pc with 60fps

pro :
+ the game is simple, not that heavy RAM running game, but still is good with everything
+ lots of combos and movement tb learned and get used to
+ in game money, which lets you buy character without the dlc (hope the update will still become like this, not seperated dlc character)

- Characters: Each character's design helps hint at what their playstyle is, and the color customization is awesome and cool.
- Abyss Mode: While this isn't a 'never-before-seen' mode, it really adds more gameplay to the game. I also thought it was cool how it was implimented with the story, but I won't spoil anything.

Cons:
- Story: The only issue I had with this is that some of the character's stories (cough* Wrastor cough*) felt stretched and short. But the ending makes me feel that there will be more story.
- Characters: I know that this is an indie game, and each character is really unique, but 8 characters for some reason feels too small, especially how you start with only 6 and the other two are paid with in-game currency. (And yes I do know that more characters are coming in updates)
- Stages: Again, I know that it's indie and there is a creative stage for each character, but the paid unlockables take 5 times the amount for a character, and I feel like it should be the other way around since character's typically provide more gameplay time than a stage.

Overall, this title is a great indie game and, in a lot of ways, almost better than smash bros itself.  I highly recommend it, even if the online mode sucks right now.",1498752996,1498752996,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,32,3,1605,64,699,1601474687

It would also help them learn while having fun for hours without too much pressure. Playing exhibition 1 v 1 was so hard! I couldn't hit the other guy a single time. It felt like I was a bronze player playing a GM (in OW terms). 1 v 1 is also great to demoralize me. After a few exhibition match I quit and went back to story mode. There's ALOT to learn.

But online modes feel incomplete and speciatly when you want to play with friends.
You can only play with one friend.
I want to be able to play with more friends but the game doesn't allow me.

Even in team match always puts your friend in the oposing team and uses AI teammates. And you can't change the team compositions. I really dont understand why this is a thing. Why can't I have an other friend as my team mate and play with 3 other freinds even though the game supports up to 4 player slots.

Brawlhalla allows you to play up to 8 friends and you can manage the teams however you like. So why not in this game?

Even selecting a stage feels like its competitive with the banning feature. I'm playing against my friend and I should always be able to pick stages in a non competetive way. For example both players pick a stage and the game choses random the stage out of the slected stages.


I really recomend that they change the online system to how local brawl works.

One problem I always had with Super Smash Bros was the moves didn't feel heavy. In this game, which has a similar style to Super Smash Bros, does not have this problem. Each hit feels like it counts, and parrying is a smooth and skill based mechanic, which I prefer over shielding. It also has coding for things like wave dashing so it can get very mechanical to play, but is still smooth and not wonky. This game can and will take hours of your life away.


Pros: 
-Coded well, so has few bugs
-Great U.I. with smooth menu transitions
-Amazing character kits that flow well together
-Well balanced character roster (Basically anyone can be super op, well maybe minus Maypul (Rip Maypul))
-Great tutorial for beginners and experts
-Good control layout and custimization
-Character and skin customization
-Great community 
-Premium skins if you want to burn some money (They look really nice)
-Active developers so content is being added regularly
-Fun and interesting story mode
-Special rewards and skins for people who attent offical tournaments or follow social media
-A good and scaling AI system
-Controller support
-Online multiplayer


Cons:
-Will take numerous hours away from your life (I have 73 hours but another 70+ playing locally at friend's houses)
-Peer to peer connection (This can be a problem, but it makes sense for the size of the development team and the style of the game)
-Limited character roster, 8 to be exact. (However, the characters are done amazingly and more characters will be consistanly added)

The games's pixel art style is really good and won my heart with it's simple but good art. The controles are smooth, the AI is good and Story & Abyss Mode are a lot of fun to play! Just playing this game helped me improve in Smash 4, too, because of it's related mechanics. I even prefer this game to Smash 4!
The Practice Mode taught the basics and advanced stuff and that the developers took time to introduce their game to the player is amazing. Most fighting games don't explain anything.
The Story Mode was short lived but the backstory of the characters & how it turns out is really enjoyable to play. I wish there was more to it! (Sadly, pixelart is time consuming to make)
The Abyss Mode is just amazing! I really can't find any other word to describe it! The extra boosters and the level system bring something new in the play style. Even after some hours it's still fun but is definetly repetetive over time.
Since I think that I'm still too trashy to try Online Battles, I will practice DI and parrying until it becomes a second nature!
I'm really hyped about Ori coming to the game and I can't wait for him to come out! (Hopefully in July) If unlocking him would require money, I would happily pay for that!

This game has no matchmaking capabilities. Even though I got the pre-release, I get nothing for it. I also believe that there are a few bugs in online mode, such as lives going out of existence when you are winning. I was winning a match, hadn't died once, and then all of a sudden, I only get killed once, then lose the match? How is that fair and fun? I like the game, but the amount of bullshit that can occur is more than a little frusturating. I also wish I would have gotten some form of bonus for getting the game pre-release, but I don't even get all of the characters, or I can't find anything noticeable that rewards me.

Well boys and girls put down your Nintendo controllers and start up your PCs because Smash Brothers is being replaced.

I know what you're thinking.  How can I make such a bold statement? Smash is the best. Espescially Melee! I can agree they are great games but from a competitive veiwpoint let me explain why Rivals even while in beta has more potential.


Blast Zone Fighters as I call them are fighting games that instead of a health bar that must be drained, you must knock your oppent far enough off screen that they reach a Blast Zone losing a Stock or Life. Super Smash Brothers being the first of this style. Now we have Rivals of Aether. I'm going to  cover many  aspects of what makes a these and other fighting games great and/or stand out.

Music- Rivals has a Amazing soundtrack that perfectly matches the high speed gameplay. Every stage being themed after one of the Four elements. Just listen to some of the tracks

Control- Perfect, the only word that will suffice. This game takes some melee movement tec wave dashes and landings and simplifys the imputs so there is not specific timing for every character. You hit jump, parry, and left or right as the same time. So missing a input that messes up your posittioning is very unlikely. Dashing and Dash danceing is very responsive and feels great. The jump arc of every character is very managable and easy to familiarize yourself with. Even when you are hit you have a great deal of control of how you tumble through the air while in hitstun. This is a game that a person can never blame the controls. No  "" I missed an L-cancle or my wave dash didnt work""  those comments will not be true in this game.

Level design done right- There are two versions of every stage. Rivals has no stages with unfair elements like transitions or moving platforms when the basic stages are being used.(But now it has 2 with moving plat forms only one being a little annoying :note made 06/09/17) Every stage has a silly more casual version called Aether. Every stage has very different platform placement so none of them feel the same.

The Rivals- Every character in this game has a unique power that their move set is based around. Zetterburn can set you on fire doing damage over time, while also being able to absorb it off of his opponent to strengthen his strong attacks, this games name for smash attacks. Kragg on the other hand can summon a rock pillar to change the stages geometry or grab a boulder to throw at you that will remain on stage if it is not destroyed. Every character has something different they bring to the table and it is fun to experiment.

Whiff lag- If you miss an attack in this game you are subject to more lag or ""The amount of time before you can begin a new action or retake full control"" This leads to players that just throw out attacks being punished and players who plan out there attacks being rewarded with a True combo or DI (Directional Imput) dependent combo or ""String"".

I beleive tha Rivals has great potential as a competitve game. The game even has a built in Tournement mode that allows you to ban stages and set the amount of matches in a set. If you love Smash bros. Just pick this game up you won't regret it.

Full release addtions

Online- The online fuctionallity of this game much like many fighting games is not the best. Playing a person out of your reagion is almost pointless due to high pings. Low ping matches have different problem that can only be called stuttering. The match will randomly slowdown for 1 to 3 seconds causing input drops. This means all input. In a game that is DI dependent to survive strong hits this stuttering will be the cause of many deaths. The style of random matchmaking is also not a welcome sight. you will repeatedly meet the same players causing a staleness if the matches are one sided in your favor or the opponents. 

Rebalanceing- the characters have mostly been worked out other than, some small changes that I dont care for ( the shrinking of Zetterburn Down Str's 1st hitbox for one example) The character now feel very balanced so I never feel like I lost to a character rather than the player. This is something that comes from experiance so some people may disagree. 

Conclusion- One of the strongest entries in fighting games that I have played in a long time base solely on the style, combo structure,match interactions and overall design. As a competitive fighter this gets a 10/10",1468386476,1497033057,TRUE,0,1,0.476190478,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,112,6,7200,45,5386,1601014425

Created by the same person who made Super Smash Land, a free PC fan-made Smash game, Rivals of Aether is a fast-paced fighter that adopts the Smash Bros. formula. Play as 8 different characters, each with their own very unique set of play styles. Fight it out with up to 4 players, smacking each other around until one gains victory. 

If the normal fighting isn't enough for you, well this game also has a Story Mode! Dwell into the lore o fthe Rivals of Aether story and learn more about the characters. 

There's also an Abyss Mode, where you get put into many different trials that require you to complete in order to set on into the next wave. Level up your characters and give them over powered skills that'll make Abyss Mode more fun and exciting. 

New to the game? Well the Tutorial will help you get started,  not only does it teach to the common core basics of the Smash Bros. formula, but also teaches you advanced skills that the pros use such as teching and wavedashing.

Simply put: A game for casual players to have some fun. Exciting and intense for the competitive players.

The achievements in this game aren't especially hard to get. There's some that require you to KO opponents using specific moves, but most of them you'll get by playing the Story Mode, there are some Tutorial achievements and some Abyss achievements.

The differences from smash are what make this game so interesting though:

-There is no shield, tapping the block button initiates a parry animation making you invincible and opening up your opponent
-There is no ledge grabbing and there is a much heavier focus on wall jumping to get back on the stage.
-From the little I've played all characters feel relatively balanced and competitive in their own ways
-No items are in the game so battles are entirely skill based with very little random elements such as moving platforms on some stages

Rivals of Aether is an excellent platform fighter and is easy to pick up and play for veteran smash players.

However, that being said, if you are new to platform fighters, this is not really a good introduction. The tutorial is useful, but odds are you will be playing players much better than you and you will get stomped over and over again. If you want a good introductory platform fighter on PC, then play Super Smash Flash 2. It is free and more beginnner friendly. If you enjoy SSF2, then you should consider getting Rivals of Aether.

Also, something [i]really[/i] worth stressing is that there are no grabs and shields in this game. At first that seems simple enough, but that can really throw you for a loop once you actually play without them.

49,Rivals of Aether,23012115,english,"Well, this should be different from how my last review looked, but I wouldn't get myself wrong about it. So Rivals of Aether had released on March 28, 2017, and I figured I should change my review based on its full release. Don't get me wrong, this game is still amazing to me but I want to say just a bit more about it in certain areas.

So, what's this ""Wubilicious"" guy got to say about Rivals now? Well it's still an amazing game with a really great dev team, especially on discord since well, that odd dream of talking to devs becomes a reality in the Rivals of Aether discord group. Even for people wanting to learn and get better, theres the Rivals of Aether Academy discord group, just as a cherry ontop of this crossover elemental sundae of a game. Not to mention any fears you might have about the people in the community should be remedied very quickly, as well, surprisingly people are very nice in this community compared to something like Smash 4 or even Brawlhalla. Not saying that those games have %100 awful people in their communities, not at all, I've just seen more toxic people in those communities compared to Rivals of Aether. Back to the positives, Rivals of Aether sports an 8 character cast with all their own strengths and weaknesses, all revolving around 1 of the 4 major elements, kinda like Avatar. All of these characters have fairly different playstyles and advantages/disadvantages on every stage (unless you're Zetterburn, the most balanced in the game >:C) Speaking of stages, theres a stage for each character, including some general stages featured from this games Abyss and Story modes, not to mention the current CEO Dreamland skin with it's rockin' remix from Rock Wall and the stage Tower of Heaven featuring from well, Tower of Heaven. The music is also pretty kickass in this game too! Don't just ask me, I'd take a listen for yourselves but my favorite track has gotta be the Fight or Flight track that plays on the stage Air Armada. So I mentioned both the Story and Abyss modes, what about those right? Well story modes a big hit in my book, as these characters are fairly unexplored in story since their only other piece of story is on the Rivals of Aether website. The story mode is fairly basic, you fight cpus that get higher AI levels each time you progress untill you get to the end of the story where you fight a more mysterious looking version of one of the characters. Sadly Absa and Etalus haven't been put in story mode but I'm sure some things are to change. Abyss mode is basically a odd minigame-esque mutli-man melee, you start off fighting really weak enemies but it gets more depth like breaking hexes (targets), absorbing light, and even fighting the boss of the games Story Mode every 15 or so waves. I'd say it makes up a lot of the solo mode time you'll put into the game, especially if you want the Ardent Rival achievement. I'd say most of the achievements in this game are fairly standard, being completed by doing a characters story mode or getting a K.O. with one specific move, however theres a small handful that really take time and challenge, so theres even things for the completionist in Rivals of Aether if they're interested. For anyone with some artistic ability, theres also a custom color palette maker for characters built right into the game, and it's fully supported to show in combat as well. It adds some nice variety from just fighting friends or doing abyss mode all the time I'll have to say.

So no game is perfect, right? Well that's not even exclusive to games in general but I'm gonna take a short look at the negatives. One mainly being the 8 character cast, while it's indeed impressive how much depth each character has, it's still only 8. To me honestly, it's not a big complaint, but I know the developers have new characters coming down the line as this is being typed. I'd say another negative is how there's a couple stages I personally don't enjoy, especially because I feel they just don't work in Rivals of Aether compared to something like Smash. I'd say the scaling difficulty in Abyss mode when you have people over isn't super rewarding, as you don't really get much more experience for characters compared to the amount of added difficulty you get with having help, infact it's kinda backwards. You'd think while inviting someone to help with Abyss mode you'd still have some difficulty increase, but it'd still be easier because of the second (or third/forth) person helping you, but thats not the case at all. I'd say some of the music in the game isn't super amazing, but even then that's my personal taste.

So thats really all I have to say. It's an amazing game, and if you can't believe me than try it out for yourself, it's not like you can't get a refund from Steam if you really don't enjoy a game nowadays. I know some people would also like a number grade for reviews too, but I think they're a bit silly. So for any of you who've played Devil May Cry I'll give this game the S rank, yea the devs honestly worked really hard on this game and it very well shows. Even my complaints are personal, well maybe except the 8 character one (that one's fairly common) so my complaints shouldn't be taken to heart or anything. Would I say everyone should check this out? Well not unless you enjoy Super Smash Brothers at it's core mechanics and not for the fact that it's a Nintendo fighter. I'd really recommend this game at least be checked out, whether a friend owns it or you just want to see what the game is beyond my review.",1463361047,1492377294,TRUE,1,2,0.525547445,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,132,17,24468,0,17118,1591578129

I suck at smash and i went and bought rivals of aether considering i watched some people stream it and it looked fun and i was not wrong.
This game combines competiteve smash and casual smash into one game , By allowing you to play with anyone online with no drawbacks although after few too many ranked games you might have a broken controller but now onto whats good and bad about the game. 

PROS: Game is constantly under changes allowing for new characters to Buffed or Nerfed 
Easy to get the hang of a character and play the game and rewards mastering a certain character.
You never feel as if you died to bull sh it 
Has a Story Mode

CONS: Krag
Jumping Into Online Play Instantly Can lead to you not getting the true experience of the game if you are new to a smash like.

Things look unbalanced and flashy as hell. But every character has gimmicks that they can abuse and be abused by. It's Melee-esque in the best way possible with the simplest mechanics, but in play, it's as smooth as fucking butter boi.

60,Rivals of Aether,31140035,english,"This game plays like Melee, so if you like that you'll like this.

I do have some grievances though.

1. The Story Sucks
   The story lacks any development. You fight a Rival and see a scene. You do this until you fight YOUR rival with 2 stocks rather than one. The story scenes don't connect to the rivals that you fight until the very end. It's jarring and incoherent.

2. Zetterburn (and also a little bit of Kragg)
   This character is far too easy to pick up. I understand that there's a lot of depth to him, but when the entry bar is so low, it discourages experimentation. I would've rather they all be hard to pick up or be like Kragg, where they are easy to pick up but not totally useful in the meta. Without this consistency, Kragg seems useless, and Zetterburn seems stupidly good.

3. Parry on frame 2-5? Too much lag, not enough Time!!
   The Parry system is a good idea in theory, but the timing is far too strict for the itty bitty reward that you get from it. A parry should be frame 1-5, so at least you can do reaction based parries. All parries in the current state are far too dificult to pull off without a hard read. 

Overall, this game is just very fun. It's ridiculously fast paced, and never makes you wait. The art is well done and the music is catchy. 8/10",1492191604,1492191604,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,115,6,1906,0,948,1597846683

72,Rivals of Aether,31043977,english,"I started playing Rivals of Aether in early access, but after its full release, I've been playing it a lot more.
The game plays a lot like Smash Bros., as that is its main inspiration.  However, what you'll get from Rivals is not a soulless Smash clone.  Instead, you'll get a game filled with its own personality, quirks, and tons of fun gameplay.
A fantastic inclusion is the two modes of stages.  There's an ""Aether"" mode and a ""basic"" mode.  This essentially doubles the number of stages in the game.  Aether mode stages have different gimmicks and stage hazards.  They aren't suitable for competitive play, but make for fun casual matches.  The ""basic"" stages are a bit misleading.  Rather, they're tournament legal versions of all the  stages, made for competitive use in tournaments.  These stages combine familiar layouts (such as Tower of Heaven using the triplatform layout of Battlefield and The Endless Abyss is a long stage with no platforms, similar to Final Destination), while including original stages that make for interesting additions, such as the quadplatforms of Merchant Port and Fire Capital.  The game includes built in striking and banning for stage selection, which should be familiar to fans of competitive Super Smash Bros.
The gameplay structure itself is fantastic, too.  Rivals of Aether puts its own spin on the platform fighter genre by removing shields and grabs and implementing a parry system instead.  This majorly increases the risk:reward factor.  If you successfully parry an attack, your opponent will be stunned, creating an opening for you to attack.  Parrying a projectile will reflect it.  However, if you miss your parry, you yourself are left open for punishment.  The removal of shields requires you to have more of a read on your opponent.  Movement is incredibly fluid as well.  Wavedashing in Rivals of Aether is much more simplified than in Melee, where it was already relatively easy to perform.  Dash dancing is also present.  There is one character with a double jump cancel, I'll get back to that later.  Hitstun is at a perfect balance, in my opinion.  There is incredibly high combo potential in this game, but most of it requires you to read your opponent's DI.
The sound design in this game is fantastic.  Nearly, if not every song is incredibly catchy.  I find myself listening to some of the music in my spare time (my personal favourite is Tempest Peak).  However, an aspect of the sound design that often goes unappreciated in fighting games is the hit sound effects.  All of the sound effects in Rivals of Aether sound incredibly satisfying, especially when you land a sweetspot.  My personal favourites are Wrastor's clap and Absa's sweetspot kicks.
From a graphical standpoint, the game is simple, but beautiful.  It uses charming pixel graphics to represent the environments and fighters.  The stages are all gorgeous and look fantastic.  Graphics accurately represent hitboxes, which is an issue some fighting games tend to run into.  As an added bonus, since the game is in 2D, there is no Z-Axis to mess with hitboxes, like in some other fighting games.
However, the real meat of a fighting game comes in the form of the characters, and in this area, Rivals of Aether does not disappoint.  There's a cast of 8 characters, with a 9th guest character having been teased.  Each character offers a different playstyle and unique options.  Some are more straightforward than others, but all of them reward skill.  The game is balanced incredibly well, thanks to it being in early access for nearly two years.  This allowed the developers to receive input from top players on matchups and characters.  As a result, everyone is viable, and you can play whoever you'd like at a high level of competitive play.
Each character has their own gimmick, with some being more straightforward than others.
Zetterburn can set his opponents on fire to do damage over time and power up his strong attacks.  Forsburn can create smoke on the stage to obscure the opponent's view.  He can also create a clone that is instantly destroyed when hit.  There's more to him, but that's the simplified version of it.  Orcane can create a puddle on the ground, which you can teleport to at any time, or have it bubble up for some interesting combos.  Maypul can ""tag"" her opponents, which makes her strong attacks wrap them up with vines and also gives her the option to swing over ot them with her up special.  Kragg has the ability to pull rocks from the ground and even create a platform/wall with his up special.  Wrastor has multiple jumps and can use his side special to create a small area that allows him to move more quickly and extend his combos.  Etalus can freeze the ground, which makes him surprisingly mobile for a heavy character.  He can also absorb his ice to become heavier and power up his strong attacks.  Absa can cancel her double jump to perform aerials close to the ground.  Her forward air, back air, and down air all have powerful sweetspots that are hard to land.  However, Absa can place a cloud on the stage.  By kicking this cloud with her aerials mentioned before, she can create a large shockwave that expands the size of her sweetspots.  The cloud can also be popped from a distance to control the stage.  Absa can also place a slow, but powerful attack on the cloud to make it act as a trap or create a thunderbolt between her and it.

Takes the best aspects of what makes games like Smash Melee and PM great like wave dashing, teching, DI, shines etc. and makes the game their own. If you have played Smash and think this is merely a clone you couldn't be more wrong. Dan Fornace has made this game his own with the introduction of parries and wall jumps in the place of having shields and ledge grabs. Having those two new aspects added makes the game way more fast paced and more dificult to play defensively but when you defend effectively you are well rewarded. His roster of characters are also highly diverse, taking inspirations from moves that smash characters have and then building around what would work well with it. An example of this is Absa who uses Pikachu's recovery and then uses Ness's double jump mechanics and then building a very zone based character around it with clouds that can extend, explode, create a linear blast radius between you and the cloud and even amplify hitboxes. Each character is very different as well unlike Marth and Roy or Pikachu and Pichu, they all have a highly different playstyle and major differences in every character's kit. So on top of making a great smash inspired game, with diverse characters, parries and wall jumps, they managed to even put in the little thing that every competitive smash player has wanted. They have an awesome button check feature that you can do in the character select screen, THE SELECT SCREEN! They actually understand what we want! Not only that but they have custom colours, and what I mean by custom colours I mean... CUSTOM COLOURS!

89,Rivals of Aether,30953908,english,"I'll reccommend it, but as a competitive fighter, I don't think it's actually that great of a game. 

Problems: Character balance, Escape options, inconsistencies with hitboxes and poking with disjointed hitboxes. 

One DI option. It's out an away. On about 98% of all moves its out and away or continue to get comboed. Which makes ""reads"" in this game very easy and certain characters have an enormous upper hand in every situation in this game. It would be nice to be able to go up and over during juggles, or against certain moves as a way to really throw opponents for a loop. Unfortunately, in most situations you either DI out and away and half of the cast will Fair-chain you off the side, or try and stay in and get juggled. 

On that note, all of the characters have a ""gimmick."" Zetterburn has fire consume, Maypul has wrap, Wrastor has multiple jumps. Certain character's gimmicks are just better across the board and its clearly shows.

Projectile spam is heavy in this game among all levels of play except the highest level. (It's about as bad as Dhalsim yoga fire spam at times.) Certain character's entire playstyle is centered around constant projectile spam.

Hitboxes are the biggest problem I have with this game. Wrastor and Forsburn constantly have the upperhand in most situations, as their start-ups combined with their disjointed hitboxes can poke through a lot of things. I've also noticed that if one of these attacks hits while a Strong attack is currently landing against them, often times they will recieved reduced knockback, even if the opponent successfully landed the hit. There is a lot of inconsistency with ""clashing"" (and I say that because it is all but non-exsistant in this game.) 


All in all, its a fun game, but most of the time when I play I realize why I stopped trying to play it competitively half a year ago. Certain characters who are obviously better due to design have remained relatively unchanged is jarring in terms of how much the game is praised for being balanced. 

Stages and music are nice and unique. 

6/10. 

Also Parry frame 2 I will never understand.

It's retro-styled but pretty slick and well made, boasting nearly instant load times and great controller support.

You'll probably like this game if:
- You adore colorful pixel animal people.
- You dig fighters with small casts that give each character their own unique mechanics and tools.
- You prefer simpler control styles over Street Fighter-style motion commands.
- You play Super Smash Brothers and want a similar experience on PC.
- You think Smash is a little slow because of shielding and grabbing, and want to see how things play without them.
- You can get into time attack and co-op survival modes.
- You like to fight other people--there are strong players on netplay!



You might not like this game if:
- You don't use a gamepad. Keyboard controls are supported but they can be uncomfortable.
- You prefer the party chaos of Smash with items enabled. (In this case, play Smash instead.)
- You demand big character rosters, like to play a different character every time, or dislike mirror matchups. (In this case, I recommend Smash 4, or something like BlazBlue: Chronophantasma Extend.)
- You want a wealth of lore and exploration--this isn't that kind of game.
- You want to test your skills against strong AI instead of online play. The AI is somewhat competent, but most of the single player challenge is in winning fights fast while taking minimal damage, rather than fair fights against increasingly clever opponents.

[h1]If you're into fighting games, then you will love this.[/h1] 

Rivals of Aether is a Smash Bros inspired fighting game. I say ""inspired"" because the only real similarity between RoA and SSB is the simple movement. I'll spare the detail and just get roight into it

Rivals of Aether's main drive is competitive, and boy howdy does it nail it well. The skill ceiling is so high that everytime I play I figure out a new combo or a new trick. When you go online, people are pulling off some god-level combos, however this is integral for learning and improving. Playing online is the main reccomended way of playing, because honestly, the CPU are easy, even on the highest setting. Plus, by playing online you learn to adapt, therefore you ""git gud""

However, RoA isn't all competitive. There's a story mode, which is kinda like All-Star mode from Smash Bros. Then once you beat that, you unlock Abyss Mode, which is an endless challenge mode where you have to either break some targets, capture a point, or defeat an armored enemy. Normally playing any mode will get you coins, which you can spend to unlock new characters, stages, AND special perks for Abyss Mode, that basically buff your character.

I'm such a slave for customization, and boy howdy, RoA let's you create your own custom skins for your character. On top of that, there are a few DLC skins that are pretty cheap, as well as promotional skins that you can get for participating in tournaments, or special events. Now I know what you're thinking. ""Can't I just recreate the DLC skins in the skin creator??""
no
you cant
The DLC and event skins have a special taunt and particle effects that can't be recreated in the skins creator, which makes these event skins seem more precious.

Seriously tho, why haven't you bought this game yet. It's cheap for all the content it gives you, plus new stages and characters are coming in the near future.

[h1]----- FULL REVIEW -----[/h1]

(Opening Note: A lot of my hours on this game comes from listening to that delicious music in the background. Its good, by the way. Just wanted to point that out so we don't mistake my level of fighting dedication for something it isn't!)

Full disclosure: I am not a hardcore fighter-type at all; I went to one local Smash 4 tourney a little under a year ago and essentially went, ""Yeah, no."" I've had an often hopeless fascination of their complex systems and tactics, but a lack of the mechanical skill and patience required to learn them at a higher level. In short, bear in mind that I'm reviewing this more or less as a ""casual,"" which I'd like to believe will benefit someone out there reading this.

So here I am, once again trying to somehow eke out the technical satisfaction of conquering a fighter despite the stupid amounts of stress they can cause me. Does Rivals of Aether somehow break the mold of my typical fighter experience? Not entirely: this is undoubtedly a high-octane, competitive multiplayer game first and foremost. However, the convention-breaking finesse and quality of this game is enough to make me genuinely beam when things clicks.

Because if anything, RoA is unconvential. This is essentially a Smash Bros. (Melee) clone, but it does several things differently. First, there are no shields! Instead, you must rely on dodging or what is called a ""parry"", a way of essentially reversing the enemy's offense back on them. This is important, because the concept of ""safety"" is very fleeting in RoA. Battles happen quickly and often brutally, and the inability to shield can make it hard to get a grasp on your surroundings without getting absolutely slaughtered in the process. This can make for an unforgiving learning curve at the beginning.

The characters in RoA are frequently as unorthodox as the base mechanics, though this leads to some hero-specific mechanics that are incredibly interesting. Specifically, the interactions between different mechanics and hero attacks make for some nifty setups. Zetterburn can light foes on fire, which grants a knockback bonus to his strong (smash) attacks. Etalus can freeze the ground to increase the distance of his dash attack. Even straightforward tweaks--like Wrastor's strong attacks working only in the air instead of on the ground--really shake things up. Its the kind of stuff that sounds really amazing to fool around with... but reconciling all the nuances of a character, especially against high-tier opponents, can feel very daunting.

In short, RoA makes for some very deliberate, demanding gameplay. Its tough. Its crazy. But when you nail it... its quite amazing. RoA is the kind of game that can definitely push you outside of your comfort zone, but in exchange you can have some truly cerebral moments. Yes, you'll probably get your rear handed to you in short order more than once, but piecing together the elements of success and failure can come just as quickly: the game, in a way, demands it of you. If you can harness that intensity and intellect even for a moment, you may be shocked to find that even as a ""casual"" you can have your moments. Glorious, glorious moments.

Just remember, this is a competitive fighter first. Story mode is pretty standard fare, if not a little short even for this genre. The solo replayability is tied up for the most part in Abyss Mode, yet another unconventional but nice take on the ""multi-man"" melee modes from Smash Bros. Nonetheless, I wouldn't plan to get much mileage out of the single player content; its essentially a small appetizer compared to the multiplayer's main course. Despite the game's clear priorities, some may be disappointed in the overall lack of content. With a starting roster of only eight characters (perhaps for the sake of balance,) some might struggle to find a rival they really gel with.

I don't think RoA is going to drastically change my contentious, limited relationship with the fighter genre. But its dedication to rich, deep gameplay makes it feel more casual-friendly than one might think. I don't see myself tearing up the ranked leaderboards any time soon, but I may get me some occasional ""slam dunk"" KO's from Etalus's grab attack.

17,Rivals of Aether,30868071,english,"It's melee with powershields only, no grabs (Etalus doesn't count), no ledges, and every character is viable.

I've put probably 12,000 hours into Melee over my life and played every smash-like that I'm aware of. Rivals of Aether definitely comes the closest to the feel of Melee, though the two are different in their own ways. RoA is heavily focused on a combo/punish game centered around complex character matchups and general tech skill. For casual play I wouldn't necessarily recommend RoA as it can be quite daunting. Ever play against the one friend in Melee who mains Falcon/Falco/Fox and they just constantly pressure you and run you down? RoA is basically that, except every character does that.

Rivals of Aether is a platform fighter with a competitive flair that oozes polish and offers you a great deal of control over your character's speed and actions (if you've played Melee, the tempo is similar). This is as close to the Smash-series a platform fighter can get (standard double jumps, percent based health, smashes (or strongs in this games)) while putting a fresh, simplistic spin on it through each character's very unique moveset and the parry mechanic.

This game plays fantastically with almost no input delay online even over 100 ping. Don't be afraid of those high ping values!

To everyone else: Now that this game is out of Early Access, it is a STEAL for $15. Honestly, it's my new favorite fighting game on Steam. I'm a bit biased since I've been playing Smash Bros. competitively for a couple years now and have been playing since near day one of Early Access, but considering you get nearly the same amount of content for $15 as Street Fighter V gets for $60, this game is well worth the money I spent on it. Also if you're worried about buying a game for which the community might be dead, don't be. The game's community is incredibly active, and I've never had a time where I just couldn't find a match.

37,Rivals of Aether,30822498,english,"I hopped onto the Early Access train a little late, I only picked up the game in November, but watching Rivals grow has been an awesome experience. Dan Fornace, the game's creator, and the other devs are all supremely focused on creating a well balanced, competitive, fun fighting game. All of the characters are just as viable as one another in competitive play, all of the stages are designed with competitive play in mind, and yet it's still just so visceral and fun! Pulling off a sick combo, or landing an awesome set up, or hitting that optimal punish all feel so awesome. The game gives you nothing for free, but that means that you feel great once you've managed to actually land something.

The gameplay feels a lot like Super Smash Bros Melee, if you're familiar with that game, but with enough unique stuff in there that it doesn't come off as just another smash clone (even if we call it Furry Trash Smash). No ledges, grabs, or shields here, instead they've been replaced by wall jumps and parries, a new mechanic where you can block your opponent's moves and leave them in a state of hitstun for a brief moment, allowing you to follow up and punish them with (almost) whatever you want. The timing is tight though, you've got 2 frames to work with, and leaves you with a significant amount of endlag if you mistime the parry, so you can't just throw them out whenever. The game is very fast paced and combo-centric, with movement and spacing being vital for competitive play.

But the really interesting part are the characters. The roster currently holds 8 characters as of writing this review, with at least 6 more promised for the future (2 guest characters and 1 more for each of the 4 elements), and each of those 8 feel incredibly different from one another, and each have their own mechanics that interact with the stage in unique ways. From being able to create a destroyable pillar underneath you, to covering the stage in ice, to obscuring the screen in smoke, every character has a unique way to interact with the stage itself. But that's not the best part, the care and design that has gone into each and every character shows. While certain matchups may tend to favor one character over another, it's never more than a 60/40 chance at worst, and no character significantly outshines any other. High level competitive play regularly sees almost the entire cast, so who you play just comes down to personal preference rather than being forced to ""play the meta.""

The community around this game is wonderful as well, with several major Discord channels, including the ""Rivals Academy,"" a Discord created with the sole purpose of pairing new players with more experienced Mentors (including some top-level players) to help them learn, a hugely active subreddit (/r/RivalsofAether), and almost daily online tournaments, you can almost always find someone to play with. The community has been nothing but helpful and friendly the entire time I've been playing. The general attitude of the Rivals community is that we're all trying to get good at a competitive fighting game, so why not help each other out.

Finally, it's a small note, but the amount of polish and awesome small features in this game is just outstanding. Everything oozes character, from the menu music to the character select screen. Here are just a few small details that I really appreciate as a player:

- Being able to create a profile, set custom controls, and playtest those controls, all without having to leave the character select screen
- Having a music toggle on the stage select screen
- Stage banning in the stage select screen
- CUSTOM COLORS (no seriously, it's a lot more fun than you think)

If you are interested in picking up this game, I highly recommend it! I came from having only a minimal amount of experience playing a platform fighter, I wouldn't even call myself an amateur at Melee, but was able to pick up the game enough to start participating in online tournaments after only a couple of months (not saying I was doing well, but I wasn't losing out round 1 every time). A few of my friends who I recommended this game to came from Melee, Smash 4, and PM and all still loved this game. The barrier to entry is not high (the game even has tutorials to teach you pretty much everything you need to know to play the game), even if the skill ceiling is. Basically, if you're interested in a competitive platform fighting game with a fantastic community and devs that actually care about delivering a quality product, then you can't go wrong with picking up Rivals of Aether.",1490826500,1490826500,TRUE,7,1,0.578501284,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,98,1,30120,0,13755,1587197726
38,Rivals of Aether,19902788,english,"My favorite iteration of Smash, including Melee, 4, PM, SSF2 you name it. I like all those games, but this is number one for me.

The tech is there, but the design is based on simple inputs and deliberate timing and not accidentallly complex button inputs that you have to tear up your hands learning and using over and over. There are detailed tutorials that can help you learn the tech, down to how to individual characters work. The characters move sets are based on cohesive concepts designed for this game and not weird collections of existing IP baggage slapped together to pull in other fan bases. Though I understand two indie guest stars are on the way. Still the characters kits are well thought out. Pick the bird a do a bunch of arials combos, pick the smokey dude and be all sneaky with smoke screens and decoys. There are no garbage pokefloat levels you have to turn off. There are no items or finisher moves that make you chase a baloon. 

Sheild-grapple-attack has been replaced with a simpler parry sytem. Make your attacks too obvious and get punished. Ledges have been replaced with a wall jump system. L cancling has been taken out, there are no rising attacks, you land on your feet, but you can still tech roll to keep from bouncing off the ground. All of these choices streamline the game, taking out the nooks, crannys and weird invincibility frames and moving gameplay more towards hitting your opponent with sweet combos.

There's single player stuff with lots of replay value, more characters on the way and an active community with tournaments out at smash events and on the net. The devs listen to player feedback and cater to competitive play. I saw a well thought out nerf suggestion for the creators favorite character on their subreddit implemented with the very next patch. I can not speak highly enough of the people behind this game. It's fantastic right now and I have a lot of faith that it will only get better.

I would definitely recommend this game to people who want to play Melee but find it too hard. I'd also recommend it to Smash players as a whole because of how it plays in general.

With 8 characters, it doesn't seem like a very diverse cast, but that's where looks can be deceiving, because each character plays so differently from one another, and Dan still intends to add more characters as time goes on! 11 stages is also a great number compared to the number of legal stages in Smash games.

All in all, this game isn't difficult to pick up (especially if you're coming from Smash), but the real challenge comes from mastering it.

Online can be a problem, because there will be people who just annihilate your very being (looking at you, Sino), but playing with friends and getting better at the game makes this all worthwhile.

45,Rivals of Aether,30809686,english,"Rivals or Aether, or RoA, is an indie platform fighter, meaning it has the samwe basic mechanics as Super Smash Bros. It takes mechanics from melee and more recent smash games, along with making up a lot of its own and put it together under the guise of a pixel retro art style.

The game is specifically designed for competitive play and in my opinion that it the way it is most enjoyable. Having friends to play with, especially local ones is where the game shines. It has a small single player story mode and the new abyss mode which are fun by themselves and definitely add more depth and value to the $15 game, but in the end are just distractions from the main event.

[b] Mechanics [/b]
If you're not familiar with competitive smash the next few things I'll be saying probably make no sense but what can you do. RoA takes the combo and movement heavy style of melee with features such as
-dash dancing
-wave dashing
-strong edgeguard focus
-lots of hitstun
however it also adds the good 'comfort' features of the newer games like
-buffering
-not freefalling out of an airdodge
-more forgiving/intuitive controls.
and it gets rid of shields (making offensive play more rewarding) and the ledge, so no edgehogs or planking.
Believe me when I say it all comes together and isn't just a huge mess of different games. it works and makes for some hugely satisfying combos and edgeguards, without it ever feeling to unfair or unbeatable.

[b] Characters [/b]
You'll notice that at the moment RoA only has 8 playable characters which seems like a very small number, and in terms of modern fighters it definitely is! however this isn't as big of a drawback as you may imagine. if you compare it to smash 4 with over 50 characters, every RoA character feels completely unique and I play and enjoy all of them. they all have unique tech and mechanics for them which you would need to learn in order to master the character. Also the small number of characters means balance is a lot easier to the devs, and every character is kept viable and strong enough to compete.

One important thing to note is that I highly reccomend you make sure you have some kind of game pad or controller before you buy this game. While keyboard controls exist it really doesn't allow the freedom and enjoyment for me and almost all other players. You can use a gamecube controller if you have a usb adaptor.

There may only be 8 characters, but each one feels totally unique; not a clone in sight. There are mechanics in this game that I wish were present in Smash.

Graphics are pixelated, nothing too special to report here. The music on the other hand is pretty top notch.

There's a story mode but it's pretty barebones; move through 5 stages with 6 characters. There are some cutscenes between each fight, but they're only there to establish character backgrounds. The story themselves are mostly disconnected from the battle, but I guess this teaches you how to wreck the AI in each match-up to get the gold medal.

Abyss mode is a neat idea though; you gain character experience by completing different trials and challenges in rapid succession. You earn coins to unlock move enhancements (runes) for Abyss PvP or future Abyss mode runs. 

Practice mode is fleshed out. You can change the game speed and display hitboxes to figure out ideal combos.

The online only has 1v1, which means you will find opponents even if there aren't a lot of people playing.

I can be completely honest here, but I'll just put my pros and cons

Pros:
-Balanced character roster
-A fair amount of stages
-Abyss mode is fun as all get out
-Controls and learning physics is 5x Easier than Super Smash Bros. Melee
-THE FREAKING MUSIC!!

Cons:
-Laggy online (not often, but sometimes)
-Short/Basic story mode

Somewhere in-between the two:
-Replayability (that pretty much explains for itself)
-Not much characters, but that's ok I guess

Sure, the game has many comparisons to Super Smash Bros but IT DOES have its differences. Ledges are non-existent in this game which makes every match more combat focused rather than stally. Along with that comes a small roster of 8 characters, each with their own unique playstyle (Orcane being my favorite). The Competitive scene is nice, small, and one ive found entertaining as its evolved.
Even the casual side of the game is great with friends as it offers several gamemodes for you to choose from. The only real downside I could say about the game is the dullness of the story mode but lets be real, no one is buying this game primarily for the story.

Aside from that, if your a fan of the Super Smash Bros franchise, you NEED to give this a try, you can wait for a sale if you want, but 15$ for this isn't a bad price.

The sound design and graphics are clearly retro-inspired, and this doesn't neccessarily help or hurt the game one way or the other. But they are definitely GOOD retro graphics, with a lot of attention to detail, and the characters are full of personality.

The gameplay is tight. RoA uses Smash mechanics like comboing, smash (""strong"") attacks, tilts, aerials, etc., with its own mechanics like parrying. Oh, and you can't grab ledges, so getting back to stage is always fun. Character special moves can effect the stage in really interesting ways, like Kragg's pillar and Maypul's plant. And characters have their own mechanics like Zetterburn's flames and Maypul's mark that you have to watch out for.

If you have a few buddies and spare controllers, definitely check out the local multiplayer. Stages have ""Aether"" modes with fun gimmicks and insta-deaths, and things get really exciting with 4 Rivals on-screen at once.

You can also customize your character's color, which is super neat. And the best part is, the game isn't even complete yet. Story mode, and other features will be added in the final release.

theres just soo much in the way to have fun in these games that make you go why?

why make your spacie about as hand harming as the melee char he based off of.

who thinks a zoning heavy is fun?

why add jigglypuff to the game with marth hitboxes

wheres the dam block button?!?!?!?!

ive been playing this game since launch and i just can't find it fun fundementally. I understand that things get rocky when  and practicing matchups and labbing it up(doing your homework on characters) can solve these issues but the trip to attaining this level off skill is not fun when you know the other player doesn't have to work as hard.

and really know the dev who made this game is confusing aswell. an in interview a while ago he stated he wanted the combo system to be like smash 64 which is extremely combo heavy( think MVC3 is you know about it) yet has a character in the roster that dies at 50 and flies out of combos like crazy. 

oh and moves sometimes fly right through people at times,along with a ton of other tangable hitboxes that don't match visual hitboxes so thats a thing.(im talking full 3 hit jab combo can happen while someone is behind you). along with parry replacing block which is a terrible option when it plays out, considering your defensive option is NOW a risk in itself to be punished. which is crazy considering there are moves that can only be punished via parry, which is awful considering this game is mostly played online.

31,Rivals of Aether,29483076,english,"[h1]This Game is Goooooood![/h1]

Before playing the game, I expected it to be good but I didn't expect it to make me get hyped again for a videogame. The game is pretty fun if you're a fan of Smash Bros, especially Melee, but if you're not, you should still give this game a try. Coming from a 2D/3D fighter background, I never thought I would enjoy this game as much as I'm enjoying it right now. The game actually made me interested in the Smash scene and I've been trying out Melee because of this game.
Here's a list of the pros and cons that I've noticed:

[b]Pros:[/b]
[list]
[*]The tutorial is great for beginners. It's very well made and deffo will teach you the basics and some advance stuff in the game. It even has character specific tutorials!
[*]The game's roster is fun and pretty balanced. All the characters in the roster, at the time of this writing, are all pretty viable and all of them feels unique and the roster has a very wide variety of playstyles. For example, Wrastor is a very combo heavy character but is very light, another example is Orcane, a character that utilizes puddles to improve its attacks but needs a lot of planning and decision-making in-game.
[*}The game is still in Early Access. You might also take this as a con but being an early access game means the game still has a lot more room for improvement. Expect more characters and stages to be released because of this.
[*]The gameplay and controls are smooooooth as hell. Like what I said during the intro, I exclusively played 2D/3D fighters before this but the controls were so easy to learn that the transition was super smooth. The controls are also customizable depending on your preference.
[*]One word: [b]SOUNDTRACK[/b]
[/list]

[b]Cons:[/b]
[list]
[*]The online matchmaking is awful! It might be because the playerbase is still small but getting matched-up with a player that you declined thrice already is stupid.
[*]I don't know about other players' experience but online was laggy for me in general. I rarely get below 150 ping when playing online, even in friendly battles. I think it's because of my internet connection but my connection is pretty above average in my country's standards.
[*]The learning curve is pretty steep just like other fighters but with the great tutorial and some patience, it's pretty easy to get the hang of the game. But expect to dive deep inside the game for countless hours if you want to be borderline ""good"" in competitive.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
Overall, this game is one of the best games I've played gamplay-wise. Everything is thought out carefully and well done. To be fair, it's not a perfect game per-se but it's a great one nontheless.

55,Rivals of Aether,29169313,english,"[h1] Introduction [/h1]
Rvials of Aether is an extraordinary game that is very reminiscent of the Super Smash Bros. series.  Most will compare this game to Super Smash Bros. Melee, but I feel it's actually closer to Project M, the mod of Super Smash Bros. Brawl to create a game closer in concept to Melee.

[h1] The Pros [/h1]
[list]
[*] The movement and combos in the is very smooth and fluent, even more so if you have played the SSB games before.
[*] Eight entirely unique characters to Rivals of Aether with inspirations in their movesets taken from existing characters in SSB.
[*] Each character has a unique trait about them that can be used to enhance their attributes or create a different result.
[*] The tutorial for general gameplay and specific characters is great for introducing you to the platformer fighter (party game) genre and giving you a basic understanding for each character.
[/list]

[h1] The Cons [/h1]
[list]
[*] Becoming remotely decent for a competitive level, can take several tens or hundreds of hours, if you're not already familiar with Smash Bros., however that still doesn't mean you'll be good here if you are there.
[*] Matchmaking could use improvement, while this can be controlled a bit if you set your region, you'll still encounter people with not so desirable ping or the same people over and over.
[*] Ping can be a problem depending on who you're playing with and where from.
[/list]

[h1] Tidbits [/h1]

You CAN change the controls for the game! Don't like jumping when you flick your stick up? Problem solved! Don't like doing a strong/smash attack when you want to do a tilt? Well you can solve that too!
I also hate how ridiculous the hitstun... Yeah, I went and said it. I don't like the super long lasting hitstun that pretty much allows this game's combos to function. I think that covers my additional thoughts.

[h1] Conclusion [/h1]
Rivals of Aether is a very fun game to play as friends, both as a party game and a competitive fighter.  It is a great way to get into the platformer fighter genre without having to make an investment and I would recommend this title to anyone who has friends that they can play with or are already acquainted with SSB.

It has the same mechanics as melee (which is a game that i love) and has its own characters, if people dont play this game who are in the competetive scene for smash, then i say give it a try, its one of the best games i have ever played on steam and is my favourite, i only had the chance to buy it a few days ago but i have spent countless hours on it on my brothers account and when he shared it with me, 10/10 would buy again, thank you so much Dan Fornace for giving me this game it is so amazing and i hope you keep developing it.

Guess the only way to put it is almost every online player feels like they have something to prove, and even in casual pvp, they make sure to rip you apart as viciously as they can.

9,Rivals of Aether,28578168,english,"This game stands out from the crowd, to say the least.

While seemingly just a knock off of everyone's favorite Smash Bros. franchise, this game throws you into a conceptual fighting game that requires a good amount of time and dedication to get the hang of. It's true, some of the abilities certain characters have are obvious imitations from SSB; most of them are used in conjunction with the rest of that character's kit. This introduces a larger field of outplay potential than most other games. A battle can demand constant focus as to where your opponent(s) are setting up to potentially annihilate you and in turn, makes you play accordingly. 

Despite the roster only featuring 8 playable characters at the moment, you may find yourself playing one for hours and all of a sudden discovering a new combo you can perform. What also sets this game apart from the SSB franchise is that there are 3 attack buttons and a larger amount of air attacks, which amount to somewhere between 15-20 attacks per character. 

Rivals of Aether is an incredibly complex game for how simple it comes off as and while you may find yourself encountering a lag spike occasionally, I wouldn't consider it to make the game unplayable by any means.

Through the combination of art style, music, SFX and mechanics, this game is definitely worth your money if you're at all into fighting games and even more so if you're a fan of the SSB franchise.",1482546637,1482546637,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,433,1,222,0,150,1485166928
10,Rivals of Aether,28575162,english,"Before I begin: I have a couple of years of experience with Melee and Project M, and this review is mostly my first impressions.  Rivals is much like the Smash games, but it introduces some new mechanics for better or for worse.

The classic rock-paper-scissors of Smash is attack/shield/grab.  In RoA, the latter two do not exist.  In their place is a lone ""parry"" feature that cancels out the opponent's attack and stuns them for 40 frames (and reflects projectiles).  In theory, this was intended to make the game more aggressive, but in my experience with netplay, it seriously hurts the neutral game.  Parrying a move is much more advantageous than blocking it would be if you had the option, and it is equal to or better than hitting the opponent with a combo starter... so obviously it's kind of busted.  Rivals' answer to this is to make the first hit of jab not recieve stun from a parry, and also to make it cancelable into any tilt.  I haven't made up my mind on whether or not this is worse.  The tutorial also teaches parry baiting, which is basically the same as spotdodge baiting, except it also removes things like OoS options and shield pressure (as a Falco player, the absence of the latter is disappointing).

There's also no ledges.  Melee ledges are really dumb (even as someone who religiously grabs ledge when the opponent is offstage) so I can see why this change would be explored, but in practice it seems to really hurt Zetterburn (PM Wolf, basically) most and Wrastor (Marth + Puff +  Falco, also the best character in the game) least.

As for the mechanics it borrows from Smash games:
Directional airdodges, and thus, wavedashes, are possible.  They accept digital inputs, do not put you into special fall, and can be buffered.
SDI does not actually take smash inputs at all.  The tutorial introduces it in the context of escaping multihits, but in my experience, there are practically none of those that are actually exploitable, so... I guess it's just an addition to combo DI?

Speaking of controls that aren't the way they should be, the right stick charges smashes when held, which is quite disappointing from a game that borrows so much from Melee since only Smash 4 does this.  And also like Smash 4, netplay is more often than not a lagfest.  I've had better experiences here than with For Glory, however.

...And now that I have torn as much out of this game as I can, it's still the best Smash-like experience you'll find on Steam.  I got it for less than $10 and it's easily worth it at that price, especially if you intend to play locally with other people.

PROS
- All new unique characters
- No relied upon mechanic of shieilding or grabbing but reverts to dodgeing instead
- Cheap
- Low PC requirements

CONS
- Very few characters
- Controls are hard to pickup
- People are very picky with who they want to face agaist online and will often disconnect after the first round or jump of the edge because you outplayed them in one of your three lives

However this game is extremely fun with very little learning curve to pick up and play but very difficult to master which gives it a great balance of easy fun and tough challenges.

UPDATED - Nov 2016

RoA is still a massivley fun game but the dwindling playerbase has made it much more challenging to have exciting ranked games without playing the same player 4 times in a row.

However, it makes it much more difficult to have short que times or to recieve players consistantly in a similar region as you.

51,Rivals of Aether,27880090,english,"This is an excellent game for fans of the Super Smash Bros. Series. 

It features similiar gameplay options: wavedashing, short hops, fast falls, specials, teching, wall jumps, DI, and SDI. While all of these mechanics are featured in Super Smash Bros. Melee, here in Rivals of Aether, they are much simpler to execute. The frame window for inputs is much greater allowing you to pick up these advanced techniques quite easily.

Ledge mechanics are different. You can not grab ledge, however it is still very important to prevent the opponent from recovering. 

The combo game is a big part of Rivals of Aether. Similiar to Smash Bros. you can ""free style"" your combos by reacting to DI and tech. 

Defense-wise, there are no shields. However, you do have a block. When timed correctly, this block can also stun the enemy for a short time. You also still have your standard rolls and air-dodges.

The game is wonderfully designed. You have 8 characters, all with a wide variety of movesets. You have a decent amount of maps, each with a ""competitive"" variant. You can create custom skins for characters. There is a button check mode right from the character select screen, excellent for quick handwarmers. There are in depth tutorials that teach the basics and advanced techniques of the game. There is local and offline play, against a second player or AI. There is also 4 player teams. Story mode and Abyss mode (a wave based gamemode) are on the way too. There are also new maps and characters planned for the future. 

It is also important to note that you are able to use a GameCube controller (as long as you have the proper adapter). So if you have played any of the Smash games on the Dolphin Emulator or are coming from Anther's Ladder, you will be all set.

While this game isn't an exact copy of Super Smash Bros., fans of the series will find and enjoy many similarities. All in all, a great game designed with the player in mind. It is easier to pick up, yet still difficult to master. I highly reccomend it.",1480277954,1480277954,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,199,1,733,0,113,1531151930

54,Rivals of Aether,27872080,english,"   If you like fighting game, this game is a great change in gameplay. It is a sumo-fighter, like those in the Series Smash Bros series, but it is designed with a competitive mindset in hand. The characters feel both balanced and fleshed out, providing a great experience. I first noticed this game on Humble Bundle, and I was skeptical at first. While, I had played Brawlhallah, it the characters felt empty and unbalanced. The mechanics were also a little unclear, unlike Rivals of Aether. In RoA (Rivals of Aether) exhibition matches are done as a best 2 out of 3, and while both games feature the ""sumo"" mechanic, where the objective to to knock the opponent out of the ring, RoA's normal gameplay doesn't reward you points for a knock out, but instead penalizes you for getting knocked out. This, in contrast to Brawlhallah's normal scoring system, rewards player for not just knock outs, but kill streaks and kill steals as well. I felt as though it cheapened gameplay, and rewarded those who were good at the latter, but not necessarily completely competent in overall skill. The biggest differences in mechanics, generally speaking, compared to others are that: 1) you cannot grab ledges, but each character is given a wall jump and can use their recovery move once before and after the wall jump; 2) shields do not exist, you can still ""perfect shield"" like in the Smash series, but it will only activate a ""parry"" which allows you a brief window to punish your opponents mistakes; 3) it has no grab/throw mechanics, other than Etalus's up air; 4) there are three types of attack buttons, jab/tilt with a normal attack, special attacks, and heavy attacks (like Smash attacks). I feel that, with these mechanics in place, it creates a much different environment and experience than that of other Sumo's, or ""Smash-likes.""

   In summary, I feel that Rivals of Aether offers fun, balanced gameplay with unique, well-developed, and creative characters, all while keeping the game feeling fair and offering a true test of mettle in gameplay. Now I could go on about how greatly unique and fleshed-out each character feels, or how the stages, hazardous or not, are well designed and approached with a competitive mind.

Lets get down to this.
Good stuff. 
Fluid gameplay.
Every charater is very different.
With smash, the characters are thrown in the game with moves from their past games. This game, the characters are made FOR the game. All characters have some form of stage control. So many strategies for all of the characters. Its really great to see.
It takes the wavedash glitch from melee into this game, and openly explains it to you (for your hardcore people, you can buffer the wavedash. Im not sure if you can do that in melee, but with my experience in melee wavedashing was really hard.) 

Not so good stuff.
A lot of people dont play the game yet.
The game is yet to be complete. (even though they patch and unpatch, they have yet to add their single player modes. Its all a really long process.)

26,Rivals of Aether,26408447,english,"Not only is Rivals of Aether a great competitive fighting game but it is one of the biggest surprises of indie gaming. The project has been lead by a passionate and talented team and it clearly reflects on the product after playing for hours upon hours. All the characters are well fleshed out be it through their colorful appearance to their distinctive gameplay. The sprite work is a love letter to retro games but reinvents it in a new and modern way. The musical scores are charming and suit the feel of the stages beautifully. The game on the surface is easy to learn for beginners but rewarding to those who want to devote the time to master it.

Although Rivals is a fantastic game it does have its share of problems that I hope the team addresses heading launch. The game is unforgiving to people who play with keyboards. Keyboard play feels unintuitive and just jarring compared to controllers, which may alienate many potential consumers and owners to continue playing. Also, the $15 pay wall indefinitely hinders the game to grow. I agree with this payment method personally and see that it supports the development team, but objectively it does pull consumers away to other titles which are cheaper or even free. Unfortunately, if such problems continue to exist it will negatively affect the game and it's playerbase in both the short and long term. Alienating potential players will make the game less lively; there will be less people to play against in either the ranked or exhibition mode. A lack of new blood will raise the question if it is worthwhile to continue playing to veterans. Admittedly, these are difficult issues but I have complete faith that the team will succeed.

ROA is SSBM except it limited the roster and made the game more aggressive via implementing parries over shields.
Each of the 8 characters is flashy and unique, watching high level play make think this will end up dominating smash once it gets properly finetuned and released.

Personally I think the slightly lower skill floor through streamlining how wave dashing works and allowing for a full range of customisation on any controller is inviting to new players and creates a cool meta on top of tournament play.

If any of these characters were in a smash game then no one would play smash, because these characters are as broken as my elbow when I broke my elbow, when I was five. Also, I just played online for five straight hours, so I am salty as funk, which is very, very salty. Buy this game.

Already having great fun learning the characters and the gameplay feels great.
Glad to see another Platform Fighter, since Smash Brothers died for me now that I'm too poor to keep up with Nintendo Consoles.

Wait, hear me out.

So, there are two things to look for when designing a competitive game: the degree of [i]challenge[/i], and the degree of [i]fun[/i]. When it comes to mainstream games, we associate the former with competitive viability and the latter with ""casual"" appeal. For example, some might argue that the later Smash games are more ""fun"" than Melee, even if they're less ""challenging.""

But there's fun in competitive design, too. Do you enjoy playing Peach vs Puff in Melee? Or even Puff vs Peach, for that matter. I'm a Marth main, and I dislike fighting ICs, even though he's good against them.

There are aspects of Melee's design that make it [i]not fun[/i]. Yes, it's competitive, and it has a high skill ceiling - but Marth vs Fox when the Fox is above 100%? Not fun. Just frustrating.

It only took a few hours of Rivals of Aether to realize that the game rights many of Melee's wrongs. For example, knockback seems to scale more for kill moves than combo moves, so damaging your opponent too much never makes them harder to kill. That's more intuitive than Melee's approach; why should Fox at 150% be more of a threat than Fox at 75%?

RoA is filled with tons of little improvements:

* Horizontal wavedashing makes it easy to get a ""max length"" wavedash.
* Wavedashing without a directional input gives you a wavedash in place rather than an accidental air dodge.
* More recovery options make gimps harder, but you can still get edgeguarded for days.
* Blast zones are closer to the screen, so there are fewer of those ""Samus bomb-jumping back from the corner of Dream Land"" situations. Either you're in a fast-paced edgeguard situation, or you're dead.
* No Tournament Winner, thank god.

On top of that, RoA adds its own layers of depth. Parrying is an awesome mechanic, and it'll grow more sophisticated as people get better at the game. Air dodges actually add movement options in neutral, not just recovery - lots more to explore here too.

Honestly, the only thing this game needs is players. Its design is already better than the games that inspired it. It just needs a higher skill ceiling - and I think the potential is there, if we develop the meta.

My favorite is Orcane, with his slippery...slippery-ness and water abilities, though his recovery isn't always the best.

Gameplay is fast-paced and very focused on offense. There are no shields, so your only forms of defense are well-timed dodges and a new parry mechanic which lets you punish an attack or reflect projectiles, but can be punished if you don't use it correctly. No items, but I don't miss them and the game can get chaotic enough with four characters at once. Stages either have fun gimmicks or can be toggled to be more friendly to the serious player. Online is 1v1 only at this time, but the netcode is great as far as I could tell.

There's some great features of its own as well, like the ability to make your own color schemes for every character, a well-made tutorial that walks you through the basics before covering more advanced techniques and character-specific info, and playtesting controls ON THE CHARACTER SELECT SCREEN.

I genuinly loved this game until they nerfed forsburn so you cant attack with the clone unless you have 3 smokes stored up, he was really the only thing going for it to me and they removed what made him cool instead of nerfing what actually made him broken. I'm probably gonna stick to melee icies for now unless they bring his clone's hitboxes back, but I do have a few ideas as to how they could bring back attacking with the clone while also making it balanced.

[u]Idea number 1[/u]:smoke charges. I think a cool thing they could do would be this. If you have 1 smoke stored forsburn's clone attacks once every 300 frames or 5 seconds, 2 smokes stored every 180 frames or 3 seconds, and when you have all 3 it attack's every 180 frames and you can control when it attacks.

[u]Idea number 2[/u]:buffing charged clones. So I actually do like how you still sorta can have a clone that can attack if you have 3 smokes stored but that's not as easy as it may sound AND the clone can die from 1 single hit making your efforts almost meaningless. I think giving the charged clone 2-3 hits before it dies would make your efforts a bit more meaningful so it wont get killed right as you spawn your hard work, though multihits will count as however many hits the move has, making it still susceptible to an early death. Now i know it'd be hard to keep track of how many hits the clone has until death so maybe each hit it'd change color, like to whatever the original skin you chose was.

Anyways this game is still great and i highly reccomend it, but I just wish they didnt hit forsburn so hard.",1473283615,1473283772,TRUE,2,0,0.5,2,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,76,6,24400,17,1019,1601281438

It is inherently clear that Super Smash Bros. was the foundation Rivals of Aether was built upon, yet the end result is completely different from anything Nintendo has been able to create and what some may argue 're-create'.

A major difference between Smash Bros and RoA is the absence of shield and grab abilities. While that may sound like a major con, it is actually quite the opposite. The removal of those two basic features really brings out what I believe to be the original intent of the developer. COMBO'S, COMBO'S, and more COMBO'S!

Launching the tutorial mode also brings upon greater insight on just how different this game is from anythings within Super Smash Bros. franchise. Advance techniques such as wave-dashing and wave-landing are now treated as a fundemental part of 'normal' gameplay, rather than some glitch only high-level players found useful. In tutorial mode, you also discover that while the shield mechanic has been removed, it has been replaced with, what I personally believe to be a more technical function; that is of course the parry mechanic.  

Overall, I am glad to see the smash genre growing and heading in this direction. Even if this game goes nowhere, I hope that developers pick up where RoA left off.

Now that that's out of the way, this is a great game. It's known as a Smash clone, but that's largely because it's part of the same unexplored genre, commonly referred to as a platform fighter. Granted, it is a very specific genre, and one that Smash practically invented, and Rivals of Aether also borrows a few mechanics, but I digress. The game has numerous mechanics that make the game very easy to pick up, including a very well-made tutorial mode where your charming guide Orby explains everything about the game, from the difference between walking and running, to how to properly DI so you don't die to a sourspot back air, and more. However, don't think that you can finish the tutorial and then immediately start climbing the ladder on Ranked mode - the skill ceiling in this game is astonishing, and you can easily discern the difference between a scrub and a veteran. Newbies need not fear, however, as the game's active community, including Reddit and the official North American Discord group, are very welcoming and helpful.

¿Deberías comprar Rivals of Aether? La verdad,  si en algún punto de tu vida te ha gustado algún juego de la serie Smash este juego seguro que te encantara.[/h1]

·Pros:
-Jugabilidad tipo Smash pero con pequeñas variaciones que lo hacen crear un estilo propio
-Personajes Variados y cuando digo variados me refiero a que realmente cada personaje tiene una manera de jugar  diferente y que  hacen al personaje unico.
-El hecho de que sea un Early Access, nos prometen nuevos mapas, personajes y modos.
-La estética Pixel-Art: Detallada y bonita de ver. Animaciones muy trabajadas.
-Ranking Online, marcadores nacionales, tutoriales de juego y otros dedicados al manejo de los diferentes personajes.
-Se trata de un juego destinado al competitivo donde desde el principio te enseñan técnicas como tech, crouch-cancellling, wall-jumps, dash-dancing...
-60 FPS Baby!

·Cons:
-Dificultad para obtener una buena conexión al jugar online, tanto en ranked como en exhibición.
-El proceso de acostumbrarse a los controles ( la Y (del mando de Xbox( por dios juega con mando)) para saltar) y la entrada al online y el hecho de que te destrozen es complicado
-Actualmente el juego ofrece poco contenido  (esta review esta siendo escrita en 4 de Julio de 2016 y el juego se encuentra en su versión 0.14.1) Solo 8 personajes y 7 mapas, de momento el modo historia  se encuentra bloqueado pero parece que esta al caer.
-Esta en Early Acces, así que tu te arriesgas.

Dicho esto, ¿Deberías comprar Rivals of Aether? Te lo recomiendo.

This game is a perfect blend of Super Smash Bros. Melee's speed, with sm4sh's easy-to-learn, hard-to-master.

The online works well (better than some triple-A games). The matchmaking is nice.
It's furry smash bros. (if you're into that thing)

71,Rivals of Aether,23931439,english,"Rivals of Aether is one of my favorite games of all time right now, and I can honestly say that I actually like it better than Super Smash Brothers. I still play smash 4 just as much as this game, however smash 4 is not even close to this game in terms of balanced gameplay and competitiveness. Why do I say this? Well first I will describe a few game mechanics.

-The game focuses on the main mechanic of percent based health, the higher percent you are at, the more knockback your character experiences.
-There are 3 types of moves, Normal attacks (tilts), Special attacks( (specials), and Strong attacks (smash attacks). The Normal attacks and Strong attacks are on different buttons, and while this is a major change from Smashes smash attacks, I think its for the better. It is much easier to preform tilts and strong attacks without accidental interchanging them.
-Air dodging is very similar to melee's air dodging, except it does not put you in free fall.
-Since Air dodging is like melee, you CAN wavedash.
-There is no shielding. Instead, if you press the shield button, you do a parry, which will reflect projectiles and temporarily stun your opponent if they make physical contact with you. This mechanic makes the game much more aggressive and much less defensive, which is a good thing for fast and fun gameplay.
-While there is no shielding, rolling is still pretty much the same.

Those are the base mechanics of the game, however there is a few more features that I should note.
-Excellent Tutorial
-Online play that disciplines disconnecting mid match, and before you challenge someone you can deny because of their ping.
-The game Dev's are really nice and are super active in the community. Constant updates and very easy to reach out to them. I have seen multiple twitter polls and reddit threads that they have made asking the community how to balance the game and how to make it much more fun. And I can say that many if these polls have resulted in actual changes.
-Game has 8 characters. While that does not seem like much, it makes the game extremely easy to balance. The game is actually really balanced, and if one character becomes super overpowered, theres' at least one balance patch every month and it should fix it.
-Game supports both DInput and XInput. I connected gamecube controllers to the game easily.

Negatives? I have a really hard time thinking of any. Some of the only things I can think of is this game is very hard to get in to if you are new to completive fighting games, and the lack of characters. However both these things could be viewed as positives also.

All in all, if you like smash brothers and wish the game was more fair, balanced, and completive, please for the love of god buy this game.",1467222752,1467222971,TRUE,1,0,0.518605292,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,325,9,5354,0,624,1592103498

As a casual 2D fighter gamer (KOF, Street Fighter, Samurai Shodown etc), I'm suprised about the complexity of this type of games. The current gameplay in ROE beats Street Fighter 5 by miles.

Pros:
1. Simple command like mortal Kombat X (directional input; no 360/720)
2. Stage design is an important part of the game.
3. Movement is important in this game (don't commit suicide by jumping of the stage); hop, jump, jump cancel & recovery.
4. Main tactic seems to secure better location in stage (forcing player of the stage), parry attack to gain frame advantage and combo player to increase hit percentage (higher means  easier to force the player of the stage with strong attack hit)

Cons:
1. No clear tutorial on how to actually ""win"" the games. It assumes you're coming from the meele fighter community.
2. Difficult to separate command like down-tilt to moving down in a stage.
3. Still an ""early access game""; minimal content.

Highly recommended; even without sale discount.

It's a great game for a fighting game on Steam. You really can't beat it if you buy it on sale for $10 or less. I wouldn't pay a full $15 for a game that only has 8 characters and has DLC costumes already, though. Food for thought. 

-Pros

-Wavedashing, Who doesn't like wavedashing? -wish,woosh,wish,woosh-
-Lots of fun combos that can be strung together to create unique kill moves
-If you play competitive Smash you will move than likely enjoy this games mechanics (Its NOT Smash though)
-Netcode is pretty good but there aren't a lot of online players. If you're picking these up you should expect to play it locally with friends that come over or online with friends in your area. I'd suggest buying a copy for a friend if you pick this game up. (That's what I did)

-Cons

-Small character roster (at least characters work well)
-Already have DLC skins (I hate DLC with a passion) 
-No stage without platforms, this could easily be added and would help all players with developing their neutral game
-I haven't been able to find a single person to play with me that isn't on my friends list :/

2,Rivals of Aether,23644069,english,"Disclaimer: I came to this game from the Super Smash Bros series, I learned and mastered most of the advanced techniques from Melee and I learned fundamentals and spacing and making reads from Smash 4. I have no idea what this game is like to new players, or to casual players who don't constantly try to up their game, so I'm not going to speak for them.

I mainly came to Rivals of Aether because I needed a fresh new start. Playing Smash was getting self destructive, to the point where I would cry after every loss. RoA was an attempt to get back into the mechanics I loved, but maybe this time I wouldn't hate the game by the end of it. And you know what? It succeeded. I'll talk more about this later.

Rivals of Aether delivers all the depth and complexity of a Smash game with only 8 characters. Every moment of the game you're making a conscious decision in an attempt to counter whatever you predict the enemy will do. If they're going to attack, parry. If they're going to parry, wait a bit, then attack. If they're going to wait a bit, just attack. It maintains the rock-paper-scissors quality of other fighting games while increasing the pace and the satisfaction of reading your opponent correctly.

Every character is drastically different in how they play, accomadating for each playstyle, so you'll usually find yourself really just maining one character. If you're the fast offensive custom combo type who personally prefers the air, Wrastor has you covered. If you're the heavy hitter who wants to fill your opponent with shame every time you land a hit, Etalus is your character. If you want to piss off your opponent to the point where they can't think straight, well, actually every character does that

The interesting thing about this game is that every character has some quality about them that you can shift the blame to if you lose as them or against them. If he launches you offstage, Etalus can create armor for himself that allows him to take one hit without taking any knockback or flinching. Forsburn has that fucking smoke that he can create at will and basically prevent you from seeing him. Even the stage design has sense of cheapness to it, especially in the stages with high platforms that you can pretty much just camp on to stay safe most of the time. It's really easy to shift the blame onto a broken character or stupid weakness your character has, which might be good or bad depending on your personal viewpoints. I like it though.

One major complaint I have about this game is how unpopulated the game is. Seriously, I'll be waiting minutes just for a match in ranked. Which is why you have to get this game, I'm serious, if what I've said about this game has gotten you interested, buy this game and go on ranked right now so my chance of being able to face someone increases.

4,Rivals of Aether,23640482,english,"I bought this game, because my friend recommended it and I also really like SSBM; that is the same reason I tried hard to like it, but some things just aren't meant to be.

Positive:
[list]

[*] The necessary Tech-Skill ceiling is low, so even the low-level player is pretty consistent in his execution and your Melee Tech-Skill will carry over (atleast movement wise).

[*] It is developed to be a competetive fighter right of the bat, rather than a community made one.

[*] Better than Sm4sh / Brawl.

[*] High speed with lots of combos.

[*] There is no way to stall even a little bit, which together with high-speed and lots of combos creates a fast paced game.

[/list]

Negative:
[list]

[*] Defensive options are next to non-existant, you can completely ignore them, as DI-ing properly will still result in a 6 or more hit combo, thanks to imba Offensive options and parrying is almost as inconsistent as Power-Shielding every move.

[*] You will get combo'd hard very often, which can at times be frustrating. (Just imagine every character has Falco's punish game).

[*] I don't know if it's just me, but the stage-control moves all seem really... well janky to me. I know it is supposed to be original, but for me it does really take away the neutral game, as you can't zone or space effectively. To give an example: Apart from her Smashes, Maypul is a rather short ranged character, but she does make up for that with high speed and attacks that link really well into each other. Sounds familiar, right? Now she doesn't have a shine, but instead her down-special is a plant, that is placed on the ground and hits an enemy as soon as he gets in range. By placing it in the right place she can gain stage control easily and doesn't lose it, until the opponent gets hit by her plant, which coincidentally sets up for a combo, if she is within dash-range.

[*] There is literally no reward in learning Tech-Skill.

[*] The recovery/ledge system is not very intuitive. It's not straight up bad, like Sm4sh, where you live forever and  recover from anywhere, but it is making recovering unnecessarily hard and takes a rather long time to get used to.

[*] Some decisions seem rather questionable, like Absa's F-Tilt, that acts as an instant projectile that covers the whole stage in front of her (luckily there is no FD), Orcanes Puddle, allowing teleporting from anywhere or that you can instantly follow up Forsburns Dash-Attack with his Up-Smash, which can only be avoided by very good DI.

[*] Where the hell is Captain Falcon?! ... Okay I'm only semi-serious about this, but the killing point for me is, that there is no character that I personally have fun with.

10,Rivals of Aether,23512101,english,"[h1]EARLY ACCESS REVIEW:[/h1]

Rivals of Aether is considered by many to be a love letter to Super Smash Bros. However, it's actually the product of hardcore fans looking at all the games within the series and declaring, ""Hey, we could do better.""

Upon seeing this on Steam one fateful day, I just KNEW that I had to make a purchase. Combining the combo potential of 64, the speed, competitiveness, and meta of Melee (intentionally; wavedashing isn't a glitch in this game), the accessibility of Brawl and the fine-tuning of Sm4sh, as well as adding some unique flavor, some fans would even dare say that this game is superior to any Super Smash Bros game before it.

[b]What It Has Now[/b]

Rivals of Aether currently has all eight characters, a VS mode, a plethora of tutorials for newcomers and hardcore fans alike, about eight stages, controller support, and an online mode. The online is rather primitive, only allowing 1v1 battles as of the time of this writing, but ranked battles have recently been added.

What truly makes this game stand out are the fighters. Based after various animals, each character can control some aspect of nature; fire, smoke, water, ice, air, thunder, rocky earth, and plants. There are no ""clone"" characters in this game, as each contestant stands out as their own. 

The only thing I dislike is the fact that some characters (read: most) rely on some sort of central gimmick; Orcane relies on his puddles to teleport around the stage and attack, Absa uses her thundercloud to zone, and Forsburn uses his smoke to charge his attacks, as well as generally be sneaky. These character rely on this central aspect to succeed, which can make it difficult for new players who might think that all the attacks are disparate in nature.

[b]What It Will Have[/b]

The full version will have a Story Mode (complete with unlockable ""aether stories"" which act as codex entries), an Abyss Mode that functions as an endless gauntlet, and assumedly a fuller online experience. Currently, the devs have no plans for future characters, although they are open to suggestions on their website forums, which suggests that they simply don't have any more ideas for character designs.

Beyond that, there isn't much else. As this is an indie title, they are focusing on gameplay rather than content, especially since it is a fighting game.

[b]Will It Happen?[/b]

This game is made by dedicated fans of Smash. They already have all eight planned characters. All they need now are the Story and Abyss modes, an updated online mode that runs smoother and has a four player mode and a casual mode (perhaps combined into one), and some further character balancing. I think it is safe to say that the devs are halfway done. 

They have a website where they post updates to the game, and the latest update focused on fine tuning the online mode and adding tutorials for all skill levels. Updates move along at a consistent pace now, usually one every one or two months. There are no signs of abandonment so far, and I think it's safe to say that they will complete this game by the end of the year.

[b]Worth A Buy?[/b]

If you have an itch for local multiplayer, want some online action, or if you're one of those weirdos who can spend up to an hour in VS mode fighting the CPU (like me) then I suggest it. As far as fighting action goes, I think there is enough content for potential ROA fans to get their feet wet. If you're a Smash Bros fan who just wants to try something a little new, I'd also suggest buying. Dedicated devs, an active community, and a unique spin on the Smash formula make this worth trying out.

12,Rivals of Aether,23495889,english,"So, most people would say, ""Hey, isn't this just smash bros.?""
It is, and so much more!
Imangine smash bros, copypasting every gimmicky character into it
That's Rivals of Aether
The thing is, that the gimmicks are so diverse, that every character feels different (Except Zetterburn, Absa, and Etalus)
And, if you're into competitive Smashing like me, then this game will not only explain various skills such as teching, but also builld upon those said skills
For example, it wasn't until I purchased Rivals Of Aether that I used tilts
Before, I relied on ariels and charged attacks to ledge guard, and kill my enemy
I now realized that I could use tilts to help that process.
Also, there is so much to this game.
Just yesterday I discovered the tutorials. And although I know how to tech roll, DI, and fastfall, they're all a blast to playthrough, and pretty tough at sometimes
Now here come my complaints
Biggest one on this list, Zetterburn
He feels incredibly broken.
I have a strong dislike to this character. 
For me, he's incredibly hard to DI away from, he spits fire everywhere like me putting my mixtape out on the internet, and his spacing is incredible. Mix that in with the power to basically fill your anus with fire and then blow that same fire up, and you've got a broken character.
My secong complaint, I'll mix into one. 
Absa and Etalus
Absa feels way to gimmicky
Like, without her cloud, she's like Rosalina without her Luma
I can see Orcane without his puddle, yeah he kinda stinks, but I'll tell you two things,
One, I've won twelve matches without using the puddle once, (my friend challenged me to it,) and two, technically speaking, his puddle is just an enhancer, makes his moves better. Absa on the other hand...
And that brings my to Etalus. His problem? He's not gimmicky enough. I tried playing him, even read his info screen, (which I do with every character,) and I was still like, ""so where's the part where I find some cool way to combo this guy.""
And it never came.
Look, I'm willing to give both characters a chance, if they fix their seperate problems
My other complaints are more about the game then about the charcters
WHY DO YOU TEASE US WITH THINGS LIKE STORY MODE?
LIKE, IT JUST SITS THERE ALL LOCKED UP AND I WANNA PLAY IT SUPER BADLY
BUT I CAN'T
Lastly, I'm kinda sad over the fact that the roster is complete. I feel like there are so many more characters to be added, I could think of some, but then they'd be furrys
Should you buy this game?
Positively
If you like fighting games, then you might as well prepare your wallet.
And even if you don't, this game is still great and an awesome time killer.
Y'know, just hop and and play a couple of matches.
Also, if you're into competitive smash, but can't get used to it, I suggest Wrastor. (Not because he's my favorite or anything.) His multiple jumps allow you to get used to air combos fairly quickly
Also check out their DLC
I think they should advertise it, because I didn't realize it existed till I was watching one of Alpharad's videos and I was like, ""Hey wait, where can I get that?""
I bought all three, despite the fact that I picked up Maypul for a day then stopped using her.
They're so unique, they even do something special with the character!
Might I suggest spangled Wrastor.
His special thing is, how do I put it?

Rivals of Aether (ROA) is a  platform fighter that's heavily based off of the Smash Brothers franchise, but it has its own elements that make ROA very different, such as the lack of shields and ledges to name a few. I also believe that this games development is fully considering the competetive players. That's not to say that casual players such as a group of friends or family won't find it fun, as the core mechanics are easy enough to learn but hard enough to master to get the balance between ease and skill ceiling. 
In my opinion, this game sits in the middle of Melee and Smash4, the two most played games of Smash Bros. It has the ability to become technical at times where combo heavy characters can flourish, like in Melee. But, there is also a much higher need for careful thinking before acting, like in Smash4. The recent inclusion of ranked play with leaderboards makes winning and losing count many times more than before. Finally, the ability for almost any controller or keyboard to connect and work is an absolute joy. I would not have bought this game if I could not use my GameCube controller with it (which will work with adapters, including Nintendo's. Just Google how to make it work.)
As for bugs and glitches, I can say only once has my game crashed and the bugs that I have not encountered are being taken out by the dedicated dev team.

Rivals of Aether is not one of those games.

Rivals is a game designed by and for fans of the SSB franchise who want a platform fighter that plays to the strengths of the more fast-paced and competitive entries in the series, particularly melee. It is built upon the foundation of the competitive melee community, even using a default ruleset that emulates that of melee tournaments (best of 3 sets, set to timed stock matches) and takes many techniques that are central to melee gameplay and encourages them (where the later smash bros games removed them).

That isn't to say that this game is only for competitive melee players or even for people who enjoy melee - it brings a great deal of new and innovative gameplay concepts to the table by designing each character's moveset specifically around their effects on the stage itself (Wrastor's whirlwind allowing him to move faster and be more dominant, Zetterburn's flames allowing him to lay traps, Orcane's allowing him to move around the stage at will).

51,Rivals of Aether,22919375,english,"Consider this game to be an 8-bit a game where Super Smash Bros and Avatar the Last Airbender got hit with a fusion spell. With an underwhelming cast of 8 characters, it never feels dull considering the beautiful environments, great soundtrack, and the fact that said characters have unique, elemental abilities that afftect the stage in a unique way. This allows you to dictate how the fights go or eve change the tides of battle. 

The 8-bit style is creative and visually appealing, but not distracting. The controls themselves are pretty tight, similar to that of Melee. My only problem with this game so far is that you cannot set custom control preferences. This can be very tedious as this means you will have to configure your button layout every time, even if you only plan to play for a couple minutes.

This is clearly a game with a large learning curve as you will have to learn combos, mobility with the full and short hop, as well as dodging and parries. With that in mind, the game allows you to either play casually or competitively by adjusting stages to be aether (which there are things that happen around the stage itself) or basic (which allows you to play without shenanigans).

Either the in-game hurtbox/hitbox visualizers are broken, or the hurtboxes/hitboxes themselves. You will constantly see moves with no visual representation of a hit (i.e. Wrastor's wing during his fair not touching the opponet, but them still receiving damage+knockback). This leads to a frustrating amount of moments in which someone made the correct play, spaced a move the way it SHOULD be spaced, but still gets hit.

Riding on the coat-tails of the broken boxes is the absurd amount of trading moves in this game. A ""trade"" is when two players throw out moves without clanking (when two moves hit each other, make a ""clank"" noise, and nullify each other) but both players taken damage+knockback. There are some situations where trades make sense - you throw out a move that touches the opponets hurtbox without touching the hitbox of his move and vice versa. You will encounter, however, many more situations that just leave you scratching your head saying ""That's actually physically impossible.""

The controls have an elegant simplicity that grants the game its appeal and low skill floor. Simply input a direction and one of the attack buttons simultaneously to perform an attack in that direction. There are three attack buttons corresponding to tilts, strong attacks and special attacks. The same controls apply universally to all characters and they all share quite similar tilts and strong attacks, so that once you learned to play with one character, you can find your bearings with any of them.

There are only 8 characters but each has a pretty unique moveset with some specific quirks, especially when it comes to special attacks. This can be both great and somehow bothering at the same time. Great because every character has a distinct playstyle and everyone is guaranteed to find at least a few tailored to them among this small but varied cast. Bothering because it steepens the learning curve for two reasons when compared to Smash. First, it slightly gets in the way of skill transfer from character to character. Secondly, matchups knowledge becomes more important.

By no means I want to give the impression that this is an actual issue and that the game is in fact hard to learn, it is still very easy to pick up, it only makes it harder to master. And yet, RoA brings some of its own simplicity to the genre. It pares down the mechanics and trims the formula to its essential components by removing grabs, edge grabbing, L-cancelling, shields (replaced with parries), … What remains at the core is a streamlined gameplay that prominently features exhilarating kickass combos.

The result is a mechanically tight game with a low skill floor, high skill ceiling, and a learning curve sloped to quickly and comfortably project players towards the more fast paced, technical and competitive side of platform fighters.

I absolutely recommend this game to anyone who prefers Melee to other Smash games. This is the closest you will get on PC. It manages to capture both the simplicity and depth that I enjoyed in Melee while still having its own flavor and charm.

Although it isn’t a party game and is definitely positioned towards the competitive end of the spectrum, I also strongly recommend it to newcomers. I mostly play casually with friends at my skill level, and even so I enjoy it much more than the few other alternatives on PC. The action is fast paced, the combos you can pull off even as a beginner are really awesome, and it’s overall extremely fun.",1460818288,1460818506,TRUE,21,1,0.721909344,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,424,15,5559,0,1429,1565861387

I have since seen it for much more than that though. Smash fans will feel comfortable with the 2-D arena combat. The combat system is also easy to grasp while offering a lot of diversity to spice up gameplay. There is no doubt that this game utilizes a combo system that allows for really sweet and punishing combos. If you spend time with this game, you will quickly find all of the characters offer something unique and useful with their special moveset. 

If you want a game that you can play with friends, this is perfect. With Rival of Aether's amazing controller compatibilty, I was able to use an xbox 360 controller and a PS3 controller (with the right drivers) and play with my friends right from my couch with no hassle. I have found that the most preferred controller it seems to be is the use of Gamecube controllers. I would say the Gamecube controller offers a really responsive experience. Not to mention all button configurations, and sensitivity settings are easily setup and saved by profile (much like the smash bros. profile/button system, but easier to access). 

I am very optimistic about the future of this game. I think it's a true beauty in it's current state, and I'm now a dedicated fan (as well as have turned many others into fans) and will be following this game all the way through it's development.

4,Rivals of Aether,21980993,english,"As a competitive Smash Bros player(#2 in my country) I think this game is insanely bad and I'm saying this because I've put 90+ hours into it. At first people think it's amazing and I also thought so but after around 30 hours you start to realize the game's issues. Bad mechanics, extremely bad character design and weird stages. Wouldn't recommend to anyone.

It DOES feel like a good game at first, don't get me wrong. But once you realize it's weaknesses you'll regret buying it and probably go back to Smash as soon as possible.

Okay, I can elaborate.

Bad mechanics:

Parry: Parry is a fighting game mechanic and it's good in some games such as Street Fighter series or Pokken, where it actually works. In a platform fighter like RoA however, it doesn't work. It's basically powershield but worse because smallest mistake can lead to a 0-death combo. If you're playing Smash 4, you know Bayonetta has a similar move called Witch Time which is essentially RoA parry. You know what happened when they added that move to Smash 4? Everyone got crazy over it and now they're considering actually banning Bayonetta because she has a parry. That's how BAD parry is in a platform fighter game. In these kind of games(RoA, Smash 4 etc.) there are moves which are high risk high reward, and low risk low reward. In Smash games, there are shields and if you commit to a low reward move, you'd expect to get punished lightly. But if you commit to a high reward move and get shielded, you'd expect to get punished heavily. In RoA, parry completely shits on this balance and makes every move high risk, because parrystun is the same even if the move is a high risk move, or a low risk move. This essentially makes the game extremely defensive, to the point where whoever hits first might get punished too heavily so both players would have to play too carefully. I don't see a high-level future for this game simply because of this mechanic. 
Random meteor hitboxes: For the sake of making some characters go for crazy hype  meteors and stuff, all hitboxes that goes downwards were given a meteor hitbox. This makes characters like Zetterburn(up-b) or Kragg(nair) meteor the other characters randomly for no reason. Completely unintentionally too. This isn't too much of a big deal but I'd expect a fighting game to be a little more consistent. I like examples of games where you do things and those things work as you meant. In RoA that isn't the case.

Bad character design:
 
Absa and Orcane:The developer seems to be confused about how the game should be played. He makes zoning heavy characters that punishes approaches, then realizes these characters slows down the game and nerfs them. Shuts down what they have and makes them unusable in high level play. Absa got nerfed twice, and Orcane got nerfed three times. Their zoning tools got nerfed heavily, for no reason. These characters' movesets and designs all compliment to a zone-heavy defensive gameplan. Then he weakens them and buffs other tools they have to make them play more offensively. It doesn't make sense. Very bad design choices by dan fornace. (They should've stood the way they were)

Proves that the Smash formula is a recipe for success, and while it is truer to its influence (unlike games such as Brawlhalla), it just goes to show that melee-like gameplay is solid on its own and doesnt need to be changed. the game feels extremely tight, characters control amazingly, and I don't feel too limited by the engine. balance is okay, and the netplay is extremely solid. this is an awesome game that has been designed incredibly well, and has enough depth to remain interesting.

BUT --- and a big BUT, -- it also feels a bit empty. characters are a little gimmicky and I feel it lacks the depth its father games have, with its removal of many mechanics without new ones to compensate. it won't replace Smash for me, but maybe if they gave the game a few more quirks, I would feel differently. right now, it's a great side-game to Smash but I just cant see it having the same insane depth that keeps me fully invested in a way Smash does. 

in a way, it doesnt have the same ""happy-accident"" feeling. you can tell that all the mechanics are HIGHLY deliberate. while this helps to streamline the gameplay, i feel like they've forgotten all the wacky engine quirks from Smash and are compensating with much more unique character movesets -- which is a good concept, but it makes me feel like the playstyle for each character is far more narrow, since I don't feel the same freedom Melee's vast pool of techniques gives me.

tl;dr, great arcadey fighter, but if you're looking to delve competitively, I would pick up Melee or Project M. this game just simply isnt deep enough to remain interesting forever. there's a reason Melee's scene lasted 15 years, and I don't know if i trust this game will do the same",1458109720,1458109720,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,127,2,2126,0,1523,1539043220

The trailers truly do not do the pace of this game justice. It is way quicker and more combo intense than even both trailers let on.

It is an incredible combination of Melee movement and Smash 64 hitstun. This comes together in the form of incredible combos that can sometimes be 0 to death if you read peoples techs and DI properly. 

YES! THERE IS DI. Combo DI and Smash DI. There is wavedashing, wavelanding, edge cancelling, reverse aerial rush, some characters can jump cancel, theres a character with a double jump cancel and the 8th character can DACUS. Ignore the negative reviews. The lack of shielding makes this an incredibly strategic and aggressive game and the latest patch really made camping difficult and the balance of the game has never been better! The negative reviewers need to GET GOOD. Learn to parry god dammit!

 There is no ledge, every character has a wallkick that refreshes your recovery and the recoveries in rivals are insane so edge guarding is incredibly fun. There are no items. The stages are all playable and there are no ""banned"" stages. Hazards can be put on for fun but they are always disabled in online play and in fact ive never seen them used. 

This game is a love letter to competetive smash fans and i am incredibly passionate about it and would hate to see people turned away by comments like ""i cant parry good enough games imba!!111""

I would only suggest this game to anyone if they really enjoy playing smash and only smash, comparing this to other fighters is just impossible.

other notes:

I really hate pressing a button to jump especially when its bound to Y. Sorry bethesda.

Playing with a fightstick i ran into the game still recognising stick imput ghosting, Hold stick right and let go it will still keep going for a few milliseconds after release even causing you to run off ledges right when the game starts if you just let it do its thing, i was able to recreate this problem 36/50 tries, it even does the same with the cursor in character select. 

Only 2 people fighting at a time, for this kind of game i was hoping for 4 player combat. 

Because of the way the controlls of the game work its alot of work to even position yourself properly to even hit your enemy and with most of the moves having these delays, just missplacing yourself out of reach to hit your enemy, a problem i haven't had in any fighting game including smash itself,

Playing a game is supposed to bring you excitement and you enjoy playing them, but with this all im getting is dissapointment that i wasted $15 on a game i probably would never play again based on its lackluster and barely working mechanics.",1457395284,1457395284,FALSE,3,0,0.451865911,1,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,536,7,628,0,150,1577584132

Although the game is a bit short on content at the moment, the online matchmaking and local multiplayer are really fun.

Pros:
- Characters have a ton of depth. They're easy to learn, but nearly impossible to master.
- One of few in this kind of ""push your opponent off the stage"" genre on PC.
- Frequent updates and patches to balance characters (all characters are viable).
- Awesome controls. Very responsive and fast.
- Rebind keys for controller and KB+M
- Many reused mechanics from Melee so it won't be too hard to be good at both games.
- Beautiful pixel art.

Cons:
- Very, very dry on content. (hopefully by the full release it'll all be there, but if you're looking for content definitely don't buy this until the full release)
- Matchmaking seems to be kinda wonky for me. I keep getting put up against really good players, but that might be just because I'm super bad.

-Perfect online code for an indie game. 
-Very nice and memorable 16 bit music
-A very cool and very diverse roster to relate yourself with and all of them share a few moveset seen in smash bros.
-Not a smash bros clone; it's a different game, different feel... As in dota 2 is not like Lol.
-I coudln't tell if this game was in Early Access, i only found out after a long session of gameplay.

Cons
-Controls are not exactly like it is in smash bros so you must get used to the changes.
-No ranking as of yet; be prepared to lose again and again...

Style:

This game reminds me of Megaman more than Smash bros because of the sound effects. 

When you die, same sound effect as when you die in a megaman game. Each stages looks like a bit of what you usually see in a megaman game. 
With that said, you will have the impression that each enemies come from a megaman game(the bosses). I know, i sound like a broken record by now, but if you play it yourself, you will eventually get it.

Gameplay and differences from Smash bros:

-Blocking has been removed and replaced with a parry. On parry, your opponent become unable to move for a split second which leaves you enough time to counter-attack.
-You can no longer use grapples and theres no grapple-type character.
-For the melee freaks, you can wave-dash and it's a lot more easier to perform. 
-You can perform Air-dodge only once while in mid-air. Afterwards, you can do anything else while still in mid-air.
-After Up+special(Up+B smash bros), you can only do it again if you bounce off the wall and you can no longer edge-guard.
-Extremely reliant on juggles-combos. 

ROA vs SB: 

More like melee, but you don't feel like you must exploit the game to win and while everything is easy to perform (including wave-dashes), high level play is still a very long way after you feel confident enough.

I personally find this game to be a lot more addictive than any other smash bros game; even the online net-code is better than the one found in smash 4.",1454861052,1454861052,TRUE,14,1,0.605550408,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,76,14,3300,0,1014,1493219579

8,Rivals of Aether,20979651,english,"Basically a Smash game with amazing netplay. Rarely have lagging matches. Parry adds another level of mindgames once you get good at it as it might seem whiff punishing, rushdown, and zoning are the best strategies when you first start it. Combos are easy against bad opponents, which there are a lot of online. This game's level of fun is inversely proportional to the disparity of skill between both players, meaning if you're too good or fight really bad players, the game might start to lose its spark for you. However, if you can find good opponents, this game will always be fun and never lose its luster. Definitely worth the buy if you're not a casual and enjoy competitive games. Keeps the pace of a fast Smash 4 match as shielding isnt an option. My only critique is that there isn't a grab button.

It should only be able to throw the opponent up or down OR and shouldn't lead to a kill, but a small percent increase with the potential to increase combos given the player makes the correct read with unchanging knockback that is fast and forces the opponent to choose between missed tech, tech in place, or tech left/right.

Do you love Super Smash Brothers and want more?

Then play Rivals of Aether! It is a lot of fun to play another fighting game that uses the creative formula of smash.

Unlike other Smash Clone games, it is hard to call this game that. It is made very well. It has creative attacks and ablities like smash attacks in air(Wraster), fire that allows you to power up your smash attacks(Zetterburn), or being able to be a liquid organism that makes people scared of puddles! (Guess who that is...) Also, this game has an awesome and easy combo system. The game plays like smash, but with more hitstun and less knockback. That means lots of combos that require strategy to avoid.

The issue comes in the form of errors. Errors appeared alot when I was playing this game. That really made it fell cheap when the game so well crafted.

However, the errors don't appear too often. It is too much fun anyway, so it is worth it to play the game. Even if those errors are an issue.

Overall, I give this game a 4/5! Play it when the full version releases. So far, the game is worth $2.00 at it's current build.",1452399704,1452399902,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,29,8,22076,546,253,1602086555

77,Rivals of Aether,20315666,english,"Okay, so instead of my usual gushing over smash stuff, here's my pros and cons list
Pros:
[*]The netplay is really good. Got a bad connection? the worst you're looking at is some pause hiccups inbetween combat, so pretty seamless, so a lot like KI's if you've played it
[*]Melee tech is MUUUUCH easier to pull off, minus the L-cancelling, because this game decided landing lag isn't a good thing to put in a game (good job, Dan). Dash dancing, shuffling and wave dashing are as easy as pressing two buttons together at the same time... probably because it is
[*]Every character is unique, and has their own learning curb. This makes learning every character and their mech-tech (* ahem * mechanic technique) pretty fun, and they're easy to grasp and use, and only a little harder to start incorporating in combo play
[*] Does NOT take a strong computer to run, you'd probably guess that from the spec list before, but my experience with most spec lists are liiies
[*]D-pad play feel. 'nuff said. (Really though, I never use d-pad in fighting games, and I feel much better using it here, despite it being a lot like smash)

That being said, there are some things that I found less than stellar (which I'm sure will be fixed down the line, in which case, I'll just remove this whole thing)
Cons:
[*]Absa reminds me of Rosalina. All the control, little weakness. There are few instances where I would think of a character needing nerfing(although, in smash 4s case, they all need to be BUFFED)
[*]Full screen seems to give it a hard slow down for some reason. (that might just be my laptop though, so if someone corrects me on that, I'll cross this off)

tl;dr Buy this game. That's it. It's a GREAT game that deserves as many people interested in it, competitive or casual.

82,Rivals of Aether,18303284,english,"If you like smash bros, you will like this. it's pretty much the same game with fresh new characters and ideas. It take skill, but I would probably say less than smash, but that is just due to the amount of time that people have been playing it and had experiance with it. Also, the inputs are easier compared to melee, for instance. This game is like somehwere in between PM/melee and brawl/smash 4 and the devs have nearly hit the sweetspot.  this game is fairly balanced, though I do have a few things to pick on and say to the contrary.

(EDIT: below I complain about forsburn. He is not the easies to play but he is very strong, I have come to realize. He is a top tier character and this game is very well balanced for the most part.. people used to think fors and maypul were bad but it turns out they are the best in the game. All the other characters are still competitive, though. The opinions below were premature and do not reflect the current meta, but a much earlier one; they also reflect how I felt as a less skilled player. If you like fast paced platform fighting and competitive play get this game. the cast is small but that is for balance reasons. THe cast is very diverse while small, and this game has given me some of the best experiences of any I've ever played. The community is very good for the most part. I have literally added 80 to my friendslist through this game)

This game is great but it defnitely needs a few tweeks. I play forsburn, probably one of if not the hardest characters in the game, and while I am happy with him, it is hard not to fall prey to  the rest of the cast, particularly wrastor and zetterburn. 
Heck he has a hard time agains most everybody. Once you get to learn how to play him, things do get easier and more doable, but it's not hard for things to become and uphill battle if your opponent know what they are doing as well. I think he requires a bit more awareness and reads, which is not bad i guess, but it is also true of bowser, the worst char in melee. 

So I think forsburn may be a bit underpowered, but that may just speak to the difficulty of playing him. its not that his moves are super bad, they are just easier to punish than most other characters.

The rest of the cast seems really tight. wrastor is ridiculous but they just nerfed him so.....  not gonna go any further than that. Not that the rest of the cast isnt great. wrastor can just wall you out, his moves have a ton of priority and range, and he can through out tons of them.

This is a multiplayer 2D fighting beatem up game. There are several characters (These are my names not the actual names) like Flame Lion, Skull Demon, Rocket Raccon, Rock Beatle, Dolphin with legs, Falco, and my personal fav and the chatacter I am wanting to main, Satan. Each ""rival"" has a light attack, heavy attack, and a special, each changing with the up or down movement of the rival. The character is delt damage in percent, and flys farther away with increasing percent. It is very much like Smash bros, and the other game I have to compair to on Steam is Brawlhalla. Even though its gameplay is very simelar, it is very much worth the money. Its the closest to smash on PC, and with RoA and Brawlhalla a PC gamer can get almost the entirety of the smash experance for a fraction of the price without using emulators or ROMs. 
The new smash is 60$ and a WiiU exclusive, and a little over a year ago I got Melee on gamecube for 90$. This is 15$ and brawlhalla is Free to play.

Rivals of Aether is one of my favorite fighting games ever, topped only by Super Smash Bros. Smash fans will find themselves at home with its similar style and mechanics. Even some technical terms are relevant in this game, such as Teching, Dash Dancing, and Wavedashing. It supports Xbox controllers, but it's terrible to play with it. You can actually get some Nintendo controllers with this game, like the Gamecube Controller, Wii U Pro Controller, and the Wii U Gamepad. I'll explain how to do that at the end of the review.

There are some things missing, though. Well, more like one thing, but it's something many other fighting games have, including Smash. Grabs. You can't grab. That's the only con aside from the lack of content, which is forgivable since the game is still in Early Access.

SCORE: 95/100

FINAL NOTES
Get it if you're a fan of Smash and want something fun to play.

28,Rivals of Aether,19894688,english,"I've played an absurd amount of Super Smash Brothers Melee competitively, and when and Project M was released I was happy to give that a shot and it was neat. The big issue with the two is that the communities are small and online ones even less. When I heard of ROA I was excited. Looking at online videos it looked somewhat promising, so I figured I'd give it a go and support the dev in hopes of an alternative to SSBM and Project M. After dissecting the game in its current state and playing online many hours I've arrived to the following conclusion:

If you're expecting great gameplay like the two games mentioned above, Rivals of Aether will not deliver. 

Here's biggest reasons why:

==Spam friendly==
  -You can get big % by chain dash attacking your opponent or just using gimmicks (skillful right?). Online gameplay is swarmed with people dash spamming with Maypul, Orcane, and Zetterburn.
  -A lot of moves have little recovery frames which leads to rewarding mindless attack spamming. This also leads to easy air juggles. Many characters can do air 2-3 air attacks in one jump. So you can just spam airs while jumping no problem. Online you'll probably run into an average skilled Zetterburn that will dish out 70% damage by dash attack spamming, short hop air spamming onto his neutral B to accomodate. If you've played Melee, you'll relate when I say I constantly feel like I'm playing against Sheik players (low skilled dash + tilt spammers).
  -Some dashes or tilts can be cancelled right into smashes which will connect.
  -Can't crouch-cancel weak attacks or dash attacks, so you'll just eat more of them if you try to as you'll end up DI'ing downwards instead.

== Lacks mechanics ==
  -There is no block mechanic or grab mechanic, which skews gameplay to be all about offense. These mechanics would allow punishing dash spamming or any noob friendly behavior. All you're left with is ""parrying"" your opponents moves or gimmicks. So if you're playing against a Maypul dash dancing and dash attack spamming, you better have great reflex or be able to predict your opponent. Also, keep in mind that when you parry any move that has more than one attack (like neutral standing attacks) your opponent can cancel out of the parry into a roll and punish you for trying to punish.

The skill curve for this game is easy and the skill ceiling is low. Any skilled veteran SSBM or PM player can easily 3/4 stock an average player, but in ROA whoever can spam better wins.

TL;DR
ROA is a noob-friendly game full of rewarding spamming and gimmicks, while lacking mechanics which makes the game have a flatter skill curve. I would not recommend the game as it stands (Version 0.0.9).",1450925063,1450925824,FALSE,8,1,0.57352078,3,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,172,6,2614,0,1577,1582083873

Rivals of Aether is probably one of the best smash clones around ive got 44 hours on it nearly and im still enjoying every minute of it.
What makes Rivals of Aether stand out is that all the characters are able to add to the environment somehow or another whether its through leaving a fog you cant see into, a puddle that can be blinked out of or a giant pillar blocking the path.
This adds a very unique feel every match because everybody can use these skills differently.
Its got extremely satisfying sprites each with a plethora of recolours to choose from. 
Each stage is made very well and making it so you can play each match a different way.
Pros:
Great Gameplay
Fantastic looking sprites
Unique Characters
Different feel to each stage
Has offline multiplayer
Tons of recolours
Fun Soundtrack
Great for casual play
Cons:
Its still very much being worked on
Online can sometimes be a pain with all the lag
No arcade mode yet

63,Rivals of Aether,19557895,english,"Rivals of Aether is a Super Smash Bros inspired platform physics based fighting game. It is not a total Smash clone, however and there are many things to separate it from Smash. The most common thing across games is the percentage mechanic, the emphasis on combos and strategy, and things like teching and DI.
How the game works:

You choose one of 7 characters so far, and play on a stage that is a platform with other little platforms, boxes, etc.

Here's what to do:
1. Rack up damage through combos and strategy (like punishing players when they mess up, openings you find)
2. Make sure that doesn't happen to you through defensive strategies like rolling, dodging and parrying (a mechanic not found in Smash!).
3. Do the above but this time with a kill move or ""smash"" (in this game ""strong"") attack to launch the opponent off-screen, or have them fall off the stage by other means.

Rivals of Aether is about stage control like Smash, but unlike the newest installment, SSB for Wii U, this game favors offense more, which bring mechanics that are now absent from Smash like directional air-dodging, that in turn brings things like wave-dashing from Smash Bros Melee. There is more control over your character (they don't slide as much as they do in SSB4) and combos are easier to hit because of increased hit-stun (the time before your character can do something like dodge or attack back) and moves have negligible landing-lag, which makes defensive players who are used to shielding in Smash not able to punish successfully shielded moves as easy. Parrying replaces shielding, which is an instant guard that stuns the other player, but the frames (the actual frames in gameplay that determine whether your action works or not) are slightly different from what is expected with Smash.


In conclusion, if you want a fairly balanced game that doesn't adore For Glory Link spammers who shield your moves, only to then grab (no grabbing and throwing in this game!) and pull off easy-bake combos, get this game. It has local multiplayer, (a plus for PC!) online, and as of this review, the game is still in Early Access, which means more content, balancing and gamemodes to come.",1449538885,1449538885,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,21,3,714,0,160,1478472405

The cast has very few characters, but this honestly helps with the game's approach with each character revolving around a specific gimmick such as; Orcane's teleportation, Frosburn's cloning and Wrator's midair smash attacks. I do belive as of no some characters do need to be nerfed *cough* Absa *cough* the ballance is mostly fair. Even though the game is still in developement it does lack things such as a campaign but the modes are still displayed on the menus to tell the player what's to come.

84,Rivals of Aether,19421397,english,"I REALLY wanted to like this game. I did. But as it stands, it's far too gimmicky. Online play is very laggy due to P2P without region lock, and about 60% of your games will involve one side or the other suiciding to avoid the terrible lag. But the bigger issue is that the characters are all very gimmick based. Zetterburn can KO characters at 60% if he sets them on fire (and considering every one of his special moves spreads fire, isn't very difficult), Kragg isnt killable until he hits close to 200% and can just spam attacks that don't even allow you to approach him, and Orcane just down airs you into oblivion. Worse is that the other half of the issue isn't in their strengths, its in their weaknesses. Sure, the idea of Maypul's recovery is cool, but its easily telegraphed, as is Orcane's recovery. This doesn't necessarily mean any characters are over or underpowered, just that... well, if you can light someone on fire and destroy them immediately, why would you ever do anything else? Which I feel means that at the lower to average level of plays, there is little to no variety. Everyone spams fire and strong attack on Zetterburn, pillars on Kragg, side specials on Maypul, etc. I feel like the game devs wanted to make a game for a competitive scene, so they said ""eh, if you're really good at the game, none of these things are an issue."" Which is all fine and dandy, but if you don't want to be a pro RoA player, the game is very unforgiving, and often is very unenjoyable. Parrying is a cool mechanic in the game, but is very difficult to time, and, if there is even a shred of input lag, is worthless. And it feels like every one of those ""OP"" attacks only counterplay is to parry... So there is no counterplay. Get your opponent into a juggle combo of attacks before he does the same to you or its gg.

TLDR: Lots of lag issues, every character has a gimmick rather than just being naturally well-rounded, devs try to appeal more to the competitive side which makes it a poor game for the average gamer.

Typically we'd play Super Smash Bros. 4, but after playing it for a year and a heavy portion of salt over the last couple months we needed a breath of fresh air and Rivals may have saved RHS Smash Club from dissipating!

Just moving around in Rivals feels amazing. The lack of shields and grabs allows you to spend more time on mobility and air combos. Personally, in Smash 4, I got pretty sick of going for an aerial attack only to realize it’s a futile endeavor and end up getting punished by a shield grab.

I surprisingly enjoy local play more than online. Althought it is fun every once in a while to go online and totally destroy someone, I still enjoy playing with my friends on the same PC more. Being with people and having friends to play with locally makes this game much more fun as you can do 2v2s, which can lead to some amazing and really funny combos. I hooked an old PC i had to a tv using an HDMI cable and love it. The large TV screen is much more realistic when playing with multiple people locally, but it is possible to play on a monitor. 

This game is amazing, take my word for it. Even if you have not played smash brothers, check out super smash flash or a game similar to that.

8,Rivals of Aether,19270426,english,"Note: I play exclusively online, so the review applies to online play only.

If I wrote this review when the game first came out it would have been a thumbs up and a glowing review. But I cannot recommend this game as it has some serious flaws.

1. The netcode is atrocious and is not anywhere near appropriate for a fighting game. Inputs get dropped, input delay changes on the fly, and each player will experience lag differently. I have fought many times where the player I was fighting was getting lag and input drops but I didn't feel a thing, and vice versa.
2. The characters are way too gimmicky. This is very fun when you first play the game and you get to see how unique each character is, but eventually it becomes boring and turns into ""each character has one play style and X number of auto/near auto combos you must do to be competitive.""
3. Due to the character gimmicks, the game is mostly about hard counters. It feels like most matchups are 7/3. For example, Zetteburn v Kragg is ridiculously in Kraggs favor.
4. At an advanced level, combos can be cool, but in order to be newbie friendly, way too many simple and boring combos exist that feel cheap, especially when you miss a tech due to online delay. I'm specifically referring to Forsburn and Zetteburn sprint spam, Wrastor bair spam, Forsburn and Zetteburn uair & fair spam. You end up seeing and using the same combos over and over and over because they work. Originality only has a place in the very top % of players.
5. The parry mechanic is an original idea with a terrible implementation. Parry is spammable, and landing a parry vs a player at a high % is essentially a guaranteed kill.

It's early access, these issues can be fixed. I'll update my review accordingly if the issues do get fixed. But for the time being, I'm putting this game down. The frustration of dealing with the subpar netcode and lack of balance vastly outweighs any fun.",1448478485,1448478485,FALSE,11,0,0.509427845,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,238,7,5900,13,5700,1601409641

35,Rivals of Aether,19119321,english,"I love this game, It's the greatest smash inspired game to ever come out. The game is extremely smoosth and unlike other smash like games, this one does it right.

Pros

Great gameplay and mechanics.

No sheilding creating more offensive play.

Few characters, but all are unique and fun with none of them being too OP (Krag is not that bad people)

The stages are interesting and fun to play on with both a tournament/competitive version and a fun casual weird style.

All characters have something unique about them and are each easy to pick up but hard to master.

The game includes wavedashing but unlike melee it's not needed to be a good player, just there if you would like to play more competitively.

The movesets of the characters are things you would never see from a traditional smash game, making it see one of a kind.

Great servers and online connection, very little lag if any, the only type of lag would be from you having a bad internet, not the servers.

Cons

Not as many characters as I would like, though they will be brought in eventually.

Even the level 9 AI is easy to beat, making online the only real place to practice, and if you're downloading something then it might suck.

No way to see players steam profile after a match if you want to friend them to have a good practice partner.

These are all minor complaints for what is a fantastic game, from someone who is highly into the competitive smash scene(Going to local tournaments and practicing online constantly) I have to say that I like this game more than smash. It's easier to pick up, and with less character and more room to focus on each match up, much easier to get into competitively.

43,Rivals of Aether,19023932,english,"While I have a love/hate relationship with its online mode, I absolutely adore this game.

The first thing you need to know about this game is that it is a ""Smash clone"". However, it is not a Smash clone. I'll let that sink in. If you come expecting a platform fighter with fast-paced yet deep gameplay, this is the game for you. If you came looking for a game with shields, grabs, or ledge mechanics, prepare to be disappointed.

There are other reviews here that go more into detail. Suffice it to say, this game is very fun, and plays very fast. Combos are king, and it isn't always noob-friendly. If you keep at it, though, you will find a very rewarding and engaging fighting game. Best played on the couch with 1 to 3 friends, though the online is serviceable, albeit not amazing.

Expect lag in your online matches, but do your best to move on. This is probably the best advice I can give the enterprising Rivals player. The netcode is still in the works (remember, this is Early Access), so it's not perfect. Fixes have been promised. I, for one, am optimistic.

Finally, I restate, this is an Early Access title. From what I've seen of others, it is a pretty darn solid Early Access title. Little content means the game is what you make of it, but the gameplay (arguably the vast majority of a fighting game) is incredibly tight and polished. A lot of stuff isn't perfect, but the devs are hard at work and publish patches semi-regularly.

A few ""Quick Hits""
[*] There are only 6 characters. There will be 7 come 11/19/2015, and 8 by full release
[*] There are only 5 stages. Some are great, some are meh. This will vary depending on your character
[*] Shields are replaced by parries. If you hit one of the shoulder buttons (or the equivalent on the keyboard), you will have a short window of time where enemies who hit you will be stunned.
[*] Ledge Grabs are replaced by wall jumps. Hit the jump button while moving toward the wall, and you will jump off. This allows you to airdodge and up-b again. Very helpful, but a little hard to grasp at first

All in all, even if you only get a handful of hours out of this game, it is only 15 bucks. That may be steep for some, but with the amount that I have enjoyed playing this game, I easily would have paid even double that. If you're not convinced, wait until the full release and buy it then. I'm sure a lot of the complaints people have will have been addressed by then.",1447288449,1447288449,TRUE,3,0,0.563953519,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,61,1,6906,95,1291,1601243375

It seems very obvious to me that there are a large number of keyboard players who lose to players with GC controllers, and a large number of GC controller-users who lose to players with XBox controllers. It really is that significant a difference.

#2 This is a fighting game with no balance. There are six characters and every character has matchups where they are 7-3 or 3-7. When we get to eight charcters, will we see lots of 8-2 matchups? When the full twleve characters are released, will we have 9-1 matchups?

#3 Most characters have powerful, non-interactive gimmicks that discourage approaching. This does not give me confidence for where the game is heading.

52,Rivals of Aether,18963721,english,"A fantastic game for those who are a fan of Super Smash Bros: Melee (SSBM).  I don't typically endorse games that are ""clones"" of other games.  Having said that, Rivals of Aether(RoA) attempts to blend mechanics that fans and professionals felt set SSBM apart from other fighting games with new mechanics that are designed to make the gameplay feel smooth.

*No more shields - This has been replaced with a parry system that is similar to a powershield in SSBM.  I think this is a well-implemented and a great change to the feel of the game.  It emphasizes the timing of guarding against attacks, and empasizes reflecting projectiles with parries.  This ultimately leads to less stalls in combat due to shield spam.

*No ledge grabbing - I think this is an extremely positve change for the state of games like this.  In SSBM, people would often take advantage of the invulnurability frames that ledge grabbing gives, as well as the fact that in SSBM, only one person can grab a ledge a one time.  If a player is to quickly ledge grab during his enemies recovery, the enemy just drifts past the ledge to his death.  While this is sometimes an interesting mechanic in SSMB, I think doing away with it leads to much more interesting edgeguard sitations in the game.  

While I never played Melee competitively, I've been interested in the scene for a long time now.  I find that RoA has very fluid mechanics, and it's a great pick up.",1447029998,1447029998,TRUE,1,1,0.522293031,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,127,10,5780,0,3728,1586388708

57,Rivals of Aether,18923851,english,"This game. Where to begin.

Overall:
To start, the game is fairly simple and easy to pick up (Controller is recommended). It has a massive SSB feel, with a free-flow combo system, and characters that are aren't too complex. This game is a lot of fun, is already building a competative scene quickly, and plays really closely to Melee.

Pros:
-Graphically, is really great
-Easy to learn
-Updates are pretty often (about once a month/other month)
-Controls are tight and feel great (on a controller at least. Never played it with a keyboad to be honest)
-Online isn't all that laggy (in my experience with it)
-Characters are fairly simple and easy to pick up and learn to fight against
-Wavedashing
-Extremely fun

Cons:
-Characters are pretty 1-demensional
-While being easy isn't bad, it almost feels too easy
-Stages are either extremely different, or essentialy the same one. This is only an issue because some of the stages feel too small. This is more of a preference thing. Diverse stages in a fighting is uncommon, and not a real issue. It's more the size, which only one, maybe two stages fall under being too small.

Conclusion:
Trust me. This game is worth the $15. I've played a lot of fighting games, and most of them are fairly complex, and require a lot of practice to get with. This one isn't like that. It's really easy to learn, has local and online multiplayer, plays great, controlls easily, looks really good, and sounds great.

The game is remarkably easy to pick up, and aims to reduce or outright remove a lot of the barriers that prevent a lot of people from playing Smash at a tournament level. It gives a big boost to intermediate level players who just don't have the time or patience to learn the dozens upon dozens of techniques crucial to tournament-level Smash. Those who play Smash are probably used to accidentally performing a Smash attack by accident when they intended to perform a Tilt. In RoA, Smash attacks (Called Strong attacks in this game) and Tilts (Weak attacks) are on seperate buttons, preventing you from accidentally performing one or the other.

What I mean by that is it has the POTENTIAL to be an extremely fun game. However, I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS GAME... at least for the moment. I wouldn't feel right about pretending to recommend it. 

About 1 in every 5 games do I have a connection that I can actually play without disruption. 8/10 games the connecton is so bad it freezes over and over again. Eventually someone will get sick of it and will purposefully suicide due to the terrible connection so that they can move on and hope they can connect to the next person.

Characters are simply imbalanced. There are a few that are just better than others. Better moves, stronger kill moves, more plentiful ways to combo that ""stun"" long enough to not allow you to get out of it. It's just the way it is. This NEEDS to be fixed so that two players of equal skill levels don't lose to the other simply due to having a character with stronger attacks and better kill moves. 

So no, don't buy this game. Don't give the developers any more money until they earn it. Character balance fixes, connection fixes, input lag fixes. All of this needs to be fixed before I can recommend Rivals of Aether.

However, the few times that the connection is good and the characters in the current game aren't one of the imbalanced ones Rivals of Aether can be very fun.

Zetterburns just using the fireball and then spamming you with side smash, the Forsburns just using the backstab mid air. The Kraigs just spam the same side attack until you're off the map and then they throw rocks at you. The Wrastors just hitting you up in the air and then finish you with a spin move. This game got really annoying and boring fast to the point where I would just lock in Zetterburn and just throw fireballs and side smash. Can't beat em, join em, Probably the only two characters that actually seem like they do more than one thing is Orcana and Maypul. But of course I rarely encountered any online and they were the most fun to play against. All the trailers made the characters look fun to play against and to play as, but it turns out no one bothers with that and they use the same abilites over and over. I didn't even know Wrastor had drill kick side ways until 2 minutes before I wrote this review. 

The online matchmaking isn't that great either. You get paired against a random person of any skill level and for me it was either people who actually pulled some cool combos or the spammers. To bad I don't get to see much of the former. Its quite interesting seeing the pros pull some amazing combos that look really good and it gets me pumped to versus someone online and when I load the game up then I'm stuck seeings Zetterburn after Zetterburn doing the same thing over and over and I just lose interest. 

So why am I recommending it?

Because its fun with friends like smash is. You and your friends load up this game see the amazing art and fun music and you guys just play. No one uses the same moves over and over like online. The yelling and screaming and discovering what combos with what is just a blast with friends and probably the only reason I might open up this game from time to time.

Do you want a fun game with great visuals and music? Do you want to play smash with your friends and enjoy the different characters? Do you enjoy a great netcode? Do you hate ledges? If you answered Yes to any of these questions then this game is for you. 

Do you want a fun online experience and would only play it for the online? Do you like seeing diverse characters and a big pool to choose from? Do you like balanced matchmaking where you get paired with people around your skill? Do you hate spammers? If you said Yes to most of these, you should look for another game. 

Hopefully most of my problems will get fixed and I will update the review, but if you're looking for an online smash type game and you don't have anyone to play with, friends or just people online, then the online feels like a chore.

20,Rivals of Aether,18632133,english,"A very fun, Smash-like game. Overall the game is incredibly fast paced and fun, and would highly recommend it to anyone who likes Smash or other fast-paced games like it. The dev team is dedicated to making it appealing to both competitive and casual players alike, and to keeping the game balanced.

As far as characters go, I do feel like some characters will always just beat out others if two players are on an equal skill level.

My personal tier list:

S) Wrastor - Very quick in both air and ground movement and has great kill potential in both combos and raw Strong attacks, though can be kind of difficult to control if you're not used to him. His side special allows for greater air mobility, and has insane recovery with the multiple air jumps.

A+) Zetterburn - Very fast on the ground, and his side Strong attack is very good at catching opponents off guard if used correctly. His fire attacks also slowly accumulate damage over time which can lead to higher kill percents more easily. Also has decent kill potential. The only real problem with him is that his recovery is pretty linear, which can be read easily. Think of Fox's or Falco's Up-B in smash.

A-) Kragg - Slower than most of the cast, but his kill potential more than makes up for it. Most, if not all, of his aerial attacks can kill pretty easily. Combine that with his pillar and rock-throwing and he can zone just as easily as he can bring pain in combos. His side special also has armor, which can be used to great effect in throwing opponents off guard.

B) Maypul - Very quick on the ground and combo oriented, though he does seem to have a slightly higher execution cap; meaning players will have to spend more time with the character to learn to play him effectively. That being said, marking his opponents makes it easier to kill if they aren't prepared, and can also aid his recovery if he gets knocked from the stage. The only real problem is that he has relatively weak recovery without the mark, making it somewhat easier to kill him than some of the other cast.

C+) Orcane - More of a trap/zoning character than an aggressive one, laying down his puddles can be used for both mixing up and comboing his opponents. His side aerial attack is good for trapping opponents in place for a short time, as is his down special after the puddle is set. Like with Maypul, however, his recovery is pretty terrible without the puddle, and can be read and punished easily by more experienced players, setting him up to be killed easier. Still, he can be overwhelming in the right hands and has decent kill potential from his Strong attacks.

Finally, C-) Forsburn - My own personal character of choice, though I do believe him to be the weakest of the current roster. I play him as a very aggressive character, going in and setting up my clone and smoke whenever I can. In the right hands, the clone can be used in tandem with the player and cause massive pressure on the opponent, and his smoke can be used to hide the player and cause deception. His smoke can also be absorbed, in which after 3 absorbtions he can use his down special to cause an explosion around him with great kill potential. Think the Wario Waft in smash. The reason I consider him the weakest, however, is for three reasons: One, his smoke and clone can be dissipated with an attack from the opponent. A single attack removes any cloud of smoke on screen or can be used to the destroy the clone, if not both. Any projectile will dissipate the clone and the smoke as well. Wrastor is probably his worst matchup because Wrastor's side special can blow through the clone and clouds with ease. Two, his kill potential is somewhat lacking. Other than his strong attacks (which aren't too bad, actually), his only two kills moves are his back aerial attack and his explosion, which brings me to number three - using any special other than his recovery removes one of the charges needed to cause the explosion, meaning you have to absorb another cloud of smoke to trigger it. His recovery is also somewhat predictable and can be read by the opponent relatively easily.

Like I said, this is a personal tier list and can be taken with a grain of salt - this is how I see the game thus far.

A weird-ass raccoon-ferret that stabs you... with... leaves?
A stereotypical animal shaman that uses smoke to hide himself... He should probably lay off the cigarettes.
A Heracross looking mofo that is apparently not a bug type, since he uses Rock Throw, Rollout, and Stealth Rock.
A lion that is apparently pretty upset about someone lighting his mane on fire, since he seems to be on a quest to make sure EVERYONE feels his pain.

42,Rivals of Aether,18567667,english,"****NOTE**** At the time of this review, the game is in Early Access - so many features and aspects of the game are not fully developed.

Honestly, this feels a lot like a Smash Bros for PC, so that is what I am going to compare it to.  (Note: I have many hours invested into the WII U & 3DS Smash games)

Similarities to Smash Bros:
- Controls
- UI
- Gameplay

Things this game does better than Smash Bros:
- Online play. By a lot. Far, far less lag. Matchmaking is quick.
- Loads far quicker than Smash Bros for WII U or 3DS
- New, interesting characters (Zetterburn FTW)
- No blocking. This game is incredibly fast paced because of it.


Things that Smash Bros does better than RoA:
- Huge roster of well known charaters
- large variety of stages
- Items in battles
- More than two characters in online play (although Smash lags fairly often, even on 250mbps internet connection with nothing else connected)
- Larger variety of modes available


Parting thoughts:

If you want Smash for PC, go buy a WII U or 3DS and Smash. You should probably also buy this game.

If you are looking for a fun game that has a lot to offer at an extremely attractive price, get this game. I highly recommend it.

50,Rivals of Aether,18542364,english,"I really like this game. It's a great Smash Bros inspired fighter, but at the same time it's not a straight up Smash clone. There's no edge grabbing, and the blocking/dodging mechanic has been revamped entirely. There's 6 characters so far, and each of them have a very strong gimmick to them. For example, Orcane can teleport to wherever he places his puddle, but he doesn't have a recovery, so if you're knocked off the ledge and you don't have a puddle, you're screwed. Wraster can use smash attacks in mid-air, but he can't on the ground. So far, it's a great and diverse cast of fighters, each feeling unique. It's only gonna get better as time goes on too. The game itself feels like a mix of Melee and Smash 4, except it's a lot easier to pull off sweet combos. I LIKE THAT. A LOT.
The music is for the most part pretty good. There's a few really good tracks in there, and some mediocre ones. It must be hard to try and create music that has that awesome Nintendo-ish charm to it.
In the future, I'd love to see:
-Omega versions of stages like in Smash 4. And along with that maybe another version (Alpha ?) that's like Omega stages but with a three platform setup similar to Battlefield. 
-A story mode that lets you get to know a lot about the fighters. I like being able to connect with the fighters, that's part of the reason why I love Smash so much.
-An arcade mode similar to classic mode.
-Different costumes besides color variations (don't get me wrong, I love those too!)
-Goku, Ridley, and Geno
-That last one was a joke, but keep adding good unique characters. Ice based, electric based, dark based fighters would be cool. And don't be afraid to derive from animalistic character designs too. Some humans or robots to throw in the mix would be pretty cool.

ROA has great pixel art, with each character and stage looking vibrant. ROA has an interesting selection of 6 characters (2 additional characters planned in future updates), from a four-legged orca whale to a styling avian. Each character is completely unique, my favorite being Forsburn, a dagger-wielding assassin type character with abilities such as 
- smokescreen (neutral special) to deliver a surprise attack from an unknown position.
- decoy (side special) to throw off the opponent, with the same abilities as its source, its attacks can also create/extend combos.
Another thing I like about Aether is the crazy amount of moves that combo into each other, it's all so smooth, and the game is only in alpha so there's no doubt it'll even further improve.
My one complaint so far is the online matchmaking. About 90% of my matches have been players immediately self-destructing without even attempting to fight. Though this may be due to lag on the other end, it's not apparent to me as each of the games have been smooth on my end. it's. really. annoying. It takes forever to get into a match where the person actually plays. I feel like some sort of penalty could possibly be implemented to fix this.

Balance is tight (very tight, in my opinion, although people will disagree,) physics feel just right, and it feels really good when you land a kill setup. What makes the game really shine, though, are the characters, each of which have something that make them feel totally unique and interesting (yes, even Zetterburn has some neat stuff.) 

Since it's early access, the game is quite limited, though. The six characters never get old, and different playstyles can change up these characters dramatically, but the roster will feel very small to a lot of people. There's also only local multiplayer and online, with the only really single player option being against the ai, and the ai is pretty easy once you get a handle on the game.

Online could also use a bit of work, as the netcode doesn't feel spot on a lot of the times, and a few network glitches make it hard to find a decent game a lot of the time. Lots of people are also rage quitting right now, sometimes seemingly over nothing, but I guess there's no avoiding that.

3,Rivals of Aether,18395392,english,"if you are a fan of Super Smash Bros then you will without a doubt love this game, id compare it to SSB Melee with how fast paced and smooth the fighting and controls are. all of the controls are exactly the same as Smash Bros, so its really easy to pick up and play. all of the characters are very creative in play style but you will see subtle little things that will remind you of certain characters from smash. also there are a few minor differences, you cant edge grab the stage, instead you  cant stick to the side and it gives you a fresh jump to recover again.
this game has so much potential and i cant wait for more characters and story mode, the online vs mode is very good and there is no lag as far as i could tell.  i realize its in early access so there isnt much meat to the game yet and only 6 characters to play as, which is understandable but it is still a con to me. some characters are also a little more OP than others which i can also understand because they still need to get feedback from the gamers so they know who needs to be reworked.

Pros:
-creative characters
-sprite graphics
-awesome stage design
-great online vs mode NO LAG
-amaing controls and smooth frame rate
-amazing chiptune soundtrack
-custom controls

Cons: (Based on early access content)
-no edge grab
-need to balance the characters a little more
-only 6 characters (right now)

8,Rivals of Aether,18379876,english,"This game is better than smash bros from a competitive standpoint. It's quite similar, but it's better;

1. It's $15 as opposed to the hundreds of dollars for a Wii U and Smash Bros (you still have to spend money on a gamecube adapter and controller if you use those, but you can use any USB controller or keyboard if you prefer.

2. Made by a company that wanted to make a more competitive version of smash. They succeeded by making a platform fighter that has an incredibly balanced (albeit small) roster, no items, neutral stages, and advanced techniques reminiscent of Super Smash Brothers Melee to create a high skill ceiling.

3. The simple graphics allow almost any computer to run this game at 60 fps with no problems whatsoever.

4. The online matches don't feel as laggy as the online mode in Smash Bros for Wii U.

5. The characters aren't limited to pre-existing games/universes like they are in Smash Bros. The characters in RoA are original and actually feel like they were designed to beat each other to a pulp, unlike some Smash Bros characters *cough*wiifittrainer*cough*.

6. It has much better practice mode features, such showing hitboxes and knockback direction as well as being able to advance frame by frame.

7. There is no tripping, rage, or stale moves. This removal of variables makes combos go off much more consistently and intuitively.

Rivals of aether truly puts the ""really early"" in ""early access"", or at least i hope. The game needs a ton of stuff added and improved on before it can be considered even close to a releasable game. we'll do a pros cons list cause we're Hip

Pros:
-great combat, tight controls
-characters feel unique with their own gimmicks that feel extremely satisfying to pull off *cough orcane cough*
-pretty background art
-extremely fast to get into a game

Cons:
-character designs are for the most part god awful
     -wow i've never seen a FIRE LION before
     -obligatory bird character with goggles
     -a dolphin with meaty legs
     -a dolphin with meaty legs
     -a dolphin with meaty legs
-lack of characters and stages (early access duh)
-can't play in full screen (only me? i don't know)
-the online. two of my hours on this game were spent trying to get it to work properly. its mostly because my computer is weird and only has a monitor refresh rate of 48hz. everything runs smoothly and looks fine on my end, but my opponents must have experienced extreme input lag, which would mean they just suicided three times to get to a different match. in order for me to play i had to mess around with my computers settings and disable vsync and mess with other stuff and play in windowed mode. this needs to be fixed, no one should have to mess with their pc settings and settle for less than ideal conditions just to play the game
-lack of communication. the above would have probably been figured out way faster if there was chat in the end game screen or something
-lack of competitive matchmaking. the player base of this game currently is probably something like 75% super smash bros veterans and 25% people who heard about the game and decided to give it a shot. learning the game is difficult when you get three stocked over and over by some zetterburn main and you can't get a hit in. matchmaking would probably solve this: either all the try hard git good players play competitive and are matched against same level people and would be happy not playing against noobs and the baddies like me get to practice in normals, or people keep tryharding in normals so baddies like me go to matchmaking and practice at the shit tier where we belong until we git good


my cons list looks huge in comparison, but overall i do think the game is really something special. i just hope that the developers care enough about the cons i've listed to fix them and make this the great game it could be. if this game gets fully released as the game we all want it to grow up to be, expect tournaments, youtube content, professional players, guides, fanart, etc. because this is unlikely to be something that dies out quickly if its good. if you think your computer might have issues running the game, please wait for the devs to make it more reliable


TL;DR: game's fun. it has a really really long way to go though

The mechanics for each character are very unique and would likely never be found in a smash bros game. For example, the character Wrastor can perform strong attacks (smash attacks) in the air while the character zetterburn can set you on fire in order to activate his sweet spots for his attacks. Recovering to the stage is also very different from smash bros as ledgegrabbing is not in this game. This causes you to be very creative with your recovery and rely on walljumps to get back to the stage. Other differences include parrying instead of shielding and a lack of grabbing. 
Even if you have put in countless hours into Smash Bros, you will find a fresh and enjoyable experience with Rivals of Aether. The game is smooth, fact, and filled with satisfying combos. Rivals of Aether feels less like a smash bros clone and more like an entry to the platform fighter genre. I highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys smash bros or fighting games.

This game is ACCESSIBLE
The gameplay is fast and smooth, and incredibly user friendly. The learning curve is lessened from Smash due to the lack L-Cancelling, replacing it with low landing lag, making combos smooth and easier to perform. There aren't edges to the stages, making edge-guarding less read based, but, the wall jumping and air dodging lets you mix up your recoveries just enough to keep opponents guessing, but not to the point where you could do 3-4 different things recovering. Also, you can attack and move out of an air-dodge, which makes a missed wavedash off the stage less punishing. There aren't any shields in Rivals. Instead, you have parrying, which keeps defensive play to a minimum.

I haven't even talked about the characters yet.

Wow.

Every character is completely unique, with really well executed ideas. Zetterburn can set opponents on fire, and if he connects a strong attack (the non copywritten name for smash attacks) while the opponent is still on fire, the attack does quite a good deal more knockback and damage (Try aerial side-b into F-smash ;) ). Wrastor is the godlike combination of Falco, Marth, and Jigglypuff. He utilizes a wind current that, if he is inside it, raises his speed and his already insane aerial speed. He also has 4 jumps, so, uh.

BACK AIR BACK AIR BACK AIR.

Anyways, Forsburn can create a clone of himself (ICs anyone?) and can create smoke, store it, and use it to create an explosion around him. He can also Ken combo. Orcane uses a puddle that he creates somewhere on the map. He can teleport to it, make it evaporate into bubble has a trap, and enhance some moves of his. Maypul is an extremely small and fast character that can mark opponents with certain special moves. If she uses a strong attack while the person is marked, they are stunned for a small amount of time, which is a really simple kill setup. If the opponent is marked and she up-Bs, she will pull herself toward the opponent, and control her direction, which is great for mixups. Kragg hits quite hard, but is a good deal slower that the rest of the cast. He can create a big stone that he can throw in a myriad of directions. If he isn't holding it, he can break with an attack, which sends a bunch of rocks in the direction he attacked. Depending on what attack you use and what direction you hit it at. His up-B is really bizarre, he summons a pillar of stone wherever he is. It's really useful for comboing, by getting an opponent between Kragg and the pillar opens tons of combo opportunities.

So, is this game worth buying? Yes, absolutely, One of the greatest games in early access right now.

Obviously the characters are different, although there are some parallel characters.

The control scheme is a little awkward for me, i just have to get used to it, you jump with the Y button on an Xbox controller, regular attack with a, ""strong"" (smash) attack with b, and special with X, because of this, it is difficult to jump and do attacks, i would like it if the developers added an option to jump by pressing up with the joystick or the D-Pad.

The graphics are good. its an indie-style pixelated game, so it looks like a game that maybe could have been on the SNES or the Genesis (during their later years) but they are technically Hi-def and the game can play in either windowed or fullscreen. 

The gameplay itself is a little lacking, but it is still in early access. Because of this, i will return to this once the game is at its full release.

99,Rivals of Aether,18294801,english,"Rivals of Aether is a great 2D spiritual succesor to the Smash Bros. series from Nintendo. I love the unique characters with both original moves and moves inspired by characters from the Smash series. The mechanics and rules in the game differ than that of Smash as well, and to that I say ""well done!"" If it were just a blatant knock off of Smash, it would not feel as original and innovative as it does. 

With all that said, I'd like to share some my personal knitpicks about the game.

For starters, the character Kragg feels a bit too overpowered. His movesets are easily abused by campers and veterans, making him extremely difficult to fight against. He also has a good bit of speed behind him for a heavy-hitter. Now I may just be a John or a Scrub for these complaints, but I may also not be the only one that feels this way about him. I just can't help but find myself hating going against this character, especially when they are spamming the rock throw and rock scatter attack. It feels nearly impossible to get around it.

Second, online play can have some SEVERE lag issues. Sometimes it can run fine depending on the connection, but often times, there is a HUGE delay in the controller input when playing online, which can make it extremely difficult to play. I understand if someone I'm playing with has bad wifi, but their has got to be a way to patch this.

Lastly, I think the overall controls are a bit too stiff. It may just be me, but I find myself parrying A LOT when I am simply trying to dodge roll instead. Sometimes my inputs don't match what I am trying to do either. 

Now I know this game is in Early Access and it is FAR from done, but I figured I would just give my two cents about my thoughts on the game so far. All in all, for it being in such an early stage of development, it is pretty damn solid! I tip my hat off (if I had one) to Dan Fornace and his team on this game. It's fun, it's innovative, and I absolutely cannot wait to see where this game goes when it recieves it's full release in the next few months!

5,Rivals of Aether,18284789,english,"Rivals of Aether is a fantastic game that balances the best elements of similar games like Super Smash Bros. 

Pros:
  -It retains some of the technical skill involved in Melee and Project M (i.e. wave-dashing) but does not overwhelm you with constant skills like L-Cancelling or SHFFLing. I have personally found L-Cancelling to be a hassle, so I was happy to find that there is very little (maybe even zero) landing lag in Rivals of Aether.
  - The basic attacks are all there, but a lot of characters have much more interesting mechanics (i.e. Wrastor's aerials freezes him in the air.) Combo-ing with these attacks feels awesome due to the small amount of hitlag on each attack.
  -There are no more grabs or ledge grabbing which some people find questionable. However, the lack of grabs adds to much more fluid gameplay relying on attacks to start combos rather than grabs. Also, ledge grabbing has been pratically replaced with wall jumping, which is much different to say the least.
-In my opinion, the characters in this game are much more unique than the characters featured in Super Smash Bros. Each character in this game has a unique gimick besides just attacks, specials, and aerials. I hope that future characters will flow as well as the current ones.
  -Rivals of Aether is a game that endorses competetive play and is built for it. This game will feel like a Smash Bros. game made for competetive play. If you like Smash Bros. You will like this game.
  -Has support for Xbox 360 controllers and keyboard. You can also use a Gamecube controller if you follow these instructions: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVu8xJ7Bs6o
  -The music is very good, and I personally love the art style. However, due to the lack of stages the music can become   repetetive.
  -Comes with a cool training mode that allows you to experiment and play with bots in any way you want.

Cons:
  -Many of the fights experienced online will be choppy and filled with button lag. From my experience, most games I've played have been realtively low on the lag scale. Whenever I play with friends there is no noticeable input lag or choppiness in the gameplay.
  -The game is in early access, so you don't really know whether this game will really become something with your money. I say this from personal experience with many early-access games that I have purchased, which I'm aware is my own mistake.
  -I don't necessarily know if this is a con, but to all the Melee fans out there: Rivals of Aether is not Melee 2.0.
  
Conclusion:
I definitely missed lots of pros and cons, but overall, I believe Rivals of Aether is very entertaining and worth the price tag due to the replayability of the game. As stated previously: If you like Super Smash Bros. in any way, shape, or form, you will like this game.

Things that have been really enjoyable thus far:
-Decent variaton in level design without ridiculous crap. (as opposed to the extremes of Smash Bros.)
-Mostly*** balanced characters
-Nice looking sprites/animations
-Growth potential for players to explore characters and combos. This is a big plus.
-Very unique character mechanics/stage control options. Everybody plays distinctly, and that's a lot of fun.
-There are not many negative points (see below)

Things that have been frustrating thus far:
-Forsburn has this combo: dash attack into dash attack into dash attack into dash attack into dash attack into dash attack into dash attack into dash attack. That's getting real old real fast. Yes, DI can save you eventually but only after several of them. Thus, we end up with Forsburns running around dash attacking everything into oblivion. That's very boring gameplay. If this could get nerfed/fixed, I think players would appreciate it. 
-Zetterburn has one similar situation that people love to try to abuse. Side special into side smash. Again. And again, because the first one powers up the second. Thankfully, this one is easier to get around and punish. 
-Occasional lag spikes making matching virtually unplayable. (They are thankfully uncommon.)

going back to the characters for a minute my favorite is Kragg he is basically the sort of grappler in the game him being a slow hard hitter an I love it, but he is the slowest character in the game so if he faces like the raccon or bird he is gonna get kited around BUT if he lands a hard attack say goodbye to that enemy.

It's a good game down to it's core an I personally love fighting games, an to top it off they already have the new character coming out soon an Electric goat I think an she or he looks like one of those set up characters its gonna be interesting to see how Kragg can deal with her.

I feel better now that this is out of the way :-)

To put this review into context, a small info from my end: i am a long time smash player and still play Smash 4 on a daily basis but soly 1vs1 for glory. So i am focused on the competitive spectrum of smash play.

Rivals of Aether is exactly that, a ""smashlike"" with laser focus on competitive 1vs1 play.
This shows in many aspects of the game:
1.) There is no blocking. This might sound harsh but it is the right thing todo, since blocking has always been a flawed mechanic in smash. To compensate you get a pary. Just press the button at the right moment when an enemy is about to hit you and you get a few frames of invincibility to counter your enemies moves.
2.) No ledge grabbing. The ledge grabbing has always been a special part of smash games, but it also slowed the games down and in some matchups lead to a VERY simplistic interpretation of rock, paper, scissors. In RoA you cant grab the ledge but any character can wall jump and do his recovery afterwards. This results in a much faster and skill based meta for of stage recovery/edge guarding.
3.) Easy wave dashing. Wave dashing is back and easier then ever. Just press a direction and the pary button + jump at the same time.
4.) very distinct characters. even though there are only 6 characters in the game so far, all of them are very unique and each matchup playes completely different.

Even though this is early access the game is  VERY enjoyable and the netcode is allready better then in smash 4.

37,Rivals of Aether,18257600,english,"[strike] Rivals of Aether is a Fire Emblem fighting game where characters that have the move Aether fight each other.	[/strike]    

Rivals of Aether (ee-thur) is a Super Smash Bros. inspired fighting game with tight controls, cool movesets, and combo centric gameplay. This game is fun if you are playing for shits and giggles, but can sometimes be frustrating so bring a salt shield.

There are a couple of characters I believe need tweaking and balancing like Zetterburn and Forsburn and maybe Kragg, but other than that the characters are all balanced, but they each require huge skill to be decent with. I recommend using Zetterburn for transitioning players from smash to get used to how the game works and moves. FYI, you can wavedash for those who know what that is.

There are 6 characters at the time of this review, and those characters are [b] Zetterburn	[/b] and [b] Forsburn	[/b] (the Fire characters), [b] Kragg	[/b] and [b] Maypul	[/b] (the Earth characters), [b] Wrastor	[/b] (the only Wind character right now), and finally [b] Orcane	[/b] (the only Water character right now).

The game if fun and highly competitive. There isn't much to do but to fight locally or online, and sometimes online matches have huge input delay spikes which is a bummer but it isn't [b] that	[/b] frequent.

51,Rivals of Aether,18250339,english,"Rivals of Aether takes a lot of inspiration from the Super Smash Brothers titles (namely Melee), and adds its own unique twist to it. The combat is very unorthodox, even compared to the already unorthodox Smash Bros series, with each character being able to control the stage in their own ways.
If you are a fan of Smash but find the formula starting to become a little bland, then pick up this game. Just be aware that since it's still in early access there could be a few bugs, but of my (almost) 20 hours of playing it, I haven't run into anything game breaking. Online matchmaking is a bit finnicky at times, with some matches lagging more than others, but I've had hardly any problems playing with friends.
If you're looking to get into smash, or have no other alternative, then I'd definitely pick up Rivals of Aether. It's a great game with a lot of similar aspects to Nintendo's hit brawler franchise, and there's no better alternative than this.
I'll actually be a little envious of Xbox One owners when this game hits the Arcade.
Final thoughts: Great game, interesting gameplay, awesome characters and movesets. Online is a little iffy at the moment, and there are some bugs, but those will probably all be ironed out as Early Access nears its completion.

58,Rivals of Aether,18244996,english,"This game is a great Smash Bros-lite for PC, probably the best attempt at translating the mechanics of smash to another game that I have seen. If you enjoy Smash, you will likely enjoy the basic gameplay of this game. At the time of this review, there are 6 characters, 5 stages, and only 2 modes (2-4 player versus and 1v1 online). While this isn't a huge amount of content, what is there is really good, and there seem to be 2 more characters and I believe 3 more stages planned based on the greyed out options in the menus. There seems to also be two more modes planned, including a story mode. Based on this, I can safely say more content is coming, and the content promised is likely to be delivered as it isn't all that much more than what is already available,

As far as comparing the game to Smash, I would say that for a $15 title it compares well. While it has no where near the amount of characters as Smash, falling short of even the original N64 Smash Bros, the characters available are all quite unique and varied. Most of them have moves and abilities unlike anything I've seen in Smash, and this helps differentiate the game from its source of inspiration. Some particularly original abilities include the Earth Beetle's up special, which pulls a giant pillar of stone from the ground right under the character's feet. So cool! Another example is that the Bird character can shoot a whirlwind that leaves a trail of wind behind, making his movement speed faster inside the trail. The attention to detail is really impressive here, as each character's abilities fit perfectly with their look and the way they handle. The bird is lightweight and has wings, and thus focuses on aerial moves and speed, whereas the beetle is larger and slower, focusing on slower, heavier attacks and keeping his feet firmly planted on the ground. The other 4 characters have their own quirks and specialties, but I won't spoil them for you here. While Rivals doesn't offer the breadth of content of a Smash game, it maintains a similar level of quality with the content it does provide. As someone who sees the Smash titles as some of the most polished games ever made, this is a big compliment.

The graphics  are a simple, 2D, pixelated style often seen in indie games. While this is not out of the ordinary, the art direction and design of each character and stage conveys a unique sense of identity and place. This is the perfect example of a game that uses the pixelated 2D style that is so common and elevates it, making it something original and aesthetically pleasing. I like the choice of anthropomorphic animals, as it ties in well with the four elements theme the game has.

Overall, this is a great game, and one of the best early access titles I've ever played. While I usually avoid early access titles, as they can feel half-baked and unfinished, this game is an exception to that rule. The base mechanics and gameplay are all here, and the additional content to come will simply add to an already great experience. If you want to wait until all of the content is out, feel free, but if you buy now you are still getting a great experience, and will have reason to revisit the game later once further content is released. The game is already in a polished, playable, and (most importantly) fun state, and I whole-heartedly recommend a purchase, especially if you can hook up 4 controllers and gather some friends around your TV or monitor.",1443501194,1443501194,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,626,4,121,0,96,1538603917

This game has amazing potential, but despite its quality, it's lacking in content.

- 1 on 1 Online
- 6 playable characters
- 5 Stages (With the ability to toggle each for a Final Destination-y version)
- AI that can scale in difficulty

For some, the gameplay alone can justify countless hours with a friend, While others will shy away due to poor online connectivity and a lack of variety.

I will shelve this game for now, but you can bet your bottom dollar that I'll be back when this game finally leaves Early Access.

My second time trying out a game such as this (after prior experience with Smash Brothers' replicas such as Super Smash Flash 2), I was exepcting something less impressive or similar to all the others.

The pixel-art is amazing, kudos to all those involved in this game, amazing animation and stage design. The characters, I thought there would be at least one or two characters I wouldn't want to play with, but after around a few hours of gameplay, I'm comfortable with them all. The moveset for each character is rather unique; no repetition whatsoever. Hopefully, other online modes will be available in the future, but hey, baby steps. This is only early access and I'm already impressed. I procastinated over my homework to play a couple more hours of this game. I can see that there are some suggested features but not available for choice. Such as 'Online' in the options menu and the other spaces in the character roster.

19,Rivals of Aether,18209033,english,"Rivals of Aether is, as you've probably gathered at this point, a Smash Bros style game. It sets itself apart by being more aggressive than Smash has become and having extremely unique characters. Ever character has their own little set of gimmicks and tricks, such as Kragg's ability to create a pillar and block that effectively act as part of the stage until destroyed, or Orcane's ability to lay down a puddle he can teleport to or ""burn"" for a blast of bubbles. As a result most of the characters play quite a bit differently and become fairly technical (though some are still fairly simple to pick up and play; notably Zetterburn and Kragg). It gives the game a sense of depth I feel Smash is somewhat lacking and really reinforces the differences between a so called ""platform fighter"" and a standard fighter. Stage awareness becomes much more important as well as an understanding of your opponents capabilities.

The game also has some key differences from smash in terms of standard gameplay, namely that ledge grabbing is not a thing, all characters can wall jump (gaining a second use of their recovery as a result) and there's no shielding, only ""parrying"" (which stuns opponents for a period based off how powerful the move was). As noted previously, the game is more aggressive, and this is partially why. Recovering becomes a lot trickier with no ledge to grab and having to effectively time your ""shield"" makes it harder to turn back an offensive. Oh, and unlike later Smashes, comboing is very much a thing in this game.

With that, you may be wondering if this is a game you should try casually. The game, while more aggressive, is still quite accessible to new people. The more aggressive mechanics aren't burdensome for the most part and just require some adjustment. About the only thing to keep in mind is that wave-dashing is in game, and while infinitely easier than Melee, is still something casual players will likely to find too much of a pain to bother with. This shouldn't effect most players anyway. 

NOTE: Currently the game is early access, and online is 1 vs 1 only on random stages with no hazards. If this is a dealbreaker for you, you may want to wait.

So honestly, I strongly suggest giving this game a shot. For fifteen dollars getting an awesome Smash-esque experience on the PC is super worth it.",1443299630,1443338695,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,365,3,2787,0,1359,1579932153

24,Rivals of Aether,18213986,english,"This is a great little game that is very fun as is and has a lot of potential.

It is a platform fighter (AKA ""Smash-clone"")  It uses many of the same concepts as Smash and is fairly technical.  The key difference so far is that there are not blocks or grabs/throws.  Instead of a block you have dodge/parry button.  

The dodging works similarly to Smash.  However, if you hold still and hit dodge you will parry. The parry works somewhat like parrys in Street Fighter III.  If you parry an attack, you recover more quickly than the attacker, which gives you a chance to counter or escape.  Since there is no block, grabs/throws are not really needed.

Also, there are no items.

The balance of the characters seems good so far and each character is pretty unique.  The netcode for online play seems to be more than adequate as far as I can tell.

It does come with offline play against bots, local pvp, and an online 1v1 3 stock mode, which is pretty fun (side note on how the online play is: for the most part, I've had decent connectivity while playing others, 3/10 I'll get someone with chuggy internet, but overall its good enough to play properly).

I'm not sure what else to say about this... Good animation, great character design (although, based on each character's backstory, it seems like there's an actual plot and that might mean a campaign mode? could be fun), and nice crisp control of you character.

Different in a few MAJOR factors: No blocking, no grabbing, no ledges, and every character is unique in some way.
Want an ACTUALLY stealthy character? Forsburn is perfect. A character that can teleport between ""portals"" they lay down? You won't find anyone like Orcane in Smash. Or how about someone who can make ENTIRE WALLS right below him, instantly? That would be Kragg.

So basically, this game is different enough from Smash to be fun for Smash players, yet similar enough so it's easy to learn. I HIGHLY recommend this game to anyone who likes Smash, or anyone looking for a good, easy to run fighting game that's good for partys.

Using Roll as a defensive option on the ground is not nearly as effective as it is in Super Smash Bros Wii U/3DS, for example. In the air you can Dodge in any direction, but only once before touching the ground again.

Super Smash Bros Melee featured a movement technique called Wavedashing. By Jump Canceling your Air Dodge into the ground diagonally in either direction you can slide across you ground, allowing for fast micro spacing that could be used both offensively and defensively. This technique makes its spiritual return to the Smash genre in RoA.

Edgeguarding an opponent attempting to return to the stage has always been a core of competitive Smash gameplay. Although you cannot Ledge Grab in RoA that hasen't changed. Players returning to the stage in RoA will find themselves with more resourses than a typical Smash game. Every character has a Wall Jump. Not only that, but you can Wall Jump even after using an Up Special and going into Free Fall. You can also use your Up Special again after a Wall Jump. This mean recovering from the depths is possible even without being able to grab the ledge.  

With all these unique gameplay elements Rivals of Aether definately brings a fresh take to the Smash genre of fighting games!",1443149033,1443293338,TRUE,1,0,0.50248754,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,47,2,10357,0,4842,1568524170

This game stays true to its goal of bringing smash to pc, not only does it have the feel of melee but it isnt just a clone unlike all the other browser based smash games. The characters are honestly my favorite part about it, every single one feels 100% viable from a competetive aspect. Even Kragg, who fills the role of the slow paced big character, which usually is out of place in the smash games, feels great and playable against the rest of the cast. All of the cast feels vibrant and different from the rest which is amazing to see. For example my favorite (orcane) has entire strings that are possible off of a bubble detonation from a puddle. In a competetive fighting game, diversity is a GREAT thing to see, as it keeps the game fresh. It gets tiring to see the same characters all the time.

74,Rivals of Aether,18193120,english,"If you like competitive Smash Bros, get this game. It may look like a simple copy-and-paste of SSBM for the Gamecube, but this game is NOT just a Melee clone. For starters, it removes the mechanics of shielding, grabbing, and ledge-grabbing. Shielding is replaced by ""parrying"", which is an alternative to counters from Smash. So basically, no one's Down-B slot is taken up by some stupid counter. The absence of ledge-grabbing makes off-stage play intense and gratifying. Combo potential, on-stage and off-stage, is fantastic. And of course, it's no competitive Smash-style fighting game without wavedashing and L-cancelling, both made way easier. And the characters are unique, some invent new ways to control the stage (like Orcane's puddles or Forsburn's smoke), while others take inspiration from well-known Smash Bros playstyles and revamp them. Forsburn takes aerial and tilt inspiration from Marth, but his Side B creates a clone of himself that reminds me of Ice Climbers. Wrastor has the unstoppable airgame of Jigglypuff, but his attacks on the ground parallel Captain Falcon, Falco, and Meta Knight. Zetterburn, the game's main mascot, takes Bowser's strong attacks and mixes it with Fox's specials. But even with these comparisons, experience in playing Jigglypuff will not translate over to Wrastor. Experience with Bowser will not make you instantly understand Zetterburn. 
So, a recap: Takes best parts of competitive Smash Bros and revamps them, combos and techniques are easier to learn for casuals, characters will remind you of popular Smash characters but make them new. Oh, and the music and art are great as well. 
I'll rate this game A Bag of Chips/10. It has all you love about Smash Bros, from the competitive to the casual.

1,Rivals of Aether,18180035,english,"Awesome game! I've been anticipating this game since only Zetterburn and Orcane were out, so I'm super stoked that it's out now. However, note that this early access version may not be for everyone. While I personally LOVE this game and love being a part of the early access development, some may want to wait until the full release. I'd definitely recommend this game to anyone as $15 is a great price for even a full game, but you may want to consider a few things before buying:
[list]
[*]As of now, I've found that many people of the RoA community are from some part of competitive SSB. This may appeal to some, but may make others wary of purchasing the game due to the large skill gap if you haven't played a smash game before.
[*]This games meta is not at all yet developed. Some characters are broken and some seem to be lacking. I personally think it'll be awesome to see how the game is balanced as the meta progresses, but some might get frusturated by these early issues. For example, right now a lot of people are getting extremely frusturated with Zetterburn as his f-smash kills at really early percents. I'm not sure if this will be patched later, but if you get frusturated with games that aren't balanced, you might want to wait until the full release of this game to buy.
[*]Building off the first point, if you really want to learn the meta to this game you will need to proactively look to get better. Wavedashing and other advanced tech are not explained as this game assumes you have prior SSBM experience. This isn't really a negative, but it is something to consider.
[*]Again, this is an *early access* build, it does not have all features that the final build will have. There are a limited number of characters and stages in thi build, not that it makes it any worse, but if you're not into early access stuff you might want to hold off.
[/list]
Those are just a few things to consider before buying the early access build of RoA, but like I said I would recommend this game to anyone who is willing to learn it! While it may sound like I was just bashing this game, I love it and think it has way more pros than cons:
[list]
[*]This game is very fast due to little lag and minimal defensive options. Parries sound broken at first but cannot be spammed as easily as you'd think.
[*]Combos feel great to pull off.
[*]Character depth is insane. Each character has its own stage control options, adding a slightly neglected aspect to this genre (with exceptions being characters like Snake and Rosalina).
[*]Stages are extremely interesting. Not all platforms are level with each other or even making for interesting combos and playstyles.
[*]Lots of support from the developers! I can tell Dan is very passionate about this game and wants to make sure everyone likes it as much as possible!
[*]It's fun! The game feels nice. Doesn't feel like Melee nor PM, but like its own game. The roots, of course, are obvious, but it's very impressive that this doesn't just feel like a knock off clone!
[/list]
So overall, I would definitely recommend this game.

10,Rivals of Aether,18155128,english,"This game is addicting. For the price, it's well worth your money whether you're looking to play Smash but don't have a Nintendo console or are already really into Smash. There's a lot this game offers. The character roster may look small, yes. Right now it has a mere 6 fighters with 2 more to be released by the game's launch, and only 5 stages with 3 more to be released, but the depth the gameplay brings to the table is so engaging that I find it hard for me to not look forward to coming back to it again and again. 

The fighters take a lot from multiple Smash characters and mix them into one but a lot of their movesets and specials are so unorthodox from Smash that it's a breath of fresh air for avid fans like myself. The major differences you'll notice right away are that there is no ledge grabbing and there is no shielding. You can wall jump (usually) after doing your up special and you can parry attacks (hitting the block button exactly when the other person's move would hit you). It leaves them vulnerable for a second for you to counter-attack. It fits with the game's playstyle and it's really cool to see new takes on standard Smash mechanics. 

Wavedashing is also here, and it's much easier to do than in any of the Smash games. No character has a short wavedash, so it's viable for everybody and useful to learn and apply to your fighting eventually. Overall I'd rate this game a 9.5/10, would be a perfect score but for real can we please nerf Zetterburn and Kragg a bit?

Pros:
-Incredibly easy to pick up (I mean seriously easy, you probably know most of the combos just from even watching melee)
-Cool characters
-Each character is unique
-Online is good with randoms
-It has Wrastor
-Wavedashing feels great
-Chrono Trigger-ish music

Cons:
-Balancing isn't great, as it's first day. Maypul is pretty bad and Zetterburn is too good.
-Online with friends has huge amounts of delay (why?)
-Wavedashing is not really needed in this game
-Not enough characters
-Not enough maps
-Not enough Chrono Trigger music
-Absa not included

Extra:
-There are no ledges in this game
-No grabs
-No shield (although there are frame parries)
-Maps have hazards

Now it seems like that's a lot of cons, but trust me, this game kicks ass. It's fun and fast paced and really easy to learn. I suck at melee and PM and am only good at smash 4, although this game feels completely natural. I play on a 360 controller, so it did take time to learn some things, but it's really good all around. Recommend to anyone that has ever, EVER played a smash game before. It's a good detatchment from smash, as it feels incredibly similar, but at the same time, incredibly different. You never notice how much shields, grabbing, and ledges affect gameplay speed until you take it out. The two big problems I have with this game is the balancing, which is an easy fix if they ask around on Reddit or something, and the amount of characters. We need more! We want more! We want more because we like this game!

Good job, Dan Fornace. As I mostly play games just to play games, I play this one because it's fun. Oh, and I guess the other smash games too, I guess.

pros-
-like smash but more competitive and fast paced
-handles smoothly (locally)
-an innovative fighting game
cons-
-kinda crappy controls without a controller
-still in early access atm
-small roster of characters
-laggy online mode (sometimes)

overall its a pretty solid game IMO.

42,Rivals of Aether,18167761,english,"Honestly I love this game it is a great change of pace from smash 4 and melee but it needs some work and thankfully its early access so it will get that work. What does it need you ask well I will tell you in a multitude of rants please join me below.....

Edit: I just wanna mention for the people who say that the servers are bad I have had zero problems with lag or DCing yall need better internet I think cause I have had 100% smooth gaming online,

(Start the rant here) 
First things first you should not be ably to spam your f-tilt and win that should not in any way shape or form work. You also should not be able to play Zetterburn and spam side b and down b while yeah sure i can go Zetterburn and spam too and I usually win that fight problem is thats no fun I don't want to have to counter pick characters this isn't Pokemon is it? The fact that Zetterburn is the only character who has a form of projectile camping is an issue. 

(Zetterburn in a nutshell ... ""rivals of aether was such a great game... But that all changed when the fire nation attacked"")

I realise we have parrying in the game and yes it reflects them just like a perfect shield in smash but the fact is why can he camp give someone else a projectile or an actual reflector I don't know. Now parrying that is another one of my issues with this game. Whle yes the system is really cool and original you shouldn't be able to spam parry and win the game cause for some reason it is 100% possible. Put more lag on it or something don't remove its usefulness obviously but make it riskier for more than just Maypul to use cause for some reason hers is like 2 frames slower which makes no sense why do i have to learn multiple parry timings? And yet again I know i can run up and bait the parry get in a combo and then bait the parry and get a combo and bait the parry and get a combo you see where I am going its boring as all hell. Anyways I'll stop complaining.
(Rants over don't worry) 

 Now for the actual review. This game is great buy it if you enjoy playing smash with your friends. Or enjoy any fighting game with your friends. But thats where the fun stops for now. Online is full of spamming and for some reason only 2 characters Zetterburn and Wrastor. But for some nice couch co-op with friends this game is super fun. 

As far as controls I am personally using a gamecube controller and it feel soooooo good. It took some work to get it to work but man it feels like I am playing smash. Movement is god like you can dash dance super easy wavedashing is in here too and it is also super easy. 

(Wavedash rant)
Although I have one small bone to pick with the wave dash. Why did you put it in here? nothing has lag at all. You can do everything but F-tilt out of a dash. and everything auto cancels on its own. So why is it here for the show i guess cause I see no use for it. Now if you couldn't do literally everything out of a dash maybe it would be used more. Atleast as far as I have seen it doesn't help anyone do anything so for now it is just random flashy tech to show your buddies. atleast it would be if it wasn;t the easiest thing to do ever.
(Another rant down)

So what we have here is

Pros: 
A smash like fighting game that works well
God like controls and movement (serious props for that one guys)
Nicely designed original characters (inspiration from smash but all different in their own way)
Awesome stages (wheres FD guys.. in 20xx I want Zetterburn only no items Final Destination)
Seriously great music like wow I want a sound track 
Great couch co-op gameplay (sadly being lost in todays gaming thanks for keeping the dream alive)

Cons: 
Unbalanced fighters (not super bad but need works I know its in alpha)
Limited fighters to chose from (More on the way so this ones kind of a for the moment thing)
Limited stages to chose from (again more on the way so as i stated above it's for the moment)
Lack of options 
^(What I mean by this is you can do 2 things when you aproach A. attack B. parry yep thats about it. Now I am not saying it is a bad thing I like it but it leads to whoever gets that first actual hit off gets the game basically.)
(Hitstun Rant)
 Hitstun is forever I mean forever in this game so any attack you are hit by leads to another and another and another. If each player is good that is you read the di you attack you read the di and attack. I know they don;t want to make it an exact clone of smash but I mean grabs would be nice or just one more option like a spot dodge that would be easy to put in and very useful.)
(end the final rant I think)

All in all as I stated above I love this game it is so good just al little tlc and I think it could grow pretty big. To melee levels no sorry not gonna happen but it will take off quick as it is so yeah. Thats my review great game with alot of potential.

this game is good for what it does. Its smash for the pc, but not at the same time.

think of it like this.

The game plays and feels like smash bros. The characters each handle differently with different and with diverse movesets.

But..... on the other hand those characters are so unorthadox that Smash would never ever consider this. 
 
No ledge game, you get 1 wall jump and 2 Up+b if you can even make it to the wall

DI is still a thing. Teching is not. Air dodging has the same properties as melee. But no wavedashing (ive tried) 

Game feels rough. Online can range from absolute joke to amazing. Its not complete by anymeans. 

Soundtrack is well done. Spritework is good but is a bit choppy (plz fix) 

Overall..... its good for what it does. its a smash game for the pc. best one ive played. 

(This game supports GC controllers. Go get one before playing this. its makes it SO much more fun. they even have a guide set up on how to do it.)

So my opinion. Dont get unless your a fan of smash and want something to play. if your a laptop user with a nvidia card, u dont get f**ked by optimus. IF your not into fighting games, this is a good one to pick up for casual gameplay vs bots. Newcomers to this style, just pick up a gamecube or wii and a copy of smash. its better and it will give you a handle on how this works, then come back to this. However if you dont want to that then buyer beware. 

Final Verdict. 6.5/10 Its good for what it does. its fun, its enjoyable, its good to look at. But smash is not gonna be cloned anytime soon, but this was a DAMN good attempt at it.

Things that could be better:
-AFKers in online matchmaking currently (9/23/15) aren't removed from being paired with you
-When binding keyboard controls, you cannot choose to change a menu button unless you also change the in-combat button as well for a single key.
-Had to use xpadder, game doesn't work with my logitech controller
-Matchmaking often pairs you with someone across the country, resulting in 1 player with a lot of lag.

1. Competitively viable.
2. Plays and feels like a mix of SSB4, Melee, and early Street Fighter titles.
3. Multiple stage versions (like the version of the walkoff stage that, well, doesn't have a walkoff).

What it needs:
1. A grab.
2. Built-in support for various popular controllers (I had to remap my GCN controller in JoyToKey).
3. Nametags to define control schemes (just like in Brawl/PM/Wii U).
4. Online game modes such as Doubles, Casual, Competitive, and With Friends.

What I want:
1. Stage builder? Please?
2. Optional mouse navigation of the menus.
3. Smoother animations. The current ones are satisfying and all, but the frame rate of them is very low. The game would feel a lot better and moves would be more distinct as a result.

It features 6 character at the moment, 8 when it comes out of Early Access. That's the only negative point I could imagine. Every Char plays completly different so 6 chars at the moment are totally okay. I would like to have like 14-18 chars at the end of Early Access. That wouldn't be that much of a problem because all the chars come from a different element. So there are enough possibilitys I think. 

The online-play is great and the lag comprensation is fair for both players. If someone has a bad internet, there will be slow downs for both players. Good job!

I think I'm enjoying this more than any other Early Access game I've purchased. The graphics are nostalgic and crisp, the gameplay is very solid, and online play works very well if you have a reasonable ping/connection speed.

There's currently only 6 characters available, but 2 more are to be released when the game is officially out. There is a small handful of stages to pick from, each giving you a ""basic"" or ""aether"" variation. The ""basic"" versions remove walk-offs, stage destruction and stage hazards, presumably for competitive play.

Much like the smash bros games, each character has 4 sets of moves. Regular attacks (think tilts), areal attacks, heavy attacks (think smash attacks), and special moves. But unlike smash bros, there is no shield button. There is a sort of spot-dodge like button that can be used to parry, but requires very goos timing. Also removed is the ability to grab the ledge. Instead, each character has the ability to wall jump, and use their up-special a 2nd time after the wall jump.

Balance might need a little work, but it's all there. Also do yourself a favor and get a USB GCN adapter instead of using the X360 controller. It just works so much better, despite the extra setup work it requires.

42,Rivals of Aether,18142221,english,"Only just starting, and I'm already in love. 

It may at first seem like a super smash bros clone, but actually has a bit more unique character than you'd think. While it does borrow the same percentage/KO system from smash bros, the gameplay is a new animal entirely (no pun intended). No characters can grab the ledge, yet all can wall-jump, making recovery much more interesting and dangerous. No landing lag, allowing for a 0% to KO combos provided you don't miss any oppoprtunities. Unlike smash, you do not have any shield, and you can't grab. Instead, you ""parry,"" Which is nothing like smash's defensive play at all. So far, Inturrupting a combo stream with a well timed parry is extremely satisfying. 

If you are a fan of super smash bros (especially Melee and project M) I cannot recommend this highly enough. It was made by a smash bros fan with smash bros fans in mind. However, there are some things you should know. This is a competitive game. It does not have the party gimmicks (items and final smash moves). It's made to be a sport. Also, we're still missing 2 characters and the entire story mode. It is early access after all.

All joking aside, the first few hours of this game were a solid first impression. The character designs are all unique and charming in their own way. Each character has their own set of tools to use, and I can't name any ""clone"" characters on the roster. This game is also an interesting take on the Smash Bros style fighting game (this really should be a named genre instead of just ""Smash Clone"") in that it has mechanics of its own, such as the Parry. Wavedashing is easier to do than it was in Melee and Project M. 

My only gripe as of now is that the matches against random players online can be laggy, but most of the time the connection is decent.

Complaints is that the battles only have one song which after trying out today is getting a little old already.

-Not too much imbalance. Fire does a bit more than I'd like as it basically makes a huge danger area for no reason at all.
-Easy to learn (after about an hour or two) but near impossible to master.

The developers got ""Omega Stages"" right.

They do take a bit of getting used to if you have played Smash, but the controls aren't too complicated.

Parrying is easy and dosen't require much practice unlike in Street Fighter 3.

I hardly came across any lag online.

The music puts a smile on my face, and I can't usually say that to describe music in a fighting game.

The  characters are balanced.

I do have one major problem about most of the players I find online, however. A really small amount of people I fight online actually want to play the game, and a large ammount just seem to want to kill themselves.

28,Rivals of Aether,18149937,english,"Like Smash? Then this game is for you, simply put. 

By competitive players for competitive players. Though there certainly are options for the casual crowd, this game is largely designed for the level of depth, speed and fun brought forth by Super Smash Bros. 64 and Melee, tailored to boast the same accessibility of Sm4sh, with unique style and flair to give RoA its own identity.

In Rivals, gameplay guides character design. Since the cast is entirely original (with some animations borrowed from Smash) the devs have the freedom to keep the roster fit for specific playstyles. The goal for RoA was to create something more aggressive, and to accomplish that they threw out the concepts of shields, grabs, and ledge camping. Instead, we got parries, which are basically ""power shields"" that stun the enemy so you can punish them, and a very, very diverse combo game for all characters.

A lot of familiar mechanics show up in RoA: wavedash/land, dash dance, reverse aerial rush, and a slew of new advanced tech for the community to discover. Each character, based on one of four elements, has their own tech and traits that make them distinct. Zetterburn can light his enemies on fire for a DoT effect and burning enemies take increased knockback from strong (smash) attacks. Kragg, of the earth element, can change the stage using his up and neutral specials. He can create a giant rock pillar to wherever he is located, and pull a big, stone block to place and block enemy movement temporarily, or use as a projectile. Now apply that sort of diversity and clever design to the 6 others.

The game's small roster bolsters its ability to remain focused and balanced. Dan has stated that the game is to be balanced around 1v1s, ensuring that all characters have the tools they need to deal with any of the others and dittos of themselves. He's been very receptive to feedback, which is fantastic and an absolute blessing for a competitive fighting game.

All in all, this game has been incredible even before its release. Controls are smooth, art is beautiful, music is engaging and catchy, characters are unique, deep, and interesting, online play is (usually) smooth, and overall Rivals of Aether makes for a great platform fighter either as an alternative or supplement to your Smash collection.",1442950949,1442950949,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,244,9,5049,26,986,1601437505

It feels fair and responsive. The learning curve is low and the skill cap very high, exactly how it should be.

The thing that immidiately noticed was how different all the characters are.
Obviously this gam eis going to be compared to smash bros, and all I can say it that it feels kinda like melee. 
The Air dodging is something that they improved on over smash bros in my opinion, in this game air didging can be done in any direction. This game does not have grab and that breaks the ""rock, paper, scisors"" counter that smash has, but I haven't played enough to say if it is better or worse. Grabbing is usually used for combo's anyway and  this game already has some clear combo's. I'm not sure it's possible to counter perfect counters, but they are so hard to perform it might not matter anyway. 

At first I was a little disappointed to see they were aiming for only 8 characters, but when I played the game I noticed that they were exceptionally well designed, it understand would be hard to think of more characters that are of such high quality and unique. 

Personally I'm not a fan of pixel art, but I guess the pixel art makes it possible to play this game on my shitty laptop. 

Thank god for the option to play maps in ""basic"", I really dislike the aether version of the map ""treetop Lodge"".

Akin to Melee and Smash 64 this game has combos and lots of them! From BnB to mix-ups to creative combos, this game really puts a certain satisfaction in landing each blow. The game is also made easily accessible to anybody new to the genre. Inputs that were difficult in other games are made much easier allowing even the most casual gamer to have fun with in a 1V1 environment.

The game also boast a small but healthy cast of characters, each with their own mechanic. I could go for ages about each character cause they all have so much depth but I'll spare you the wall of text. Despite each characters unique traits they are all extremely well balanced and are extremely fun to play. Not to mention the character design is very creative and each character is identifiable on the battlefield. 

The only real issue with the game as of right now is the online. It can be laggy at times but I think that's mostly dependent on the players internet rather then the netcode its self. But the online as of right now is actually really well designed, allowing for quick Bo3 matches with the option to rematch.

I was part of the alpha test from August 31 2014, and the most recent test build I was apart of was March 2015. 

I instantly fell in love and started showing the game off and playing with my friends. All of us play melee competitively, and while there are some differences from Smash, this game could easily pass as part of the main series.

Cirby (on steam), is a member of the community I respect very, very much. He wrote an excellent review for this game, and I suggest you read it. His review will explain the major differences between RoA and a Smash game.

I'm going to talk about how /fun/ this game is.

If you look back at all of the best video games in history 99/100 times they all have one thing in common: a quality movement system. To explain what I'm talking about lets look at Mario Kart. Normally you have total control over your kart, you can speed up, speed down, break, hop, do a trick, angle yourself, etc. The only time you don't have control is when you get hit by an item. The frustrating part about getting hit with an item isn't that you stop, the frustrating part is that you lose ALL control. You can't try and steer to avoid falling off of the track, you just go forward a little at a fixed speed. 

Pack in a great hitstun/combo system, some decent players that can read, react and play mind games, a GREAT 1v1 online system and 4 player offline for those into that kind of thing and you have a great overall package.


Here are some gfycats of some real gameplay (from an older build, but still the same game really) so you can see some..not randy day 1 gameplay. Keep in mind, these are from an older build and are not fully the same as the product you are buying now.

And goddamn I fell in love within 3 matches of the game, everything was so smooth the music was godlike all the characters are unique in their own way. Its simply just, perfect.

                                                              -Things you're probably curious about-
        
         Air-dodging works kind of like Smash-4. You can air dodge only once before touching the ground, but you are able to input commands after the air dodge. this works great for escaping combos and then being able to retaliate mid air. Wave-dashing is also in this game, but with the air dodge mechanics you can't kill yourself by missing a Waveland off the edge, which is a plus. 
        

The hitstun feels a lot like Smash 64, making combos feel extremely clean, but the percent dealt by comboing moves has been adjusted accordingly. L-Cancelling has been done away with, but aerials have very low landing lag, so air -> ground comboing still feels fluid.
         

Character selection is currently expectedly low, with only 6 currently playable, but don't let that scare you away. As of writing this, the 3 hours I've put into this game (all in the surprisingly good online play) has been with a single character. Also, since this is still early access, you can be sure to expect new characters in the future.

All in all, an incredibly good game, it takes the groundwork that the Smash games built, and puts it into a competitively-aimed game with remarkable results. 10/10",1442917876,1442917994,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,291,2,7625,0,483,1588793110

You probably found this if you're a Smash Bros player, in which case you know you're in for some Melee flavored action with a unique spin.
If you're not familiar, then you should know that this is a kinda niche title. It still has content that would be good for parties, but if you plan on getting into it more, you'll be seeing a lot of Smash terms.

You should also know that it doesn't support Gamecube controllers right now, and I don't know if it's planned, but you CAN get it working flawlessly with x360ce.

Ideally I would like to see that support, optimizations in the engine, and little quirks (like Maypul's dair and Orcane's fair not showing hitboxes in training) fixed

I do think this is a stellar release, though. The fighting is fun immediately and the characters have thoughtful design. The training mode settings are great and the attention to detail and certain design choices show that the developer has competitive play in mind. I think this has the potential to really go somewhere if it catches on.

BUT if you're not into Smash, I can't say I recommend it as of the initial release.

It has similar mechanics to Super Smash Bros Melee, but you can't grab
edges and players, and you preform counters instead of shields.

So far there are 6 characters with 2 more on the way which is fine for
an indie game but I would still like to see more.

It has a very good soundtrack and very nice pixel style graphics.

---Stuff that I would like to see in the future---
-Improvment to online play (had terrible lag when fighting against random opponents. haven't tried with friends yet).
-To preform a Smash attack, you have to press a sepeate button. It would be nice if it worked like in Smash, where you tap the analog stick fast.
-Workshop support for levels would greatly increase the replayability.
-Some way for fans to submit ideas for new characters, so we wont be left with just 8.
