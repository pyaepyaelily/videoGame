0,Sands of Salzaar,77187230,english,"Finding the English option in a menu written in mandarin was the most interesting gaming experience I had this month.

This game is basically an Ouighur-management simulator - How to genocide your neighbors - except you're not the Han, you're Vietnam: everyone finds you so cute they want to invade you in every way possible.

I grinded, grinded and grinded again, and now two hundred Vietnamese with knives run around me to kill anyone who dares breath the same air I do. City management is fun when you reach City-level genocide, and territorial conquest is too. Speaking of quests, they're ok, the usual fetch-feast.

I wish I could enslave people instead of killing every living soul, but it's only a minor problem.

26,Sands of Salzaar,77020348,english,"An easy recommend for the bargain bin price: 8/10. Plenty of content even in early access, surpassing many triple AAAAYYYY games out there. Very high replayability with a wide array of skillsets to choose from during character creation to tweak your own unique build. That being said, there're a couple of things I've got issues with:

1) The combat is janky & unwieldy. Biggest problem is the pace, you have time to issue ONE order (attack/defend/follow) to whatever army group (melee/ranged/cav) you have before the enemy is on you (usually under 3sec, less if they have cav) & everything devolves into a messy brawl: melee & cav bump & slide around each other while ranged troops run around like headless chickens. You simply don't have the time to use proper troop tactics in combat, you're much better off using those precious few seconds to fire off your hero skills before you get swarmed again. Simply allowing the player to pause or slow down combat to issue orders will make things SOOOO much better.

2) But the single most annoying thing about this game: ITEM DURABILITY. Everything other than your mount & trade goods break, even your trinkets. They break even if you don't take any damage, simply engaging in combat will suffice. Worse still, you can't just head to the nearest town & click repair items to handle it for a price. Oh no, you're got to buy tools from a small handful of towns that sell them and then repair your items individually. An unnecessary & frustrating waste of time.

The game has some really fun elements, but I'm not sure I'd advise anyone to play it until some problems are fixed.  I understand this is a small dev team, so I apologize for harshness in my earlier reviews.  Rewritten to be less grumpy.

-- THINGS THAT NEED TO BE FIXED BADLY: --

QUICKSAVE SAVES IN SAME SLOT AS AUTOSAVE: It is basic game UI convention these days for quicksave and autosave to not occupy the same slot, because it is intensely frustrating and disappointing for a player to find the game autosaved an undesired game over his quicksave.  The ability to do regular saves is not enough.
Recommendation: Eliminate autosave, or make sure they save in different slots.  I'd rather have no autosave than a bad autosave.

PROCEDURAL QUEST DEADLINES: I hate them.  They spoil the game because you now have to rush around having to skip stuff.  The only solution is to either (1) avoid procedural quests, because they're such a headache half the time, or (2) save/reload until it assigns a doable quest, which is time-consuming and tedious.  I mean, some of them don't even tell you the destination until you've accepted them already.  Annoying, stressful and not fun at all. 
Recommendation: Eliminate or greatly extend them.

UI AND TEXTBOX PACING: The textboxes are too slow and the animations are very insistent.  I find myself clicking over and over in frustration and irritation.  Especially with often-repeated text, it's like a time-wasting load screen put there for no good reason.  The characters being ""typed"" in slowly, and then speeding up a bit if you click, still takes several tedious seconds holding the player up.  And the text scroll playing an animation when opened, closed and page-flipped also adds time waste on top of that.
Recommendation: When a player wants to skip, a player wants to skip.  Make it so text interactions/conversations can be skippable in a matter of 1-2 seconds, not 8-20 seconds.
Speeding it up 50% or whatever is not enough.

FIGHTS START UNPAUSED: In most cases, this is not a problem, but what happens when you're face-to-face with a boss who can 3-shot you?  As soon as the loading screen disappears and the fight has started, the boss has already launched that attack at you, and you have no time to react.  This is frustrating and feels like a cheap shot, particularly since some bosses are extraordinarily difficult already.
Recommendation: increase the distance in difficult fights and/or have the player unpause the fight when it's finished loading.

PUNITIVE/ARTIFICIAL DIFFICULTY: With some fights, the difficulty feels more like a crazy bullet-hell game, and it feels unfair, despite being maxed out with good gear.  Twitch-reflex players might like it, but tone it down for the rest of us.
- The Sol Warrior fight is too much.  Too many rapid, long-range attacks that affect 
 larger area than the AoE warning arc graphic indicates (if it shows a 90 degree arc, it's hitting 110 degrees, and it's almost impossible to roll out of if he centers it on you).  That 110-degree arc attack is only avoidable if you're lucky, and it inflicts a 7-8-second knockup/knockdown/stun status, during which the boss chains other attacks on you.  And he hits hard enough to 3- or 4-shot you.  The fight is a long fight, and I really hate that if he catches you on this attack once and chains you, there goes 75% of your health.  Feels like a cheap shot.  When I finally beat him, I did not feel a sense of accomplishment.  I felt a sense of frustration that the game had wasted so much time making me fight it over and over again hoping for a lucky break.
- The Pahoehoe Lava Void dungeon boss is ridiculous -- depending on what attack he opens up with immediately after the load screen is over, he one shots my entire team with a wave fire attack.  Again, maxed out, good gear (including orange gear from other bosses).  Not much room to maneauver, massive AoE attacks that do high damage, and companions die within seconds even if he doesn't do the immediate one-shot.
Recommendation: Tone these down!  Feels like you're going for Darksouls difficulty here, but half the difficulty is artificial and unfair, and action-strategy players probably don't want to spend 2 hours trying to beat one boss -- we want to move on.

-- THINGS THAT SHOULD PROBABLY BE FIXED: --

BACKGROUND MUSIC IN BATTLES: I actually quite like most of it, but that occasional deathmetal for combat is wtf.  I'm sure some people like it, but it is out of character with the rest of the music, and a lot of players don't like it.  It's a shame as is, because I liked the other tracks enough that I didn't immediately turn them off (which I almost always do with games)!
Recommendation: Different battle music.  Perhaps make individual music tracks blockable via checkbox.  

IN-GAME FEEDBACK FUNCTION DOESN'T WORK: In-game feedback option on the menu is broken.

When you approach a ranged enemy as a melee fighter they just run away and split all over the freaking huge map. When you finally caught one and hit him once. He just run away again... so annoying. 

And no, choosing a ranged character yourself doesn't help at all. Your projectiles have a travel time, its not point an click and target locked. Which makes your projectiles really hard to hit an running enemy.

Build a bigger army to deal with it? Nope! doesn't work! Your army just chase them, and they just run and run and run. 

Maybe this is better to deal with in the later stages of the game when you get more abilities. I havn't be there yet.

51,Sands of Salzaar,76918018,english,"This is a great game, and if the devs keep building on it, it will become incredible, but it gives you virtually no help/guidance, so I've decided to share some of the key things I've learned since starting the game last week. Hopefully these tips can prove useful to new players:

1) The start is going to be ROUGH. You're going to want to explore and get drawn off into the vast world on offer, but you'll find yourself out of your depth and failing quests pretty quickly if you're not careful. Stick with your main character quests and the Redstone keep area whilst you level up, otherwise you'll end up with a dead squad and lost reputation with factions. Don't worry, once you level up, you'll feel more powerful and it's a pretty decent power curve depending on your character class.
2) Don't be afraid to take on basic units for 150Utar - they will grow with you and can be levelled up into very powerful units. 
3) Keep hold of anything you receive as a 'gift' when raiding/questing - they are usually items of interest that you can give to potential party members to win them over. One example is the combat gloves/helmet etc. - you can gift those to a female character in the Eastern Umbra Cliffs with red hair (I forget her name) and she will join you.
4) Don't go seeking out any quest and hoarding quests as many have timers (it will tell you, but only AFTER you accept the quest) - many will be beyond your capabilities for a while, so better to come back later once you're Lvl 15+
5) In Umbra Cliffs you can find Ultimate Forge Hammers easily which will repair any equipment, so if you find yourself with a decent piece of gear with low durability, head down there and stock up.
6) Utar is tight at first, a great way to get more is to ask town Chiefs for quests and sometimes they will give you a quest about a kidnapped noble with a 1,000 Utar reward. They will give you 1,000 Utar (which you can spend if you want and go rogue) which if you then deliver to the Bandits who kidnapped the noble, will net you a 1,000 Utar reward with no fights and minimal work. Easy 1,000 Utar, plus reputation gain. 
7) Another easy early quest to look out for are ones about groups of teenagers that have run away, they will usually be easy to find (one set to the right of town, left of town and below the town). You get an easy fight for XP, then nice XP, Utar and reputation gain upon completion which is pretty quick.
8) Trading is the best way to boost your Utar - from Redstone buying the pepper is an affordable investment, then head north and you can sell it for a significant profit at the Golden Bazaar or another town near the top of the map. Similarly, taking something from the far South towns up North is easy money too.
9) You can fast travel. Press M to open the map, then right click on a location and select 'Move Here' then press 'T' and it will massively fast forward time so you get there v fast.
10) If you have a dead unit, you can revive them with a White Rose potion - I'd recommend getting early talents in the healing tree which will give you 2 potions every week, so that you can revive units if you find yourself regularly getting into tough fights.
11) Look out for Bandits attacking trade caravans - you can join the fight to assist the caravan for nice XP and loot - they are usually quite easy fights as you get help from the trader's party.
12) Once you're lvl 5+ attacking the Prisons to free captives is a good way to get free new units for your army.
13) If you come across a villager wanting wood in the Umbra Cliffs, don't give them any until you have a HUGE amount as I have almost 1,000 wood with no result.
14) To capture a camp you will see several control points once you attack it - simply go and hold each one until it turns green (Domination style) - if your units aren't doing what they want or you want them to push to take a point, select 'All Units' then 'Attack' to get them moving as sometimes they will just stand there.
15) Don't worry too much about Talent Point allocation as you get a seemingly endless supply regardless of level cap. They are all strong trees and there's no 'best starting tree' as it depends what you'll be focusing on first (trade vs more characters in party vs large army etc.)

There's still a way to go and the combat could certainly be improved with units running endlessly into walls etc. but it's well worth your time and money - plenty of replayability and quest galore. I haven't tried taking over a town for myself yet but will be giving that a go soon too.

The initial clash is fine, very indicative of charging armies clashing in melee, but after that initial charge it devolves into chaos with all units running everywhere, half or more of the enemies charging my PC hellbent on murdering it ignoring any other sources (makes kiting a hilariously easy way to win any battle), the other half running around like chickens with their heads cutoff occasionally turning around to hit something. 

My other nitpick is there is no indication on how to recover units (or I missed it because am dum dum) under normal circumstances you would expect your units to eventually recover on their own.. but this does not appear to be the case (yet) and require a special potion which appears to only be acquired from the healing talent tree (maybe also dropped too but no luck there yet) of which I only found out through looking up online.

You play a Hero that can level up, learn new abilities and so on like most RPG's and he or she can be costomized greatly down to silly masks, hats and facial expressions. During creation you spend legacy points which you gain while doing special bosses, dungeons and the like so that next character might have the ""nameless"" class, which is basically possibly all the classes from tank to mage rolled into one, that is if you have enough legacy points saved up.

The story is pretty generic in its own, ""save the world"" a few obvious plot twists that you see a mile away, so as main story goes not mind blowing BUT! there are some pretty awesome side quests, where choices affect outcome and so on, so maybe the main story will get fleshed out more later on since it is early access, who knows, at least compearing side quests and the main quest, it seems the main quest got the short end of the stick.

Anyhow in addition to your main character you can hire other heros to join you, the other heros tend to have 1 unique skill and a two secondary skills, which compear to the nameless is a joke, with high arcana mastery (determin how high max level spell casting you can learn in game not from start but in game) a ton of bonus stat skill trees and possibly a whole class or three. and you can also recruit generic soldiers that can rank up.

like Farmer -> mercenary -> Mercenary Spearman or Crossbow or Sword
or Apprentice Witch -> Witch -> Shaman -> High Shaman

some might need to be merged with one another before they can rank up like most wolves you pick up is made up of a unit of 2 in a position but to make them into alpha the highest evolution of wolves it must be 4 in a unit.

You need to acquire towns, train soldiers, keep garrisons perhaps even keep NPC heros in the garrison but if they do they might get bribed away, at least generic soldiers are definatly not going to change sides.

You build Gold (Utar) bazaars which trades with other cities, mines for iron, lumber yards for lumber and jade quarries for jade (mage type units use jade for upgrade or even purchase) in addition to these buildings there are some unique ones, like training cavalery, toxic scorpions, food storage and much more.

Anyway as RPG's goes it has been ages since i have played a game this well made, and at price of 10 bucks it was not only a steal it was down right robbery. The guys making this is making a title that is by all means amazing even with a super generic storyline the other factors make more than enough up for it.

96,Sands of Salzaar,76749634,english,"Before we delve into the bulk of the review, I would like to utter a confession. I bought this game with only minor prior knowledge, having minimal information for the developer or the story itself. I bought this game for the aesthetics and frankly, because of my heartfelt desire to pollinate with that seductive, blue eyed vixen featured on the front cover. Now that my confession has been revealed, allow the genuine review to commence.

Upon loading into the game, I was greeted with personally engraved Chinese messages. Using my knowledge of basic Mandarin, I was able to decipher the true meaning of these messages. It appeared that an entire barrage of threats, perpetuated by the Chinese government was being sent to my person. An onslaught of demands, ‘requested’ my assistance, with refusal to do so resulting in imprisonment in one of their ‘training’ centres. Naturally, I refused to comply with these unfeasible demands, promptly changing the translation to English. Note, the ability to change the language wasn’t exactly concealed and as such it took 10 minutes to locate. You’d presume that you’d be able to alter the default language before you loaded up the game, but alas no, these developers want you to suffer for not speaking fluent Mandarin. 

After, changing the language, I briskly began to play the game, entering the customization section. Quickly, I realised that the options were relatively limited, with the hair and eye colour unable to become modified. As a result, I used what tools were available to my person and set about creating a bug eyed, wilderbeast, wearing the mask of a feline. Truly the epitome of masculinity. After creating my elite Chinese soldier, I delved into the realm of this already peculiar game. Upon loading, I found myself venturing in the barren depths of the Chinese desert, scavenging for supplies like a lowly peon. Due to the lacking tutorial and complete disappearance of any quest markers, I was at a loss. I decided the most logical course of action would be to accumulate an army and fortunately there was an encampment nearby. My cursor revealed that in said encampment there were mistreated prisoners, with the hastily made translation insinuating that the prisoners would fling to my banner if I saved them. Naturally I attempted to free the prisoners, albeit it all went awry. After attempting to assassinate 15 guards, inflicting minor wounds, my skull was cracked open like a coconut crab and I was promptly released with a stern warning.  I was astounded by this utterly idiotic dialogue, these guards who were supposed sadists, torturing defenceless prisoners just allowed an attempted murderer to leave, virtually unscathed. Astoundingly, these guards are a tolerant bunch. After my stern warning I learnt my lesson and began to wander the desolate, bleak plains of Feudal China. Everywhere I went, I was harassed by wolves and insecure bandits, facing animosity in every direction. All the while, I was stuck in this God forsaken desert, surrounded by the same surroundings. Truly an extraordinary start. 

After fighting numerous adversaries, I realised with dismay that the combat was repetitive drivel, with the auto combat rivalling that of even Raid Shadow Legends. From my experience, the combat appears to be occasionally clicking space to dodge, left clicking enemies to attack and sparsely using special abilities, all the while allowing the character to auto manage the majority of the combat. Truly, I would rather have Dwarven harlots come to my house daily, with Jehovah’s witness ham fisting a Bible down my throat then endure this disgraceful combat system. 

Anyhow, even after all seemed bleak, I persevered, determined to try to extract a tinge of enjoyment. Shortly, in my campaign I encountered a bandit leader camp, and promptly decided to “Make Trouble” for them. While I originally envisioned a mass assault, resulting in a massacre, the reality was relatively underwhelming. Apparently the hastily constructed translation meant 1v1 duel the bandit leader with flimsy practice weapons and afterwards shake hands. After my initial triumph, I attempted to fight the bandit leader again, however, the bandit with a gesture of chivalry deigned not to. It is truly astounding, how such courtesy exists in a world rife with violence and bloodshed. 

At this moment I gleaned some significant information, the story, narrative and translation was immensely shoddy. Barely any consistency exists, characters change allegiances on a whim, quests don’t have markers and it all erupts into a confusing mess. The characters motivations if utterly devoid of logic and is frankly ludicrous, I recall witnessing the justification for a quest being, “He seems serious we should do something.” This ties in well with the locations for quests. When compared to a game such as Mount and Blade, although no quest markers existed, the description detailed the location of the village the quest was nearby, allowing the missions to be completely with convenience and administrative efficiency. In this game on most occasions you are told, “Please save and ransom my friend, he is nearby.” GREAT, THANKS. Furthermore, since I am not a Chinese farmer toiling away at my rice fields ,describing a characters appearance as, “He is as a dried vegetable on the first day of the rainy season” makes little sense. Overall, the dialogue is more perplexing than all the solar systems combined, it is a genuine enigma. 

I have witnessed those with Stockholm syndrome, attempting to justify a positive review for this game. They describe this game as a ‘Good alternative to strategy games.’ To call this game a good alternative to other strategies, is equivalent to saying, ‘This toaster is a suitable alternative to bath soap’, it is utterly ridiculous. Those suffering from Stockholm syndrome, furthermore, call the game a ‘Good game with flaws’, which is identical to saying, ‘Ted Bundy is a wholesome man with slight personality flaws.’ It becomes apparent that the undying fans, of this shrivelled, decayed game are severely downplaying the downsides in order to convince themselves that this game in it’s current state is a worthwhile investment. 

Overall, this game is as though I am bound to a chair, being slapped and beaten within an inch of my life by an old man. Every time, I recuperate, he then forces me, under threat of assaulting my wife and children, to play this game, essentially perpetuating me to endure this game. Eventually, after such a prolonged period of playing this game, I scream, I bellow and I shout and eventually the neighbours hear and alert the police, who siege my captors house and eventually save me. Afterwards, I then suffer from trauma and resort to alcoholism in an attempt to purge the memories of my experience playing this, temporarily it succeeds, however, eventually the embodiment of mediocrity returns to haunt my computer. Fortunately, shortly afterwards, I write this review and with the power of venting, all of my inner demons are expelled and once again I am a pure individual, able to escape the wrath of this game and their squirrel developers. It is not often that I play a game of this calibre. I would like to conclude that my enjoyment level while playing peaked at 2/10, that our overlords have flawlessly translated this game and soon it will be ready for cyber warfare.

- When you start the game, your weapon and armor will not be equipped automatically. Equip your items before you do anything.

- Keep an eye on the mini-map. Helmet logos signify places where you can acquire new troops.

- It takes awhile to get your first settlement in game UNLESS you choose the Sultan as your starting class. If you choose the Sultan, you will need to build up your settlement and your garrison. Keep in mind that after a month you will be attacked. Plan accordingly.

- When trying to recruit hero characters, it is often enough to give them 1 gift or do 1 quest for them. Charisma helps if you want to get on their good sides early on--something that will benefit you later in the game.

- When managing squads, there's a button that says ""activate"" but it should say ""Combine"". So if you have two smaller squads of, say, wolves, you can combine them into a single, larger squad.

- Attacking settlements and bandit camps is like playing League of Legends. Defend against the first wave of enemies before you choose to attack, however, to keep your forces united and strong.

32,Sands of Salzaar,76643241,english,"Sands of Salzaar takes no issue in challenging mount&blade's long lasting dominion over low-effort sandbox-rpg genre. Luckily for it, it does it particularly well between its use of RPG and Turn-based strategy elements along with a slapping soundtrack and enticing graphical vision. Released in China on January 3rd, the game made its way to English localization only recently. While it's still in early access on Steam, it offers a  promising amount of upcoming content . It can be modded extensively, just like m&b can, but most of its modbase is in Chinese language for now - the developers has recently launched a modmaking party recently to remedy that, I suppose.

Pros:
Sandbox content is well crafted, balanced and intriguing
Visuals complement the game's themes while looking pretty good despite the low-poly approach
Freeform character customization
Regularly updated

Cons:
There are some placeholder-esque low effort design choices that mar the overall experience
The English localization gives you a general idea of what's going on, but that's about its extent 
Lots of bugs, but none was gamebreaking in my experience

80,Sands of Salzaar,76540108,english,"i've only just started the game, but my first playthrough went from picking it up at around 9 pm and playing until 4 am. Off the bat this game is basically a 2d mount and blade with high fantasy elements. Can't really speak much on the story since I got side tracked from that, however I'm sure its cool enough.

Pros:
- The in game faction politics are very fun, and immediately change how you get through the game. Fuck over any faction and you can get hunted down, and you'll have a harder time being able to do other side quests
-The scope of combat can get quite large, and there is a good balancing between skill of the player and how squishy he is against dozens of mobs. The 2d overhead view also helps manage the battle.
-Combat has loads of way you can spruce things up with abilities and items and can help turn the tide of battle.
-There are various kinds of quests in this game, some flashbacks, some basic fetch quests, some centered around slaying enemies, recovering farmers etc. Most village quests coming from unnamed npcs will have this randomized ai feel to it but that's ok, I just hope the story is good.

Now here are my cons/areas to improve:
-Npcs leftover from quests you failed to finish with just walk around the map and can't even be interacted with anymore. I say that at least in single player mode there should be a way to get rid of them
-Nothing wrong with a lot of these quests having a timer, the main issue is though that we don't have any reliable ways to get to any where or know where things are. Not saying we need some massive arrows leading us everywhere but maybe some interactable sign posts being put up can help us a bit? 

These are my current thoughts and I'd like to update them as time goes on. This is my first alpha testing and I have high hopes for this game, especially since I haven't enjoyed many games in months",1601046505,1601046505,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,223,6,1314,1314,408,1601175646,,
81,Sands of Salzaar,76539410,english,"The main draw of this game for me was a top-down hack and slash version of mount and blade. However the combat in this game is feels very underwhelming as a melee user because the enemies keep running around like headless chickens, causing you to whiff attacks. What's worse is that in late game you get to fight troops which spams endless amounts of non-telegraphed crowd control making combat feel much more worse. The game somewhat lets you control your troops in fight but it's mostly pointless since they only allow you to give orders for attack/defend/follow in this game and you can't micro them manually at all. There's also no unit collision in game so the enemy and you can freely phase through each other to kill ranged units, granted you dont get CC'd or kited to oblivion. Maybe the game is better on a magic user, but I had my fill of the combat for now.

The game very much stills feel incomplete, it's doesnt even have a proper prisoner system like in MB. If you manage to kill another leader/member of another faction they will magically respawn at their capital in a few days time which is really dumb. Companions are also pretty bland and don't seem to talk at all unless prompted to compared to MB. While companions might seem like a big power boost to your team, they are very lackluster since they only carry one skill, are limited to their preferred weapon and worst of all you have to carry a lot of hammers since durability is in the game to repair their gear. So for them to be good you also have to try to find skill books in the game from book merchants which are both hard to find and you might get a crappy skill that doesnt do good damage as they only have one book in stock at a time.

The random quests from towns are pretty basic kill bandit/send stuff but the bandits sometime spawn far away from the supposed area making them hard to find. The sidequests are alright but most of them dont really reward very well for time invested except for a few.

83,Sands of Salzaar,76534394,english,"Mount and Blade with ARPG combat. All right. That's it. That's the review.

Just kidding. Let's start with the good, because this game does do some things quite well, and then we'll move on to the bad and the ugly. I would like to preface all of this with a preword. At the time of writing, this game was freshly translated to my native language, English, and as such I've decided not to touch too heavily on the story. Now it's there, but the English is quite broken. Even so, things like pacing, introduction of character and building of tension and stakes are severely limited. Does that matter in a sandbox game? Probably not. That's why my section on story is here and not in Good, bad or ugly.

The Good. The game's honestly quite fun. If you enjoyed any of the army management or kingdom management stuff from Mount and Blade, you'll probably like this game. The different armies are varied and interesting and the tiered troops feel stronger and stronger, gaining ARPG abilities as they level up to accomodate their style and not just flat statistical improvements. Hero characters can have their own, unqiue skills that change the way they fight and it's all quite interesting to explore. The maps are presented as wonderfully hand-drawn almost woodblock looking maps and everything is easy to read and identify. There's nothing really new, but the Action RPG skills and customization is an interesting approach. The game features a system called ""Prestige"" which allows you to bank points for consequent playthroughs. These are awarded as Legacy points to your character on character creation, incentivizing repeated playthroughs. With these legacy points, you can also scale the difficulty, and in-game it claims there is no limit to the difficulty scaling coded, so the game has a lot of replayable value besides just the classes themselves. Speaking of the classes, the design and theme of the game are great, being primarily influenced by Chinese culture but also having many aspects of middle eastern culture such as Sultans, Hashashin, Camels and desert culture in general, but overall there isn't a lot added to the classes. We've seen them all in other ARPGs, with perhaps the exception of the ""Errant Knight"" who's class would probably make more sense if it was called ""Ronin Samurai"", because that's what he is. English speaking players expecting a ""Knight"" might be a little confused for a moment. Using this system, you can even later create your own class who can take legacy bonuses of having the abilties of the other classes, allowing you to fully customize your character.

The bad. The A.I. is abysmal. Now, if you're used to Mount and Blade, none of this is going to sound too new to you, but the game is fraught with A.I. making the dumbest decisions. I'm not expecting every fight to be a match of wits against Zhuge Liang, but so many aspects of the A.I. are just broken. Enemies who are designed to Skirmish like cavalry or archers will flee into walls and get stuck. Your character rigs to the ground to play a swing animation with no chase, so if anything moves slightly, you miss. The extent of the military strategy is just big, ugly murderballs and your A.I. allies will gladly fight them or engage in battles with no chance of winning on the offensive. Nearly no aspect of the A.I. is really good to look at.

The game is also horrifically imbalanced from almost every angle or approach, with some classes being clearly far superior to others. This is marginally mitigated by the option to take Legacy Skills so you're able to fill in the gap on your character class, but there are also classes with no gaps so they use those same points just getting and remaining outright stronger with, for example, a stat boost legacy. Part of this imbalance arises from a system which I think is pretty neat, which is a shame. A lot of the encounters and events in the game are split up into ""Squad"" and ""Company"" battles. Squad battles are essentially small encounters with you and your bodyguards similar to an ambush in Mount and Blade but much more prevalent. Company encounters use your entire force. Certain classes, such as the Shaman (Beastmaster) and Sentinel excel at fighting in Company and others, Such as the Hashashin and Jackal (Bounty Hunter) excel more at smaller encounters and duels. Then there are the wild boiz who can do anything, such as the Spiritmancer and the Knight Errant. The problem is that as the game progresses, you're invariably going to fight wars against other Kingdoms. There's no way to honour duel or use your single-target character's abilities to reduce the enemy's forces effectively, and even worse it's a much more painful crawl to get to the point where you're strong enough to be sufficient either way. They don't even have an advantage in the early game to counteract. So you're just going to have a MUCH easier and easily noticed time playing different classes.

The UI could definitely use some work and specifically, the player should be alerted of friendly armies on the march and their destination as well as easier options to collaborate with your allies, perhaps through a Marshall or messenger, but a lot of it's functional at bare minimum.

The ugly. The elephant in the room for this category is the character portraits, but i'll also put down some other minor gripes. The character portraits look like something out of an anime fanpage on deviant art. And not one of those amazing artists, but someone who's just getting started and has no talent. I appreciate the customization within the confines of the system and some of the art genuinely looks good, but the whole procedure feels cheap and reminds me of a mobile game or one of those facebook gimmick ""meme"" generators. I would rather have the limited choice between a bunch of those crazy eyed Japanese woodblock characters or some traditional chinese inspired art than a build your own chinese anime husbando or waifu, but with the interactions playing out like a visual novel, it's hard to imagine another system working.

I would love to see at least double the number of legacy skills and perhaps a skill builder that allows you to add effects like ""Dash"" and set variables for range, then chain it into something like ""AoE"", ""Knockback"" ""Draw in"", ect, because the current skills just feel like they're (perhaps purposely) lacking some punch, and this system would allow you to comprehensively fill gaps in character design, but I can also understand why the systems might be the way they are. Still, if it's buried deep enough in the legacy system, new players wouldn't miss the original vision.

Ultimately, I think if you like both Mount and Blade and Diablo you'll be able to extract the asking price's value worth of enjoyment out of this game. I've already sank around 20 hours into just playing a few classes and I still have plenty of things to learn and explore. Wiki pages are limited in English at the moment so it might be a bit difficult if you're not used to wading into the game with reckless abandon, but with a very minor roguelite element that allows for persistence in the form of prestige and legacy, even your first few failed attempts will be worthwhile down the line.",1601039837,1601039837,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,147,16,1994,1994,1195,1601652732,,

90,Sands of Salzaar,76512788,english,"A bit like Mount and Blade in that you lead a group of fighters in an open world. Trading, banditry, taking over towns and settlements all seem to be included. However, the combat plays much more a clunky action RPG. Imagine Diablo, but the control are not very responsive. For a game where many (perhaps most) things are gained by the sword, it's a shame that fighting does not feel quite right.

 If it allowed you to pause to issue orders, like more traditional party-based RPGs, the lack of responsiveness might be forgiven. But since you'll regularly be facing down dozens of opponents, as hero units (the player included) are balanced more like Dynasty Warriors protagonists, it's difficult to get around the fact that you control like a yacht being dragged across land by a pack of wild boars. 

I don't know if the lack of control over your squads of troops is a blessing or a curse either. On one hand, not being able to pause means that issuing orders would only make controlling your land yacht main character even worse. On the other hand, not having fine control can quickly lead to frustration over how the AI handles battle tactics.

Currently with the state of combat as it is, it's hard to recommend. However, it gets a thumbs up for the fact that devs seem active, the overall package has potential, and it's not hard to see ways to improve the experience that could address what I have mentioned.

9,Sands of Salzaar,76470523,english,"After 26 hours in just 2 days after the English release, all I can say is that Sands of Salzaar is a true diamond in the rough.

[u] Pros: [/u]
- Very nice artwork

- So-so BGM, not very good in my opinion, but somewhat fitting and not bad.

- Combat system is a mix between old school Chinese MMORPG and light strategy, actually scratch that, the whole game is a mix between Chinese MMORPG and Mount And Blade, I love it.

- Very nice variety in troops that you can hire, and assembling a team of companions that are actually as strong as the player feels very rewarding.

-And finally, the game has achieved what Mount and Blade 2 failed to achieve, a huge, meaningful world filled with many stories and secrets for the player to explore and solve, you can actually be a wandering vagabond with no interact with the world political matters (and not feel bored after 4 hours because the contents are just repeatable battles, quests and trading) in this game. 

[u] Cons: [/u]
- Rough start: The starting of the game is currently very rough, you got plunged into a world full of unknown without any direction or help, many the player does not have enough sense of belonging and immersion at this point to start exploring without directions, especially for the players who just want to try it out for under 2 hours, thus explain why there are so many under 2 hours Not Recommended reviews.
 
- Political Relation system: The political relations will fuck you up really hard at the start if you decide to side with some random farmers or traders to kill bandits, as helping one faction will result in negative relation with factions that are at war with them, and only minus 1 point in relation would result in you being denied access to the faction's outpost. 

- Locked skill tree: I first came into this game expecting to be able to study and rise from a normal person, to an elemental wizard, or a master swordman, or whatever feels the most fun, but the game simply locks the skill tree in the starting character choosing, quite a disappointment for me.

- Shallow character progression: I played as a wandering swordman or something, and the skill tree is just 1 path, there are branches, but mostly just a passive or upgrade of the active skill that you can either take or leave, the elemental magic that you can learn around the world is a straight skill ""tree"" with no branches at all. The 20 level cap just add more to that shallowness.

- Unimpressive combat system: 
+ Since the amount of skills you can learn are quite limited, combat is simply a repetition of using the same skills that you 
   have used since forever, this matter become worse in later levels, when every troops become massive bullet sponges that 
   require you to spam a lot more just to kill one. 
+ The strategy aspect in sieges are fine, but almost is in-existent normal large combat, as you cannot pause when opening 
   the strategy screen.
+ Damaged enemies running away while could be somewhat realistic, is actually more annoying than fun.

[u] Suggestion: [/u] Here are some ideas that I hope would contribute something to the game 

- A starting NPC at the recommended starting location that sells the basic necessities ( low-level gears, some food... ), warns the player a bit about the game systems, and give some pointers to the opportunities around, all under the guise of a small-time merchant that trying to sell their stuffs for newcomers to the land.
 
- An encyclopedia for the troops, monsters and systems so that the players can look deeper into the game.

- Skill trees expansion, and the ability to start as a nobody and being able to study whatever powers they want. (with, or without restriction)

- Pause when using strategy. Might not be as realistic, but since the speed of the battle is so fast, using strategies are currently very hard for new players.

- Enemies running away when damaged makes sense, but it's better to tune it down a bit, allowing the player to have more time to deal damage.

[u] Conclusion: [/u]
- While there are many features that needs more refining, the game itself is currently very enjoyable if you made it past the start (or just experiment with the first save, then starts for real in the second).

- One more good point of the game is that there are very few bugs, nothing game-breaking on my experience, though there are some lags when starting to play.

- So if you enjoy Mount and Blade gameplay but wish for a bit more RPG, and don't mind a bit of gaming hardship then this is truly the game for you. 

Tl;dr:
- Good game
- Needs more refinements
- Recommend


*Edit: After a bit more of playing, and being unable to send message by the in-game tools, here are a bit more suggestions:

- Auto fight mode for player character, this would help reduce the repetitiveness of the game, and is very useful in sure-win situations.

- Let helping outpost gain relations with the faction and owner of that outpost. It simply makes sense, and give the player more ways to increase relations.",1600938635,1600948470,TRUE,190,1,0.936048567,24,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,114,11,2963,1471,1658,1601337191,,

11,Sands of Salzaar,76472072,english,"This game has massive potential. The world building framework and party building concepts are some of the best I've seen. There are a lot of things that need to be polished and balanced, but that's expected for an early access game. The reason I'm giving the current version a thumbs down, however, is a key mechanic that severely lowers the fun - expiration timers.

This game presents itself as an open world sandbox. Yet a huge number of quests and events in the game have expiration timers attached. The timers are a problem because many quests do not tell you beforehand that they have an expiration. Quests also mention locations that unless you've explored the whole map, you often have no idea where they actually are. So what ends up happening is that as you meet NPCs and take on quests, you end up with a bunch of quests that have unexpected timers attached, and you have no idea where they actually are, or you find out after studying the world map that they are actually multiple regions away from you on opposite sides of the world. This forces you to either ignore the ticking timer and take reputation penalties when they expire, or run around like a headless chicken trying to beeline from one quest area to another. This completely kills the open world sandbox aspect of the game.

There are a number of ways to solve this, from removing timers, to making every timed quest clear upfront, to showing the player a map of the quest location (and NOT just a name) before you decide to take it or not, to allowing you to abandon quests in the quest menu without penalties, etc. This game has so many interesting and even brilliant mechanics, but it also shows that just one influential and poorly executed mechanic can really dampen the experience.",1600942260,1600942260,FALSE,214,3,0.794543684,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,79,8,955,739,379,1601567427,,

The game railroaded me to the first settlement.  I could have gone elsewhere, but the areas off said rail seemed to contain only enemies above my level.

Although the skill system seemed interesting you don't have much to choose from.  Early game the ""recommended"" character is a fairly boring ranged attacker.  

Combat was, unfortunately, boring and clumsy.  Hold the left mouse button down to run around but also use left mouse to attack.  Holding shift keeps you in place so you can aim.  Diablo-style interface.  Click, click, click, use hotbar power, click, click, click.  Timing, reading the opponent etc. not really a thing.  The enemies, rather than fight, ran all over the battle map and I had to chase them down one at a time.

On the plus side, the hand-drawn art is nice and I enjoyed the combination of Arabic and Chinese influences.  Character customization has many cosmetic choices.  The music didn't stand out, but wasn't bad either.

Got some units for my army, got to the quest area finished a quest find a merchant fighting some dude but I thought the merchant attacked the other guy (it looked like the merchant ran at the other person) so i helped the other guy, now every city in the game hates me and i can only enter them at night due to one decision and it makes half the time playing the game not allowed to do some of the most important things I finished 3 quests for a city and it didnt help my reputation at all for the FACTION even though the CITY liked me now so they still didnt let me in and my reputation with the faction was stuck at -1 point which is enough to not be allowed in a city i guess, and every combat im in after about 3 seconds all the enemy units just start running around not even fighting so i just have to chase them down with attacks that dont track so I couldn't even hit them unless i ran into their pathing no matter what they are bandits, ogrelike creatures, wolves they all just sprint around and my fights are me trying to body block them for my army to kill them. 
TLDR:
The game seems good and has a lot of potential but right now I wouldn't suggest it my biggest issues are Enemy AI not caring at all about whats going on, and Reputation doesn't really make sense even though a camp likes me for helping the quests i was wanted by them because of the faction they were.

The game similar like Warband. But instead of a world map, you are wandering around many local maps. The reason I say it similar like Warband:
- You start with 1 man army, and then you recruit more and more.
- There is group of bandit, faction wandering around the map. 
- The combat exactly like Warband, you encounter a group of enemy, have a short talk and then both will move to another map for a battle. End of the battle you will have some random loot from the enemy. If they defeat you, then you will be captured as a prisoner and then you will escape from them in short time. After that you will ""respawn"" at the beginning of the map with some lost (stuff,gold,food,etc..) You might have a chance to capture the enemy as well when you defeat them.
- Economy changing all the time, the merchant may run out of stuff to sale but if you come back after a few days, his stuff will be fill.
- Faction war. 
- Everything keep going even with or without your action. 
- You can equip outfit/Armor/Clothes/Weapon/Stuff for your main character and your companion/army.
- Horses.
- Your army and also yourself need food to survive. 
- Level systems.

Things that new (doesn't exist in Warband):
- Skills (like summon stuff, explosion fireball ...)
-  Cute waifus
- Multi hit. you can attack multi enemy at the same time.
- Use potions outside/inside battle (healing,..)

Overall: 
- Worth getting (Wait for Sale)

84,Sands of Salzaar,64538149,english,"A really good game, reminds me of Kenshi with basic tribal warfare, relationships and factions. A mix of Mount and Blade with being able to start your own army and faction which can then get out of control having every other faction dislike you and send agents to kill you, but my experience with Sands of Salzaar was much better than previous said games.

I admit I was hooked from seeing the art style since it was so different than most games like this in the genre which captivated me straight away. Bought it, got in. Spent 5 minutes working out the menu, then starting a game, picking fights unintentionally then experiencing addicting combat.

Quite surprising the combat is very satisfying in my opinion, there are so many different skills and abilities that are both beautiful and insane. Every fight feels like an epic anime battle. I'm sure weebs would adore this gem of a game. I know i do.


And even though i still have no idea what i'm doing half the time, because the game is only in Chinese, i still manage to progress the story and have a ton of fun. Just screenshot and translate it to your desired language.

Also if the developer is reading this, i'm sure Westeners would pay for a translation or help fund for it on Kickstarter or equivalent, I know I would. It'd be nice to finally understand the politics, the menu screen, the options screen and then finally understanding every detail of story in the game.

Besides that, the game is worth buying even if just for waiting for it to be translated. I spent 40 hours in a game i don't understand, real gamers start learning a new language to game that's how mlg this game is.

I love it. Support the developer, give them your money.



另外，如果开发人员正在阅读本文，我确定Westeners会在Kickstarter或同等水平上为翻译支付费用或为其提供帮助，我知道我会的。最终了解政治，菜单屏幕，选项屏幕，然后最终了解游戏中每个故事的细节，将是一件很高兴的事情。

除此之外，即使等待翻译，也值得购买。我在一个我不理解的游戏中花了40个小时，真正的游戏玩家开始学习一种新的游戏语言，这就是这款游戏的意义所在。

我喜欢它。支持开发商，给他们钱。

游戏的战斗设计有点儿问题,其中之一就是没有时间限制
我今天玩儿的时候去打一个强盗老巢,看看对手级别不高就进入了战斗,结果进入了攻城模式
进去了之后,发现两边谁也打不过谁,强盗来打我我能给他们灭了,但是我去占他们的点,离开了之后他们还能占回来.  因为对面的队伍很多我的队伍很少,我的等级也不是很高,无法做到一人占据点,这样到最后就处于一种僵持状态.
一般来说游戏的战斗都会有个防止这种无限战斗状态的机制,有的游戏是时间限制,有的是回合数限制,还有的例如WOW之类的游戏会在战斗开始一段时间后让BOSS狂暴,hearthstone是爆牌之后每回合减血.
但是这个游戏没有这种机制,我守据点对面打不下我,我出去占据点对面会利用人数优势趁我离开的时候派人去偷,变成了来回绕圈子,无限循环很是尴尬.战斗里也没找到撤退,只好返回主菜单独档.
其实可以设计成每场战斗不能超过若干时间,或者是角色复活次数有上限(好像战争游戏里的人力资源)

Do speak and read Chinese so I believe I've experienced most aspects of the game.

Game is still in a very early stage of development I believe, and updates coming daily shows a high degree of engagement from the developers, which is pretty promising. The update notes that they provide are quite detailed, which is another sign that they are putting real efforts in this game.

- Game is pretty fun especially when battling against other factions; however the AI of the game is still buggy at times (improving rather quickly with the daily patches).

- Quite a bit of grinding when trying to collect and upgrade rare troops.

- Battle becomes a bit repetitive as you reach end game.

I really fell that this game has the potential to put the now days (Boomer dialog) triple A sandbox game in the shame corner  in my opinion if you want a good sandbox game that has a good story and backstory and plus you can change the cours of the story

Manage relationships with factions & people, recruit friends and soldiers, explore the world etc.

Although it is still pretty lacking in some aspects, the skills tree is pretty limited from what I gather, there seem to be a ""passing on"" feature where you can pass on part of what you've accumulated from your first character and give them to a new character. 

The combat is also tiresome at times, especially since I chose a class that automatically made me an enemy of almost all the factions and started with no troops or friendlies, just me against the world. I am still pretty interested in the different troops you can collect and upgrade though, seems cool.
