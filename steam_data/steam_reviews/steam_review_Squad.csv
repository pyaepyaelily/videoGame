0,Squad,77163347,english,"This is one of the most amazing realistic tactical large scale milsim games out there with amazing sounds, visuals, equipment, tactics, etc. Squad is a predecessor to Project Reality. There are some far fetched physics that are however completely illogical in any degree, things such as; a recycling bin stopping a tank, some tree branches toppling over a truck, the deep bodies of water in the game acting as acid and outright killing you as soon as you step into them, etc. There are some things not in the game that everyone wants but the engine cant handle well if it was to be implemented. Things such as, gore/body dismemberment, environmental destruction, attack helicopters, thermal sights for tanks, night vision combat, etc. Communication is  key in  this game, not communicating with your squad/team = dying and losing as a team. Urban warfare, vehicular battles, long range engagements, etc, be prepared for anything.

High K/D wont help the team 

Running like a crackhead like it's COD trying to run and gun wont help the team 

Playing like a one man army navy seal wont help the team  if you dont communicate with the rest of your team.

Rage quitting wont help the team 

Grabbing the tank or any other armored vehicles in hope you can outgun the whole lobby and win the game without talking wont help the team either if you dont communicate, you will just get shut down by enemy AT infantry if you dont have nearby friendly infantry to support your armor advance.

Having a mic will help the team 

Working together as one whole unit will help the team 

Following orders will help the team 

Not sprinting directly machine gunner bc you couldnt react in time to bring up ur weapon to fire back will help the team 

Working with friendly infantry units whilst playing as an armor unit when entering an urban environment will help the team 

Supporting armored assets as infantry while pushing and clearing out an urban area will help the team 

Properly managing ticket count will help the team 

You will have rage moments such as, being killed with one bullet 500+ meters from a well positioned marksman bullet and never seeing where your shooter's face and where the shots came from, after all this game is like real life combat, you wont see where your enemy is and you will fire in their general direction not knowing of you killed them or merely supressed them.

As for new players, if you have a mic and mention you're new but are willing to follow orders and communicate you will succeed, the more experienced players/squad leaders will be willing to show new players the ropes of the game.

>tldr
This game is a very realistic military simulator game that you've never seen before, communication, coordination and teamwork will almost always help win you battles, not how well you can flick headshots. Would highly recommend, 10/10 game.

I didnt think that was possible, but this game will turn my clean PC, that is well above the minimum requirements and very close to recommended requirements into a Jet engine. It is hard to play the game knowing that this game is making my rig scream at me. I even turned graphics all the way to low, but left v-sync on (this is because doing so actually makes the game run slightly better, go figure) still turned into a jet engine within 10 minutes. Turned the resolution from HD to 1280x720 and it STILL had me worried.

But that's not all, the devs brag in their trailers about their optimizations. AS IF THAT SHOULD EVER BE A SELLING POINT. But the full 1.0 release absolutely broke the game performance and optimization. Going into any server, you will be very lucky to have 45 fps. usually get 20-30 fps. It's fps is not a slideshow like Arma normally is, but it's still bad. It's not just me, numerous people are having the same issue.

16,,76972348,english,"BLUF - This game is a run simulator, and it is often difficult to spot enemies due to poor graphics. The price is very high for the current state of the game. But, overall I would say if you like slow paced strategy first person shooters this is for you! 

This game has a lot of potential! Things that need fixed are - graphics, choosing weapon classes, optics on weapons, and the tutorial. Everyone I've came accross in game that is new has no clue what is going on, even more experienced players are lost. The weapon class system is trash, and not realistic at all. Why cant you just make your own weapon? I understand limiting snipers, but let people customize their ARs. The graphics are the worst part of the game, it's very blurry and difficult to spot people at distance. At times this game seems like a ""run simulator"". More quick transport vehicles are needed, and please fix the fall damage. You can literally die from jumping off a normal compound wall (7-8ft).

Pros - the concept of the game is phenomenal, this game is funny at times and others very intense. How easy it is to kill/die makes this game great. It forces players to move tactically and move logically and as a unit. The communication structure in game is the best I've ever seen. The recoil is very realistic to each gun, and it is very well executed in this game.

There is name tags and or indicators for your own team but there is a second or two delay before they show up, and the further the distance the harder they are too see.
I understand this is supposed to be realistic. As realistic an army game without real bullets anyhow.
But in every other game like this at least the enemy uniforms are different.
It would help a lot if the Russian team actually had Russian style military uniforms.

Pros -
Game looks and sounds amazing.
Vehicles are dope if you know how to use them.
Maps and stunning.
Match start is funny af.

Cons-
Know one actually knows how to fight in war, so it becomes a shitshow real fast.
Gunplay is fucking awful, your character has Parkinson's 90% of the time.
Your character cant run but 5 feet without shitting himself in exhaustion.
Communication is actually nonexistent, you need a team to play this game.
Local chat is just retards yelling they need a medic or they kinda know where the bad guys are.
Just frustrating.



When you make a game that is so based on realism, you have to give information to your players. For 90% of players this game is pugs, that being said most of you games are going to be dogshit. The sole reason of this being you have NO information EVER. I dont know where the enemy is, I dont know where I am, I dont know what the actual fuck is happening. SL are actually potatoes half the time, and pings dont actually happen you need communication and it isnt streamlined in this game.

Would recommend that at least to watch a video from MoiDawg or Karmakut to learn some basics from them but the people in game usually are nice enough to help. Below is my original review from 2017 when I had somewhere around 330 hours at the time.

""Sure yeah it is hard to understand at first and nobody wants to squad lead because they're scared to or don't want to but it can be very fun to play by yourself and with friends. Other than the usual glitches, crashes, and poor performance at times, the wacky things that can happen are very fun and the sounds in the game are amazing. I would say pick this game up only if you're willing to learn how it plays because you're not going to have the best of times in the first hour to get a true feel for the game. Also just a heads up, please just pick rifleman for your first few games and if you ever choose marksman, please for the love of god just pick a different class if your Squad Leader says so because most people feel it is the most useless class. Also Desmo's Playground is a good server to ask for help as well with Level Gaming servers and be sure to introduce yourself when you join a squad and ask for help if you need it. They also have discord servers and Level Gaming has a website with a link to it. If you got this far, I wish you good luck and safe travels on the interwebs.

22,,30428897,english,"Easily the best game I played when it comes to conventional warfare immersion.

The atmosphere is realistic and will leave you captured within it as you fight across multiple battlefields and environments. There are several factions, vehicles, weapons, and maps. Some of these are accurately modeled after real-life counterparts.

The mechanics are a combination of both realistic and simplistic approaches. However, the way everything works together along with the environment gives a powerful illusion that makes it feel like a simulation.

The game is slow-paced, and has a major focus on communication and teamwork. You're punished when playing alone, therefore you must be part of a squad in-order to be a capable fighting force. It's in the name. You must also constantly communicate with said squad using voice chat, as information is crucial to success. I would NOT recommend this game towards people with no microphones or anxiety/shyness when it comes to voice chat. It's imperative that you play prepared for that.

Learning is simple if taken step-by-step. You start from learning the classes, mechanics and being part of a squad. Enough time and you also learn to be a Squad leader. I encourage you to ask the experienced in-game. Typically they're very helpful and friendly. There is no shame in learning and making mistakes.

Version 1.0 recently released as of this review, and it includes an awesome map and also my favorite faction of all time; the Middle-Eastern Alliance. It's a good time to pick up the game now if you're interested, though note the price increase since the game left Early Access.

Get a microphone; doesn't have to be expensive, just enough that you can be heard clearly. Do your time; Live, Die, Learn, Repeat. Become the ideal Squaddie, Maybe even be a regular squad leader later on. Eventually you'll get those moments that will keep you coming back for more. 

You'll have great games and bad games, that's the way it is, its the internet and the people who play it are ever changing, coming from many walks of life and circumstances. Soon enough you'll make some in game friends and see regulars to squad up with. Take the plunge and immerse yourself.

My specs are:
Ryzen 7 3700x
EVGA RTX 2070 Super
32gb RAM @ 3200MHz
1tb Samsung 970 EVO Plus M.2

So the first of the major bugs came when I tried to adjust the mouse sensitivity. It worked, but afterwards it wouldn't allow me to look up or down at all. I managed to find a fix but it required me to clear my user data cache. Meaning I had to change all of my audio/display/keybindings again.

The second major bug I encountered was my mic was not being picked up in game (blue yeti pro), all other games it works just fine, not with squad. Unlike the previous issue I couldn't find a fix for it so I would either need a different mic or not have the ability to use voip in a game that almost requires it.

The final bug, the one that broke the camels back, was after about 5-10 minutes in-game my frames would drop to about 5-10fps and wouldn't go back to normal until after I restarted the game.

So in closing, if I change my mouse settings I wouldn't be able to move properly while not doing callouts because my mic wasn't working only to drop to 5-10fps within the first 10 minutes of battle.

The game is very poorly optimized and at the $40 price point I had no choice but to refund, which is upsetting because the game at it's core was fantastic and extremely fun.

I left that review on a negative note, as well as leaving a negative review to match. The game hasn't really changed much since then.

They will only attract new people to the game, which is great, but its not the correct playerbase. There are lots of newer players that don't use their mic's, which obviously is part of the game in a very major way. But for how much longer?

While in Project Reality most of the communication took place through the in-game channels, it appears that here people are extensively using Discord (or no communication at all), so the public ""pick up"" squads are dead. 

There is so little communication from the squad leaders, once the squad gets split up after the initial 10 minutes, it does not regroup, with everyone just running around doing their own thing. 

The squad size of 9 is too big, even as experienced PR player, it takes away from the ability to communicate and coordinate. This is unmanageable, and it does not surprise me when I see such chaos on public servers in this game.
