9,Rome Total War,77083964,english,"Rome Total War is a very good game. The building mechanics of the game are enjoyable. I think its a lot of fun to watch your settlements grow from small villages to massive cities. Although, many of the buildings don't feel useful to me. Not because they weren't useful, but because I didn't feel their effects. The buildings that actually did feel like they give an effect were the walls, military buildings, the roads, and the governor's houses. The politics in the game are exclusive to the Roman factions. The political systems of the game are lackluster. It boils down to just getting more popular and than marching on Rome. The way you raise popularity is by conquering regions. The political system is mostly useless. The other part of the game, and probably the reason you would want it, is the fighting. And I will say, that doesn't disappoint either! Battles in the game are very fun. And watching your faction grow is very satisfying.

67,Rome Total War,76247115,english,"It was a great game (I have many, many more hours on the CD version which I bought at launch), and still would be if not for a couple of bugs with the way it interacts with steam.  You can play it just fine, the problem is when you quit out the launcher gets stuck running, and there is no way to exit out of it.  Even going into task manager and ending process will not resolve this, the launcher continues to run (There is no process related to the launcher in task manager).  Thus steam will report the game is running, which prevents you from: restarting the game, verifying files, uninstalling/reinstalling, or logging out of steam.  You can exit and restart steam but the game will still be running.  You can play other games (the launcher doesn't really seem to interfere with anything) but can't relaunch the game.  The only solution is to restart your pc.

The above doesn't trigger immediately so you may think you're in the clear after exiting the game (also if the game crashes, possibly because you alt-tabbed out, you will be able to restart the game), but this bug will trigger after a while and you may have no idea it's still running till hours or even a day later.",1600552889,1600552889,FALSE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,221,6,6690,0,6690,1600505961

They shouldn't be scrounging for pennies from new customers.  If anything just raise the price of the DLC's.

Great game, I'll give it a 10/10 overall because of pajama boys.  But seriously CA we need to talk about your financial problems.  Let's just say, ""I know a guy"" that could help you out.

There are a multitude of units that are specific to each faction, from the elephants of Carthage to the Praetorians of Rome. If you are looking for a start in the Total War franchise; THIS IS IT. 

Short campaigns or long campaigns, easy or legendary; there is no end to the amount of fun a person can have on this game. I have been playing this game since it came out in 2004 and can say that i still enjoy it today.

This game is a MUST for any steam library. I hope, that if you do purchase this game, that you enjoy it as much as I have.

15,Rome Total War,14756642,english,"[i]Rome: Total War[/i] is my favorite Total War game. It has the best campaign mechanics of the series, and one of the best modding communities. 

This game is the only Total War where you have to deal with problems such as culture, population, and distance from the capitol while expanding your empire. Buildings from different cultures give negative public order penalties that must be compensated for. Expansion means slowly integrating new cities by building and demolishing buildings. Recruiting units draws from a pool of manpower that is influenced by climate and buildings. On higher difficulties and huge unit sizes this means relying on a populous core to defend the fringes of an empire. Cities further from the capitol have higher corruption, and a public order penalty. This must be compensated for with administrative buildings, religion, and garrisons. All of these factors limit expansion in a realistic way that prevents steam rolling. They also promote playing the game in a more historically accurate way. 

[i]Rome: Total War[/i] lacks the detail and accuracy of [i]Medieval 2: Total War[/i], but that issue is resolved with mods. Mods such as Roma Surrectum II, and Europa Barbarorum correct issues like bronze age Egypt existing during the time of Rome and add an insane amount of detail to the game. They slow down combat, balance the game, and expand on the base games brilliant campaign mechanics. Europa Barbarorum adds a provincial system that represents citizenship, integration, and the effects of slavery, and wealth inequality on the Roman Republic.

3,Rome Total War,70924127,english,"The Rome: Total War Collection includes the base game of Rome: Total War, and its two expansion packs; Barbarian Invasion and Alexander. 

Rome: Total War was the first 3-D game of the now incredibly popular and critically acclaimed grand strategy series, Total War. As the first 3-D game in the series, it set precedents. Ones that are still felt in the series today. Many claim that this is one of, if not the best in the series, and it isn't hard to see why. The main selling point of Total War has always been its unique combination of turn based empire manager, and real time battles. This core game play is nicely exemplified by Rome. It may be a bit clunky and poorly optimized, but a little help from the steam forums, and a few hours of practice, will make you an expert at it. Controlling units of an army, utilizing real strategy and tactics, such as the importance of the High Ground, calvary charges, and phalanx formations, are all impactful and fun features. Sieges are a personal favorite of mine. The empire management is pretty solid, even considering its age. The juggling of culture, public order, and public health in your cities adds a challenge that isn't too difficult. Still, its not as flushed out as the combat, where he position of the enemy's shields affect your arrow effectiveness, for example. All in all, Rome: Total War is a great start for people who want to get into the series, and is a very solid and deeply enjoyable experience that'll hold your attention for hours on end (provided you can get it to run).

Now on to the Expansion Packs

Rome: Total War - Barbarian Invasion may be one of, if not the, greatest Total War expansions/DLC. It provides an entirely different campaign and experience to the base game. It adds in features that are still in Total War games, such as religion or hordes. It is a noticeable difficulty spike/challenge compared to the base game as well. Play as either one of the two halves of the Roman Empire during its (well, the West's at least) Twilight years, or as one of the Barbarian factions. Essentially, Barbarian Invasion is a fantastic addition to the series, and could be counted as its own game, seeing how good it is.

Finally, Rome: Total War - Alexander, is the weaker of the two expansions. I know, ending the review on a high note, aren't I. I hold no real ill will towards Rome - Alexander, it is just that its uninteresting compared to BI. No real new features or mechanics are added. Its just Rome: Total War, but instead you play as Alexander the Great's Macedonia, and have to conquer all that he did in the allotted time. Perfectly serviceable on its own, but compared to BI, bland.

In conclusion, Rome: Total War is a great game that you should consider picking up if you are into empire management and/or RTS games.",1592383952,1592383952,TRUE,6,0,0.587577224,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,113,65,8176,0,6475,1600376758

51,Rome Total War,64485050,english,"In my ongoing and likely futile effort to write a Steam review for every game in my library (#238 out of 558)... it's time for Rome Total War.

Rome has long been lauded as the premier entry in the venerable Total War series. Personally I don't quite agree with that assessment, but when it comes to ancient era warfare, I have zero qualms about declaring Rome: Total War to represent the best Creative Assembly has yet managed to produce.

Which is another way of saying that the long-anticipated sequel, Rome 2: Total War, is absolute garbage. But I digress.

Rome Total War represents the best RTS take on the ancient world, but be aware that this game has not aged particularly well. When it comes to the factions, Rome is a mess--almost entirely ahistorical. It often feels as though the campaign was crafted by someone who had never so much as read an encyclopedia entry on the Roman Empire, and is utterly nonsensical: the vast and dynamic empire of yore is instead depicted as a loose alliance of three, largely autonomous noble houses, constantly vying for supremacy. Don't think about it too much: it's rubbish. Thankfully there are a great many excellent mods that correct this... bizarre creative interpretation, and I strongly advise that you ignore the vanilla game altogether, and only ever deal with the mods. Personally I would recommend the Europa Barbarorum mod.

Beyond that, several aspects of the game feel a bit clumsy by modern standards: diplomacy is largely an afterthought, unit balance is all over the place, camera controls are unnecessarily clumsy, etc., etc. But even so, Rome Total War manages to provide an epic spectacle -- all the more impressive for the fact that it can render enormous battles, comprising tens of thousands of soldiers, on even the most modest of today's hardware. If you're looking for an excellent historical RTS, or are fond of the Roman era in general, Rome: Total War should most definitely be your first stop.

You have to act very carefully, You can even go into the actual battle and control your troops if you really wanted to but there are things wrong with this game as well. 

1. The Romans are responsible for the killing of christians.

2. They crucified Jesus on the cross. (Because of what we did to Jesus through our Sin)

3. They were cold blooded killers that showed no mercy to their enemies.

4. Sent people into the arena to be slain for sport and entertainment, mostly christians!

There is more that I can point out but overall the game is really good, just don't like that they serve false gods. But I can recommend this game, just blot out or your ears all of the dodgy stuff if you buy and play this game. The best part about this game that there are console commands to make factions christian, otherwise just remove the shrines and replace it with christian ones. Most Roman (eastern empire) citizens/leaders ect are christian but some are pagan, you can choose to make every city and every leader christian, just look up my thread ""Christianity Factions?"" This will show all suitable traits for Christians. As much as I didn't like the Romans, I love that this game also supports Christianity so thumbs up from me. One last thing, DO NOT BUY Rome Total War 2, too expensive as well as an extremely dodgy story plot. There's also a blood and gore DLC in the second one!? Violence that is overpowering in gaming dulls the conscience not being able to know what is right and what is wrong. Don't get the second one, waste of money.

Campaign map feels large, but not to the point where your grinding to conquer everything fast enough. Just make sure you betray the Senate and seize power before the other factions get to large! I made that mistake and had to reconquer all of the Balkans, Anatolia, and Crimea. Not a good time.
Only thing I disliked about the game was the ""Squalor"" town modifier. Super stupid and annoying, and was just utterly bothersome to deal with. It'd decrease by towns happiness slowly, and never stop. Only way to deal with it was to recruit a bunch of peasant units in the town, walk them out to the middle of nowhere, and disband them. Was that what the developers intended? I have no clue but it was pretty unprofessional. Regardless, no other issues, and its a great game.

it runs terrible on some modern laptops.

In my case, the GPU I have is nvdia geforce 940mx, I get a higher FPS from Medieval 2 than in Rome.

If you experience lag especially in the campaign map you'll have to download a dll file in order to remove the lag, you can download it from here: https://steamcommunity.com/app/4760/discussions/0/412448792372318074/

The downside in using the dll file is that it'll visually remove fire effects from arrows, artillery projectiles will be invisible, the shadows will also look very pixelated.

The game crashes when I finish large battles but this was resolved once I fixed the resolutions of both the battle map and the campaign map to be the same.

After 5 hours of searching, trying and discussions, combined with plenty of tools download and experiments with windows I found out: Problem is caused by Microsoft update. OK but Steam is selling the produict as functional game whitch simply does not run. 
Cheap option is to create own preference text folder, copy and paste solution from official TW sites (https://forums.totalwar.com/discussion/160589/issues-when-trying-to-launch-rome-total-war-on-windows-10-workaround-provided) whitch makes your game run but in my case, on monitor with resolution over 2560x1440 / 160 HZ tis can be run only in window (with parameter ""-ne"" in steam launch parameter option, whitch causes to duplicate the mouse cursor on desktop so instead of acting with generals and unists you alltime finght with your screen desktop icons of other games and programms. On steam forums you can read that this problem persists over 4 years and they did not do a crap about it - making a simple script solving this, saving you sweat, panic and anger, should take few hours max.

54,Rome Total War,68863389,english,"I've been playing this game since it released and it still hasn't lost its luster!

Pros:
Rewarding campaigns
Very fun combat
Good Variety of units for most factions
VERY replayable
Auto-manage settlements makes managing taxes/buildings/armies a breeze
Basic game options allow for more realism or less realism in battle to help curate your experience

Cons:
AI can be stupid sometimes - both in campaign map and on the battlefield (just be careful of the quirks and you should be fine)
Campaigns tend to slow down after the first big expansion you accomplish since it can be difficult to get troops to the edges of your empire without ships or roads
Settlements can be tedious to manage (if you decide not to automanage)
Settlements are hard to control once the population is too big (expect revolts that you won't be able to avoid in the late game)

Conclusion:
A classic game worth a buy! I come back to this game regularly. What Creative Assembly was able to accomplish was way ahead of their time and in my opinion it beats Rome 2 Total War",1589052022,1589052022,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,51,2,8418,0,8042,1595727581

Early game does a good job of explaining most of the basic mechanics and offers enough of a challenge without feeling unfair, evolving into a more complex and larger game as it progresses. Game-play consists of making turns on a board, the player and AI developing cities, building troops, sending spies and diplomats to neighboring cities, and initiating battles as they attempt to grasp control of the area, then those battles being played out (or auto-resolved if you choose) on a battlefield. This is where the game truly shines as you control hundreds of troops, either fighting in an open space, attacking a stronghold, or defending your own. The scale of battle here is awesome and evolving strategies as plans succeed and fail keep them tense from start to finish. Graphically, the game is starting to show it's age, but with everything maxed out easily on modern computers, the immersion and fun-factor isn't effected. Soundtrack is top notch. Only downside I've found in my time playing is that there is a lack of direct explanations for certain elements to the UI and the developing of cities. Overall, this is a must play for strategy fans interested in the series.

There is no other Total War game I have ever played that made me feel I was commanding actual people. When I flank the enemy line and slam them with my cavalry, I can see the impact they make, and some people flying in the air. There's several different cultures. There's barbarians, carthaginians, egyptians, greeks, nomads, and romans. Each offers different gameplay, and you generally need to play differently and compensate for the different cultures. What really sets this game above the others is the modding community. Byfar my favorite mod is Europa Barbarorum, it is a historical and realistic overhaul. There's numerous other mods available; I've seen even seen a Starwars overhaul mod. The mod community is still alive, comparable to the Skyrim modding community. I've put about 2,000 hours into this game including steam, and I don't regret any of it. This game is extremely hard to put down. In my opinion is is the best Total War game ever made.

diplomats early and assassins throughout, diplomats can get all the trading rights you need early.
assassins are simply some aspect of the game that needs to be utilized, kill enough generals and you get master of assassins (its an awesome title that's enough) gives you bonus.
Generals hanging around in cities with libraries academies and universities gain all kinds of entourage members, mathematicians, doctors, artisans, traders (bonus to trade), legendary warriors (lowers recruiting charges) etc.
Fine game.  Every other game gets compared and the only ones close are panzer general and Shogun (shogun is awesome but Rome sorted out all the choppiness of battle and other movements)

42,Rome Total War,65785419,english,"Steam says I've played this game for 72 hours. Steam Lies. 
I've owned Rome Total War since the game first came out about 16 years ago. It's one of my favorite of the entire Total War series. 
I haven't played Rome 2 yet, but frankly ever since Empire Total War the franchise seemed to go downhill. Too much paid for DLC to unlock factions and not allowing players to take control. I doubt I'll ever purchase Rome 2 unless it goes for sale for under $10. 

But this isn't about Rome 2, this is about the original Rome Total War. It's in depth strategy, balancing the whims of The People and The Senate, or about taking a tribe of so-called Barbarians to glory in beating down the gates of so-called civilized people. 
The graphics look like it takes 256 mb of RAM, which back in 2004 meant I had to upgrade my computer to run this game. But this game wasn't about the incredible graphics, (which for the time looked fantastic), but it's for the strategy and tactics. Plus being a bit of a history nerd, I enjoyed the historical notes of the units and other tidbits of history. 

Perhaps it is nostalgia, perhaps it is that I started playing Total War franchise in 2000 when the original Shogun TW came out, and I've owned and played most of the TW titles, usually buying them as soon as they were released (before I got older and realized if I just waited a couple months I'd save a lot of money).

Where do I start? I've been playing this game on and off for as long as I can remenber, and all of my memories on this game have been truly fantastic and some of the greatest gaming memories that I have!  Rome total war is one of those games where you cant help but keep coming back too, maybe it is the mesmerising soundtrack, or perhaps the highly addictive week long campaigns; perhaps its the strategic element that it is drilled into the game, or perhaps. Perhaps its a mixture of everything...

[h1] Campaign [/h1]

The greatest thing in Rome 1 is by far the campaigns, you are plunged into a land of bloody conflict, a land of political intrigue, a land of inter-house dilemas, a land of ploys and plots, a land of *total war*
What is amaazing about this games campaign is the fact that the world is quite literraly your oyster, you can choose to invade anywhere at any time, kill anyone at any place, and wage war on any country for any personal reason. Many a times I have watched my empires form and my empires fall, there is no better feeling than slaughtering a rival faction that has wronged you in the past, or perhaps the feeling of re-conquering what was once your soverign territory, this game has mixed emotions. You actually feel a pang of sadness as you have created an empire through bloody strife and conflict as you remenber the hundreds of thousands of soldiers who died and laid down their lives for you to establish your empire. Or perhaps you wont feel this, maybe you wont have a huge militaristic empire, perhaps you will have a small but economically powerful kingdom filled with merchants and trades, or maybe you just want one or two small kingdoms and you just want to survive, after all. Total war is not for everyone...

[h1] BATTLES [/h1]

The maps in rome 1 are huge and give the player a great empty canvas of strategy at their disposal. The battles feel unique, and they feel like battles, you know that if you loose a certain battle then it will result in a crippling blow for your empire, perhaps your capital is under seige and if you loose then your faction leader dies thus morale is diminished to a minute fraction. Or perhaps you have sent out an expeditionary force to some far off land and have established a small but secure foothold which is under attack from a near unknown force. Each battle has a meaning, and each battle has its own ending. Perhaps your heroic soldiers will become 'men of the hour' birthing new heroes and generals for your faction. No units are over powered everything can counter something, so this game is balanced...

[h1] CONCLUSION [/h1]

This game truly is a master-peice of a game and i would recommend it to anyone who likes mass exterminating the populus. But unfortunatly it does not run on some pc's on windows 10, and the graphics are outdated and the frames are unfortunatly capped at what seems to be 30fps. If not for theise glithces/ graphical limitations then his game would be a solid 10/10. But unfortunatly I have to drop the final score down to a 9.5/10!",1491765739,1584564569,TRUE,1,0,0.523809552,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,102,37,6709,0,4928,1572990375

36,Rome Total War,33825797,english,"I absolutely love this game.
If it wasn't for Medieval 2 Total war, this would be my favorite Total War game ever. 

The graphics overall has a certain pop and saturation to it that makes it look really nice and vibrant, not only that but the game focuses more on an artstyle than realism, although I bet it looked realistic at the time. Theres so many mods that improve the game of sorts by making it historically accurate, and makes the units look more historically correct. But, theres a balance that games have to strike between realism and appearance with unit graphics, or realism and mechanics with gameplay. Nothing against the realistic mods, its good that they are there, because they are amazing in their own right. But, whenever I play a mod and look at the troops, i cant really get attached to them like I can in the original game. Again, nothing against the mods for that, its just that this game has such an iconic look that is only there through time. 
The graphics for this game is like a fine, old, red wine.

The gameplay, although having its flaws with pathing and AI at times, is still something that is really fun to play with. Maybe I would be more critical on the AI if it wasnt for the fact that they haven't really improved in almost two decades. Medieval 2 total war made good improvements, but afterwards things went downhill more than uphill. Its sad that this AI is representative for the time that this game came out. Because I can only imagine how perfect this AI could be if just given todays technology, and maybe more time to develop it. 
Outside of the AI, the fact that this is one of the only strategy games that has turn based civ managment and real time army strategy in one. I dont think theres anything like that other than Total War. Theres been a few games that has tried to do what this game has done for its series. But it never really got that click unlike what this game had. 

Although The Roman campaign is really the only super interesting campaign in the game, all the other factions, even the unplayable ones, are pretty fun to play as, just for the unit and building variety. Though, I wished there was more to them. Luckily mods are there for the rescue. Even though you could see that and be like ""wow only one kind of unique campaign? Terrible game"" you have to realize that this hasn't really changed afterwards. Some of the games afterwards has even had no unique campaigns in them. This doesn't really excuse Rome for just only the Roman campaign, I know, but like I said before, the other campaigns are still ones that are kind of fun to play as just for some variety.

The music in this game is absolutely phenomenal. To me this soundtrack beats out any other games soundtrack in this series of games. Theres some real pounding bangers that gets you hyped in battle, and theres some that are just genuinely really nice to listen to. I dont know the names of the songs, never really looked into them. But you know what song comes on when it plays. And the songs pull just the right emotions for the right moments. If you first hear that defeat music, it strikes you a bit. It hits ya different so to say. And for me at least, it invokes me to avenge my fallen bretheren.

Sadly this game seems to crash a few times and some people can have difficulties to start the game. But that happens with every aged game sadly.

I have went through a whole novel and I havent even went through all the parts in this game.

The game's lack of support has left the game in a state where its a real guess if your going to be able get up and running or not.

I have yet to try so many things because of how big this game is, and the instant-combats allow for really fast engagement that make you feel like a real army.

As a top-down game, where you don't control the individual characters, it can be frustrating at times watching your AI, and a few small bugs do not help.  Regardless, I have tried to get my friends to play me in this game because it is so good.  I might say do not buy this game unless you have time for the long run.  Even a preset instant-combat can take 30 minutes or more, and I have had many hour+ invasions...  There are AI auto-manage systems, though, so you definitely do not have to sit for hours.   I also recommend having a decent CPU/GPU because having thousands of units on screen is tough on your machine.  A poor CPU/GPU will run, but with low resolution and polygon count.",1581398030,1581398030,TRUE,2,1,0.536423862,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,67,4,8666,0,7860,1597383163

63,Rome Total War,63140621,english,"[h1]Grandiose & Stimulating / Recommended for all RTS & 4X Fans[/h1]

+ One of the more accessible entries in the Total War franchise
+ A good umber of historical factions to unlock
+ UI is intuitive & easy to acclimate to
+ Like other entries in the series, the game does an incredible job of blending both the necessity of city management & the thrill of real-time, tactical combat
+ Focuses on large-scale strategy & smaller-scale tactics in equal measure
+ Public order is a welcome mechanics that can keep an ambitious player in check
+ Household management adds a social layer to an already deliciously complex strategy game (perhaps not by the standards of the modern entries, but still very complex & gratifying, nonetheless)
+ Different units have their own, sensible, strengths & weaknesses
+ Scale of battles absolutely cannot be overstated
+ Factions enjoy many differences between them, making each playthrough feel fresh & unique to an extent
+ Runs beautifully on modern hardware with no real compatibility issues

- Dated visuals; although they were quite good at the time of release, they don't hold up quite as well to a modern audience
- Some of the Senate missions are borderline impossible to complete (if one is a sensible player)
- Enemy AI is often laughably at best
- Naval combat is automated only

I try to mix things up and try to create an empire using only a limited suite of units or use a power with disadvantages (Britain, Egypt etc have commanders in chariots which seem get the general killed at the first opportunity so avoid them).

The year is 329 BC. Italy. Warring city-states vie for power and superiority over their neighbours. The Senate and People of Rome control The Latin states…but enemies surround them. The Republic stands at a crossroads in history… 

Bombasticus Maximus: Romans!  Senators!  Friends!  Latium is firmly under the rule of the Senate and People of Rome! The Latin people are now one! Not since noble Brutus drove out the last King, have we known such a glorious day. But now, my friends, in this hour of glory, we must be on our guard. To the south, treacherous Greeks and Samnites block our trade!Tarquinii groans beneath the tyrant’s heel!  That tyrant threatens Rome! Will we abandon Tarquinii? And now barbarians raid from the north. Burning and pillaging roman lands! Shall we let danger fester and grow? Or will we act as Romans? With courage and dignity. Remember. We are the Sons of Mars! As senate leader I call upon Tribunes Gaius Julius and Decius Brutus to smash the Gauls and relieve Tarquinii. All those in favour say I.

Senators: AVE! AVE! AVE! (...) Infamy! Shame! (...) No! NO! NO!(...) WAR! WAR! WAR! WAR! “I!” (Followed by cheering)

☐ Decent
☐ Bad
☐ Don‘t look too long at it

☐ Very good
☑ Good
☐ It‘s just gameplay

☐ Eargasm
☐ Very good
☑ Good
☐ Not too bad
☐ Bad
☐ Earrape

---{PC Requirements}--- : It is an old game (late 2000) so a decent should be able to run it at its best. Be sure to max our resolution and draw distance to enjoy the game at its best!

☐ Check if you can run paint
☐ Potato
☑ Decent
☐ Fast 
☐ Rich boiiiiii

☐ Just press ‚A‘
☐ Easy
☐ Significant brain usage

☐ Isn't necessary to progress
☑  Average grind level
☐ Too much grind

☑ Average
☐ Good
☐ Lovely
☐ It‘ll replace your life

☐ Long enough for a cup of coffee
☐ Short
☑ Average
☐ Long
☐ To infinity and beyond

---{Price}--- : Worth the price. Still has some things missing but a decent game nonetheless. A classic of the Total War saga. Do not forget to get Barbarian Expansion (Alexander Expansion is a bonus, not a must have)

☐ It’s free!
☑ Worth the price
☐ If u have some spare money left
☐ Not recommended
☐ You could also just burn your money

---{Bugs}--- : A couple of minor glitches, very few bugs to speak of. 

☐ Never heard of
☑ Minor bugs
☐ Can get annoying
☐ ARK: Survival Evolved
☐ The game itself is a big terrarium for bugs

---{Overall}--- : A classic, epic turn based strategy game. For management fans, getting your cities straightened out, keeping expenses on track and avoiding rebellions will keep you busy. Strategy fans will adore the battles with over 1000 soldiers on both sides clashing. Historians will like the roman names that are all over the map. This game will test any strategy players’ limits. 9/10

☑ Competes with the classics
☐ Impressive but has something missing
☐ Fun to play, easy to forget
☐ Playable because you are bored
☐ A decapitation or ♥♥♥♥ is more fun

14,Rome Total War,61406277,english,"This game is not only a nostalgic game, but also one that stands the test of time. Once people look past the graphics, they will find and innovative, unique, complex, immersive, and entertaining game underneath. The battles and balancing are incredible (minus the hoplites which are overpowered as hell), and because of the game's age, anybody on any relatively modern device can run the game at the highest graphical rate. The game was massively innovative for being able to support so many three- dimensional models at the same time, as well as particles, arrows, effects, etc. Coming with this new ability came the chance for strategy in a video game never seen before or since outside of the total war franchise. This game is unique in its mix of gameplay and setting. There are not a large amount of games that take place in the Roman time period (which is a shame in it of itself), and very few which have the strategy and immersion of this game. Another charm of the game is how amazingly accessible, yet complex the game is. There are many intricacies to both combat and the campaign map, but these intricacies are easy and fun to learn over time, making winning a campaign extremely satisfying as you felt you progressed. Also, despite the aging graphics, the game is stupendously immersive, unlike any game I have ever seen before on any platform maybe discounting Skyrim. Overall, Rome Total War is an excellent video game accessible to almost anyone in this day and age, and it goes to show that crafting a beautiful game like this can cause the game to transcend time and limitations of graphical quality. If you enjoy any strategy games, love the Roman time period, are looking to get into the Total war franchise, or are just looking for a really cheap game to pass time on, then Rome Total War is the perfect game for you. Please don hesitate buying it, the game is criminally underpriced for its sheer quality, even if the pricing system is pretty much based exclusively on age of the game.

Take on the mantle of the leadership of nineteen factions from across the Roman world, from the titular legions of Italy, to the fearsome woad-painted warriors of Britain and Germany, to the horse archers of the Parthian and Armenian empires. 

Pros:
+ Excellent variety of units, giving each faction a unique flavour and playstyle.
+ Great real-time battles (albeit lacking some of the later quality of life features).
+ Strategic campaign with a far superior Senate vs. People conflict than the second game.

Cons:
- Slightly outdated graphics (still impressive nonetheless but for those used to the modern titles it may be a bit of a shock).
- Diplomacy (as with all Total War games) is quite bugged with overly aggressive opponents and seemingly random decisions made by AI.",1578240317,1578240317,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,91,14,7423,0,7123,1599092520

93,Rome Total War,60490107,english,"I played this game on release and I have to say, it really does hold up well. 

In its day it was groundbreaking and really pushed the genre into the new era, now it provides a nice little niche away from the glamour of more modern TW titles. There are little things you will notice in the game that have not survived into the newer titles, things that really have no excuse to be left out as CA has gotten lazier and lazier in 'streamlining' the development of their games. 

You will be able to have unique individuals who accrue detailed traits as you rack up wins, losses or even just leave them to govern. I haven't played some of the most recent titles but this had the best character development out of the ones I've played. 

The campaign map is the classic TW version (arguably the best city building aspect before cities became small towns with intense building regulation requirements) but does suffer from a frustrating unit recruitment process if you're only used to multi-unit recruitment of later titles.

To unlock factions you must defeat them in the main campaign. I like this feature as you have to start as Rome, the easiest faction to play, so you essentially had a working tutorial that you could springboard off into other factions as you cleaved your way through them.  Somewhat redundant now though and if you can't wait to play your favorite faction you can simply edit some of the text files to unlock even some of the unplayable campaign factions. As a side note, the little tutorial battle they have you play was actually pretty fun in that it was modular; having a skirmish before the main battle which you don't really get elsewhere. 

The graphics are pretty but basic (to be expected). 

The AI isn't half bad for its age (and better than some of the later titles).  

It marks the start of CA's Golden Age and is hands down my favorite title. If you like ancient warfare, pick up this Rome Total War, not Rome II. 

My only criticism of this game is somewhat halfhearted; that is that there are a lot of historical inaccuracies (when I say a lot, I mean some factions are displaced by hundreds years) however that does not detract at all from the brilliant, if simple,  gameplay. If you do want historical accuracy, I cannot recommend Europa Barbarorum enough, it's an overhaul mod that introduces brand new factions, expands the map East and Southward and completely redoes all the existing factions to be historically accurate, all the while giving you reams of information about historical events, items and people with original voice overs, artwork and historical music...

Got this game this year, and it's my favourite in the series, so don't think you can't enjoy this game unless you're a Total War connoisseur, because I'm definitely not.

That said, this freedom also makes the game somewhat easy to cheese. You can play honourably, or cheese till your heart's content, but trust me when I say that everything tastes better with cheese.

Oh, and before I leave, some cautionary advice: Beware the Dacians. They are completely, utterly, incorrigibly insane. They will hurl themselves like rabid dogs at the walls of Aquincum until the settlement is either theirs, or until every last Dacian man, woman, and child lies dead and bloody at the feet of your shell-shocked and mortified legionaries.

13,Rome Total War,57519985,english,"Before getting a digital copy I wore out three CDs of Rome Total War.  I had read about the game engine due to it's cross-over utility for the the new specialty history channels.  ( Before they removed all history basically ...  this was a need )  but in the way back when it's not like you expected a game to dazzle.  I had  Civilization for that.   The previous game which seemed unbeatable.  

The main thing, possibly the only thing I dislike is that in the early game  you really need your family members, don't have enough and several of the already born male children will eventually develop hooting.  One of them even kept under firm control and given every opportunity to balance that eventually winds up so depraved there is no safe place for him.   Yet like a lot of  RTW players I feel attached to the only characters you can truly know.  Eventually you can park  your family members in academies and they pick up enough positives that however depraved it's safe enough to use them.  The game guide kind of recommends killing them off which could be why I work so hard not to. 

The family makes for a nice thread through the many games you play. Oh weird the 'first father"" is on a longevity streak.  Hmm sucks you moved all his cards to some young and sort of sucktastic upstart ...  Wow Portia had a baby at 62 .    You know which are programmed to have those traits which  you will be driven to rehabilitate.  The game hints making an extreme argument for the opposite. 

I like that despite playing way more hours than Steam suspects due to offline ...  that battles can still sometimes serve up something new.    The map is big enough the  possibilities vast enough that if I can see and move a mouse I will still be playing when I am 120 or so.   

I've played the older Total War Titles and a few of the ones that came after.  The rest seemed a departure from the series golden premise - Rome Total War is by far the best.  

I like a lot of games.  I'm always willing to try a game but if some odd deity said I could only play one game for the rest of my life this would be the game. 

As time has passed that no game has  passed it even if some have been temporary obsessions has made me wonder about my taste but I've spent enough time worrying about that so now I think it speaks to the game having every thing a great game has. 

Newer shinier games will have better graphics.  The units not just desynchronized but actually different but those are trivial things compared to the core premise and the game engine. 

Go ahead and play it.  It's so old it should be practically free .  You might want to clear your schedule . Stock up on grapes and wine and perhaps buy new sheets as toga's are hard to come by.  Go all in for the best game to be made so far.   That's such an extreme endorsement I expect flak and it's not like I don't hope a game that unseats Rome Total War will one day be developed .  

I have my doubts but it  could happen. 

The good news for people who have never played is as an ancient game it's practically free so give it a try.    If you miss the razzle dazzle that push your gaming rig to fire up all fans you can go back to games which may be more stunning  graphically and audio and have a familiar chaos to them but when you want to rest in solid game design you will be back.

Medieval 2: TW was also amazing. Empire, Napoleon were very playable. Unfortunately, Rome 2, even though it improved the series in many ways was very confusing to me.

Rome is an addictive and engaging experience combining light grand strategy and unmatched real time strategy on the battlefield. For me, this is the best kind of strategy game. One that has you looking not at stats and hexagonal spaces, but at units of soldiers and at the terrain. When playing, you rarely if ever think of numbers. You're far too invested in commanding your army and outfoxing the enemy for that. The enemy AI is serviceable but at times (particularly as the defender in sieges) it can be downright idiotic, and all turning up the difficulty does is make the enemy morale higher. The AI shows it's age. That doesn't detract much from the experience for me, though, because the campaigns and the thrill of battle are as compelling now as they were then. The Steam version comes with the Alexander and Barbarian Invasion expansions. I haven't played the former but the latter is excellent, set in the downfall of the Roman empire and giving you countless new factions and units and having far more historical detail than the main game.",1572789802,1572789802,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,95,2,1820,0,238,1599510561

12,Rome Total War,55868645,english,"One of my favorite games of all time. While it lacks the graphical look with the title being published in 2004 this game is simply the pinnacle of Total War games. It not only gives you that feeling of being a commander on the field but it also encourages the player to look up period the game is based on. 

This version has two separate games included which are Alexander and Barbarian Invasion they are supplemental and extensive to the base game adding even more bang for your buck.

Besides this game especially struck the right chords when it came to the battlefield. When I was just a kid my pop and I would be setting up an army on either side to knock down and pivot one another with toy cannons as our viably weapons. I love reliving those moments of my childhood as I make my soldiers the best that they can be. 

My advice is to have Germanic Berserkers on the Jordan River and stack the enemy units by ten fold and turn on the rage ability. Have fun. This is a classic that remains to grab my attention for many years. If you don't like the old look then please play Rome 2 both of these games are amazing at their own right, however, Rome 2 does limit army mobility in a slightly annoying fashion.

22,Rome Total War,55687091,english,"A little frustrated that my pc was not up to par to be able to play Rome II with high graphics (the game looks pretty terrible on low settings), I ended up getting Rome I during a sale and initially, I was reluctant to play it, thinking the graphics were worse than Medieval II and therefore only the gameplay would be similarly engaging. Boy was I wrong. For 2004, these were some really ground breaking graphics, especially being able to make thousands of units clash. While the city graphics are pretty basic and minecraft-ish (the white blocks of classical antiquity buildings look pretty low-poly), the environment graphics aren’t so bad (distant mountain ranges, the sea etc. look fine), and the unit graphics are actually pretty good, especially for the roman units where you can see intricate designs on their shields, chainmail, the bands of the lorica segmentata, helmet crests and so on. 

But before I begin, please note that this game runs best on DirectX 8 and therefore has problems running smoothly on Windows 10 (and DirectX 9, 10, 11 etc.) and therefore requires you to download and move a d3d8.dll file into your steamapps/common/rome folder so that you get a good framerate. This, however, renders flaming arrows and catapult projectiles invisible, and while there is an alternate solution out there that involves you installing some other third party program, I cannot find that thread anymore, all I remember is it saying that while it did not render those projectiles invisible, the framerate improvement was not as high as with the d3d8.dll fix which is why I stuck to this one. 

Ideally, you want to play this game at normal battle difficulty (subsequent total wars gave AI units only morale bonuses at higher difficulties, but in rome they get combat bonuses too to the point where your hastati end up fleeing from peasants on very hard, so stick to normal) and unit scale LARGE (80 men per unit) as this is the most historically accurate scale for roman cohorts at the time. One interesting game mechanic in ROME is that training units drains population from cities. Therefore, playing on HUGE unit scale (160 men per unit) would massively deplete cities and cripple population growth both for you and for the AI, making settlement development almost impossible. Play on too small a unit scale and you can do virtually nothing to stop city growth which can become a real problem during late game due to squalor and unrest.  

The aforementioned game mechanic also allows you to train peasants and send these to other provinces and disband them there to speed up population growth, which is needed to unlock more buildings for your cities.

Unlike Medieval II, provinces aren’t divided into two settlement types: cities and castles. Instead, it’s the same development tree for every province, but boy are there lots of different buildings to build. Even after investing 150 hours into this game, I can guarantee you that there still will be some buildings left to build even in your most populated settlement. Buildings are divided into several types: farming, sanitation, temple, market, docks (if there’s a coast), and three types of military buildings: barracks for infantry, ranges for archers and siege weapons, and stables for cavalry.

Rome Total War came out as early as 2004 and yet revolutionized the RTS genre with bouts of realism. For example, your geographical position on the campaign map will reflect how your battle map will look like, and from which direction you and your foe(s) will be deploying. Fighting a battle on Rhodos will not only see you next to a coastline (with a fleet of ships in the distance if there is a fleet near your position on the campaign map) but you will also be fighting in front of a backdrop featuring the Colossus of Rhodos.

This brings us to another interesting feature exclusive to Rome: Total war – the seven wonders of the world. Not only are they featured on the campaign map (and have models on the battle map) but they give unique bonuses to your faction if you capture the province they are in. Some yield powerful bonuses while others are only helpful in their immediate surroundings. The Pyramids at Giza help quell unrest in Egyptian provinces. The Lighthouse of Alexandria increases movement distance and survival of ships along the Egyptian coast. The hanging Gardens of Babylon increase your faming output, the Temple of Artemis at Ephesus reduces religious building costs, The Mausoleum of Halicarnassus reduces building time for high tier buildings, the Colossus of Rhodes increases sea trade revenue and so on.

What is unfortunate however, is that the game initially only allows you to play as one of three Roman factions and unlocks other factions only upon you defeating them. But to keep things interesting, instead of you playing as a single Roman faction, in Rome Total War you instead play as one of three different houses: the Julii (red), the Brutii (green) or the Scipii (blue). In addition to this, there is SPQR – the Roman Senate (purple) which controls the city of Rome and is allied to all three houses just like you are allied to the others. The Scipii are programmed to conquer Sicily and expand towards the north African coast while the Brutii fight in Greece and then eventually expand toward the north east. Your faction enjoys a certain level of standing with the senate and with the people. The more provinces you conquer, the more the common folk (plebeians) begin to shout your name from the rooftops. Meanwhile, fulfilling senate missions (even if this means declaring war on factions neutral to you) increases your standing with the senate and should this drop too low (by not doing what they ask you to), your faction leader will be forced to fall upon his sword and refusing that as well will set off the Roman civil war – the senate and the other two factions will consider you a traitor and declare war on you, but you cannot take Rome until you have a high enough standing with the people. So it is best to do what the senate says until mid to late game and from there on out – alea iacta est – march on Rome. The Roman Civil war is interesting in that Roman armies are the best equipped in the game, so they will put up a bigger fight compared to other factions. That being said, the others aren’t pushovers either, despite Rome being destined to rule: Greek phalanxes, Egyptian chariots, Parthian cataphracts, and Carthaginian elephants can ruin your day if you do not have the proper counters! And regarding Rome’s armies, the Hastati-Principes-Triarii line initially make up the infantry supported by Archers and Equites (cavalry) all the way until the Marian reforms (which trigger when you build your first Imperial Palace on the Italian Peninsula) from where on out you can start wielding professional legionaries that can form the testudo formation and are the best infantry in the game.

Until the Barbarian Invasion expansion night battles are not introduced and religion is only present in the form of temples conveying different bonuses – it is important to tear down temples and build your own ones because temples not compatible with your own culture cannot be improved when the conquered city grows to the next tier. And building the highest level temples in each city is paramount to keeping unrest at bay. Each faction has access to three different gods, each giving certain bonuses like improved harvests or better law (reducing corruption) or quirky retainers. Assassins and spies do not have action cinematics like in Medieval II but are still very straightforward to use and easy to train. Due to the high levels of gold income in Rome Total War, diplomats are some of the most powerful agents in this game, easily able to bribe enemy armies and even bring entire provinces under your control, as long as they are not heavily garrisoned or governed by enemy family members.

The modding community had a field day on this game, and there are countless great addons. The Multiplayer is very solid, although one wishes for a bit more variety when it comes to the siege battles, as all of the Roman and Greek cities are perfectly square, one layered, and linear attacks are the only possible mode of attack. IE the streets are the only available areas where troops can move inside the city, and there is only one surrounding wall, meaning that the defense is extremely one-dimensional. These cons could also be taken as pros, because as i said before, it is a fantastic starter game precisely because it is so linear and simple, yet the tactical route is definitely still a viable option.

81,Rome Total War,54649369,english,"A fun game, and one which has character and soul, something later total wars don't really have. 

My one criticism is a problem which has always existed in total war games and that is the AI campaign mechanics.  In order to make the game 'artificially' more difficult the AI receive all kinds of cheats and buffs, so for example they are completely unaffected by money. 
For example, you can blockade a faction's ports to block trade income, sabotage a town's infrastructure so it hardly makes any money or you can take all but one of their settlements, and although you can see that they have no money on the faction information scroll, they can still muster armies of 20 or so units.

This means that the only way of taking provinces and defeating factions is by defeating them in battle. You cannot starve them into submission or drain all their money until they submit, because they can ALWAYS respawn huge armies due to the AI buffs / cheats. You can therefore not play a small but tall empire as you can in CK2 for example.

It's a lazy way of making the game more difficult (instead of doing something like make the AI more aggressive / sneaky) . So you can't really execute grand strategies - the depth is in how you control your armies and where you send them, because they are the only viable way of winning the game

I really enjoyed the game and it mechanics. The battles were amazing and it ran super smooth, rarely any crashes, awesome soldiers to soldiers combat and the ability to just conquer the whole world even if you finish the campaign. I went for conquering the whole world.

Bugs and crahses: There was one crash when loading the game but when I pressed it again it worked perfectly. Also when your in a loading menu a black flash appears everytime in my first playtime but not anymore.

The campaign: There only one campaign but it still really enjoyable to play. (You can also play as the barbrians when you conquer them)


The system and governership: It was quite hard to manage towns and cities as I had to take care of population size, public order, income and so on. But the most was my money will produce -211 gold, destryoing my profits. I eventually find to prevent it by constructing buildings that increase wealth and happiness. 

It was intresting to mention that you have three options of what to do with a conquered settlement. 
1. Extermination (loads of money)
2. Enslavement (Slaves and a bit of money)
3. Occupy,

Most of the players go to exteriminate or enslave settlement but im a more occupy person. Also it avoids getting into public order issues. By choseing option 1 or 2 you might gain some money in the short-term but long-term will be hard.

Let me start off by saying the gameplay and overall feel of this game is amazing and I would highly recommend it if you can manage to fix the framerate and whatnot. If you do a simple google search of ""Rome Total War performance fix"" you will find that this game was originally intended to run on single core processors. You can set the affinity of the game to run on only one core, however in my case that didn't seem to help. I'm not sure if it's because I'm now running an AMD build or what, but recently the performance has dipped even lower making it really hard to micro manage your armies without resorting to lowering the amount of soldiers per unit and the graphics to the very minimum (which kinda sucks for a 10+ year old game.)

Supposedly part of the issue is because of the transition to Steam servers for multiplayer when Gamespy shut down.

Rome: Total War is what you play when you want to tell the Romans to go home, or vice versa.


It's the third game in the Total War series, and the first to introduce the gameplay template it still uses today. Gone are the 2D battlefield models and Risk-style campaign map from the first two games, replaced with 3D models and a strategic map you can use to finely position units and armies. Gameplay revolves around managing your territory in a turn-based strategy mode, and moving armies around the map to fight opposing armies as well as capture or defend settlements in a real time tactics mode.

This particular entry is widely regarded as a classic, and with great value to boot. It can certainly suffice for people who can't afford or run the later games in the series. Unfortunately the game is optimized to run on only one CPU core, so newer computers might run into some trouble anyway. As this is still only the third game in the series, there are some things in later titles that are lacking in this one such as resolutions above 1600x1400. Something to keep in mind, at least.

The Gold Edition comes with the Barbarian Invasion expansion that takes place during the fall of the Roman Empire, adding new factions and some new features such as hordes & religion; well worth playing after the base game. There's also a [url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/trar/recommended/4770/]second expansion-slash-DLC[/url] available separately that lets you play as Alexander the Great, and it's required for some of the more popular mods to run.


The vanilla game is a good way to get the hang of things, but from the disorganized battle lines to the historical inaccuracy I wouldn't recommend playing for any extended period of time. To wit: the Greek city-states form one faction (just one) while Rome is divided into three families that each get their own faction. Egypt, meanwhile, looks like it walked out of a timewarp from 1000 BC instead of the Ptolemaic empire it was at the time of Rome's ascent.

There's a number of mods that overhaul the game to fix these issues and more, including (nominally) improved AI, which has always been a weakpoint of the TW series - with the exception of the first two games, which used Risk-style troop movement that's easier for AI to understand. Two of the most popular RTW mods include Rome Total Realism and Europa Barbarorum, the former being a general overhaul of the game and the latter being much more realism-focused to the point of near simulation.


I'd recommend this as an entry point into Total War for people on a budget. It's probably better than Rome II at any rate; even with the many improvements that game's had since its disastrous launch it's still a game about ancient warfare that uses an engine the developers intended for Napoleonic warfare.",1349271141,1564325831,TRUE,1,0,0.540412009,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,510,271,5469,0,5225,1496030221

I put a solution on the discussion forums on steam if anyone has issues with it. Basically just do a system scan and it will (hopefully restore any files missing).

I nagged my mom to buy me a cd version as a kid, and a lot of memories where to be had (naturally, I modded the files to have every faction unlocked, good times)

The gameplay, battling, tiny details and old but impressive graphics for their time make this game extremly enjoyable to play, and I believe that this is a great RTS game for newcomers and begginers.

I saw that some people had issues with the game not booting up, so I was hesitant to buy it, but I eventually bought it and had no issues with it (apart from when the game froze like once or twice), but other than that, all is fine.

Will have to try Alexander and especially Barbarian Invasion, they look fun as well.

42,Rome Total War,53533892,english,"So, where to start? This is the seminal point of the Total War franchise, kickstarting the series as we now know it. As with later entries in the series, the game allows you to choose one of three factions to start as; the Julii, the Scipii, and the Brutii. Now, for the most part, you won't find much variation here, with each one representing a different family that was a historic part of Roman history, and this can lead to viewing each army as essentially a copy-paste, with the differences being the colours (In order, red, blue, and green). That said, this might also be the biggest twist of the game. Each of those factions, plus the SPQR, representing Rome itself under Senatorial control in vivid purple, starts the game as allies, and this is a nigh unbreakable bond, at least until much later into the game.

As such, you get to spend a lot of the game securely taking over your desired portion of the world, at least until you finally get the message that you've exceeded the boundaries of good Roman virtue, as the Senate would have it, and can finally kickstart the late-game Roman civil war/bloodbath. Now, this can leave the idea of playing as any of the non-Roman factions as a little unappealing in comparison, given that you're lacking the safety net of having steadfast allies as a Roman player might, but this is Total War. If you wanted a nice easy game where you can try and manage it all easily, you'd be playing Age of Empires or Starcraft. (Just examples, not knocking them!)

In terms of graphics, obviously they're not on par with later games, but they are sufficient. A Roman legion in all its glory looks suitably impressive from afar, and even close-up they still hold a lot of the detail that could be demonstrated given the limitations of the engine and the times. Perhaps the biggest change for someone who's never played pre-Empire Total War is that obviously diplomats have to be recruited and sent out to do your bidding, and that naval combat is never seen on screen, resolved as a solely AI-worked calculation. Other than that, a lot of the staples we see, such as hiding units in tall grass, the exhaustion system, morale and even the limitations on ammunition for ranged units, it's all here.

TLDR: kind of a meandering review, but, just buy the game. It's well worth it, and if it's not, you can always try a refund.",1562255514,1562255514,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,189,3,6168,0,5754,1579367882

52,Rome Total War,52311295,english,"Rome Total War is one of the best titles in the early TW formula and the strategy genre in general.

The colourful cast of factions, the music and the atmosphere, more than make up for the aged graphics and gameplay when compared to newer titles. 

RTW is ideal for newer players of the franchise, as it trims down the fat and focuses on the ""pure"" strategy experience, even though it misses some quality of life improvements introduced later in the series. 

The battles play smoothly on almost every single PC at this age even though most  maps seem relatively barren. The units are still cool to look at though and the animations are charming and even fun.

The hisorical accuracy is pretty much on par with a history channel late night special but some would argue it's part of the fun and the charm of the game.

Finally the replayability va;ue is great, as each campaign can take from a few days to weeks or even months and there are lots of unique and fun factions to choose from, each with its own playstyle, strengths and problems.

78,Rome Total War,51755170,english,"One of if not considered the best total war games in the series, Rome total war set a very a high bar for the rest of the series, and honestly had some of the best mechanics in total war to date, and additionally doesn't feel like your giving an arm and a leg in DLC just to get the game to a functioning state

i will admit its definitely not perfect, the graphics while okay arent that great compared to future titles, the diplomacy ingame kinda sucks ass as NPC factions are kind of dumb in that they will betray you even if your best friends, and overall are kinda retarded       ((i mean this is total war in all games they are dumb)) 

I think that this game has some of the arguably best siege battles within the franchise, the higher leveled cities are absolute juggernaugts to take down and the games provide good and interesting ways of taking them down, such as catapults, Siege towers, Battering rams, ladders, sapper points. It allows for good overall ways of taking down your enemies

A nice feature as well is that you can build as much as you want within the cities, and can even go onto a map and visit the cities themselves and see all the cool and pretty buildings, while the graphics arent amazing they hold up very well too this day
Pros:
Solid siege battles
pretty good battle AI(not the greatest but not horrible))
Good empire management
Good lategame((atleast for Roman factions))

Cons: 
Diplomacy is dogshit((just get trade agreements and ignore the rest))
The other factions honestly arent that great and dont have good lategames 
can feel sluggish lategame((although this happens with every total war
AI is not that good at stuff other than fighting really
City management is a bit limited 

Overall I'd reccommend it to anyone wanting to enter the total war series, if its on sale then i highly suggest you buy it and expierence what one of the best total war games out there plays like

With that being said, it is not a perfect game. As innovative as it was, many of the new systems introduced are just plain broken, usually in your favor. It is very easy to keep your economy booming and roll across the map. At higher difficulties the AI just cheats more, but once you've gotten that far you are probably able to outplay them anyway as they often do completely nonsensical things. Medieval 2 would take this game's basic skeleton and make something more cohesive, but it is also a more difficult game because of this. 

It is easy to have rose tinted glasses for this game because of nostalgia. However, all of its quirks make it one of the most fun Total War games.

1.  Combined with the Extended Greek MOD (XGM), RTW becomes greatly expanded & more playable.

2.  The next TW effort MTW II, continued the good looks, added Castles to their cities, but erased all game difficulty.  

3.  Non existent Diplomacy, as with all the TW efforts, there is no diplomacy (neither do the CIV, or the Paradox travesties).  If they border you, strong or weak, they will eventually ATTACK. 

Conclusion:

With XGM MOD, I enjoy flattening the Romans (as the Greeks) after uniting greece.

Also enjoy uniting Italy as the Romans.

XGM improves RTW a bit.  expands the map, adds a cultural dimension, and allows for some control/influence over the Diplomacy.

*If you wish controllable Battles, Cities - representing  Humans occupying the ancient world (no humans in subsequent TW efforts, only Forts), RTW, & MTW II, (& the pathetic RTW II - of which no more will be said here), were the last TWs to refer to the Human race, you must try RTW & MTW II.  Since, for the TW developers, war happens, happily in a world without inhabitants, as in a dream.

RTW was the best effort.  It had a bit of Tacky (some gamey difficulty).  Season it with XGM.

-builder AI automatization is helpful, but controlling it and little to no separate degrees of it aren't
-basically a worse version of MTW2?
-senate stuff, offices, char 'development', etc. all make little to no sense, the more you step into senate it probably keeps hating you much more right away
-(just like any total wars?) systems altogether are as if meant to be as ahistorical as possible, at least due to how it balances and ties with gameplay;
-to make systems n limits in place even more ridiculous (like distance to freely switchable capital defining most of public order) - sometimes some unrest just stays permanently, with no fix possible it seems, another variant could maybe be that you can't demolish some things and they could be of another culture, yet again denying peace without hobo guerillas for ages (that also anyway pop anywhere anytime, everytime, bout no matter what, just these merely tend to stay in place mostly harmlessly)

It have an eternal re-playability and campaigns are very enjoyable, it require low hardware performance and presents a multiplayer where to challenge friends in direct battles.

The diversity of troops available is not immense and some times the borders of regions on map are a bit strange. The campaign and battle strategyes are really well done and it changes a lot if you are ruling with the Greeks rather than the Romans or Egyptians etc.
Along with Shogun 2, in my opinion, the best Total War. A step above Rome 2.

Who, like me, loves this game but is unable to install the old cd...here the solution.
If you find it under sale, it is a bit dated, I absolutely recommend it (I took it for 3,99$ I also saw it at 2$).

Rating: 8.5/10  It is still holding the comparison with other more recent games.

88,Rome Total War,49863558,english,"This game is the sole reason why people have bought the games in the Total War series and been let down ever since and now it works on windows 10 ( sort of ). Owned this game 15 years ago, must of put thousands of hours into it and stumbled across it by chance today which became an instant purchase. This is still the Best Total war game of the series but considering the rest pretty much suck that's not saying a lot. This game has many factions which you don't have to spend more money to be able to play them. Each faction is pretty unique and plays differently, some have no archers what so ever, some have their archers on chariots, some have great spear men and some are useless. The main difference with this than any other is even the best player in the world can find a challenge unlike the rest which are just easy. The hardest faction to play is Partha, while it has some amazing troops they are locked away behind high level buildings, if you play on very hard good luck reaching them or lasting 20 turns for that matter. The graphics are not up to the standard of Warhammer but the graphics shouldn't be the reason you are playing these games. While the battle maps are lacking in some detail at least you can clearly see your troops which is far more important than a few more detailed leaves on a tree. The campaine map is large but not as big as Rome 2 or Attila in other words just right and you can easily find your armies, diplomats and spies. Unlike Warhammer every faction is involved and you will have to defeat everyone to win.
You might experience some problems with this very old game but I've only had one game crash in the 10 hours of playing.

As for the graphics don`t worry: you get used to them right on the second turn. Give it a go, you`ll find it to be amazing.

For sure there are many elements that are out of date. Its building and settlement management system was basic and primitive even when it first came out, compared to contemporary games of the time, and Medieval II refined it to a far better system. But there is just something visceral and heart pounding about the battles in Rome I that continuously draws me back.

I don't know how many hours I've played this game since first release, and yet I can confidently say that no two campaigns have Ever been exactly the same.

All this goes on automatically, whereas newer Total War games has an experience system where the player selects ""perks"" of their general.

Rome: Total War is a game developed by The Creative Assembly and published by SEGA and forms part of the Total War series

The game offers some pleasant graphics and really vibrant colours, although some ugly glitches here and there, it is pleasant all the same

The game does suffer with some repetitiveness at certain areas of the game but a fun game nonetheless

Rome: Total War overall, however, is a fun game to play, yet sometimes flawed, but is a great grand strategy game to play in short bursts!

45,Rome Total War,48795302,english,"In my Opinion, Rome is perhaps the best strategy game. Employing simple yet engaging mechanics, complimented by stimulating music whether you are gazing at the campaign map overseeing your empire or in the heat of battle controlling one of your many created armies. For its time, the visuals are fantastic and the music even more so. Despite seeming simple, the game boasts deceptive challenges and fair difficulty ratings. You start off as Rome, choosing 1 of 3 houses of the triumvirates. In order to play other factions, you must first conquer them. To win, one must control over 250 City States and/or conquer Rome the capital of Italy (The 3 Roman Triumvirates have a different win condition, they must first win over the senate and the people of Rome to rule it via competition between the other two triumvirates.) 

Rome is a Turn based strategy game, but unlike most of the turn based strategy titles, Rome makes it so that each turn ensures healthy progression thanks to responsive AI that like you control their own military, agriculture and politics, engaging with both you and the other AI on the map. Plus you are consistently given Missions by the senate of your own faction, which if completed give very helpful rewards. Thus ensuring that there is no stagnation between turns and no cease of action on the field or on the map. 

There are a few problems posed by this game, first and foremost being that Rome is a very old game. Released in 2004 the game is now 15 years old, meaning it's multiplayer potential has faded into obscurity, unless you employ 3rd party software like GameRanger etc. Second issue with the game is that no matter what difficulty you put it on, there are certain factions that will naturally have the upper hand like Egypt and the Romans due to either their fixed position on the map and/or the resources they control when they start off. It is NOT impossible to face these factions on any difficulty, but there are some considerable rage moments on either the ocean or on land against said factions. Other than the reasons stated above there arent any other real issues with the game, it is very well made. 

Another BIG plus is that the game does its best to be historically accurate. From city state names and placement as well as faction names and placement and the resources they posses. Each set of factions have their own unique despots/leaders/wives/assassins/diplomats/scouts as well as land/water based army/navy units of who's profiles are historically accurate respectively. There is also an option to play historical battles that actually took place or if you want you may create custom battles at your own leisure, just remember to give yourself infinite Denarii so you can give yourself the best army ;). (Denarii = money)'

I have been playing Rome Total War far before it was available on steam and i have many thousands of hours played on both multiplayer and offline in the game. I HIGHLY reccommend this game to both strategy gamers and *coughs* plebs *coughs* non strategy gamers alike. It is a beautifully made game for its time and has aged very well considering the contemporary gaming scene. A worthy investment of time and money. 

Roma Victrix!

This game is unremarkably historic as well as the genre-breaking game of the year 2004. In this spectacular yet old and buggy game, you get to partake in the affairs of the three families of Rome, which fight for power and for control of Rome.
The collection adds onto the popularity of this game by adding in the Barbaric Invasions expansion pack, which introduces the few yet new factions like the Franks, the Huns, and the Persians. It also adds a few custom units dedicated to each faction, along with new city styles and a few more specialized buildings and items.

The good things about this game/collection are:
- An expansive campaign.
- Unit varities.
- Factions have differences.
- A humongous map.
- RTS Influence.
- A still active gaming community.

The bad things about this game/collection are:
- Really out-dated in modern standards.
- Out-dated graphics.
- Quietly fading away in the public eye.

Nonetheless, I recommend the game and the collection because it's a great way to spend time, conquering others and fighting off the annoying Greek city-states and rebels as well. It's truely a big bang for your buck.

93,Rome Total War,48094959,english,"TLDR: Fantastic game but has its a fatal flaw in really bad combat AI.

I've gotten into the franchise recently and love it to death, this being my first TW game. The attention to detail in this game is absolutely phenomenal and genuinely impressive by todays standards. The only problem i have with this game is that the battles are just way, way too easy because of how bad the combat AI is. I played the tutorial then hopped into campaign on very hard for both difficulty settings and i just felt let down. The AI will just throw random units at you ahead of advancing its entire line, on top of that they almost never build long range missile troops or have good battalion composition in their divisions among generals. There's usually just a mess of infantry that the AI can't seem to control correctly and after several hours on the game it really broke my immersion. I found myself never actually building any archers, cavalry, or high-tier infantry units just so battles actually seemed fair and engaging to fight where i could try to manuever my units to gain advantages rather than have advantages generously tossed at me by the AI, even on the most difficult settings. I'm currently looking for a mod that overhauls the AI and makes it a bit smarter and will be looking into other newer TW games  to keep scratching this itch. 

That was a lot of criticism but i still love the game and im writing this review before hopping back into it, I just feel like it could be better, but for a $10 game made in 2004, holy shit is this game absolutely phenomenal. I'm hoping the more recent TW games have better AI that builds better armies and uses them better, or a modder has done that themselves for this game.

32,Rome Total War,40968126,english,"[h1]A wise man in times of peace prepares for war.[/h1]

My troops are encircled. The battle was not in my favour from the beginning - my general had sallied forth to besiege an enemy city, leaving two units of peasants, a nd a single unit each of Roman Hastati and Velite. So it was that barbarians amassed outside the walls, trapping the small frontier settlement. Weeks passed, and eventually the uncultured barbarians pushed against the walls. One unit of peasants held one breach in the wall against fanatical swordsmen, killing as many of them as they could before the peasant's morale broke and they fled back to the town square, where they managed to regroup. My Hastati and the other unit of Peasants, after killing as many as they could, retreated before the fanatical swordsmen could attack my flanks. The Velite fled down another series of side streets, leading the foolish barbarians away so that my Hastati could line up in the center of the street, protecting the town square from direct attack. The two peasant groups, now greatly reduced in number, stand alongside the Hastati, who had lost about ten men in the frenzied battle at the gate. Over a hundred, perhaps two hundred, barbarians marched down the main street while the other hundred chased after the Velite. 
The fight began once more in earnest, as the naked, fanatical warriors charged against Roman shield and steel. They were broken; routed, they fled out of the city. But more came - warbands of men armed with spears and shields, attacking Roman soldiers with vigour. 
The Velite were cornered, and fought to the death, brave Romans to the last. As they were being attacked, a unit of peasants was hurriedly ordered by the general to support them - this came to little, but the flanking action managed to surprise and kill a few more of the barbarian invaders than might have been killed by the unskilled melee fighters in the Velite regiment. The peasants fled back down the street to the town square. 
The Hastati and the other group of stout Roman peasantry fought valiantly, and broke group after group of barbarians against superior Roman steel and mettle. Soon, the hundreds of barbarians that had stood against the Hastati were fleeing from the city and tripping over the bodies of their fallen comrades, and, alas, a few Romans as well. 
Meanwhile, the band of cowardly barbarians that had encircled the Velite charged down the side street towards the town square. The peasants waited in the town square, only fifteen of them now, as the twenty-seven remaining Hastati turned, preparing to counter the charge. 

And they did - for a time. The fight raged on for some minutes, and it was just as the Hastati seemed to be gaining the upper hand that the warbands that they had broken before had returned - it appeared that their barbarian courage could only be gained by stabbing brave Romans in the back with their long spears! 
So the Hastati now, encircled by at least one hundred and fifty barbarians, stood back to back, forming a small circle. The general - a mere captain, hastily appointed by his compatriots due to the absence of the general, shouted encouragement to his soldiers, imploring them to hold fast. The peasants attacked the outer ring of the barbarians, and one group was completely wiped out. But, the barbarians were faltering, in spite of the amount of Romans that they had killed - they saw in the twelve men that remained true strength - they were true warriors. 
The Hastati, the brave twelve, pushed outwards, breaking the warbands, and striking a lucky blow against the enemy general - he lay with his dead brethren, right next to a fluttering Roman flag. 
As the barbarians fled the city, passing through the streets littered with barbarian and Roman bodies, twelve Hastati and two peasants looked out at the carnage that had been wreaked on the city streets that day; they were the only survivors. Romans, true and honorable. 

Some months later, the twelve Hastati were linked back up with their original general. They were taken to the capital of the barbarians, and it was there that they witnessed the fall of their 'empire'. Now, Rome had finally received it's revenge. 

Well, just in case you weren't paying attention - this game is one of the best strategy games ever made, with an easy-to-learn, hard to master attitude, hundreds of hours of gameplay, and countless tactical possibilities and awesome stories just like the one above. And just in case you are wondering about my hours - I played a lot of this game offline before Steam.

I still think it's much better than Rome II, which fell to overambition on the map side of things, is still incredibly buggy and laggy, whilst grossly neglected why people play Total War games - the battles.
This particular Total War game only gives the faintest lip service to any historical accuracy whatsoever, but the sheer cartoonishness of its cinematics, units ('head-hurlers', ancient Egyptian chariots, flaming pigs, naked fanatics etc.) and voiceovers gives the game its charm. If want any game to see thousands of Legions and Hoplites killing each other onscreen, this is still the best.

'Barbarian Invasion' (the free expansion in this) takes itself a bit more seriously. The Horde mechanics are definitely far less annoying than in Rome: ATILLA. Night Battles in particular are awesome. 
The only real thing Rome II and Atilla have over the original in gameplay terms was the inclusion on the Middle-East, this game arbitrarily cuts the map off at Armenia/Syria, meaning the Seleukids, Parthians and Sassanids usually die really early. 

There are however 2 *excellent* mods for the original Rome, namely Rome: Total Realism and Europa Barbarorum. Ironically the latter is the more 'die-hard' version for pedants, Total Realism staying closer to the original game.

tl; dr: A much more fun game to play than it's sequel, which poorly imitated Paradox-type Grand-Strategy games and just created a laggy, bugged out map with actual BATTLES as an afterthought.",1543196443,1543196443,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,76,30,16,0,,1564967823

It's still actually one of my favourite games of all time. For it's time, without a doubt the best there was. But with teh changes that have been made to it with random patches here and there, and the increased difficulty of getting the game to actually work, I can't honestly recommend that anyone buy it from steam anymore.

Most people will spend a lot of time getting it to function and even then with difficulty. If you do manage to get past all of that, then you can probably with even more difficulty mod it and make it better still for you personal experience. However:

Many mods are broken and do not work an longer. Not sure how many have been fixed and reworked by mods.

Changes to the game in the last two years have made it a little boring and a bit of a wam-bam tahnk you mam experience battle wise. I haven't really been able to get in to it since they converted armour bonus' into actually hit points, as opposed to taking a percentage off of the enemy attack. Units break at half the speed in general, which does actually make it more difficult but the battles are soooo short now. There's no class to it.

I cannot thank this game enough for the times where outside problems didn't even matter anymore because the Romans were attacking or I had to deal with the betrayal of my Gaullic allies. I got this game originally in 2010 thru the CD box and it's only since the CD got too scratched I had to come to Steam, hence the low hours and it's helped me finish middle-school, procrastinate my way through highschool and now I'm juggling it with the rigors of a relationship, college, and working in the real world. Even with all of that I don't regret a single hour I've put in, the simplicity of wanting to be the undisputed emperor of Europe along with all the hilarity this game throws at me like losing a city because the attacking AI won't move into the town square since they like standing on my walls for 30 minutes much more make this game so addicting and easy to come back to.

I haven't even started to talk about the mods that some really creative people have dedicated themselves into making, want cooler spartans? done, want to make burning pigs fly on catapults? there's a mod for that, want a mod with even more authenticity and realism including barbarians having their dongers out? do I even have to tell you yes for you to know some guy out there spent time making pixelated penii? 

This and Medieval 2 are basically the two main Total War games I'm really limited to with my yucky computer with Empire barely playable (although I still have racked up 200 hours just bc I have some stubborn inclination to watch soldiers march into cannon fire) but the endless amount of fun I can have by sending spies with disease to all of Greece to watching enemy Roman soldiers go into testudo because the snowing was falling too hard on them seems like I'll be playing this game for years to come. I haven't played so many Total War games because I'm a broke college boy where the rent is too goddamn high and so this old 2010 computer is gonna have to do for a couple more years until I get to lose my social life and girlfriend and fail more classes because some Japanese clan or goblin stronghold thought they could betray me.

Even though the game may be outdated, the gameplay is still great. Rome: Total War is a top class strategy game. One can control various nations during the rise (or fall, depends on which faction you play) of the Roman empire. I personally enjoyed the combination of city management and real time battles. I have spent countless hours (don't be misled be my current hours, I have played Rome: Total War long before I bought it on Steam) on Rome: Total War. Who wouldn't want to be like Caesar?
If you like strategy games, this is the game for you. The graphics may be outdated, but the gameplay is still solid. This game combines the features of a turn based strategy game with that of a real time strategy game. The grand campaign is situated in Europe, North Africa and Minor Asia and is played in the turn based mode whereas the battles are fought on a small map in real time.
In conclusion, I rate this game a 89,89/100.

- Immense depth of mechanics. Traits, choices, settlement trees, decisions that MATTER.

- Replayability with factions abound.
- Units with COLLISION.

- Newcomers will need patience to overcome the big ol' learning curve.

Regardless, here's a rundown. 

Here's a comment from a dude called SickZip, which an be found on Reddit:

""Random general spawns is only one of the things that adds generals to the pool.

The sudden uptick of complaining now, as opposed to when female generals first appeared, is because in a recent patch they made every character on the family tree into a politician and so an eligible general. This means that for factions taht allow femal generals, every characters wife, widow, or adult daughter is going into the general pool. At the start of the game, the percentage are only a little above what you list. But once the game gets going and family trees start filling out, you can end up with a majority of women generals fairly easily.

Worse, if you avoid using female generals because you're a historical purist or think putting everyone's wives in charge of their own armies is dumb, you will end up with your general pool dominated by female characters. 

Basically CA is bad at game design and testing and is now pretending to be woke and insulting fans to avoid having to ever address this.""

But this game has more of the historical accuracy that Medieval 2 doesn't have while trumping down on Shogun with the fun of bringing glory to Rome!

The reason this game stood out amongst other games was the mix of turn based and real time strategy that has been done by only a few other games, and this is the only game that did it as well as it did. Combat is fluid, strategy is relevant, and the game actually manages to make me nervous when I am about to fight a battle on equal footing.

Strategy is important in this, becuase unlike many other games, spamming one unit will not win you battles. You need a well managed mix of units and sound tactics to win the day, and a good general helps as well...

Also a plus is that there are really good mods for this game: Lord of the rings total war, Europa Barbarorum, Extended Cultures, Roma Surrectum II, Rome Total Realism, fourth age total war, etc.

however some of them break some stuff or cause new bugs and I wouldn't recommend those to new players.

Vice versa vanilla has some bugs which are fixed in nearly all mods. Plus egypt isn't a hellenistic faction in the vanilla game which bugs me.

There is a unnoficial bug-fixer made by player1, however more recently ahowl11 has made a even more updated bug-fixer which fixes some bugs not fixed by player1 and turns egypt into a hellanistic faction. It's called ahowl11's vanilla enhancement mod and it's the only mod I know that doesn't add new bugs to the game.

31,Rome Total War,12770630,english,"Well.....reviewing this game is hard. For it's time, it was without a doubt one of, if not the greatest, strategy games of all time. However, comparing it to newer Total Wars (except for ROME II, that is something else entirely) it lacks in several things, notably historical accuracy, diplomacy, and managing your government. 

For one, in historical accuracy, there are multiple nations (like Gaul, Spain, Greece, etc.) that are unified nations even though in real life they were a divided people, with seperate clans, city states, etc., but for some reason CA mashed a lot of city states and tribes together to form unified nations, which is completely inaccurate. Also, in Egypt is not Hellenistic at ALL. They still have traditional Egyptian paganism as their religion, and their units are traditional Egyptian ones, even though Egypt was now practically a Middle Eastern copy of Greece thanks to Alexander the Great. 

In diplomacy, there are very few options (some examples are trade rights, alliance, and map info), which lessens your interactions with other nations. The AI also struggles to properly conduct diplomacy.

Finally, there is governemnt. For Roman factions, the Republic government is somewhat accurately displayed, but in general, there really is no ""government system"" like in some later Total Wars, although there is a family tree that allows you to set the faction heir, adding a bit of spice to government. 

If we put those those things aside, though, you will find a true classic of a strategy game-and I'm pretty sure most people here would agree with me. In a time where graphics made people look like horrible mutants, the AI was as smart as your neighborhood stray dog, and strategy games lacked a lot of actual strategy, this game was revolutionary. The graphics, although inferior to today's games, probably looked really great to a lot of players back in 2004.  The jump from the previous Total War, Medieval, to Rome in terms of graphics was absoultely stunning. The AI (which, to be honest, is not much smarter than the neighborhood stray) is competent despite occasional errors. Diplomacy, while lacking in true immersion, adds a new level of strategy to the game despite its simplicity. The government system, while being very basic, also adds to the strategy of the game, as you scramble to find a sutiable heir for your glorious (or, more often than not, not-so-glorious) empire. 

Speaking of empires, there are 20 factions, with about half of them playable, half of them not playable. Technically, there is a 21st faction: the rebels. The rebels not only represent actual rebels, which I am perfectly okay with, but they also represent ""minor factions"" that CA left out of the game, which is kinda sloppy to me. However, all-in-all, the campaign is sound, if perhaps a tad disappointing to modern gamers. 

Now, on to battles. It is usually not possible to manage a nation without going to war occasionally, and this game certainly does not oppose that statement. You will end up in countless battles, usually with random weaklings who think they are better than you, but you will sometimes find yourself matched against a worthy foe. If it is a land battle, you can do one of three things: fight the battle out on a battle map, have the computer auto-resolve the battle, or retreat. For naval battles, you only really have the auto resolve option. For the battle map, you and everyone involved, regardless of whether they are on your side or not, will command various units that can be trained in cities if you have the proper buildings (in the campaign). You lead these soldiers to victory or defeat against the enemy. I personally believe CA did a great job with the battle mechanic of the game.

If you like Total War games, strategy games in general, video games in general, or if you like life, then buy this game. Even if you don't like life, still buy it. This is a true classic of a strategy game, and you would be a fool to pass on it if you are a fan of the genre.

Overall, 9/10.

Also, this game definitely deserves the ""Test of Time"" award. An absolute classic of the strategy genre.",1415063099,1534014087,TRUE,159,21,0.748797715,18,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,54,10,9218,0,9004,1527196242

89,Rome Total War,42870972,english,"Often considered to be one of the best games in the Total War series. Rome is a game that has captured my heart and imagination since i first saw my friends played the game on his computer back in 2006. There is so much in the grand ambition of this game that far exceed most games back in 2004.

At the start of the game, you start out with the Roman faction. You have 3 major families to choose from; The Julii to the north, The Scipii to the south, and The Brutii to the southeast. rosterwise, there are no difference between all 3 families. Instead, each family is given different objectives by the senate to capture land for the roman republic. Your ultimate goal would be to gather enough strength and the support of the people to eventually overthrow the senate and become Emperor of Rome. After you complete the game, you will then be given the opportunity to play several other factions who are also vying for power in ancient Europe which spices up the gameplay with their different units and tactics.

Gameplaywise, the game is divided into 2 phases. The map phase has you in a turn based gameplay where you manage your empire to gain funds, act in diplomacy, look after your cities, and build up your army to expand and defend your territory. When a battle starts, the battle phase begins which follows an RTS formula. These are the true highlights of the game as you control armies up to thousands of troops on screen to defeat your opponents,

On the positives, this game aims to be grand scale in its endevours which for the most part succeeds. The feeling you get as you march your army of legionnares to conquer the Gauls or sacking Carthage is unmatch by any other game outside of the Total War series. Battles are often won with wit rather than force. Due to how the game's battle system that attempts to be more realistic with troop morale and the like, often times you can win or lose battles depending more on how you strategize and predict what your opponent will do next. Nothing is quite as exciting as being overwhelmed by number of your enemy soldiers only to outsmart them with a well place flank attack and gaining a heroic victory as a result. Rome succeeds at both giving the player the feeling of being a general and a conqueror that other strategy games don't really give. This is only exemplified by the excellent soundtrack composed by Jeff van Dyck which gives out a an ancient and haunting feel throughout the experience.

On to the negatives, one of the biggest issue that is incredibly infamous in the Total War series in general is the AI. Generally the AI can be competent but often times are rather stupid. Most fights can be easily won by just doing a flank attack and the AI will have no clue what to do. If you're looking for competent foes to fight then you're better off playing the multiplayer instead. The game has a glaring issue with its diplomacy system. The game is often unclear with what the other faction wants and they often come off as acting erratic rather than clever. Your allies may suddenly declare war on you for no reason and you're stuck with sudden attacks despite just a moment ago they proposed an alliance with you. Another weird hiccup is how the roster is designed. It's pretty clear that the Roman faction was given the most attention considering the name of the game, but other factions feel underdeveloped, severely in some more than others as a result. The game's factions are clearly unbalanced as a result and playing as them in the campaign can feel very frustrating especially if you play as one of the factions who are at war against Rome. Because the Roman faction is basically 4 factions with their own funds and AI, playing against them often feels more annoying than fun as you are severely overwhelmed by them if you don't act first. One minor issue i have is more towards historical accuracy. While the romans were given attention to reflect their historical design, the other factions caters more towards stereotypes that makes the whole thing feel cartoony instead. (The worst example of this is the Egyptians who despite at the time was more Greek than Egyptian as part of the legacy of Alexander the Great, CA opted to make them the stereotype egyptian from pre-Alexander time which makes no sense whatsoever).

Overall, Rome Total War is a game that is just incredible in what it accomplishes, while the game has plenty of blemishes that are more visible now than ever, it's not enough to diminish how much of an impact this game created. Follow that with the game had a very vibrant modding community in its hayday that iron out those issues and you have a game that i recommend for just about any strategy fan who are into ancient warfare with thousands of soldiers on screen battling each other.",1529486667,1529486667,TRUE,36,1,0.788937509,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,117,17,15797,0,8376,1600865596

4,Rome Total War,36604962,english,"In many ways, I view Rome Total War as the high point in the Total War Franchise.

Set in ancient, take control of one of many factions (Italian, Barbarian, Mid-Esteastern) and conquer the world!  It's a large game with the map covering Europe and parts of Asia and Africa, and a single game takes more than a small investment of time.

The core gameplay focuses on war and empire management. Battles allow for auto resolves, but the real charm and strength of Total War relies on taking to the field and commanding large numbers of troops in massive combat.  It controls great, even when the scale of the battles become epic, and the cieling for skil is incredibly high as real world strategies and tactics will get you far.  All the while, even less mechanically inclined players wont find it overly burdensome, even if they don't get all they can out of the game.  Finally, battles often feel unique as different fations play differently, the terrain drastically changes battles, and seiges on cities introduces its own mechanics.

The other side of Total War is the macro.  Players must build troops, build buildings, and manage finances.  While simple, I found a great ammount of enjoyment building my territories up.  While not in depth to any real degree, the over world system does require some finesse once you expand further and must deal with rebels.  I'm underselling this a degree, because the entire system is extremely enjoyable.

While I'm not up to date on the more decent Total War games, and despite its age, I would recommend Tota War Rome as a great entry point into the franchise.  It's a large, expansive, moderatly deep experience that you can get lost in for hours.

If you are a fan of the strategy genre and have't experienced Total War as of yet, give this game a try.

62,Rome Total War,41649816,english,"Wonderfully strategic. The game is a marvel especially for its decade. Made in 2004, it's basically an empire building game with wonderfully historically accurate land architecture (most of) the factions and units. There's no B.S. Microtransactions so the empire building is fun and also very in depth. Don't know what I mean? Well, you start off with a family. Julii, Brutii and Scipii are the choices. You start with a faction leader and a couple sons. Each family member acts as a general or official depending on where you send him. His experiences also shape his abilities. Let's say you constantly keep sending 'ol Decius out to conquer and battle enemies. Well his ability to command will rise and he will gain new traits such as confident commander. Your faction leader gets a trait called faction leader and you can also pick a son who will inherit this position. This son will get a trait called faction heir until he inherits the position as leader. You can also pay to have agents trained such as, the diplomat, and the assassin. The diplomat can talk to leaders, generals and other diplomats. He can help your faction work out deals with other factions and depending on his influence level, which is like command ability in that it decides on how well he can persuade and speak, be successful. These deals can be such as alliances, tribute, single payment, trade rights, giving territory, ceasefire in the case of a war, and many more. The assassin can well, assassinate. You can use him on enemy leaders and members and depending on their traits and skills will influence his ability to succeed. He can also infiltrate enemy camps to report their statistics to you and he can also wait inside for you to attack the camp and then open the gates for you. But if he gets caught he gets slaughtered. Also is the management ability and similar to command and influence, it decides how well this family member can manage a settlement town or city. If a settlement is poorly managed it can lead to peasant revolts and low taxes. This greatly reduces income. If you make war with another faction by attacking, you can attack each of their settlements strategically. The Gauls start north of the factions and I encourage you to start with them. Your family members can also gain office in the senate. Completing missions assigned by the senate greatly increases your chances of winning. You can also bribe factions to gain favor with them. Your also able to see how the people of Rome feel about you and how the Senate feels about you. This favor will quickly decline if you don't do the senate missions. I probably missed a lot but you get the gist of it. Oh and before O forget, you can train your own units of soldiers and make buildings in settlements to increase income and your army. Now onto the combat strategy section of the game. There are several ways to initiate combat. One is naval combat. Naval combat is basically just the computer seeing who has more ships between two sides. Whoever has more wins. There's no 3-d part of it and it's very short. Troop combat is where it gets really interesting. The first way to initiate combat is by attacking a settlement. Attacking will be violating the peace and will begin a war with whatever faction owns the settlement. You will then begin a siege.  You now have two choices. You can either wait out the siege or you can build siege upgrades, wait however many turns for them to finish building, and then attack. I forgot to mention the turns. It's not what your probably thinking. It basically that eventually your troops diplomats and such will stop moving on the map because time is passing. They will stop because their turn is over. When building anything it will take a certain amount of turns to finish. You can move to your next turn by clicking end turn. The factions will then do whatever they want to do sometimes meaning they send reinforcements or start wars. Each turn is half an in game year. Each family member starts at a certain age. Eventually after attaining a certain age they die. They can also die in battle. This is how the heir inherits the position. Anyways back to battle. So if you choose to attack with your now built siege weapons it zooms into a 3D view of the settlement. You will start outside of its walls (if it has them) and you can position your troops around a line around the settlement however you please before battle. After your done click begin battle. This starts the battle and you can now see the enemy troops unless they're hiding. We'll talk a little about that later. If you need to breach the walls then select your siege weapons, find a weak spot and attack. Beware of archer towers they will set wooden battering rams on fire. If you lose all siege weapons you lose. If you have an assassin inside he may be able to open the doors for you. It's all real time but you can speed up or pause the battle at your leisure. You can also make troops walk or run depending on the speed you want things. Keep in mind running will eventually tire them out. Weather can also effect troops. You can choose however many units you wish and click the location you want them. They will run or walk depending on what you select. Another way to start battle is attacking a general outside a settlement. This can also happen to you along with the previous to your settlements. Outside settlement battles are about the same minus the siege weapons and walls. It's just you, him, and the terrain. You can hide behind trees and surprise them or rush in. It's up to you. You can zoom in and out of the view closer or farther to the action as you see fit. I'm sure I missed a lot as this game is incredibly in depth but you get the idea. Try it. Your money will NOT be wasted.",1524516042,1524516042,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,22,3,1170,0,1064,1567729474

92,Rome Total War,41138940,english,"If you're playing this game today for the first time you might not see how fantastic it was. I played it when it first released back in 2004 and it blew my mind. I had always been a fan of strategy games but before Rome: Total War I had only ever played strategy games such as Age of Empires 1 and 2, Rise of Nations, Cossacks - all great games with a special place in my gamer heart, but Rome was the first time I ever saw thousands of soldiers fighting on my screen at the same time, as opposed to those other games where you see as few as 30. Not only could you see thousands of soldiers fighting at the same time, you can actually zoom in very close. This just blew my mind. I never even dreamed this would be possible.

I used to sit at highschool and daydream about playing this game. I just wanted to get home and play it for another 10 hours. You choose your faction (Rome, Egypt, Greeks, whatever) and manage your growing empire. Build stuff in your cities, recruit armies, battle with other armies, decide the fate of enemy cities you conquer and so forth.

Music is PERFECT. Iconic really. I have the main menu theme for this game on my MP3 player. Graphics look old but what do you expect for a almost 15-year old game? I think my favourite thing of all in this game are the generals. Your generals are characters with traits and personalities. If one of your family members comes of age at 16-years old and you just leave him in a big rich city his whole life, he basically becomes a corrupt gambling lout. If you send them out to command armies and conquer enemies you can turn them into little Julius Caesars.

I recommend it, no problem. I still play it sometimes for the nostalgia. Some of the mods for this game are remarkable - my favourite is Europa Barbarorum (they also made Europa Barbarorum II for Medieval II: Total War). It's a very realistic modification for the game - changes almost everything because one thing that Rome: Total War was NOT was realistic.

6,Rome Total War,40891952,english,"Overall a brilliant game. One of the best strategic games I've ever played.

Over the past 10 years or so I've played the first 3 Rome Total War games, Medieval Total War and the first Shogun Total War game.

The first game sets you in ancient Rome during the decline of the Greek ""empire"". You have multiple factions to choose from such as three Roman houses, the Britons, Germanic tribes, Gallic tribes, Greeks, various forms of Persians and many more. The main campaign usually gives you a set goal, such as hold 20 regions and take Rome. You'll have to build up your wealth, armies and infrastructure before taking on these goals as the diplomacies and technologies of the world advance. Playing as the Romans you will be given specific requests by the senate of Rome, asking you to use naval warfare on an enemy port or to take a city from the enemy, for example. The AI, both in battles and the campaign map, are really good! The only problem with the first RTW game is if you're playing as the Romans, eventually...no matter what, the Senate will turn on you. You can do all of their missions and so on, but once you reach too much power/wealth/land, they deem you an enemy of Rome and you have to fight all other houses (by which time, are usually the strongest adversaries) and take Rome itself.

In all three games you have historical battles, re-enactments of famous battles of their time periods. These are always good fun but not incredibly repeatable after your first victory or two.

In Alexander you play as the Macedonians conquering Asia and moving towards India. This game is different as it has a shorter time limit on achieving the goals. The game is more focused on constant combat rather than building up the infrastructure of an empire. It's still good fun if you're a fan of RTW but you can essentially do the same and more by just playing as the Greeks in the original game and heading east (while defending the west from the Romans too, of course).

The third (and my favourite) game is Barbarian Invasion. Barbarian Invasion takes place hundreds of years after the first game and focuses on the fall of the Roman Empire. There is no senate to appease. In the words of Palpatine, ""I am the senate"". The main reason I find this game to be the best is because of the barbarian horde system. The game is very similar to the original, with the factions being mostly just the descendants of the original factions. The Romans, instead of being 3 houses and the senate, are now two empires, the East (rich and probably the best of all due to superior infantry and cavalry) and the West (still the main bastion of Rome but clearly losing control). The horde system works with some factions from the start of the game but essentially it works like this. When a faction that can create a horde loses its final outpost, it will form a horde of around 3,000 troops. These will usually be strong infantry, archers and average-good cavalry. They will be able to march wherever they like, destroying or capturing anything in their way until they find a new land to settle in. Once the horde have taken 3 settlements, all remnants of it will dissapear (if you have 1,000 horde infantry in a city, they will dissapear). The horde system will continue to work until the faction has no family members/generals left. The horde system is always interesting as it leaves you having to be prepared for anything or nothing, which makes the game (in my opinion) the best in the series.",1521359343,1521359343,TRUE,8,0,0.594786048,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,37,4,6276,0,6215,1520048852

The game is of course, graphically old, but it's aged very well. The map, the interface and the campaign are very well done. There's a nice choice of countries - once you clear it as the Romans - and three playable Roman factions helps to bring across the feeling of the Civil War. Like the Catholic Church in Medieval II, the Senate will give you missions, and your actions will reflect your popularity with the Senate and the plebians. The fact that you play as a Roman family means you have to - to an extent - work within the confines and wishes of the Senate.

The entire Roman Empire - Europe, North African etc - is represented on the map. The ancient nations of the time - Gauls, Britions, Carthage, Greeks etc - are all in force. Each Roman family - Caesar, Scipio or Brutus - has an enemy tribe that must be defeated to win the game.

Anyway, I'm ""only"" 15 hours in, but I can already say this has become my favourite strategy game. Ever.

It's supremely satisfying and addictive. I often find myself saying ""just one more turn"" and then finding myself saying it again, 12 turns later. And of course, nothing beats getting into a positively MASSIVE battle, with lots of factions joining the fray and watching the utter mayhem unfurl.

The best part is, both the strategic and tactical layers of the game are very simple and easy to pick up, but offer plenty of depth — it's exactly what a strategy game should be. It is deep without being needlessly complicated. Though I have not played them, the amount of modifications for this game is insane and most of them look great.

I do have some minor complaints, though. One is that naval ""combat"", if we can call it that, is limited to auto-resolve battles (that's not the bad part) which tend to become far too frequent and annoying once all hell has broken loose (that's the bad part). It gets such that when I try to move a ship just from Italy to Greece it's like being swarmed by bees only the bees are ships. Secondly, I'd say even the ""short"" campaign goes on for way too long. I would also say that most of the senate missions are largely inconsequential and not particularly interesting or challenging if you're playing as the Romans.

Lastly, I did only have one odd bug — occupying a settlement as the Julii crashed the game once.

I am almost new to the TW saga and tried the good old RTW to get a feel of the series. So I don't have much comparison points.

TLDR: An excellent strategy and tactical game, hits a sweet spot between Civilization and Crusader Kings. The battles are real and the the management while a little less deep than CK still keeps you busy !

[b] Pros: [/b] [list]
[*]A lot of factions that play differently, I only completed Rome short campaign so far but I can get a feel of what other faction look like
[*]Well balanced game, events unfold, Rome triumph and you must take over the known world ! Win by force and bribes.
[*]A huge fan and modding community improving a lot the base game
[*]Awesome sound track, seriously
[*]Addicting as hell, one more turn....

[b] Cons: [/b] [list]
[*]Hopeless AI who calls for a ceasefire and then attacks the next turn, unable to manage the empire development like a human would do. Victory is actually won in the first 10h of a game
[*]Lack of historical realism, especially for barbarian tribes (fixed with EB mod)
[*]Undeniable aging marks, doesnt fit to modern monitors

The Britania kingdom had suddenly declared war upon my house and I sent my best and finest troops in to halt their invasion. my men held them back as I sent out my diplomats to request help from my allies the Egyptians, the Dacians and Thracians in which only the Thracians came to my help as the Dacians and Egyptians didn't want to get involved. after a hard fought battle I had obtained a Ceasefire with the Britanians so I could focus on the advancment of my people and land fully rather than very little as most of my funds went to producing new and better soldiers to fight in the front lines.

3,Rome Total War,38552754,english,"before the review i want to make clear that this review is not related to multiplayer nor its dlc's

This is rome total war, the game that makes a regular ordinary gamer into a military mastermind in classical warfare within about 50 or so hours by using THE BEST battle mechanics that you could ever imagine making battles rely less on who has a bigger and stronger stick but more on the skill of the person ordering the solder. does this mean that you can win aganst an entire roman army with a single peasant? no that would be stupid but you can win a fight using an army that has troops half as good while still being outnumbered if you know what you are doing.
now to pros and cons
pros: Amazing battle mechanics
fun seige battles for both the attacker and defender
all units have a purpose (Exept peasants who are pretty much useless)
great battle speaches (ik this sounds weird but it can actually help you plan what to do)
there is a counter to everything
encouragement for a diverse army
graphics even by todays standerds are very good
the feeling of controling huge armies to fight more huge armies
generals get traits baised on their situations (ex: if you have too much money in treasury generals will get corrupt and extravagant and if its too low they become cheap and more reluctant to spend money which can be both good and bad)
some traits become bad it they get too high (ex drinkers start at a good bonus but gradualy become worse as the general becomes more alchoholic)
ELEPHANTS
you are not just limited to playing as the romans you also can play as carthage, various barbarian factions, greeks, egypt, and more. 
combat looks and feels amazing
Huge amounts of small but important details (ex: culture penalties occor when occuping a settlement that is not your own and affects happiness depending on how different they are from your faction because you would not expect egyptians to be happy about being ruled by barbarians from germany)

everyone sounds very similar
diplomacy is a bit of a joke
ai tends to be retarded

Even Though This Game Was My Childhood I'll try to give an unbiased Review

To start off Great Game. Absouloutely worth every Penny.
Even Today it Holds up Great, Some may say the bet Total War Game ever made. That Topic is debatable but the Game is Good.

For Starters it was made in the good old days when u had to play to unlock and not pay to Unlock.
More to that the community is still like going. Its not Dead people actually play the game provided they will beat you into the dirt if you are new or havent played in a long time.

The Soundtrack is Just Amazing Every second of the Music Makes you feel more immersed in the battle.
More to that every Unit Is very well balanced. No OP Unit from any faction what so ever

But there are a few problems
  
For Some People the Graphics can be a major Issue.
Community is of Veteran Player's Who will just beat you.
Mass Routing is wayyy Too common

In the End dont think Just buy it You'll love it

I rebought it in Steam for the hell of it and cause I absolute loved this game and still do. It's definitely showing its age but even still, I find it absolutely rediculous that in some ways, the first Rome: Total War is STILL better than the second one a decade and some later... The battle mechanics in the tactical part of the game are the absolute pinnacle of the series and the campaign strategic part of the game had the family tree and dynamic traits for your leaders/generals that helped you connect with them and increased immersion. Only really minor and miniscule complaints is that cavalry are a bit too op in general and the Gauls a little bit underpowered but otherwise, this is the most balanced Total War battle mechanics wise Creative Assembly has made. Let alone the fact that the complaints above can be easily fixed due to mods... And thats another great thing about this game.. the moddability compared to the newer Warscape engine Total Wars is unparalled. Hell there was a Napoleonic Wars mod for this game... and even still, lets not get into the soundtrack which is amazing in of itself...

31,Rome Total War,38322691,english,"Let me start by saying I owned this game on CD at first. and only bought it on sale a while ago. I started playing this game in 2005.
Pro's and Con's down below.

The total war™ franchise has been one great adventure for me. I own all the total war games and Rome: Total War™ Its the best one out of all the other total war™ games. The great element about this game is that you only pay for the base game! To unlock other factions to play, You got to conquer their faction and wipe them out. Almost all Major factions are playable. and alot of minor factions as well. My personal favorite faction is Egypt and Sparta. It offers an extramly fun time.

My Score:
Sound: 9/10    
The Game audio is great. Voice actors are awsome and the music is a masterpeace.

Graphics: 7/10 
This one is hard to do cause in todays standard of graphics its old school. but if you are like me and started 
playing with even older graphics its not that difficult to play with.

Gameplay: 10/10 Almost every faction offers a totaly diffrent playstyle from an easy one to a hard one. Also no factions are unlocked with DLC is all free. but like I said. you got to crush that faction into the dust first to unlock it (or edit the game files) Also the diffrent troop style's is great. Playing as rome you best way to fight is on open ground. but playing as a ""barbarian"" faction the best way to fight the romans is to ambush them. fight in the forest. hills. etc. 

Replay Value 10/10
Just that I started another playthrough of egypt and withing 10 turns my previes playthourh allies now declared war on me is great. the politics and all your actions can change every single action. also you can also loose a family member who is badass and cause of the loss of a great general your amry is weakend and is suddenly attacked by a strong enemy general who crushes a few city's untill you got another army to help out.

Pro's:
- Great political system although it could be better with mods :) 
- Great family tree system (even better then the attila one)
- Unlock factions by crushing them. You only start off with 3 roman factions.
- Great audio and great gameplay.
- Big battles that are badass
- Great sieges of city's
- Good world map
- Trading is actualy way better then other total war games
- The missions you get from your politcal party.
There is so much more I can put here. but you gotta find that out for youself

Con's
- Not the greatest AI. 
- Some small game breaking glitches.
- The controlls can be weird. I suggest editing them before you play.

Just that this is one of my favorite games I am willing to buy it for full 60 Euro price today.
But that its only so little money I suggest picking it up right away. I suggest you buy the collection casue the elexander DLC and the Barabarian invasian are also great!",1513339412,1513339412,TRUE,1,1,0.5,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,443,7,492,0,370,1543935869

43,Rome Total War,38023333,english,"I first bought Rome Total War gold edition from my local Electronics Boutique store, in DVD format. Unfortunately, I played the game so much I broke the CD, which is why I had to buy the game off Steam. Luckily, they were having a sale on at the time so I got both Rome, Barbarian Invasion and Alexander as a package deal for less than $5. This is slightly less than I bought the original game, so it's all good.

Even in its vanilla state Rome is an awesome game and ties with Medieval II as my favorite Total War game of all. Gameplay is a mixture of turn based strategy at an administrative level, which switches to real time action during battles. As a younger player I found it hilarious to create an army full of thousands of war dogs and fight rebel peasants, shouting ""cry havoc and unleash the dogs of WAAAAR!"" as I did so. The actual goal of the game, however, is to become powerful enough to overthrow the Senate and conquer the entire map. Almost every faction you manage to completely defeat then becomes playable for later campaigns. My personal favorite faction was the Parthians - the first time I saw them was a real eye opener. Picture an army of feroicious desert bandits charging towards you, dressed in hot luminious pink.

There are a couple of pretty glaring historical inaccuricies in the game, the most obvious being Egypt. It's not Ptolemaic Egypt but Old Kingdom Egypt, which is out of date by a couple of centuries. A bigger problem comes in the fact that Steam is a bit quirky in loading the game. To access Barbarian Invasion, you have to run the game via the Steam Library, not by clicking the icon, which will only load the standard Rome. This becomes a major issue if you decide to run one of the many great mods out there, such as Ran no Jidai or FATW, because their icons won't work. To work around this, right click on Rome Total War in the steam library, then click on ""set launch options"". This will show a box where you can enter the command line necessary to load a mod. For example, for Fourth Age Total War, the command line is: 

 -mod:bi\fatw

I love the roman period.
I have literally spent 1000's of hours on this game, probably completed the campaign more than 50 times, not including the 2 dlc's, that was well before steam. 
And apart from the graphics/resolution, a game spoiling bug (epic seige bug) and the quite boring building structure, compared to later games, this game is still my prefered TW game even over rome 2!

This is a great game to get if you are a TW fan and want to play on a low spec laptop.
It is not about the graphics like more modern TW games, for me it is the far more simpler strategy and building management that would make me suggest for people to buy this game.
The building structure was quite simple as was the diplomacy, army management etc.. essentially, when you know what you are doing, maintaining an attacking flow and constant faction progression is a much easier task than R2 for instance.
Perfect for playing when you don't exactly want to invest a whole amount of mental energy to a campaign, but want to succeed, and enjoy a great TW game..",1428804293,1511842020,TRUE,2,0,0.54634726,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,310,6,264,0,264,1511842294

60,Rome Total War,37829103,english,"First off, this is the second time I've bought this game so my hours don't reflect my total playtime.

This game may not be new (and may take a little time to get it working on Windows 10, see the community guide for help), but its by far my most played game. The campaign map is played turn based, where you move around your armies, manage your cities and recruit new troops. However, when you engage in combat, the armies fight in real time.

The turnbased part of the game is quite well done, with money being your biggest worry early on, and as you get that down pat, your public order breaking down as your empire exceeds its limits. All the while, your borders encroach on similarly powerful neighbours, keeping the game interesting till the very end.

The combat is where this game really shines though, especially on the highest unit settings. Watching a unit of 160 men marching in in formation as you order them is amazing. 20 of them? Even better. For when you're still learning the game, there are some options you can pick to make the inital learning experience easier, like switching off morale and fatigue, and giving your units infinite ammunition. Then, once you have them down pat, you can switch them on and suffer as your army loses the will to fight in a long battle.

Overall, taking into account its age, this game is easily a 8/10",1511820541,1511820541,TRUE,1,0,0.518518567,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,1009,11,8780,0,5518,1590267911

These games are the golden age of Total War. Unless you do not care about gameplay and are a graphics junky, you don't even need the new games.

Pros: 
-Just best music of any Total War title
-One of the only games with diverse units for all factions (Much more than current titles)
-Heartfelt speeches from generals before each battle, which reflects their traits they have earned. Some are just hilarious.
-Nothing better than domesticating stinky barbarians in the name of Rome.

-Cheap when on sale is always great. You can own this piece of Total War history and all the DLC for like $10. That's great.
-Even playing as a stinky barbarian or Egyptian or any other non-Roman pleb you can still have fun and win.
-Noteable online community still plays, there aren't a ton of them but you can still find a game.
-AI is actually pretty smart, and will try to get your general, flank, target lightly armored units with archers etc.

Overall: 9/10

This game offers a wealth of freedom in strategy and tactics.  The game is played turn-based on the campaign (strategic) map, and pausable RTS on the battle map.  Difficulty is independently scalable for the strategic portion and for the tactical portion of the game.  

Terrain in the campaign map translates directly to terrain on the battle map; and terrain and weather can have dramatic effects on battle.  For instance, arrows fly farther if your archers are uphill of the enemy.  Bridges can be used as bottlenecks to block an enemy's crossing, while your archers decimate them.  Friendly fire is possible, and in many battles I have lost more men to my own archers than to the enemy.  Rain reduces archer effectiveness.  Open fields allow cavary to have more effective charges.  Uphill soldiers fight more effectively against their downhill opponents, Some troops gain a battle advantage in snow, and etc.

Music fades in and out nicely, and always seems appropriate for what is happening on the battlefield or the campaign map.  Voice acting of the advisors, and of the generals before the battles is well done, and often hilarious (there are some really funny audio ""Easter eggs"" in there).

It is possible to win battles against much bigger armies by exploiting the strengths and weaknesses of units.  Just one example: An enemy of infantry attacking your cavalry can be exhausted by using the superior stamina of the horses to evade the footmen for a time.  Attacking exhausted footmen usually results in a rout of the exhausted troops.

Replayability is high.  Different factions (most are playable after defeating them in a previous game) have different strengths, and playing them really is a different experience.  For instance, all the Roman factions are very well rounded and have an excellent infantry and tech tree.  Carthage has devastating elephant troops, but weak archers.  Other factions, like Partia, rely on heavy cavalry.  Gaul has a weak tech tree and economy (they are barbariaans, after all); but their troops can get big boosts from their religious system, their fierceness can induce morale penalties to their enemies, and they can field, by far, the best archers in the game.  Egypt has chariots, a well tounded military, and an excellent starting position on the map, allowing it to become an economic powerhouse without much opposition in the early game.

The voiceacting of units, generals and the charming woman who guides you through your campaign are amazing compared to the one from Rome2. The units are well-balanced and you should really consider studying the advantages and vulnerabilities of every unit to correctly use it in combat-situations. Theres a relatively big map for you to conquer, with loads of diferent tribes and people you can fight or forge alliances with. And even if you like the actual battles more than the strategic manoeuvring on the campaignmap, you can have lots of fun setting up quick, custom or historical battles in either multi- or singleplayer.

48,Rome Total War,23769178,english,"Rome: Total War is the sequel to the first Medieval: Total War, and despite the game's age it still holds up very well in my opinion. Just something you should take into consideration is that the game with the default configuration often does not launch on Windows 10, there are plenty of tutorials out there that can help you solve this problem. Now the PROS and CONS:

PROS:
+Awesome modding community; There are a lot of awesome mods out there for Rome: Total War, just be wary that the game doesn't have a Steam Workshop though, so you will have to download these mods from other websites.
+The game allows you full freedom over the faction you control, as one of the Roman factions you can choose to do the missions the Senate gives you, which will give you rewards such as troops or money, or ignore these completely (which would ofcourse hurt your standing with the Senate, that in the early game wouldn't be a good decision) and as one of the non-Roman factions you do not have an optional mission given at all (Unlike in Medieval: 2 Total War).
+Due to the freedom of the game, you can play a faction in a campaign multiple times without it becoming repetitive because you can choose to set different goals every campaign. (I have over 500+ hours played, still haven't gotten much into multiplayer yet that the game does still support and has people playing it).

CONS (Things to take into consideration):
-The game runs on 1 CPU core, so on modern systems the game wouldn't run as well.
-The pathfinding in cities can often be odd and sometimes requires micromanagement if you don't want your troops running into different directions, other than this the pathfinding is good however.

If you are considering getting Rome: Total War, get it!

63,Rome Total War,36112088,english,"[h1] Rome: Total War - The one that every Total War fan loves [/h1]

If you like strategy games, it should go without saying that you should have Rome: Total War by now. If not, buy it. It's a classic. It has turn-based campaign map where you control your military, economy and other important things while in battles the game turns into real-time strategy. Almost everything you have seen in later Total War games, it pretty much started here (mostly, it set basic standards for those games).

I don't want to write a long review, since there are a lot of things in this game. I thought that I should just mention, what I consider, the most important aspects here:

+ Almost every faction has different strengths and weaknesses and so on... pretty basic for a strategy game.
+ Average, but simple diplomacy, which does it's job well.
+ Basic city control, where you can manage you taxes, buildings and other things. It just works.
+ Most of the time battles go well depending on your skill, units (with varying experience and equipment) and generals....
+ Oh my..... Generals are the best. Their traits and skills dynamically improve depending on city buildings, battles, political power and other circumstances. WHY WAS THIS REMOVED IN TOTAL WARS AFTER MEDIEVAL 2??!!!!! And sometimes their traits can affect their battle speeches. Alcoholic/social drinker --> ""the first one to kill gets my finest wine"", boring speaker --> ""hello, today we are here to do battle"", mad --> ""I ATE ALL OF THEIR BEES!!!""
+ Very good unit detail for a old game. Also, in general, graphics are passable and they don't bother much despite its age.
+ Nice music.
+ A surprising amount of small details here and there.

Neutral:
* Not entirely historically accurate. For example, Rome is split into four different factions, but it was needed to balance the game and make civil war possible at the time. Greek cities are one faction, apperently.

- Sometimes units disobey your orders for unknown reasons (this can be considered a positive, as it's unrealistic to assume that everyone follows orders perfectly).
- Unit formations are messy when you try to enter the city and move towards the target.
- Towers apperently have automatic turrets that shoot infinite arrows (this was fixed in Medieval 2).

74,Rome Total War,35950549,english,"'i there. Let me tell you a story about a man, Total War:Rome and how it changed my life.


This man was an absolute hero. I loved him. Everything he did, I would obsess over. I soon got to the point of worshipping this man religiously and trying to get others into my cult. I spread the word about this man just like Ignatius Loyola spead the word about Reformed Catholicism. I created many large quizzes dedicated to him. Me and the rest of the 'cult' even had a gang sign dedicated to him. Why did I do all of this? The answer is simple. It's because he is cool.

Now, this man was quite fond of Ancient Roman history, as well as people like General Eisenhower (for those that don't know, General Eisenhower was the man who invented computers.) Of course, because of this, I and the other members of the 'cult' began to take a liking to Ancient Roman history too. How did we find out he loved Ancient Rome? We managed to take a look at his computer desktop and on there was a game known as Total War:Rome.


The man I have previously been talking about loved the game Total War:Rome. It is a strategy game, much like another of his favourite games, chess. He has spent hundreds of hours of his time playing Total War:Rome, so of course I had to follow in his footsteps. This game reminds me a lot of this man, and why shouldn't it? This man is one of the things that make my life worth living and some aspects of Total War:Rome are very similar to his ways. The battle instructure, Marcus is somewhat like the previously mentioned man and seeing lots of soldiers running around in battle really shows what a computer is capable of. General Eisenhower would be proud.

All in all, this game is a masterpiece. If you wish to join my 'cult', playing this game is a good way to understand our ways.",1508782091,1508782091,TRUE,0,1,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,5,1,11179,0,6512,1589816400

This game was made in 2004 and it's still amazing. There are a few limitations due to its advanced age of course. 1. The AI is poor at best, even on the higher difficulties. Most battles come down to flanking or a well timed charge. 2. The diplomacy is absolutely broken. As in "" I know you've almost wiped me out but give me half your money or fear the retribution of my one remaining city and unit"" or ""You're armies are five times as large as mine. Better attack your one undefended city anyways"". And finally 3. It can be a little repetitive after a while.

17,Rome Total War,35052401,english,"An amazing game.
Its my first entry into the Total War series and I will likely get either Medieval 2 soon.
To start off, I need to clarify I also play Civ 5 and which is what really brought me in to the strategy genre.
Rome total war is mostly about combat however managing settlements is also crucial- to get rid of rioting and general unhappiness you need to bring the occupied populus under roman influence by building buildings which specifically have Roman architecture and have arenas to generally distract people and minimise riots. A governor is part of your family line and multiple will be born and you can either make them fight along your side or place them in command of a city, generally decided by their traits.
Combat is amazing, and a strong point of why I like this game. Unlike Civ 5 or Hearts Of iron (The later of which I dont have much experience with sadly) it's not mostly diplomatical or economical revolving around a tech tree but based on strategy.
You can beat enemies with overwhelming numbers and little tact, but that will cause you to spend money retraining troops. Sitting back and smashing a weak army is amazingly fun and so is seiging a heavily guarded city with distractions, saps, ladders and towers (Hence I love capitals, because they are usually ten times more challenging to beat and more fun that a city with a small army and no walls).

49,Rome Total War,34485256,english,"Wow. I have like a hundred hours on this game and i still haven't written a review. Well, better late than never... (sorry for cliché)

This game is... mmmmwah! (immagine an italian chef being impressed) Its trait system for family members is great and quite realistic, all the campaigns are fun, and it lets you pretend like you are the ruler of your empire-soon-to-be. This let me imagine and theorise what the future would have been like (e.g. win as carthage, what would the world have been like today?) which is always a fun exercise. Also, the managing of cities and maintaining public order is both realistic and very deep. For example, don't make people happy = settlement revolts, turning to rebel hands.

The AI for this game is also surprisingly good, considering its era. The AI actually has the capability to fight back, or, like in many of my games, they all dogpile on you when you start to get good. That can become annoying, as over-expansion of one's empire can be disaterous at times.

The diplomacy for the game is also quite in depth, allowing you to form alliances, ask for ceasefires (if you are at war with someone), make trade agreements, exchange map information, and a few more that i have forgotten.

Finally,I'd like to commend The Creative Assembly for balancing all the factions so well. All the factions have their strengths and weaknesses, except maybe for the roman factions (although, those campaigns are quite boring. I suggest playing as Germania as soon as you unlock them, as they are a nice and diverse and fun). Even the unplayable factions are fun!

I started around 4pm one night and I immediately went to work against the Gauls. I moved into France and conquered it with pretty light resistance. I moved then to spain to finish off the Gaulic empire. I then went to work on the rest of the Iberian peninsula after a long and bloody campaign of death and carnage. I atleast masscred 3/4s of the population of Spain to deal with unrest. After this I waited. Built infrastructure, refined my army and commanders and moved 4 full armies of Princeps,Triarii,Archers and light cavarly, to the border of Germania poised to attack. However they sensed my imminent betrayal and made a suprise attack against my armies. This led me into a long 50 year stalemate with them, until the scythians from the west distracted them enought to where I pushed and took their capital with heavy losses. I masscred the population of Germania as well to settle unrest in the region. The Scythians not willing to give me any rest invaded and took many of the outlying cities of former Germania. I being sick of the fighting for the time being Charged them and crushed all resistance with my meager armies pushed them back. After a while of this I captured their capital and moved my capital to the former German capital to cause less unrest amoung my citizens. I then moved all my armies into place over the other houses borders of Greece and North Africe. Staged a coup against the Roman republic and crush any and all resistance making myself the emperor of the new empire.  Carpe Dium.

Better graphics
Everything else that comes with a newer game

Rome:
Higher detail in its content
More in-depth than Shogun 2
Graphics aren't as new (duh), but still nice and not a problem to me
No naval battles :(

Both are great TW games and I think equal to each other, but I love how Rome is more in-depth than Shogun 2.

Steam should really put up warnings about games that are unplayable on modern systems.

After looking up more fixes, I found that the main problem with this game lies not with modern operating systems, but modern CPUs, mainly the Intel i-series. The problems pertaining to modern OS can be fixed, but if you have an Intel i-series CPU then be prepared for FPS problems, of which there are no fixes for now, due to an inherent problem in the game's engine.

Also, as someone in the comments pointed out, Steam did put up a warning for this on the store page.

ive played all total wars (not all on steam)
i just got attila for somewhat reson. and that was the only one i did not have.
so i was like ""i'm gonna stop playing med 2 and play rome "" 
as everyone says how much better rome 1 is then 2 they are right in many ways
this could have been a postive review but i can't say it should have been
ive loved total war since i was 7 (i'm 12 now)
it was somewhat awesome ruleing my own empire and back when i was 7 or 8 i nerver looked at the bad stuff or
anything that i review and see today. if i was 7 right now i wouldent care about any of the cons just if you could build and grow a empire then thats all that mattered not quality.
but i nerver took intrest in rome series or movies etc books.
so i wasent gonna play it a few years back. rome for me was a copy of med 2 with less factions and the world of rome.
which is awesome is it? not for me i felt slow and not enjoing the time i had.
i wanted to quit after the first hour which is not a good thing.
and i hated the fact that it was the one total war game i disliked (not hate)
rome for me sucked and nerver brought anything new to the table.
making a empire was cool and rome is a awesome place to learn how to play TW
but ive played years of it and it just felt to simpile to fast
i found myself not having to change a thing and i could just keep training the same troops and win
AI - look TW's AI is s hit all around and you cant stop that from happening 
but of course ai was so bad for me.
the best ai in a total war game would have to be napolen or empire (for me)
now this is a 2004 game i cant say that the visual side of this game is amazing because its not.
but for rome and med 2 the artwork amazes me in many ways
and for old games their some of the best in their days.

This is a Total War....
The strategic part in Rome is that without cavalry, you're fucked ;D
This is one of the main rule in the game : make your cavalry move and BUILD A WALL with  your infantry
Because the game is in the antiquity, you can find elephant, chariots and phalanx... very immersive things
The mercenary system is better in Rome than in Medieval II because the mercenaries cost REALLY less money and are really more useful.

In fact, I would probably have gone as far as to say this is the best strategy game at that point in time. It has been a long time since this game's dominant reign and while it is still incredible fun I have grown out of it and no longer wish to play it.

Is the game not good enough? Of course not, it is great. Why did I grow out of it then? I put hundreds of hours into this amazing strategy title and just when I thought I was done I kept going after I found the mod communities online. I eventually grew to love Medieval 2 more because of the better natural balance between factions and other small reasons. Since then, I feel that Rome 2 (slightly modified) is a more enjoyable game overall and I have since replaced Rome from within my library by going to Rome 2 for my 3rd century BC strategy needs.

With all of that being said, this was a pivotal game in the strategy genre and is a classic to behold. This game deserves the respect and praise it has earned over the years and to anyone that hasn't played it, I think you should get it on sale and try it out. While it may be old, it is indeed gold.

Quick warning to TV users: If you play on a TV rather than a computer monitor, the executable for this game will somehow cause the TV to force 24p cinema mode and lock your frame rate to 24 FPS. This causes severe mouse lag and is annoying as all hell. To fix this, you can create a custom resolution such as 1904x1071 (which is 1920x1080 minus 16x9) and run the game that way.

I played as the brutii first, great campaign. Once I had secured Greece I absolutely steamrolled the rest of the map had an easy civil war. That was on normal difficulty.
I played the brutii again on very hard/very hard second turn Macedonia and The Greek Cities ally and declare war on me. They take appolonia from me and then Tarentum. Had no fucking clue, I was only saved at croton by a dumb move by the A.I and a scipii army I dragged into fight for me. Retake appolonia, The Greek Cities take Tarentum while I'm over there so I now only have a village in west Greece. The scipii take Tarentum and croton now they control all of Southern Italy. I then proceeded to get thoroughly raped in defence of Apollonia. Lose campaign. Rage quitted. Went and played Medieval 2 as Denmark and then got raped by the HRE.

[b]Comment:[/b]
I finally bought this game here on Steam so I would have a digital copy of it as my discs are getting really old. This game is worth purchasing because it is a phenomenal RTS game and a must-have part of the Total War series. The graphics have aged but the game still looks decent and let us face it - the game has always been about gameplay first. Multiplayer is fun but the single-player campaign is what this game excels at. A huge map with three roman factions to choose from initially, later each defeated nation is unlocked as playable in the campaign. The gameplay is divided into 3 parts - cities management, sea battles and land battles. The last one is what this game is about and what makes it truly great. All the units, even siege engines, are nicely done and serve a purpose. The fighting is tactical and fair, although sometimes hard. But nothing beats the feeling of  a victory when you are outnumbered 4 to 1, or more! The AI has some problems but that can be forgiven in this case because it does not break the game at all. On top of all this are the mods, the lovely awesome mods. There are so many it would be hard to write all the good ones but MY personal favourites are Europa Babarorum, Lord of the Rings - Total War & Rome Total Realism. Seriously this game is worth your money if you like RTS games so I quite happily recommend it!

- More diversed factions, especially the eastern remnants of Alexander's realm.

- Troops obey imidiatly.
- Troops can use formations and tactis in proper ways. The testudo for example. In Rome 1 they present their shields on three of four sides, very effective. In Rome 2 they present their shield on one side, useless.

I had no idea what the mechanics in the game were, since I didnt speak English.
Fast forward to winter of 2015. I bought the game on a steam sale. Now knowing English, I enjoyed the game even more than I did when I was a kid. From slaughtering Gauls to building up your own cities this game requires strategy, especially with higher difficulty settings.

Pros:
-Lots of different factions to play
-Very good battle system
-Great difficulty settings, you can make it really easy, and really hard for yourself if you wish.

Cons:
-Easily abusable battle mechanics, making the game easy even on the hardest difficulty
-Dumb AI, especially when they attack a settlement of yours
-Some historically inaccuracy

I recommend this game, it's very cheap and well worth it even if you play through it just once.

I believe Rome Total War will always have a loyal fanbase that will constantly find new and improved tactics. Each map is masterfully constructed with amazing attention to detail, for example you can....

-invade towns, cities, and giant citidels
-recreate battles of the past on a massive scale
-Play multiplayer with friends (my favorite style)
-Make a battle of your own
-Quick play for a quick and fun battle
-the campaign (This is unplayed by many, I have never heard someone say, boy, i could go for some Rome Total War campaign)

6,Rome Total War,30200779,english,"[h1]Rome: Total War is pretty cool, I guess. [/h1]

Back in the year 2000, a time when every music group went out of their way to look goofy, a little development studio named Creative Assembly decided to release a strategy game called ""Shogun: Total War."" 
The game mixed grand strategy and real time elements to create what was essentially a perfect formula of kingdom management and army control. The game was pretty successful, and two years later they released ""Medieval: Total War"" in 2002.  The game stepped away from the era of Feudal Japan and instead focused on Medieval Europe, hence the name. 
This game was also a success, and finally, two years later, Creative Assembly released what I personally believe to be their Magnum Opus. 

Rome: Total War was released in 2004, and that rhymes.

Set during a period when killing someone was a lot more difficult because you had to get in pleasant conversation distance of one another. Rome: Total War's campaign begins during the early days of the Roman Republic. Or ""early"", I guess. 
You play as a various number of factions, some being unlockable as you conquer them in game, each one has a unique quality to it that comes into play during the battles. 


Now, I'm going to admit, I spent way too much time playing this game, and I'm probably just going to gush on it. 

""But Dirk you World Champion Hugger."" You start. ""Steam says you only have 15 hours of total play time.""

Well first, shut up, and second: Rome was one of the first PC games I actually bought myself after a long and backbreaking career in pig wrestling. I'm pretty sure I have almost, if not more than 1000 hours all together in this game. Though in those 1000 hours I haven't even played the Alexander expansion, but I heard that's good too. 

Campaign mode is broken into two segments, the campaign map where you control your entire empire, and the battle map where you command an army in combat. In the campaign map you build cities, train armies, make diplomatic agreements with other factions, and call Carthage stinky idiots for not releasing their hold on Sicily this instant. 
When diplomacy does break down, then it's time to get a little violent. Invading enemy territory involves you moving your armies around the campaign map like board game pieces, and having them attack enemy cities or armies. When the battle begins you zoom in to get a command eye view of the battle where you command each unit like a normal strategy game.

Something that Rome and a few other games had that newer games do not is a captain system where, if you don't have a general in an army, it would instead be commanded by a captain within the army. If the Captain can prove himelf in a climatic battle or over the course of a war, then there's a chance that that captain can be promoted to General and actually become a named character.

Generals themselves are fairly unique as well, each of them is named and can be improved or sabotaged independently. With every victory, the general can become a better commander and earn some traits, these traits can be positive or negative. For instant, a general may grow disgusted by war and have no taste for bloodshed, giving his army a morale penality. Or maybe he'll become better at army management and be able to move further each turn. Or maybe he'll just go crazy and talk about how his army will win because they have cooler hats. 

This and added into a pre-battle speech system where your general's speech can change depending on traits, gives the game a very neat little roleplaying element that helps give a narrative to your campaign. When your lords pass away they leave a history that will stick until the end of your campaign.

Commanding your armies in battle is a very easy affair. You can control on unit, or multiple units at once, prepare their formation before the battle, and listen your the general's speech before it all goes down. For 2004, this part of the game was groundbreaking, since it was uncommon to see so many 3D rendered units on screen at once. It still holds up, especially if you put the unit scale to max. 


[h1]But should you play Rome: Total War?[/h1]

Yeah, probably, at least if you're a Total War fan who somehow hasn't played the classics. It's considered one of the best games ever made by people who aren't as great as me, and I would consider it at least in my top 10, if not my top 5. 
There are some problems, enemy campaign AI get sometimes wig out, having things happen like nations ask for an alliance one turn and then declare war the very next, but there are mods that help fix this to an extent. The modding scene is pretty great as well, with Europa Barbarorum and Roma Surrectum coming to mind. 

I would give R:TW my golden seal of approval and say you should pick it up some way. It usually gets really cheap during sales as well. 

Rome: Total War gets 5 overly dramatic speeches out of 5. 

Bananas are curved because they grow towards the sun.

Carthage fields solid infantry and phalanxes that don't quite measure up to what the Romans get, but their elephants make up the difference easily.

The Parthians have such powerful mounted units that it's a legitimate consideration just to leave behind anyone without a horse.

I've even turned all the settings down to low, and the problem still persists. The upshot is that this game is simply drastically unoptimized for modern hardware and operating systems.

38,Rome Total War,29835376,english,"Ignore the hours logged on Steam, I had this game way back when I had an Acer 7540G with a busted heat sink. Put countless hours into fowarding agressive Roman foreign policy!

Rome TW is still, in my humble opinion, one of the best TW games I've played. I Do enjoy Shogun 2 and Empire but maybe it was because it was my first TW, I dunno, Rome just has it for me. 

The three campaign factions are intersting and offer good variety in terms of where you start within the Italian peninsular and how that dictates your courses of action; Julii starting in the North where most players are likely to move to conquer west - Gaul - and move north into Germania and Britain. Then likely south into Spain. Fighting a very land dominated advance. 

Players who chose to lead the Brutii familiy will face primarily Greece and very sea based advances pushing east to Greek shores and pushing north into Dacia before the Julii get there. Claiming lands in Galatia (Turkey) and moving into Egypt and the Middle East. Facing the Greek hoplites is no easy task so good battle tactics are needed as these spearmen make short work of footsoldier and cavalry alike. 

Finally the Scipii family starting with lands in Capua south of Rome and a foothold in Sicily. Shrewd players will use the fact that their eastern and northern borders are rendered safe by other Roman, and therefore allied, forces to push hard west and south into Sardinia, Mauritania and Numidia where the Carthageans will put up a challenging resistance with their huge war elephants. Mixing naval and land based strategy.

Rome TW has it all as far as I'm concerned. It has a great campaign map system where each individual settlement can be managed in terms of build policies and taxes so that issues in a particlar place can be dealt with without affecting other settlements. Game progressions is well graduated and the tech trees are historically accruate (for the most part) and offer much reward for pushing your slice of the Roman empire to sucess. You'll need this as the culmination of the campaign is challengin Rome itself for power and facing down the mighty SPQR - though by this juncture you too will also be feilding the best troops your denari can buy. 

With a campaign map that stretches right across Europe and into the Middle East there are a myriad of options open to a player and this is something that makes Rome TW so good; no paythrough is the same unless you make it so. The factions are well thought out and the whole feeling of the game is done exceptionally well and for the most part is logical an intuitive. The only things lacking is the diplomacy from what I've encountered which is quite basic on most counts so it's hard to really 'reason' with the AI in order to advance less agressively. 

Depsite its age it stands a monument to strategy games and a lesson too, combining turn-based and real-time into one well proportioned package. It does show its age in the graphical fidelity of course but it is by no means bad and in this type of game is far less notceable of course. Some of the controls are a little counterintuitive in terms of controlling the camera in the battles but it's not something you won't get used to. 

If you love startegy games then Rome TW should be in your library. Its that simple. Veni vidi vici!!

50,Rome Total War,29603716,english,"This is one of the two total war games that I can with honesty recommend. This game has aged very well and continues to be one of the best total war games. 

This game has one great flaw which is the horrible AI. Slightly clunky controls and a slightly clunky camera can be forgiven but not the horrid AI which fails to even follow the most simple of instructions. Moving your unit through a gate can be impossible and the most common cause of losses is a result of terrible AI. Skirmishers that engage in melee combat despite being told to skirmish. Cavalry units charging when told to move a couple of paces to the side. Infantry unable to encircle the enemy without being constantly forced to move. Pathfinding and how the AI sometimes decides to fight losing battles makes the game greatly annoying.

Graphics are horrible and the game is rather difficult to get running properly. Crashing is common and bugs are not unheard of.

Even though the game has these flaws it truly shines when things work. Your troops have to be commanded and micromanaged in order to work properly. When formations clash against each other one might get pushed back or encircled if lucky. Small pockets of troops attempt to break the formation and morale can turn the tide of a battle. Good commanders can win against a massive enemy force if they know when and where to strike. Economy has to be managed and units are not all the same. Wars can vary in difficulty depending on player skill and enemy power but generally you'll have one or two battles that decide the outcome of the war. Constantly harrasing your beaten enemies to wittle down their numbers is vital in order to win. The player must learn how to fight different units on different soils as the terrain varies greatly. Missile units may work well against a wall of spears but when your enemy is on horse you might want some cavalry. Perhaps the terrain is too rough for cavalry formations to be effective and has to be compensated for!

 My Barbarian invasion story:
I started as the Burgundii and decided to become a pirate by building 200 boats and decided to form a horde. I send my King and his sons on the boats and set sail for a life as a pirate. First i raid Denmark then set sail and raided York. Raids the coasts of france, found the Roman Emperor in a costal town on the west coast of france, i then perceed to raid it and thus killing the emperor. I then raid the coast of spain, i then headed  to Morrocco but they decided to send reinforcements to the city i was raiding, therefore decided to go back to the ships and carry on too Carthage. The Romans, clearly not forgeting my regiced decided to send a huge reinforcement of ships and attacked killing the king and his borthers. But all  hope was not lost, by some meraculous chance (probably a glitch due to his two son maturing on board the ship while it was attacked) the king must have sent his 16 year old sons on a ship to escape the battle, and must have got ship recked off the coast of Mauritania and traveled to western Algeria. While travelling through the desert his name must have ment much in the area as hundreds of local mercenairies flocked to his side. He also gained great knowlage of philosophy and his brother converted to Christianity and became deeply interested in theology. After about a decade of travelling they converged on the wooden walled city in the middle of an oasis in the Sahara. The city contained the crown prince of the berbers and wasnt going to give it up easily, and thus he was defeated by the narrowest of margins, but  out of the some respect he let the two princes go so they decided to head east and found a small poor city in modern day Libya. The recent economic crisis had taken hold despite rapid modernisation they decided to leave. The Christian prince decided he wanted too go to the holy land to settle and free from Roman tyranny, his pagan brother agreed and they set sail for Jerusalem. they stopped off at crete which they promptly freed from the Romans and started to modernise a great fleet to get too Jerusalem, however when they set sail again they where intercepted by a roman fleet which won a narrow victory agianst him were he was then killed. Though the philospher princes had with no hair, word must have spread and a new Bergundii warlord, that had prevoiusly parted with the king when the king decided to become a pirate, had heard of the legendry philosphers and their wish, so he and the remnents of the Burgundii army attacked constaninople and used it to cross to Anatolia where they went down a coast route evading roman forces. from a secret path shown too them by a local spy they had managed to besige Jerusalem, they had won as the city wasnt properly gaurded and they managed to settle Jerusalem. After 6 mounths (1 turn) after the conquest of Jerusalem, the warlord had died of the plague and once agian with no heir the royality of the Burgundii had fallen. The end.

56,Rome Total War,29450707,english,"I had played this game before picking it up on Steam and in the end I decided to do it through here as well, as I kinda miss it, I only had the base game, and it was stupidly cheap. As I usually do, I'm gonna start sharing what the game does wrong, then going up from there.

First and foremost, one of the worst parts of the game has to be the auto-battle option. You see, you'll be doing tons of big battles here, and if you feel like you don't need to oversee this one, you can just let the AI do it for you. However it seems the auto-battle AI is as brain-dead as Trump. I've lost quite a lot of battles because I had a ton of crap to fight and didn't wanna spend an hour doing them all properly. The last one being over 2k of my troops against 200 rebel peasants. F#CKING PEASANTS. AND MY TROOPS WERE HIGH TIER, WITH SIEGE UNITS AND EVERYTHING. HOW THE F#CK DID THAT HAPPEN!? It will make your playthroughs stupidly long, but I seriously advice you to not use that feature at all.

Second is something I'm still not a big fan of. At the start you only have three factions to choose, the three big families of rome (not counting the Senate). However there's a f#ckload of factions, to unlock them you must be the one taking their last area on the map. Why? Why not, for example, certain factions unlocking others at the end of a long game? This way you might unlock a few of them in one game, most likely the ones you don't really want, and will have to restart anew with a faction that's closest to the one you do like, putting yourself through with a faction you don't want. 

Lastly, I feel like archers are a bit too powerful at times. Sure, heavy troops can tank those arrows and horse units can just sprint to them and whoop their asses, but then we got archers on horses and the whole balance f#cks itself. Elephants are also somewhat powerful since the auto-balance system doesn't seem to understand what the f#ck they do and usually win insane battles.

That being said, this is a really cool strategy game that still stands strong after all these years that will give you hours and hours of fun for a really low price.

The thing I like the most, strangely enough, is the realism and history stuff on it. It's actually kinda fun to sometimes stop and read all of the stuff the game has to tell you about troops, buildings and such. If you actually don't know much about the roman times, you'll learn a lot in here.

The strategy itself is also really cool. It's not one of those ""send all of your troops against them blindly"" kind of games. The game is surprisingly deep and there's tons of cool tactics you can use to win even the most harsh fights.

The amount of factions is also impressive for the time the game came off. There's like f#cking 40 or so, from all of those there HAS to be at least ONE you like. 

Also, as dumb as it might sound, the dialogue from the captains before the fights are so well written, I can't help but to stop and listen to them constantly. Seriously, they had a blast with those.

Honestly, if you want Shogun 2 but you can't affort it, this is a really good alternative. On a sale it costs like 1 or 2€ and it's completely worth it. Though if you do have the money, I'd say give Shogun 2 a try instead.

Step one: Start a new game playing as the Romans, doesn't matter the family.
Step two: Decide how fast you want to get going by using cheats or not, usually depends onthe mood I'm in.
Step three: Create an unstoppable army, or two, or 20, depends how fast you want the world to tremble at your feet.
Step four: Send forth your armies into the lands of the barbarians, take their cities and sack them, burn them down, kill them all.
Step five: Once the barbarians have been eradicated completely from the map, head for Greece, the home of the intelects.
Step six: Send your armies to enslave the Greek peoples, beat them off their high horses and kill them slowly and painfully.
Step seven: Once Greece has been pacified sucsessfuly, wait till you have a plauge in one of your cities, you will soon see why.
Step eight: once you do have a plauge in one of your cities, get unimprtant agents like diplomats there, keep them for a bit, them send them to the south, in places like Memphis, Alexandria, or Carthage, large cities.
Step nine: watch as thousands die from your own little biological terrorist attack, take it in.

86,Rome Total War,29056529,english,"I wanted this game when it first came out, but didn't have the hardware nor funds to do so.

Years later, I finally managed to acquire it, and I was not disappointed. To this day, this is still a decent game.

The game is half civilization builder, half tactical battle simulator.
You manage a faction, which includes cities and armies. Build up your cities for bonuses and to unlock better units. Guard your territory and expand it with your mighty armies.

I love the tactical battles in this game. There's been some moments where I wasn't sure if I could win, and only through superior tactics and maneuvering could I maintain some sort of victory. Also, there's been battles I've played perfectly, where I've taken out armies two or three times my size.

Don't get me wrong, the AI doesn't suck. If you try to just throw your troops at the enemy, you'll be in for a rude awakening. 

Also, be aware, this is not a short game (although there is alternate game modes if you're short on time and just need a quick fix). A campaign will take many hours to complete, spanning several days of gameplay.

Who should buy this game? People who like civilization games, sure, but more importantly, those who love tactical battles where the battle is won more by brain power than sheer might. Also, those interested in long campaigns... Rome wasn't built in a day, and it won't be conquered in one either.

Who shouldn't buy this game? RTS players who tend to just build up bases and overwhelm their opponents with sheer numbers. It is a possible way to play, but it wouldn't be an easy trip. Also, anyone who may just be a casual gamer should probably avoid this series.

Anyway, I also recommend an article linked on the Rome:Total War news page, about the best and worst Total War games. It was a good read, and help me to decide which Total War to buy next (I'm going to download it as soon as my monthly internet bill rolls over).

All in all, this may not be the *best* Total War game (idk, haven't played any others, yet), but it is very good in its own right, and its easy to see how it launched such a successful series of games. This one is definitely good, but I also recommend that you do a little research and see which Total War may be most to your liking before purchase, as they're all a little different (so I've read).",1483698569,1483698569,TRUE,2,0,0.523809552,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,195,21,1864,0,1663,1482390277

89,Rome Total War,26917320,english,"[Note that my hours on record are very inaccurate]

Rome: Total War is a superb game, and remains very fun to play even 12 years after release. It was the first of two Total War games to use this engine (called simply TW Engine 2 by Wikipedia), and while its successor had more complex strategic layers, more unit variety, and better tactical battlefields, it somehow lacked the charm of this one, in my opinion. Each faction plays very differently, having access to different unit types and requiring dramatically different strategies, which results in every playthrough feeling like its own epic story. Sure, the game has its inaccuracies, quirks and problems (save often; don't rely on alliances which you aren't paying for; and study your units in battle, as many of them require a little extra micromanagement than they should), but you'll forget about all that the first time one of your onagers takes out an enemy seige tower that was nearly ready to spew a hundred angry Macedonians onto your walls; or the first time an elephant runs amok through a pitched battle, tossing dozens of men aside or trampling them underfoot; or the first time your General's bodyguard makes a desperate final charge into the enemy's rear and actually turns the tide of battle.

To make this game even better, it has a large and dedicated fanbase, which has been producing mods of incredible scope and scale. Projects such as [i]Rome: Total Realism[/i] and [i]Europa Barbarorum[/i] can give you what feels like a whole new game at no cost. It should be noted, however, that most mods require game version 1.5, which is available only through the expansion game [i] Rome: Total War - Alexander [/i].

 Unlike the most recent titles with the terrible battle animations, in Rome 1 if a soldier is surrounded by 5 enemy soldiers all of them will stab him untill his hitpoints reach 0 and he dies, instead of playing a battle animation with every single one of them while the others look and wait.

51,Rome Total War,28191315,english,"My biggest 2 issues with this game:

Campaign: Holding large territories is virtually impossible due to unrest, I guess that is historically accurate (even on easy), but counter-intuitive to your objectives.

Battles: Unit and camera control are both a disaster. Why they decided against a traditional RTS camera (even though there is an RTS camera option in the game) is beyond me. Moving the mouse to the sides rotates the camera instead of scrolling the map...same goes for the arrow keys. Units themselves are hard to control and rarely do what you tell them to. Want your cavalry to attack a certain squad from behind? Well, first you have manually move them to avoid all other enemies in sight and then they may still attack the wrong enemy. Battles frequently look like masses of pixels trying to get to the enemy, but the game engine doesn't allow that.

A good example of how to do it right would be Dawn of War. Here units first engage in ranged combat, but when they are forced into melee they are actively looking for a direct opponent instead of creating 2 big masses of armies that patiently wait until the front line disintegrates. You can micro manage some of that, but honestly, it's really annoying and just lazy in my opinion.

[u]Just another overly subjective personal opinion[/u] [i]FIRST DRAFT[/i]

Sadly I cannot offer anything that represents even a small fraction of an objective, highly professional review, thanks to the lack of my competence. What I got is only my subjective little opinion crafted by my experiences with this amazing game, which I see as a significant pillar and a spectacular peak, not only of the Total War series, but of the strategy genre as well.  

I started to play with the Total War series with the first Shogun: Total War back in the early 2000's. I still have the physical copy of that great game in my drawer, next to Medieval: Total War with the Viking Invasion Expansion, and Medieval II: Total War + Kingdoms. As a kid who played a lot with turn-based strategy games like the first 2 Civilization, and Heroes of Might and Magic 2-3 (yes, I am an old fart), i was fascinated by the system and the era Shogun could offer. I was captured by the whole notion of empire building and expansion, and while I respected the whole battle-simulation aspect (which I played for hours back then), I realized that I was much more impressed by the campaign map, with its diplomacy, economy system, constructions, army building, etc. After Shogun I played a lot with Medieval Total War, which became my favorite thanks to its theme, and then for some particular reason, i did not try out Rome. I was not really interested in the ancient era, and jumped right to Medieval II. It was overwhelmingly superior to the two games I played before, and for a short period of time, I thought that Medieval II brought these improvements into the series. But I was wrong. It was Rome.

I borrowed a physical copy of Rome: Total War in 2007 and realized how huge leap this game took from its predecessors in almost every aspect of the game. From the map which changed the whole one province = one army slot type to a more dynamic one with much more attention to positions and maneuverability, the engaging senate system with its authentic theme and quests, till the improved and much more detailed dynasty and family-tree building with an original ruler and general traits system, this game assembled a lot of great ideas, that not only gave it more soul and meat than the previous games, but it also made me identify with certain problem-solving and task performance situations much more effectively. 

I bought my own physical copy of Rome in the same year, but it did not live long. In 2009, after tons of gameplay hours, it gave up the good fight. 

After playing Rome, I went back to Medieval II, I bought Empire, and also Shogun 2, but I stopped trying out the latest entries of the series. I realized, that none of these games were able to eclipse the glory of Rome. Yes, they added new themes, some new mechanics, new graphics, changed some features, but the core mechanics are still those that was established in Rome Total War, and personally I only see them as bigger, brighter, louder echoes of the same old system, which still keeps its head up high. It may look ancient to some, but this well-crafted piece of gaming is not even close to become outdated.",1480378313,1480380763,TRUE,3,1,0.560000002,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,195,5,155,0,155,1457914050

66,Rome Total War,27990268,english,"I was looking for new strategy games, and I didn't find any that would match the simple, straight forward, but always replay-worthy quality of Rome:TW.

Of course, it is outdated now. Of course Rome II for instance has much nicer graphics. Of course, Rome:TW has its flaws.

What the newer games all lack is the concentrated energy of this old style game. They give you bling bling, but then they limit your playing experience because the devs want to shape the way you play a game, instead of presenting the player with opportunities.

I'll give you a - limited - example, just to show the main point, I could go into detail in many respects, but here's one that should show what I mean in principle. 

In Rome:TW, you could march an army without a general into hostile territory. Or you could scale walls with a single infantry unit - it's your choice (and your troops' funeral, perhaps). In Rome II, you are forced to recruit a general. You must replenish resources, even if you would like to get an advantage by sacrificing some units. You cannot win a game based on skill and creative tactics, but only by playing by the book. But the game will throw an achievement your way in exchange for freedom...

I miss old style games like some old software, that did exactly what it was supposed to do and nothing else.

It was really magical. Sadly the disk version is not working in windows 10, and on my older computer it really lags, so I bought it again, but now on steam, for a discount of 50%. On the plus side with Barbarian invasion.

This is, in my opinion, the best total war game. Some may say it is not really historical, as you have factions like ""the Gauls"" and ""Germania"", while in reality they were countless tribes. True, but I never minded it. I always made my own stories. And that is the magic I think. You should create your own stories, like a king that unites the Dacian tribes and invades Greece, etc. You shouldn't play this game just for gameplay. No. Because you want to create your own stories and love the era. 

Everything is great, well, almost everything then. The campaign is fun, the battles are. You want to play as every faction, try everything out, etc. However, the Romans ofcourse are the best. You have the Senate, missions for them etc. Eventually you will get a pop up saying that the people want you to invade Rome and be their leader, so you can have a civil war! 

The few downsides are maybe the squalor problem, which will be rampant in the mid to late game, and sometimes breaks the fun, or the sporadic fps killers on modern computers. But I think they are neglectable. There are also tons of mods, but I have never tried one, I like the vanilla version.

Great game, it is cheap nowadays (especcially during steam sales), plus you get Barbarian invasion, which moves the whole atmosphere to the end of the Roman Empire, and with religion, tribe migrations, etc. although I haven't tried it yet.

17,Rome Total War,9184401,english,"Hello my dear readers,

TL;DR: This review heavily recommends you playing this game.

Longer version:

I played this game a couple of hours. It's hella fun and even the game files are easily modified to get some more factions and whatnot. The graphics are a little bit shitty, but that's not the whole game, right?
So there are some things you think you need to worry about, but you actually don't need to:

1. You think it's hard.
It's very beginner friendly. Actually too beginner friendly. The advisor starts to annoy you after a couple of hours playtime.
2. Your computer can't run it.
C'mon, what is your PC? Wooden?
3. You might tilt after lost battles.
You can always use quicksave.

In the following I will elaborate a bit more about specific areas:

Graphics: Shit, just as I said. But as a consequence makes it playable for almost everyone. Taking the release date into consideration, I'll give it a solid 6/10 (w/out release date 3/10)

Gameplay: It's an open world strategy game. Except for when you play roman factions, no one gives a shit what you're doing. Every campain is unique, every move is new, every battle is nowhere near a duplicate. Even if you are playing the historic battles, there are multiple ways to beat them. I'd say 10/10, I can't name any flaws whatsoever.

Music: The music is a kind of dorian-pythagorean-archaic style, which fits the game. Personally I don't really like this kind of music, but if you are familiar with music notation, history of scales and history of music in general, then you appreciate the music more. During the battles, the music changes to a mix of contemporary styles and this archaic style. In my opinion it really fits the mood of the game all the time. I could give it a 10, but I personally don't like it that much, so I'll give it an 8/10.

Genre: This game and its ancestors have defined the real time strategy/round based strategy hybrid genre. RTW is maybe the most iconic game, because it is so popular amongst all sorts of players: casual to hardcore. Genres listed describe it perfectly: 10/10.

Now, to some extent, we must go and face the truth: This game has its flaws. It has transcended numbers in quantifying how many bugs this has. Nevertheless This game has always kept me awake at night and I still like it.

Overall (averages): 8.5/10


PS.: I only have 80 hours, because I bought it through steam after I bought the CD, but I lost it (you need to have it in your drive). I would've had over 400 hours, no exaggeration.",1392842754,1480105435,TRUE,2,0,0.547325075,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,126,13,6497,0,4847,1582382259

Since this game I have bought almost all other TW titles afterwards, and despite the downfalls of DLC becoming more prominent, I have enjoyed each new TW installment more and more.

But the one TW game I have, and always will go back to, is this. I would say its aged modestly well, but graphics have never been important to me. The hardest campaign difficulty is brutal and I always seem to go bankrupt within 20 turns!

This game pits you as one of the three Ancient Roman families against the world, destined to conquer and divide and while only the three initial Roman families are avaliable at the start, if you completely conquer certain nations, you can unlock those too for the Grand Campaign.

What makes this game great is the amount of randomness and innate customazable characters that give this game personality. Through the family tree you will gain members and depending on how you use (or not) them, they can become crazy warmongers or glorious leaders, a depth Creative Assembly never truly tried to recreate after Medieval Total War 2. You will care (or hate) these characters as their personalities shine during their grand speeches before your army clashes with the enemy.

I recommend you this game, not for its combat and action, but for its personality and charm.

15,Rome Total War,26679043,english,"In my opinion, this is still the best Total War game to date.

Rome's got good combat, decent unit roosters for different cultures, good siege mechanics & decent city ""building/development"". You can also build forts & watch towers on the strategic map.

Rome was made before the switch to the new engine, which means that each individual unit actually fight on an individual level, trying to hit enemies & block incoming attacks, instead of the crazy 1v1 kill-animation system. This have a major effect on how battles turn out & how they're conducted. If you got more units of similar skill & situation, they tend to do a fair bit better, instead of it just being a battle of attrition. Projectiles are fairly strong, but as far as I can tell, don't home-in on targets & ready, large shields greatly negate their effectiveness.

I should mention that the music is the best in this title by a land-slide, it's always fitting & it's always get's you in the right mood for the situation.

The one thing you may miss in this if you're used to the later titles is the naval combat, it's automated in Rome. Also, the graphics are very dated. Camera controls are janky & visual feedback is poor compared to later titles.

Compared to the other Total War titles, there's only 3 other games that even come close to being as good as this one: Shogun 2, Medieval 2 & Empire(after milions of patches). I haven't played enough Warhammer to tell how it hold's up yet, but it looks promising.

OBS!
You may get random crashes to desktop if you buy it through steam, unless you go to the main folder, select everything, put it in a new folder within the main folder & then check integrity of the game & let it re-download everything.

To call the AI stupid is an insult to the very concept of stupidity. It fights battles well enough, but simply cannot handle the campaign map, which means it rarely has any troops to bring to the battle. Even heavy doses of cheating cant help this guy. Wheatly would be better.

Diplomacy is an incredible pain in the neck. You cannot just summon a rival to a meeting; you must train a Diplomant, have him physically walk across the map; and then suggest a trade, which the AI will disagree to.

There is only one starting faction: Rome. To play as anyone else you must complete the campaign... which grows boring long before your even close to done.

If your looking to get into Total War (which is a very good idea) I would reccomomend Shogun 2, Attila, or Warhammer. If you want to see what the series is all about without breaking the bank, grab the original Shogun. It utilizes a Risk style map that makes life for the AI much, much better.

Pros:
_____
-A real feeling of being a general!
-Easy to control armies (for the most part)
-Large battles that run well (because it is old)
-Intense last stand and to the tooth victory moments!
-Cool pre-battle speeches
-Challenging but fun story
-Many Armies to choose from (plus the dlc having its own armies)
-Nice looking Artillery and archer animations and projectiles

Cons:
_____
-Can be a resource hog with too many units on screen
-Frame rate drops when more than 10,000 units on the field
-Not that good of graphics
-Sometimes armies will run/flee for no reason
-Generals die too quickly

All around i give it an 8/10 when you can run it at its max and is a definite buy with it only being $10!!! it comes with a ""Barbarian Invasion"" DLC which gives you around 15 more armies and even more fun to have when in custom battles!

However, keep note of a few annoying things:

-Path finding for units can be very lousy sometimes, and there are some glitches routing as well. If a unit is defending the walls in a siege battle and they panic and route, they don't actually route for real. They just stand around idle all the time until someone kills them all off. 

-The AI, no matter how much of an effort you make, can be incredibly stupid at times. This is a trait common in all of the Total War games, but it shouldn't be too awful except for siege battles.

59,Rome Total War,25979457,english,"I love this game. That said, the tendency to crash before or after(which is much worse) battles, is fairly annoying. Wuhu! I just spectacularly annihilated an army, killing the king, taking the Capitol, winning the game...CRASH! At least when it has the decency to do it on the loading screen pre-battle you don't want to smash your computer.
 Would be nice to play all factions, but i hear there's a way to do that. Overall I like Seleucia or the Scipii best, Brutii next. Gauls have good shrines, too. If Seleucia could only make the Nike & Artemis shrines as well as their Hephaestus 1 they'd be invincible.

 Plus, I  LOVE all the cheats; never play without the money cheat or the fog 1. Making all the buildings at once also cuts down on excrutiating waiting for stuff to be built, wish I could get the troop cheats besides oliphaunt to work.(though the oliphaunts are cool) Yes , I'm a lazy control freak who'd play every game in god mode if possible, so I like as many cheats as I can get. I wish I could control all factions like on Medieval TW. Really, it's less like playing as king of an empire as the benevolent god that makes his chosen people totally wealthy & OP. My subjects are happy because they have low taxes & all the buildings in their city instantly built.(most of my governers have""the builder"" in their name.) I don't feel even remotely bad for cheating because the game does it all the time. I've had enemy cites down to 25/30% loyalty & they wouldn't rebel: it jumps to 100 randomly(with 4 high lvl spies & a smashed temple in it,1unit). Meanwhile, your citii rebel at 70%, with a full garrison.

 My other favorite thing in the game is the assassinations. Nothing beats winning the game by whacking the enemy heirs & king. Plus it's cool getting""the killer"" after your king's name. I've whacked many whole factions out of existence without ever going to war, with trade treaties the whole time.

 One thing I dislike about Barbarian Invasion is I can't use my sleazy go-to tactic of buying off the other 1/2 of the Empire's generals/troops/cities. ""ooo a 5-star general w/ a full stack...sure would be fun to make him turn on his own cities & butcher the inhabitants thereof."" I once bought Corinth off Macedonia as the Brutii to get the Zeus shrine. The senate wasn't pleased cuz it wasn't on their orders, but the people loved me. I bought a Gaul gen when I was Brutii, he sat in the capitol getting ancilliaries 'til he was 50 & I had an army for him, he then stomped all of Greece, took Halicarnassus, Rhodes, then Crete & finally Messina. He was 6 star, 9 when fighting in any situation. He became Praetor. I made him heir because he earned it, not to mention being way better than any of the family. Only the faction leader was his equivalent, but he'd fought as many battles & was Pontifex Maximus.

 What's the game like without all the cheats? Painfully slow & unplayable by my standards. Bankrupt & running a deficit within a couple of years, getting your butt whupped by ai that doesn't seem to be have a cashflow problem, they just contiunously build their cities & have huge army stacks everywhere.Mind you , I play on easy; I can't imagine what they think hard is. I've found many game devs equate easy with impossible. I think it means impossible to lose.(like when cheating heavily) I'm powerless enough in real life, when gaming, at least against ai, I want to be omnipotent. Losing's no fun, & I find it deeply satisfying to have no casualties in a battle where I annihilate the other army. I just want to crush my enemies, see them driven before me ,& hear the lamentation of the women, beacause that's what's best.

64,Rome Total War,25837920,english,"Hello, Lets get straight to the point, Rome: Total War is a RTS game, Althought when you look at it you say, ""I think this is what my grandpa played."" you are Wrong! RTW is one of the best strategy games out there, don't let its age and graphics trick you that this is a bad game. If you are new to Total War games this is a game to get you started. RTW take reletively low disk space (2-3 GB) and is amazing at almost every aspact it has. True you might say how is this different from Total War Rome II. This game is easy and you get a good idea on what TW games are based on. This is one of the oldest RTW's but I would call it one of the best. From units to strategies, this game is amazing at simulating a battle, physics are amazing and anything you do changes the world around you. So if you want to play as a roman and expand the wast territories of the SPQR, Become the supreme ruler of the Roman Empire or destroy the romans and erase them from history. This is a game for you.

Overall I would say I give this game 8/10 for being absolutely amazing. I really want to give it 9/10 but since it is old and Rome II or TW Attila is more modern, lets stick to 8/10

72,Rome Total War,25615862,english,"WARNING FOR WINDOWS 10 USERS AND POSSIBLE OTHERS: The game got a post-Gamespy update that will cause the game to do all kinds of crazy display stuff and crash. What you need to do is turn off anti-aliasing by default by going into the game's installation folder, preferences folder, then preferences file and make sure AA_QUALITY says AA_QUALITY:AA_ OFF. This should let you launch the game. If you wish to turn on AA from there, you can do so in NVIDIA Control Panel or any other equivalent program, as turning it back on in the menus will cause it to crash again.

IF YOU GET REALLY BAD FRAMERATES AND LAGGY INPUT NO MATTER YOUR SPECS: Right-click the game in your library, click properties, then click Set Launch Options. In the text box, type the three characters ""-ne"" without the quotes and press okay. This should fix that problem for most people out there.

With that done, I'd like to say that although this game is a bit primitive compared to modern TW games, it still can be a very fun game.  

Pros:

-The Campaign map is very no frills compared to modern TW games. You can build any building in any city, public disorder is easy to maintain, and it just lacks feature bloat of later games. The game is all about the battles, something I'd wish would come back after games like Attila.

- The battles can look and play better than modern TW games in some ways. Losing units will actually be beaten back and enveloped by superior forces, soldiers will respond to orders at different times, and the engagements can have some real clash and weight to them. 

-There's actually strategy to the strategy map. I wasn't a huge fan of M2/Empire/Napoleon/Attila's maps because they tended to have lots of wide open plains, while Rome 1+2 and Shogun 2 had lots of limiting terrain features where you could create chokepoints and use terrain like mountains and rivers to your advantage.

Cons:

-Battles can be over a little too quickly. I kind of get whiplash at how fast I go from marching, to melee, to routing an enemy army.

-The flipside to things like independent unit movement is that response can be sluggish, sometimes often so bad that I can't tell if the game knows if I ordered them to do anything.

-Pathfinding can be garbage sometimes, especially in cities.

-You can still get cascade moments where your empire is powerful enough that you're just auto-resolving your way across large swaths of the map at some points.

Overall, I was surprised by how much I enjoyed the game despite not playing it since roughly around its launch.

79,Rome Total War,25482645,english,"Rome: Total War is the third Total War game from England's Creative Assembly, and, to make a long story short, it's the best one yet. It was naturally expected to build on its illustrious predecessors, which featured epic-scale real-time battles and impressive attention to historical realism and detail. Shogun: Total War was a promising start for the series, while Medieval: Total War built on that promise to create an even more engrossing strategy game. With Rome: Total War, Creative Assembly takes the next step, and it's as much a revolutionary step as it is an evolutionary one, thanks to a beautiful new 3D graphics engine that makes the series' tactical battles--featuring thousands of soldiers--better than ever. The results are nothing short of spectacular, helping make Rome: Total War the very definition of an epic strategy game.


Where do you want to go today? The ancient world beckons, if you're brave enough to take it on.
As in the earlier Total War games, there are essentially two distinctly different types of gameplay in Rome. There's the overarching turn-based campaign in which you conquer cities and provinces, make improvements, and move armies around the map as you expand your empire, and then there are the real-time battles in which you use tactics and maneuvers to crush your enemy in combat. After the helpful and informative tutorial campaign, you can tackle the main imperial campaign. You play as one of three powerful Roman families--the Julii, the Bruti, or the Scipii--attempting to increase the size and glory of Rome and shore up your faction's power and influence. As all three factions are Roman, there's literally no difference between them in terms of units and building types, though they do have different responsibilities. The Julii must deal with the Gauls and Germania to the north in a difficult, landlocked campaign. The Bruti are required to deal with the remnants of the Greek city-states and expand the empire to the southeast. And the Scipii are tasked with subduing Carthage, Rome's great nemesis to the southwest.


At least, that's the principle goal of each faction. But there's a fourth, unplayable Roman faction, one that can influence your course during the campaign: the Roman senate. The senate will order you on missions, from blockading a hostile port or conquering a city (and perhaps exterminating the populace, depending on the level of enmity between Rome and the faction in question) to forging a trade deal or an alliance with a foreign faction. It's up to you whether you actually obey the order, as sometimes the senate will try to stretch you thin on purpose. If you carry the orders out successfully, you stand to gain a monetary reward, a useful new military unit, or influence in the senate. Failing to carry out missions earns the displeasure of the senate and affects your standing with that body. By and large, though, the senate missions help to focus the otherwise huge scope of the campaign--instead of being faced with the monolithic task of trying to conquer Europe, you can instead look forward to accomplishing a long series of short-term goals.

It's helpful to perform senate missions because they can affect an improved feature in Rome: Total War--families. Each of the three Roman factions is essentially one huge family, and your generals and governors are related to one another by birth, marriage, or adoption. These are the leaders of your faction, and they all have traits--strengths and weaknesses--that define their abilities. A strong general may have an excellent command rating, but his disdain for bureaucracy would make him a poor governor. Meanwhile, an otherwise strong governor may have a dislike of farming, which would affect the agricultural output in the province he's in. But if your family members are selected to hold important senate posts, they'll gain influence and abilities once out of office. This introduces a limited role-playing component in the game, as you actually care about trying to further the careers of your family members so they can serve you better.

In addition to traits, family members--not to mention your spies, assassins, and diplomats--can all attract retinues. These are the hangers-on who surround important people, such as advisors, mentors, bodyguards, lackeys, sycophants, and more. Each of these can affect your characters' abilities. For example, a wrestler can improve a character's influence (by being able to literally twist arms), as well as provide added protection against an assassination attempt. You can actually collect and trade retinue members among your family, so you can transfer them to where they're needed the most.


You'll draw your faction's leaders from the family tree. Make sure not to kill off your heirs in battle.
Families are also critical because only family members can serve as generals. You can assemble armies without a general, but they'll be poorly led and will likely fare badly in battle. But with a general, the army's fortune can change. A general with a high command ability is a powerful force in battle, as a well-led smaller force can defeat a poorly led larger force most of the time. On the other hand, the fact that generals are drawn from the ruling family can be dangerous, because you need to make sure there are future generations of leaders and generals. A disastrous battle can wipe out whole branches of the family tree, cutting down promising young sons before they can sire heirs. This can have a crippling effect later on in the campaign, when you find yourself short of qualified generals and governors with a huge empire to manage. It makes for an excellent incentive to try and preserve your generals, rather than treat them as easily replaceable fodder.

Thankfully, when you're short of governors, your cities will be taken over by the ""automanager,"" which is represented by an appointed official who runs the city in your name. You can give the automanager certain priorities, such as to follow a military or financial policy, and it will go about constructing the building and units required. (You can also turn on the automanage functionality in cities that do have governors, if you don't want to micromanage at all.) The computer is generally good at doing what you tell it to do, and this should appeal to players who don't want to spend a lot of time on the campaign map. But if you're a fan of grand strategy and want to control every detail, you'll want to make sure you have plenty of family members at your disposal.

You can choose to autogenerate battle results or fight the battles personally. In most cases, it's easier and simpler to autogenerate the smaller fights.
You can choose to autogenerate battle results or fight the battles personally. In most cases, it's easier and simpler to autogenerate the smaller fights.
When you're not busy trying to crush your opponents, you can try to spy on, trade with, and subvert them. The diplomacy system has been completely overhauled since Medieval: Total War, and you now have a lot more options at your command. These include forming alliances, bullying your neighbors into becoming protectorates of Rome, and bargaining for trade rights. You can also dispatch spies and assassins to probe for weaknesses in enemy defenses, or to take out a key enemy general before a crucial battle. And in a nice twist, you can plant spies in your own cities, where they'll help keep unrest in check by acting as a secret police of sorts, rooting out the troublemakers.

General 2: we have the high ground but that won't help much in this battle, how do you plan to win this
General 1: you'll see when the time comes, you will also help in this battle, our spy has shown has the king has brought ranged units and peasants, you'll help keep them distracted while our hasati and velites take out their hoplites, then we'll take the kings head
hasati: Generals, enemies are coming this way!
General 1: Good, everyone in formation!
[i]speaker enters[/i]
speaker: The battle then began, while the king had been focused on the general and the main part of the army, the roman equites and the second generals guard quickily charged around the flanks, weakening the bulk of the greek army, outraged the king ordered his hoplites to hunt them down only for them to be lured away either far away from the battle or into the enemy lines where hasati and velite alike slauther them, finally the king had sent himself into the fray, only for his guard to be slain, injured he tried to flee, only to be chased down and slain by the same equites he was trying to hunt down. seeing their king dead on the ground the greek army was shattered, the romans did not end the battle and continued to hunt them down all the way thermon where they won with what men remained from that battle, this concludes our story of how the king of sparta foolishly threw himself into battle only for it to be his end.

so get this game, I worked hard on this play

If you get too powerful, you'll have to eventually face the envy and paranoia of the Senate, launching a relentless civil war that will threaten everything you have built at that point and will turn the Republic into your personal Empire, but that's the end of the game.

The Good:
Runs stable on low-spec systems and on newer OS, no problem.  I have yet to note a bug other than a single instance of pathfinding stupidity.
The tutorial and interface are both very easy to grasp.  This game is very deep, but also very approachable.
Family lines and member traits that give the game a slight RPG feel.  A coherent and interesting tech tree is present and units are well described.  The sprawling map with many factions vying for power promises an incredible amount of replayability.  Strategic and tactical levels of gameplay are both well polished.  Geography and financial management are constant considerations while playing this game.  Good implementation of spies, diplomats and assassins allows strategies that aren't entirely based on having the better army.  The AI is passable but that might be because it only has to simulate barbarians half the time.

The not good.
The AI consistently misses key opportunities both strategically and tactically.  At times the stupidity can ruin immersion.  Tactical naval combat is not present, all naval battles are auto-resolved.  Thankfully, naval action takes a back seat to the land action and I have yet to see a naval battle autoresolve in an unrealistically illogical fashion - it is pretty predictable.  There is no co-op campaign option or hotseat option.  Last, the graphics.  Even over a decade old, the graphics are still passable, but if you need a little more and eye-candy you to enjoy a game, look elsewhere.  Despite these modest negatives, for the price this game is worth a shot for anyone interested in strategy games and definitely one of the best ""bang for buck"" performers I've seen on Steam.

Summary: 
A classic.  I played Medieval II+Kingdoms prior to playing this.  Almost passed it up in fact because the gameplay is so similar to Medieval II and the graphics are older.  Believe it or not, I am enjoying this game's campaign more.  Perhaps it is the idea of Rome.  Perhaps it is the soundtrack.  Perhaps it is the pre-battle speeches that are missing from MedII+Kingdoms or the sense that Rome's units are more differentiated somehow.  In the Kingdoms expansion especially, it seemed like very little effort was put into making native american factions different from one another.  It is hard for me to put my finger on why, but this game has simply been more enjoyable.  If you want a decent engine that offers outstanding mods, MedII+Kingdoms is the way to go.  I highly recommend both, but ""out of the box,"" I personally prefer Rome.  Score: 8.7/10",1466933854,1467579054,TRUE,1,0,0.500378489,1,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,373,75,1001,0,823,1518399838

87,Rome Total War,23971297,english,"Rome Total War was the first game that I was ever obsessed with, being early in high school when it came out in 2004. I actually first saw the game engine on the History Channel’s show Decisive Battles, which used the game to depict the Battle of Cannae, among others.
The slaughter that can be witnessed and commanded on the RTS battlefield in this game came at a pivotal time, when Lord of the Rings rewrote the book on grand fantasy movies. You saw these huge battles on screen in movies, and now you could command them yourself.
From experience the central mechanics of a game obviously must grab you to hold interest, but I also believe that the little details can be just as important in showing the player how much the developers love their work. Those that struck me in this game were the hilarious descriptions and attributes of the generals, which adds flesh to the polygons you command. 
Here you could find that your general could be a bold Caesar, or an insane Caligula (literally one of the attributes can describe a character as painting his butt blue and running around the palace naked). These attributes can affect what your generals say in their speeches before a battle; I would always make insane generals my frontline commanders, just so I could hear them say ridiculous things before a battle. 
The game is fun, has plenty charm, and an epic soundtrack; still plenty of bugs, but they can be worked around. Try roleplaying your generals in battle, and your faction leader in the campaign map based upon their respective attributes.",1467335418,1467335418,TRUE,1,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,562,3,2085,0,1742,1532132485

Join 2v2 with friend

Friend wants to play as barbarians

I refuse; a true roman would join the legion

We play as rome v barbarians

He brings a balanced force including war machines and skirmishers

I bring a shit ton of legionary cohorts

I also point up a maxed out praetorian cohort; it costs more than 3 legionary cohorts

Is it cost effective? I assume not. Yolo, I bring it anyways

During deployment we start at opposite ends of our side

We accidentally start the battle early; we have not consolidated our forces

The barbarians deploy about 2/3 of their forces opposite me with a blocking force against my teammate

My unsupported legionnaires are being overrun by the barbarian hordes

My teammate is bulldozing through the blocking force opposing him and rushing to my aid

Can I survive long enough?

I decide to commit my reserve - the praetorians - to sacrifice their lives for time

PRAETORIANS, HOLD THE LINE AS LONG AS NECESSARY!

The praetorians are having none of this

They singlehandedly stabilize my line

By the end of the battle over 900 of my 1500 men will be dead. Many others will have retreated

Only 4 of 80 praetorians will die

The literal last act of the battle was the infantry praetorians chasing down a mounted barbarian warlord and chopping him up

I mouse over their status before the battle ends - they have been fighting about 2/3 of the battle, and charging up and down the field. Most of my other units are badly mauled, have low morale, and are exhausted

“eager, warmed up, motivated by presence of general”

ROMA VICTOR

50,Rome Total War,23120000,english,"They may try, but they will never beat Rome: Total War.

Of course, the game is ageing, and with each new Total War iteration struggling to refine the gameplay it was always going to age somewhat badly. The soldiers which at the time seemed technological marvels now look blocky and cartoony, the campaign map looks less vibrant and more modular, the little portraits, banners and such all look unimpressive and much of the interface seems vaguely unresponsibe, low resolution and unattractive.

But they will never beat this game.

What was Rome Total War? Think of cars coming into a world of carts, think of chocolate coming into a world of porridge. People had dreamed of seeing the vast armies portrayed as 2D sprites in the original Shogun: Total War in glorious full 3D, and this game delivered in every way imaginable. The roman cities were sparkling, shining in the sun, the landscapes were the scale of the real world and the armies were, indeed, massive. The formations looked just as good as you always hoped they would, and things like charges had the very, excellent, feeling that we had all imagined.

Not only that, but the game was deep and [i]huge[/i], with hours upon hours of varied gameplay promised, with any faction we wiped out in one playthrough being available to control in the next campaign - something that Empire: Total War really should have allowed. The (strangely Australian) tutorial woman left [i]nothing[/i] to chance, and we never felt out of control, rushed, or under any pressure that was not a direct result of our own actions (all faults that would plague later titles in the series, in my eyes)

The characters were great - real world names popping up here and there, generals increasing in effectivness. Money flowed relatively easily if you were but a little thoughtful about it, and developing more advanced troops was intuitive and straightforward.

In short, this game got everything right. It has just the right mix of gameplay imposition and gamer imposition, input from both sources comign together to create a sandbox empire building experience that could suck you in and satisfied you for tens, hundreds of hours.

Amazing game.",1463848654,1463848654,TRUE,10,2,0.564414501,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,225,43,788,0,767,1567820137

I'd also like to add that all of the Germanic or ""barbarian"" lords and Kings are simply the Gaulish skins.

While making the many new additions to the map, buildings, units and artwork, they have also, quite incredibly, improved gameplay overall! With most mods there are simply new options or abilities, but often the quality of gameplay either stays the same or is sometimes reduced.

22,Rome Total War,22055772,english,"The Roman town of Massilia is under assault from barbarians from Gaul. The Warlord Vindex had brought an army of nearly 3000 warriors, while the general Quintus held the town with 3 hastati with mercenary reinforcements on the way. Vindex began his attack on the town; his army moves up with battering rams to tear down the wooden walls and gate. Quintus and his men hold up near the town center, blocking the narrow streets that lead to it. The mercenary reinforcements have only just begun to arrive on the battlefield and continue to match towards the town. The walls and gate fall and the Gauls begin to flood the town, Vindex stays behind and watches from outside. The Gauls countue to pour into the town and a small group brakes off from the main army. The main army moves down the main road to the town center while the smaller group takes a different road. As the main army gets closer to the town center they are greeted with with volleys of pila fire that shred into the barbarians killing many. The Gauls with their massive army charge into the line of hastati and intense combat fallows. The two units of hastati fight bravely against the Gauls but their numbers are staggering and they slowly push the Romans back. At the same time the smaller army is attacking a seconded point on the road that is less defended but the Romans here are able to hold them. Quintus encourages his men to keep fighting before joining the battle himself to the keep the main army from advancing. As the Romans continue to hold the town center the mercenaries finally arrive to help and see Vindex just outside the walls. Before Vindex can even realize what is happening the mercenaries surround and attack him. Vindex and his body guard fight bravely but are all eventually cut down. The mercenaries quickly move into the town and cut off the Gauls from behind. The Gauls now confused and tired begin to panic and try to pull back but can't as the roads have been blocked. The Romans and mercenaries begin to slaughter the barbarians. When the day was out only 47 men were what remained of Vindex's army. Several months after the battle Quintus would join his father with a massive army to conquer all of Gaul. Quintus would go on to conquer the Iberian Peninsula and revive the title ""The Great"". As for the mercenaries, they disbanded and settled in Massilia. Years latter their descendants  would help form the very backbone of the legion and lead Rome to further glory.

40,Rome Total War,21862992,english,"Still my favourite of all the multitudinous Total War games. Having played the Total War series since CA first came out with Shogun, I have to say Rome was the one that really turned me into a Total War fan through and through. The factions all have their own unique personalities - Rome's heavy focus on infantry; Egypt's swift chariots and devastating archers; the powerful hoplite infantry of the Greek states or the freewheeling Parthian horse archers. The game itself is easy enough for a rank beginner to learn the basics, but challenging enough for even the most grizzled of Total War veterans to take a beating. And even the strongest of factions, when stomping across the map, can suddenly find their full-stack armies reduced to nothing by a well-placed ambush, the point of an assassin's blade, or the treacherous bribes of a high-ranking diplomat...

Overall, Rome Total War immerses you in the Mediterranean world of the last few centuries BCE, lets you take charge of many of antiquity's most celebrated nations, and conquer the known world through a combination of sly negotiation, swift backstabbing and - most importantly - the iron-shod feet of your mighty legions. And that's just the campaign map.

Rome Total War, as all the games in the series are, is a game of two halves. The campaign map is probably the more in-depth and fascinating part of it for me, but there are also the impeccably tuned real-time battles. Your units face off against those of your enemies using a fairly basic rock-paper-scissors arrangement: infantry fight cavalry; cavalry crush archers; archers blitz infantry. Upsetting the balance somewhat are the fearsome Egyptian chariot archers with the speed of cavalry and an even longer range than foot archers; the same can be said of Parthian horse archers, while the Roman legionaries can Testudo in the classical formation, protecting them from archers. The battles are well balanced, enough so that you can pull a victory out of your own personal Thermopylae one turn, while the next your vastly numerically superior army can be utterly crushed by a much smaller force with superior weapons.

The simple yet satisfying game mechanics are what keeps you coming back. The options of other factions, and the different unit available within each, means you will have hours of fun mastering the pros and cons depending on who you go.

67,Rome Total War,21552993,english,"ROME TOTAL WAR AND ROME BARBARIAN INVASION ARE NOT THE SAME THING!!!

That being said. RTW is one of the best strategy games ever. I loved it for many reasons. Large armies, good, fun battles, espionage aspect, and finally at some point all there is left is other big civs that you have to fight. It makes for a great time. 

I would like to add that i am a big total war fan. I know how to run the economy, use agents, win battles, plainly, I know how to manage my faction.

Now we come to BARBARIAN INVASION. 
This is a great game in its own right. Personally I do not consider it an expansion because it is so different. It is similar but not the same as vanilla rome. Different time period factions, units, but also a different play style is needed. It was not designed as a conquer the world type like vanilla Rome was.

Keep in mind that I know how to play total war. My opinion is not that it is bad, it's just that it is not for me. Vanilla Rome had a long campaign setting for 50 provinces need for victory. In B.I. most have an 18 province requirement.

The odds are stacked against you. It is not too hard to beat I just found that it was too much a chore to enjoy. I play games for fun which is different for everyone. I tried many factions. My last on was the Saxons. I tried to see it through thinking that once I got enough cities I could have those big armies  I wanted. I had 10 provinces. I clawed my way up to this point. I still could not......

get a lot of money,
get massive armies, 
stop having to gruel my way through the campaign.

In short BI is a good game with a good challenge. I m just saying if you like vanilla Rome then I suggest you get  Barbarian Invasion demo before making your decision.

+ Deep strategy on both the world map for management and battle map for real-time combat
+ Nearly infinite replayability - you'll get your money's worth
+ Setting is great (Who doesn't love Rome?)
+ Crushing Greek sieges back-to-back while outnumbered 4-1 is an awesome feeling

Cons:
- Burden of knowledge is huge. Expect to be confused if you're new to the genre, but stick with it
- Consequently, the tutorial is also very long. Be prepared to set aside an hour or so to get through it
- Can sometimes be difficult to find information on the game's mechanics (e.g. ""How does the culture penalty work?"")
- I have had a few instances where the game will crash after I end a turn. Disabling the AI via console commands (disable_ai and run_ai) fixes this temporarily, but it means the armies on the map do not move or attack, taking all the fun out of the game.

97,Rome Total War,21211661,english,"I hadn't played any Total War games until I bought this one. After downloading and running it I went through a tutorial that taught me how to push buttons, and then I began the campaign. I started as the great Roman house of Julli, and began my great campaign. 
After pushing north to the alps, driving out the Gauls, I made peace with the nearby empires. The Gauls had been raiding me on occasion, and I had always beaten them back. Things seemed to be going well, until I asked to buy a city the Gauls owned. Now, of course, I offered a fair price. It was an incredible price, in fact, but they denied it. I offered again, with even more money and goods, and again they denied. This was the last straw. How DARE they deny me?! Don't they know who WON all those wars? I then decided that I had had enough of these ancient Frenchmen who dared to think they are equal to us great Romans. I not only wanted to teach them a lesson; I wanted them gone. So thus, the Great Gaul Genocide began.
It was a truly incredible campaign. Several new armies were raised. All traces of Gaul in the east were annihilated first, and a great push into the west began. Whenever I captured a city I was given the option to either occupy it as it was, enslave half the people and disperse them among my empire, or slaughter 3/4 of the people in the settlement. Naturally, I chose the latter. My goal was elimination. Death to all those barbarians who dared to have national pride. 
I pushed into the Gaul empire, taking city after city. The enemy had a bigger empire, perhaps, but mine was far stronger. Our great Roman soldiers killed all in their path. Despite a stumbling point where one Gaul army managed to defeat mine and save their city, two new armies took its place. The massive campaign wore on until, at last, the final Gaul stronghold fell. The people were slaughtered, and nothing remained of the once great empire. 
 I had kept a running body count as the genocide wore on. The final results were:
Gaul Soldiers killed: 3,659
Gaul Civilians killed: 33,689
Total Barbarian Gauls killed (citizens and soldiers): 37,339
Brave Roman soldiers lost: 1,258
Final body count: 38,597 people dead. 

It was only after the genocide was over that I realized I'd forgotten why I was mad at them in the first place.

One coming from the sea to the west, a fodder army of lesser troops. The turn before I plan on attack, SPQR denounces mine and the other three houses. Instant Civil War, four or five of my settlements beseiged by the other two houses, but I press on. First, my fodder army lands, 2-3k of my troops against two full stacks of SPQR elite troops, some 5-6k. I manage 681 kills to their complete annihlation of my army. SPQR forces have HUGE buffs. But it works, one of their armies is too far away from their capital to provide back up, so I lay siege. As soon as my towers are built, I assault the city. Walls so large they fill the entire screen, my onagers unable to penetrate them. The SPQR has less than a thousand men garrisoned in the city, but my reinforcements are delayed, they may not make it to the battle. With the enemies army marching at us from the other side of the city I quickly charge the walls. Sending my top units up the towers, I lose a thousand men, just trying to take the walls that less than four hundred defended. I rush a company of men to the other gate, to prevent enemy reinforcements from entering the city, they get there just in time. Now they must use my siege towers, I turn my onagers against them, destroying my own siege towers. But I haven't the ammo, one remains. With my battered and half killed army, I march to the city center, leaving only one unit back to defend the walls, along with my archers positioned along the enemy's approach. Half of my forces retreat from the city center as soon as combat ensues. The other half fighting bravely, but slowly losing. The enemy army reaching my tower, and then, reinforcements, my own. Finally arrived, striking the enemy in the back as they try to clamber up their own walls. I send the calvary and some infantry around to the side gate, attacking the city center from behind. I lose near on a thousand more men fighting the contingent of several hundred in the center, but I take it. Now I must hold it. With the enemy army at my back, attacking the walls my men so valiantly took. My second army charging at them, forcing them up against the walls, ballista's and arrows raining down on them. They begin to break, but so do my men. The might of the SPQR is undeniable, their armor thicker, weapons sharper. Sending the calvary out of the side gate, hitting them in their flank, finally the break. And the city is mine. The SPQR is destroyed, but the war has just begun, now the house Julii must reign supreme over the other two houses, they must be dealt with and swiftly.

48,Rome Total War,20501625,english,"Rome: Total War is a great game. You know this game came out in 2004 and twelve years later this game managed to heavily impress me. From the small part of diplomatic relations to the absolute massive battle scenes, the game just immediately sucked me in. Now the Total War games had never really been a big thing to me up until this moment so I was just a bit dubious about how much this game would appeal to me, but I am a history buff and I was trying to find a way to spend the summer so I picked it up during the sale. What I found was an actually really good game that managed to combine the turn base parts with the real time strategy. 

The game as said is split into two types of strategy. The first part is map screen. From here you manage your settlements and your armies. You can upgrade your towns and recruit new units. From here you can also send out your diplomats to other factions in order to institute trade agreements and forge alliances for wars. The diplomats have actually quite a bit that they can discuss with the other factions. You can make demands such has making them hand over a territory or you can create a trade agreement that can help your income or just allow them military access to other parts of the world. Another thing that impressed me is that they can reject your offer and make counter offers. This really does feel like an actual negotiation rather than just a basic “I declare peace or war thing.” One thing I’m going to say though is that there is a severe problem with the lack of anything to really during peace time. In the end though the map screen is fantastic turn based strategy. 

Now as for the actual battle screens it is one the greatest parts of the game. The sieges and the battles are just so massive that it is impossible to be swept away by it. The fights aren’t too complicated. It doesn’t take long to figure the strengths and weaknesses and of each unit. Just know when to charge and how to flank the enemy and that’s rather easy to pick up. What makes it really work though is just the basic ability to pause the game and figure out your positions and where each unit should go. This takes a lot the panicking and stress out of other strategies that usually takes me out of most strategy games. The units are widely varied and it is rather cool to see the progress of your units to much more powerful troops.

In the end what really sells the game is just the absolute scale it has. The game just feels massive and every advancement you do makes you feel more powerful. Some might say that the effects don’t look good and to those people I say they need to shut it. The game looked amazing back in the day and still looks line today. I don’t care if we can’t see every pimple on the soldiers they look fine. As for the multiplayer I don’t know what it’s like. I am not interested in it, but if you are then check it out. Rome: Total War is a game that everyone should check out if you are interested in history or if you think you might be interested in the game.

52,Rome Total War,9800515,english,"They say rome wasn't built in one day, but that certainly depends on how much you play this game, and with a game like this, you can easily get stuck in front of your computer for hours. I've heard some good and some bad things about the sequel to this game, Rome II, so i figured i might try and review this one instead.

I realize there's alot of TBS games kinda similar to this out there, but by some miracle i found my way through all those rip-offs and half bad ones, and found my way to this. Anyways, let's get to it

Now even though this game might not have the best graphics, it's a good quality game, the game runs very smooth on even the worst of computers, I experienced a surprisingly few number of glitches and flaws. Also this game variates a lot more than you’d think, the terrain and weather and basically all the nature, and even soldiers surrounding the battlefield has an effect on the battle itself, and it manages to create a somewhat realistic atmosphere.

You start of by choosing between a rich number of factions to play as, and each faction has their own abilities, starting points, diplomatic and offensive advantages, and of course they all are different difficulties. Now when you start you can also choose different campaign lengths and modes, but the ultimate goal, is to conquer the world. Even after you’ve reached your goal, and have gotten the “You Beat The Game!” message, there’s a lot to do.

Now the game doesn’t have many tracks to get you humming along, in fact it has a couple of tracks running in the background, and some music to set the mood for a fight, but that’s in the rough it, and that’s one of the things letting this game a bit down in my opinion.

To sum up, this game has a great costumization ability, and is good for a replay, or even two (to all the rome fanatics xD) not the best graphics or music but all in all, I give this an 7/10",1397338756,1452428764,TRUE,116,0,0.815287173,6,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,789,10,6745,0,5345,1421753754
53,Rome Total War,20435908,english,"Don't even think about it; this title is a definite buy.  This was my first RTS, although it is a mix of RTS or Turn-Based, the battles that take place are RTS.  This is my first Total war game ever, so I might not know everything about the franchise, but what i've experienced in the time i've played is amazing.  The graphics are definitely not going to blow you away in todays standards, but back when this was released was very impressive, in my gameplay there was about 2,000 people on the battlefield at once.  Don't get me wrong this game is not perfect, but is pretty close. For example, your troops get stuck way too many times. Also your troops run scared even though you may outnumber them 8:1 and you are dominating them. Those minor errors do not in fact damage the game in any way.  I do have one major problem since this game came out so long ago, my Nvidia can't automatically optimize it for me so it goes kind of slow for me, but maybe that is just me.

Extremely well thought-out and put together and with a very approachable learning curve, ROME puts you in the shoes of the head of a Roman Great House. Take on the Barbarians in the North as the Julii, wage war with the Greeks in the east as the Brutii, or dominate the deserts of Africa as the Scipii. As you expand a facet of the great Roman Republic, you eventually must take on your neighboring Romans as time passes. With either popular support within the Senate or with the Plebs, or by whitlling down your alliance with the other Houes, civil war breaks out and you can take Rome itself for yourself, and crush your past Roman allies. After completing a campaign as a Roman house, you unlock a new package of factions to play, all quite a bit more difficult than your Roman campaign.

In the expansion Barbarian Invasion, you face a lot more challenges this go around, the Roman Empire is suffering, plagued with Rebels on each side, and taking on enemies on all side. You can choose to repair Rome to it's former glory as the Western/Eastern Empire, or watch Rome crumble as a barbarian faction. From the Saxons in the North, to the Hunnic horde in the east, you have the same template ROME provided, but add hordes, changed regions, religious conversion and new units/buildings.

61,Rome Total War,20309666,english,"This is the best Total War in the franchise even better than Total War: Rome II. There's just so something awesome bout these factions that really make you feel you are the one who is controling everything and dominating all. The armies itself are very unique giving each faction their own individual units that make the game feel so much more refreshing when you're wanting to play another campaign because you have the chance to experience the different units.

The gamplay itself is very strategic where you see your men in their formations and positions ready to attack or defend. You may be outnumbered but if you stick to formations, strategic planning you can win which I very like that you need to use your brain to win.

The game has the best soundtrack in any Total war game, it fits the battles perfectly and makes it epic too. The Generals speech are very cool to hear aswel while you hear your soldiers cheering. Finally the utscenes are really entertaining to watch as well just seeing if your spy or assassn failed/succeeded the mission. 

Now when I say this game is better than Rome 2 I don't mean it but I do. Rome 2 has probably the most stupidest AI ever and the most content removed from. I won't go into detail because I am not reviewing the game (Also I don't have it on steam).

Also the soundtrack of this game is just amazing. Even if i have only around 2 hours played on steam,i have a lot more played on this game and i must say that i loved all the facts about this game.
 If you have the ocassion to buy this game i would recommend to wait untill a sale when the price is around 3 $ which is a fair price.
 Unfortunatelly the current games in the total war franchise become worse with the time,the dev being focused on releasing a lot of dlc's than a good final product like Rome Total War which is a masterpiece for the time it released,being a game that changed the genre in a good way.

Graphics: They're okay for its time (about a 6-7/10), but it may feel outdated for some newer gamers. Try some mods, and it'll feel more new. With that being said, about 7/10 with the mods in mind.

Gameplay: Very smooth, responsive battle animations. If you can control your cavalry well, you can handle any opponent with proper flanking and timed troop engagement. The turn-based aspect may seem somewhat outdated, but there are mods that will bring the diplomacy among other parts of the game to unrivaled levels. 10/10

I'm not going to comment on anything else, since I think this game is all gameplay with some visuals to create immersion. There is a grand and truly epic feel to the campaign, so anyone with some interest in history would enjoy it.

24,Rome Total War,19631266,english,"I am the House of Julii.

I am to the North of Italy. I am part of the Glorious Roman Republic, sharing with three other factions; the blue Scorpios (I think) who have decided to take a couple of islands and then the big parts of Africa. The green Brutii, who decided that looking ridiculous would best show the Greeks what's what. And I, wearing fantastically imperial red, who was tasked with sorting out the dirty Gauls.

I quickly began a conquest that would put the Black Templars to shame, sending out army after army, conquering town after town. They tried to resist, but my men were worth two of theirs, and my men outnumbered their three to one. As we came, we took most of them slaves, built up my core towns, built as many temples to convince more people to shag as possible, and continued on our merry murdering way.

Occasionally, the Guals or Brittony or Germans would manage to scrape together an entire army of 2000 people. These were the battles I, and my family, were born for. We smashed together, blood and sword and sinew, as my Velites threw their spears overhead, and cavalry quickly hit them from behind. Few enemies died facing us in the north, many ran and most died with sword wounds in their backs rather than face us.

We tried peace once, and we paid the price with roman lives. When they begged for our mercy, they found only our gladius. We heard the lamentations of their women as they were taken back to mighty Arretium, our capital city. And how it had grown; on the back of slaves and the glory of our men, we raised great arenas and temples to show our glory! We raised great barracks to train our men! We grew the greatest of men to enforce our will! And the north of Europe was stained red with blood; the map of Europe was stained red with our flags.

We found that land ran out quickly; Europa gave way before our bloodlust did, and we turned to look back. We were disgusted with what we saw. Corruption. Weakness. Our supposed equals made peace with the savages, our supposed superiors hide behind the walls of Rome. They whispered of treachery, but we knew weakness and corruption when we saw it. The spineless Scorpios had no trouble gaining the favour of the Senate; spending more time on their knees in glorious Rome than sword in hand over Carthage. The Brutii failed to live up to their brutish name; content with a paltry pile of sand, growing fat and lazy as we had grown lean and numerous in both flesh and glory.

We recalled our armies to home, to the swell of the crowds. They chanted our name, and spat at the mentions of the Senate. All had been united under our banner; did not the Celts and Gauls and Germans and Thrycians alike not bend the knee to the glorious Romans, all beneath the bloody red banner of the Julii? Mars had made his favour clear; he doesn't favour cowards, and Jupiter didn't let the weak rule. We built temples in His Name, and spread his name further than even the diplomats know. All that was left was to follow the glory given to us, under the gaze of the gods and cheers of the people, we marched the final path.

61,Rome Total War,19121532,english,"I definetly loved this game. It was revolutionary at the time and is still considered one of the best total wars to date. It is mostly balanced and when it's not it's usually just the overpricing of certain units. The community is full of skilled players which is a pro and a con. Many players may struggle to get into the game because of that fact, but if you practice enough and look up some strategy guides then you can rek face. I felt that no army was super under-powered or super over-powered and that anyone could be good with any faction. 

Now I'm going to talk a bit more about the cons. One of my major cons is that some factions do not get that many units. In campaign this may be OK but in multiplayer it can make some factions harder to play as. Next con is, well it's old. I'm not complaining about graphics, I'm more complaining about limitations. Battles above five thousand are laggy and hard to play. Also the campaign is hard if you don't look up even one strategy guide. It's confusing and sometimes you feel like you don't know what to do. They give you some tips that aren't neccessarily helpful. I remember having to restart the game as the brutii often because it's that hard. You can end up having built up a large debt. And my final complaint is diplomacy. Oh god the diplomacy. The diplomacy is awful. I remember gaul asking me for trade rights, me accepting, and then they attack me. Also, I have a friend who was attacking the last city of dacia. Dacia had a ton of money and he had accept or we will attack, in exchange for ten thousand denarii. Dacia refused and got obliterated. Stingy bastards. Also, Gaul in my most recent Brutii playthrough said ""give us 500 denarii or we will attack"" and I just gave it to them. Keep in mind that the julii is currently making them their bitch. Then I was like, ""Hey, want map information? Just give us 10,000 denarii."" Gaul counter offered with ""Give us 550 denarii every turn for two turns or we'll attack."" and I was like ""Fuck you!"" and then Gaul went to go threaten the rest of rome. Bare in mind that they haven't attacked yet.

My final score is 9/10 for the game. It struggles a bit, but for the time it was made it was amazing.",1447716992,1447716992,TRUE,1,0,0.521739125,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,67,7,58568,0,4407,1552701671

I clearly remember being able to play this game a little after it came out with an Opteron 165 and a X1950XT at full settings with no fps problems.

In total I've probably got 800-900+ hours on this game, maybe even 1000+, it's hard to calculate because I've been playing it so long and have spent many long sessions on this game.
Suffice it to say, I think my opinion on the game is worth something.

This game is without a doubt one of the best games I've ever played, ever, in my nearly 21-year life.
I've played a multitude of games on different platforms from the first 3 Spyro games on PlayStation 1 as a kid, to GTA San Andreas on the PlayStation 2, to Halo 3 on the Xbox 360, to Red Dead Redemption on the same system, etc. All games I'd consider to be absolutely classics and some of the best games made, and I'm sure many of you would too.
Rome: Total War, in my opinion, owns a place in that list of games.

Most people reading this review, I feel, will be those who have already had the pleasure of playing this game, and just want to see the good words that others have been speaking of it. This game is old enough and iconic enough in the PC gaming community that I dare say most PC gamers worth their salt will have played it.
Well you won't be disappointed by me, because this game is one of the most iconic PC games to have ever been made, if you ask me.
It has its imperfections, as do all games.
The poor campaign and combat AI
The now dated graphics (not even worth mentioning anyway)
The, erm... the.... God, what else is an imperfection of this wonderful game?

For those of you who have genuinely never played this before, and are wondering if it's worth it, note that this game is 11 years old, as of the writing of this review. That's old.
Be kind to it for its dated graphics and game mechanics.

97,Rome Total War,16166156,english,"Rome: Total War is the most highly acclaimed game in the Total War series. Upon it's launch, it was apparent that the Total War series had something different to offer to fans of Turn Based Grand Strategy games. In time, it would become known as one of, if not, the best Total War games ever made. You might ask yourself why out of all the newer Total War games is Rome the best? Well, there's several simple reasons.

Pros:
- Simple design, as it is one of the first TW games
- Large, sprawling cities to battle in, but not too detailed so as to distract the player.
- The single best Soundtrack you will find in any TW game.
- Large map, but not on a ludacris scale such as Rome II.
- Great choice of factions
- Campaign and battle map look beautiful
- This game can be played smoothly at its highest settings on any modern computer
- Massive replay value

Cons:
- [post suggestions in the comment area]

Overall:
Rome is a nice and simple, beautifully crafted game. It is what CA was praised for in the Total War series. Rome II is way more technical with a great deal more to learn Honestly, the inlons about this game. Just as I have, almost all major and indie critics have given this game a 9/10, 95%, 4.5/5, etc. This was also given ""14th Greatest Game of All Time"" apparently and I do think it deserves it.

Sadly when you buy the Gold Edition on steam, you don't get the Alexander DLC.

The Barbarian Invasion has one problem, chosen archers have bleeped up graphics. 
If you want an even better experience, I would suggest learning how to modify the descr_strat files to play as every faction. Nothing beats the satisfaction of invading Gaul as the Franks.

For the normal campaign, it is a challenge to get used to, but it is entertaining to form the Roman Empire through a bloody civil war in late game for control of all the Empire. Carthage is the best challenge because it is fun... fun to get kicked out of Sicily while invading Iberia.

My rating for this classic RTS would be a close 10/10, in reality 9.7/10.

61,Rome Total War,17516298,english,"I came, I saw, I conquered. Those words mean a lot in this game. When i saw this game in my local MVC shop before it closed down nearly 11 years ago. I wasn't sure if i would enjoy it. I loved games which involve empire building and controlling large armies on the battlefield like the good old AOE series. Although this game doesn't lead on the same path as AOE, it brings a lot more entertainment with empire building and controlling vast armies on battle map. This game, like a few others are the types of games that i could play for ages. They are my golden games to which i will never sell or never forget. Each faction has a strength or weakness, but it also depends on which units and buildings you create. It is up to you and you alone to survive. Its not a simple hit and run game where you can do anything you want and get away with it. Each choice, move and final act you make will to a certain point have an impact on your empire and your armies. You will never know who will betray you, attack you or ask for an alliance. The battlefields are more or less the same, once the battle begins, its fate, skill and intelligence that helps you win and leads you to world domination. 

Although the game will have its moments be it bugs, crashes or simple copy and paste. If you ever play the game on the hardest difficulty, the feeling of victory after an hour+ long battle is beyond satisfying. The battle music is perfect, the power and awesomeness before battle and the clash between your army and the computer AI is just as good. Many factions do have the same units and it can be rather annoying when facing the Roman's, but it can also be a wonderful challenge, but again, that all depends on the choices you make because one wrong more and that's it, everything could come to an end.

10/10 would meet 'n' greet, betray, pillage and murder you again

PROS:
Realistic campaign sees you requiring real micromanaging of settlements into cities, taking into account real-life issues such as corruption, squalor, plague, etc.
You learn about Roman history and troops REALLY fast and what they're good for.
You realize real quick how placing swordsmen in front of cavalry makes for a really bad ending. 
Light cavalry suck...
Hiring mercenaries has its pros and cons
Slow, patient micromanaging can result in a solid economic empire and allow you to crush anyone in your path
You want to play while watching simultaneously Gladiator for some reason..
Moddable
You can spent easily 100hrs and not be done with the game
You get easily engrossed in crushing the AI and then get a warm fuzzy feeling realizing that there are OTHER TOTAL WAR GAMES WAITING TO BE PLAYED!!!

CONS:

68,Rome Total War,6488051,english,"One of the older Total War games, this classic is still fun to play. An enjoyable blend of RTS and turn-based strategy. You start out as one of three Roman families, and proceed to conquer the known world. The world map is turn-based. On your turn you can march your armies, train more soldiers, hire mercenaries, and send out your agents to do your bidding. You can have your diplomats trade and ally with other nations, send spies to find their weaknesses, or send assassins to remove their generals and kings (or do all three!). When your army encounters an enemy army or beseiges a city, you can fight in real-time. Soldiers move in squadrons across the battlefield, flanking and being flanked in turn, breaking when morale is low, or staying to fight when the general rallies them. As you defeat nations, they are unlocked for you to play. Parthia, Britannia, and Carthage are three of them. 

There are several issues with the game. Diplomacy can be rather frustrating, with enemies refusing to make peace, or demanding you become a protectorate when you are crushing them into the dust. Anachronisms abound (the entire Egyptian roster, for example). Graphics are dated, though the map view is still pretty.

 Overall, though, the game is fun, and longevity is added through mods. Some like Europa Barbarorum overhaul all the races, removing anachronisms; others like Lord of the Rings change the game from the Mediterranean to Middle-earth.

74,Rome Total War,17416336,english,"When Rome: Total War first came out, I remember ordering it off Amazon and being so disappointed when it didn't turn up in it's little box on the scheduled date. Having played both Shogun and Medieval Total War, the originals, I was chomping at the bit to see what this next generation of strategy was going to be like.  This time you wouldn't move armies like a chess piece. This time they'd move like proper people across a living map. Betterx than that... the armies would actually seem to have three dimensions and not the old paper cut-out effect of the previous games. 

Over the next year and long before Steam existed, I probably clocked in some disgusting triple digit number of hours in gameplay. It was beautiful to look at, ground-breaking in every way and completely sucked in my life. Everything that I wanted from a classical strategy game was right there. And it still is.

Some time later Medieval 2 came out, which once again I diligently spent too much of my time playing. Now we have Rome 2 and Attila. Are the later games (with patches) better? In my opinion: strategy map yes, battles no. It all really boils down to the person and their attitude towards graphics. 

The other day I downloaded Rome 1 due to a nostalgic hangover, and have spent even more of my time ruining the afternoon of various Gaulish villages. I would never say 'don't download Rome 2' because it's also great fun, but Rome 1 is solid entertainment throughout.  

If you haven't experienced Rome 1 and are a fan of the TW series, or even a newcomer looking for a strategy game... I strongly suggest you give it a chance.

76,Rome Total War,17393771,english,"*WARNING : LONG (But detailed) REVIEW

Where to start with Rome Total War? This game is like Sid Meier’s Civilization but more focused on , as the title would suggest , Total War. So, enough beating around the bush.

Pros

This game is absolute genius. Its historically accurate , apart from the part when you , the player , take 100 percent of the area near Rome. The game notifies you when something like a flood or the Pompeii eruption occurs around the same time (I have no clue if Pompeii makes an appearance in the game. I've never gotten far enough). Another great part are the wars. There are , I believe , 3 types of fighting : Army to Army , Army to Town or City , and Fleet to Fleet. Army to Army is a standard type of fighting. Two armies on opposite sides of a field where there will be a fight to the death. This is challenging for me due to all the open space but to others it may be easier. Army to Town or City is where an army is trying to take a town or city by either maintaining a successful siege , starving the enemies inside, or forcefully invading by making Siege Towers , Ladders , Rams , and / or other breaching equipment. Either way , If successful , the army and their faction will then take and rule the captured city. Technically this is a con but , Fleet to Fleet is just borderline impossible , at least for me. In this type of battle, two fleets fight each other on the unrelenting sea. This can be especially dangerous if your ship attacked is a transport ship carrying YOUR ABSOLUTE BEST TROOPS. If this transport ship loses the battle , every man aboard will die. However , there is a fantastic feeling when you successfully take down an army , general , town , or even 1 of 20 factions. 

Cons

This game is anything but perfect. For starters , the battle screen. Before each battle , a screen pops up describing the soon starting skirmish along with 3 buttons : Flee and Retreat , Auto Resolve Battle , or Go to Battle Screen and fight the enemy yourself. Tip : Pick Auto Resolve. Fleeing is for Benito Mussolini and good luck trying to figure out the Battle Screen controls. The camera is awful. If you want to move the camera right there is a chance that you could end up looking at the ground. Along with that , you cant simply tell your archers to fire on an enemy. There's this whole process of moving them into position and it's just not worth it. Using a faulty controller to play Mortal Kombat while making a space station in Kerbal Space Program with your toes is easier than taking on an army. Its hard to explain but don't fight in the battles. Another con is the fact that the game goes through almost phases. One minute you have more generals than any other faction with more gold than Scrooge McDuck and another you are losing towns to rebels because of dying Governors without enough cash to fight back , let alone buy half a particle of dirt. This second phase is the main reason I can't get a single faction. The game gives you about 255 years to conquer all factions but even Alexander the Great couldn't win.

83,Rome Total War,17352826,english,"I bought this then-cutting-edge game back when it was released in 2004. I'd seen it advertised some months before that on a TV series that used its engine wherein two teams competed against each other to win an historical battle. That whetted my appetite enormously. When I bought it, I not only spent countless hours playing but also played its add-ons (Barbarian Invasion and Alexander).
To me Rome: Total War was the best of the Total War series - a balance between the old 2D strategy of Medieval: Total War and the increasingly eye-candy iterations that came thereafter (though I think Medieval 2: Total War was also very good).
Add to this the fact that Rome has more mods than any other in that series (and with more diversity of setting/theme) and you have a game that is highly replayable. I still dip into it after 11 years of owning it! Rome forums still remain populated after all this time, and mods are still being developed for it. That speaks volumes.

After playing this game for a few hours, I really enjoy it. As someone who really enjoyed Sid Meier's Civilization V, the campaign is really enjoyable. The combat system with the open landscapes works beutifully and feels like a real battle. Definately get this game if you liked Civ V or enjoy a good strategy game.

13,Rome Total War,17119519,english,"RTW has an epic feel.

As of today, this game is nearly eleven years old.  So, the battle graphics are not as crisp as newer titles, the historicity of some units is sketchy (or just made up), and it seems that multiplayer is not smooth in Steam.  Fortunately, none of these mean a thing to me.  The heart of the game is in the grand strategy and the personal narrative.

With over a hundred regions in which to play, the strategic game is where RTW shines. You need to plan where you will expand and where you will defend... and then be ready to adapt when the AI does not do what you expect. You may be the pawn of the Senate and serve at their beck and call.  You might try to expand against the weak.  You can follow the trade routes to gain riches through conquest.  You will find yourself occupying regions merely to stymie your enemies (and your allies). Or you might work your way towards all seven Wonders to reap their benefits.

The twenty factions all fall into one of the major religio/cultural groupings. Some conquered peoples will not like your religion, but a few might. Some conquered peoples will happily accept you as overlord because you share the same cultural values... and the Spanish clans just don't like anyone. Some factions have great infantry, some have cavalry, and some do many things well.  Yet, you can usually find mercenaries (disgruntled locals, rival tribes, or thugs) who might fill the holes in your army.

Yes, most negative reviews harp on about the lag in multiplayer and the poor graphics in battles.  If you need gratuitous violence or managing pixels in a free for all, then watch Mad Max: Fury Road or play League of Legends. If you want to make decisions that will impact your dominion fifty turns down the road, then this game can give it to you.  What kind of temples will you build in each region... or should you let the people keep their native religion?  Will a town become a recruiting station or a cash cow?  When you conquer a region, you'll have to decide to either just incorporate it into your lands as is, relocating half the people by enslaving them, or just slaughtering most of the inhabitants and stealing their goods.... and you'll find yourself using each throughout the campaign, because one size does not fit all.

And guess what?  I don't fight the battles.  If I did, I'd never finish a campaign.  I hit the auto calculation button every time.  Why?  Well... there are a number of positions which you will fulfill in a game.  Benevolent multi-generational spirit guiding your family, governor of a province, Commander in Chief, general of an army, and captain of a unit. Playing all of these breaks the narrative for me... I play the macro game, i.e. the big picture.  I plot and scheme, I build cities, and recruit armies.  Then I send them out into the field.  How they do is up to them.  If they win... great! I must be a genius.  If they lose... nuts. Back to the drawing board.

Two friends of mine, let's call them Doc and Bro, played RTW like this... Doc played the campaign map, i.e. he decided what units were built and where the battles were fought, but Bro fought all the battles.  Doc was the CinC and Bro was the General.  They played two campaigns in three years, but they remember both as epic stories of their teamwork.

In addition to the war... campaign strategy, building armies, transportation of armies, theatres of conflict, fog of war, etc... you'll have to deal with natural disasters, (In one game, a young woman of my family married a promising young fellow, but he died a year later in an earthquake.), piracy, rebellions, brigands, bribery attempts upon your armies, old age, death in battle, adoptions, plagues (stupid unwashed barbarians), and assassination. (In one game, the youngest son of my German leader was sent to subdue Gaul and Hispania. This gave him a command of 10.  I marched him and his elite German veterans across the Alps to conquer Rome... but the Romans assassinated him.  With my hordes leaderless, the Romans proceeded to sieze Gaul and invade Germania.) All of these additional factors help create a unique narrative for each game.

Oh, and when you play as a Roman faction, you'll need to keep an eye upon the Senate... how they view you, how the plebs (the masses) view you, Senatorial missions, and the official Senatorial stance with every other faction. For instance, you may have a great trade agreement with the Egyptians and a low standing with the Senate, but the Sentate demands that you attack Egypt... attacking Egypt will hurt your income considerably, but offending the Senate may cause them to label you as a rebel... what will you do?

Certain events always happen... Aetna erupts and the plague breaks out in Macedonia, but certain other events happen only when certain triggers occur (the Marian reforms), while others, such as floods, are random.  But the big event for Roman players is the Civil War.  At some point the plebs will want you to deal with the Senate and/or at some point the Senate will either have enough of you or become paranoid of your growing power that they'll demand the head of your family to commit suicide.  If you agree, they'll do it every turn until your family ceases to exist.  If you're not ready for war, then you can comply with the Senate for a few years (and prune your family tree of bad apples in the process), but at some point you'll have to stand up to the Senate... at which point you go to war with all other Romans.  Talk about raising your anxiety.... sheesh!

All of your characters really flesh out the narrative... the story of your family.  Spies, diplomats, assassins, admirals, generals, and governors all have character traits that make them who they are.  Some will be drunkards, perverts, and ne'er do wells, while some will be loyal, moral, and cunning.  They'll also tend to generate a following of hangers on, freeloaders, men of honor, mistresses, etc...  For instance, a son might come of age in your family with a command of 3... a natural born general... but on his way to the frontier to defeat the Dacians, his inner circle grows to include a Drunken Uncle and an Actor and they decrease his command ability by 3... Ouch!  He's now a zero...

In the first two Total War games, Shogun and Medieval, you had family members, but not nearly as many as Rome.  So to help you manage them (and for the sheer fun of telling a story), RTW includes a family tree.

The game's not perfect.  The legendary/semi-mythological units can be frustrating and the Egyptians were certainly not using chariots in the second century BC. Naval combat results can make you scratch your head.  Negative income numbers on the campaign map are definitely misleading. There is always the point at which you know you've won even though you may only be forty to seventy percent of the way to the finish... but that's true of a lot of games.

There may be other games out there that have made improvements to the grand strategy game, but I've always found this one to be fun to return to.",1437287261,1437287261,TRUE,91,9,0.87316066,3,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,13,3,98745,0,28703,1574244098

This simple campaign type/mode is the best part about the game and all Total War games in my opinion.

3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes.

The game that launch the Total War series towards heights that it could've never dreamed of. This game is a turn-based strategy game where you take command the various factions during the Roman Era as you command, build, govern and attack Rome's enemies.

The battle system unlike the system you will see in the modern day versions of the game is really simplistic. Sort of like an almost modern update of Imperial Glory. Now of course, the usual complaint would be ""OMG the game is too hard"" or ""OMG the online players are wrecking me"" Luckily the game has an in-depth tutorial plus you have all the time in the world as this game offers various combat both historical and custom made as you polish your skills in battle. And also being a leader of Rome.

The advisor system is really helpful as they give advice towards the player. DO NOT turn it off if your new. Keep that option for advisor input set to ""High"". Plus the User Interface for manging your territory and what not is simplistic as well.

Now bewarn, save often. Some of the daily tasks that the senate assigns you don't really give you concrete directions. For some of them it's a simple click of the ""zoom in towards target location"" while others it's ""Find this city"" and your just like ""Um okay...WHERE?!"" some of these tasks are important as it may further your position in the Roman government.

The economic system in campaign is simple enough so you can stay on top of it all but complicated enough so you face challenges to keep your armed forces financially. After play ROME 2 recently I have to say that I believe the economic system in this is better.

Actual Review:

All you need to know is the game is great.  Some things that are kind of annoying are the FPS drops in large night-time battles, moving camera fast on campaign map, and the game not letting you Alt+Tab back into the game if you tab out.  Oh, and the AI can be retarded if you are besieged and use your garrisoned troops to attack the attackers before ending the turn.

City management is decent with factors including unrest, economy, and population. However, from cities are good while others are bad. There's no fixing certain cities and they're doomed to be financially awful so it can be frustrating. The diplomacy is the least exciting and extensive part of the game. The selling point of the game is absolutely the combat. Crush the rivaling factions alone with fun and intense battles. The diplomacy allows no true alliances and depending on what faction you play you can be surrounded by enemies and have to fight a steep uphill battle. All the factions are fun but some have a pretty solid advantage. The barbarian factions are more limited on technological buildings and  troops such as onagers, scorpions, and even stone walls. It's slightly made up for by the fact that the troops they do get can be outright more interesting. Like headhurlers who throw severed heads at enemies to lower moral or axe wielding berserkers who fight to the bitter end in a bloodthirsty rage. Once again you can see the emphasize on the combat.

The game's main campaign is set during the rule of the late Roman Republic and early Roman Empire with the player assuming control of one of three leading Roman families. Other factions are playable once they have been unlocked. Gameplay consists of real-time tactical battles framed within a turn-based strategic campaign.  On the large strategic scale, players spend each turn managing diplomacy, developing infrastructure, moving armies, and managing the population's growth and public order. On the smaller scale, real-time battles against enemy armies take place with the player commanding forces that can contain thousands of individual soldiers.

The game is also featured in tv series about ancient battles - Decisive Battles and Time Commanders

No balance issues other than the roman factions and Egypt being a bit overpowered, but if you are a true strategy gamer, you'll figure a way around that.  I simply ally with Egypt for example when playing Carthage, and having a lone Numidian territory in Libya between our two nations ensures Eqypt never goes hostile.

13,Rome Total War,15506198,english,"The best Total War in my opinion and the only one I've finished so far. It is easy to see why this is considered the most influencial of all Total War games published. The battles are fantastic to play, the game is challenging to play, if you play certain factions, and fun to see a faction that was wiped out by the Roman imperilaists in our history, to suddenly lick Carthaginian sandal in your game. Another good feature in this game is how each faction has their own unique apperances and even how they fight and what units they can have, even if they are a bit copy and paste. 

If there are any flaws in this game, it is these; stupid stacked armies (several generals with up to 30 or more units), overpowered factions and historical inaccuracy.  The stupid stacked armies are a constant menace, especially  if you invade Rome, so be ready for that. Another one is overpowerded factions. The one in particullar is Egypt. If you play as the Seleucid Empire against them, good fucking luck! Historical inaccuracy is another flaw, but only minor compared to the latter two.

42,Rome Total War,15288496,english,"I'm gonna say exactly what others said about this game - forget R2; just buy this game.
The vanilla game provides an excellent strategy experience in battles - Units aren't breaking formations often during combat, unit skins and combat animations look neat and special unit abilities such as the testudo or phalanx actually count for something in this game; although the AI may sometimes not always use the I part correctly, the combat is still enjoyable. 
The campaign is also very good - the map is sunny and very neatly designed, which makes the campaign even better. 
While the game is somewhat historically accurate, there is one thing in this game that makes it a little bit of a letdown - the roman factions are very, very overpowered; they have strong units as the base of their army, plsu after the marian reforms they get legionaries which are probably the strongest units in the game. 
That's where the mods come in. There is a very large variety of mods to choose from for this game, and they make the experience even better. 
All in all - this game is very, very good, and in my opinion it even rivals Medieval II as the best Total War game.

52,Rome Total War,15243785,english,"Rome Total War is a very good game for anyone who likes grand strategy. As a fan of History myself, this game is even more epic to control the Roman Empire and crush Carthage or be overrun by barbarians. It is very accurate to the period, and offers plenty of hours of good fun. Many times I found myself losing track of time in the middle of a campaign. This game also has plenty of support for mods, ranging from Middle Earth to more realism. 

However, the game does have its' flaws. It's very old, and will be a pain from time to time. Also the controls can be a bit troublesome, such as selecting units and arranging them, to trying to execute complex maneuvers. The auto battle function is completely broken, and because of that, so is the naval combat. 

I find that at times managing a giant Roman empire can be a pain, and so the function to be able to play as the other civilizations was a welcome suprise. Once you conquer one, you can play as them in another campaign, and it is fun to try and assualt Roman cities as the barbarians. 

The modding community is so healthy, if you purchase the game and find that you don't enjoy it, there is a good chance that there will be a mod that makes it all better for you. 
Hopefully this review helped you make a desicision, but at such a cheap price, you should check it out if it interests you at all!

Battles arent as smooth as I remember with the regular boxed edition. Unit pathfinding is non-exsistant at times, however I'm not so sure if that is down to me using the ""Huge"" unit size setting. Siege battles are almost unplayable as units never follow my instructions. For example, telling my auxilia to enter a city gates and form a line while the rest of my army enters, they never just run straight in. They have to run to a certain point(all of them one by one) turn around, and walk into the city gates and not as one unit either, more like dribs and drabs.

Plus, when your unit of 161 roman cavalry with three bronze chevrons, shield and sword have a hard time taking down a single unit of slingers....there is something wrong there, the same also goes for most other infantry.

Hastati, two silver shevrons, bronze shield and sword should form a very ridged centre, take casualties like nobodys buisness.

I'm proud to say that I'm still playing this game even though it's more than 10 years old. Owning later Total War games like Rome II and Shogun 2 couldn't convince me enough to stop playing this valuable ""veteran"". As I mentioned, this game is more than 10 years old. So do not expect much on the graphics.

In the campaign, you'll start as Rome divided into 3 different families. You'll unlock other playable factions as you progress. Without being said, Rome is by far the strongest that campaign will look easy. Want more challenges? Try the barbarian tribes (Gaul, Britannia or Germanic). Other non-playable factions like Macedon, Pontus, Thrace, Armenia should be made playable by default to add more fun to the campaign mode. But that can be resolved by modding. For sharing, my 3 most favoured factions for the campaign mode are (1) Rome, (2) Seleucid Empire, (3) Carthage.

Diplomacy is rather 'useless' in the later part of the campaign. AI (especially those factions you're at war with) will reject any diplomatic proposal. But hey, this game is all about using your sword and thrust it into the face of the enemy! Let the sword or arrows do the talking instead. It's all about ""I came, I saw, I conquered"".

If you don't have a background to Total War series, try this out. It's a perfect start. Oh, and I really love those cinematic starts of the campaign as well as those historical battles.

Where to start with Rome Total War? First released back in September 2004 the game recently reached it's tenth anniversary. I've played it on and off since release and the recent anniversary prompted me to go back and play through it again. It's a game that mostly stands up to the test of time for me and well worth playing today. I didn't play the Barbarian Invasion expansion included in the Steam edition as it's quite a distinct entity that should be reviewed in it's own right.

Like all games in the Total War series there are two elements; the campaign map where you manage your empire, build cities, recruit units, move armies etc and the battle map, where you fight battles in real time. This gives the game some great depth and whilst you can auto-resolve battles this can be a bit hit and miss and you'll want to fight them yourself to get the best results. The Imperial Campaign is the main game mode where you can choose from a number of different factions and play through either a short or long campaign with prescribed victory conditions and different difficulty settings. There is a decent tutorial to ease you into things and plenty of advice is available throughout both with the optionn to turn it off for veterans.

The Imperial Campaign is backed up by being able to fight custom battles where you choose the map, faction etc and Historical Battles which recreate a number of famous battles of the era such as Hannibal's invasion of Italy and the Battle of the Teutoberg Forest. You can also play online against other players but this wasn't something I did.

The main campaign has a good deal of depth and each of the factions has different styles, units, cities and starting points which offer a wide variety of challenge. Playing as the Romans is the initial starting point and they are divided into three factions which compete against other and have some additional mechanics to account for including the Senate of Rome, the Marius Reforms and some other suprises which I won't spoil. Rome also generally has the strongest units and buildings which can make things somewhat straightforward for an experienced player. However a lot of the late game units of other factions more than match them and playing the campaign as Eygpt, Carthage, the Britons or others is very enjoyable.

The mechanics of the campaign map are very broad and offer a wide variety of tactical options to pursue; bribery, assassination and spreading plagues amongst them. I played through on the very hard settings which I'd reccomend any veteran Total War player to do and the campaign offered a good challenge with interesting scenarios and incidents along the way. Whilst my progress was steady I wasn't able to steamroll the AI into the ground within a few turns. I did play as Eygpt who are one of the easier non Roman factions to play but still a challenge later in the game.

The battle map is probably the slightly weaker side of the game and whilst some battles, particularly sieges, can be a bit difficult or frustrating, most are straightforward affairs if you have assembled a balanced army and have a relatively comprehensive grasp of the tactics to use. However the various factions armies all have different strengths or weaknesses and there isn't the rock, paper, scissors situation you see in some games. The Roman armies have the strongest armies as a general rule of thumb but other factions e.g. Eygpt, Germania have some very good units too and what works with one may not work at all with another.

I've not mentioned performance or graphics at all as the game is ten years old and there generally shouldn't be any issues nor will it look fantastic.

I'd also take a moment to mention the additional content available online from Europa Barborum and a couple of other sites. These add a huge amount to the game and are well worth a look if you want to take things further after playing the main game.

Overall I'd definetely reccomend playing this if your a fan of the Total War series and I also feel its a good starting point for the series as whole. Those interested in the era itself will certainly find it enjoyable.",1414525246,1425746191,TRUE,1,0,0.500050008,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,18,2,8753,0,8215,1430058184

21,Rome Total War,14740916,english,"This is the first Total War I picked up and it instantly got me hooked on the series. Now, I can't really compare this to other games of its time because I started playing TW about 3 years ago, but I will say this: This is still one of the best TW games in the series. They just nailed so many things correctly, and the fact that after so many years it is still so fun to go back and pick up where I left off, is a huge plus. 
Graphically it can't compare to the new ones, but it did so many other things so well, it doesn't even matter. Diplomacy with the old diplomat agent system is a pain when compared to the newer TW; Combat is still so satisfying (when u rain a thousand flaming arrows on a horde of barbarians); The campaign map still feels expansive; The biggest plus is the games massive variety in playable factions and unique units/traits. Even by today's TW standards it is impressive.

ONE HUGE CON FOR THE STEAM VERSION:
There is a problem where in the campaign map you will have massive amounts of lag, but this can be fixed (ranging from easy to infuriatingly hard solutions). I think this is due to optimization bugs or something for the most part.

38,Rome Total War,14648655,english,"As the user-defined tags suggest this is a historical strategy game.  The overworld campaign is a turn-based grand strategy- sort of a simplified Civilization.  The battles are mostly real time, with a toggle for 2x or 3x, so I guess it could be argued there is a 4x element to the battle.

The campaign takes a long time to finish, but it is good training if you want to play multiplayer.  There are some troops that don't seem to be very good relative to their costs-  I'm thinking the Arcanii (why only 16????????!!!!!!!!!!), but for the most part the game seems pretty balanced.

The biggest downside for me was the fact that this game crashes every 4th or 5th battle, and I hear I am not the only person who has this problem.  The public order system can also be wonky- I lost a settlement to a gladiator revolt, then recaptured it and two turns later there was another gladiator revolt with the exact same amount of gladiators. 

Overall, I would strongly reccomend this game if you like the idea of massive battles, tactical thinking, or time consuming strategic considerations.  I know I loved it.

Despite its historical inaccuracies (more than likely set so to have a more balanced game), its a fun game.

Despite its HUGE LACK of any decent diplomacy, classical Rome never saw fit to just let its rivals get away with anything. It's a game that wants you to take lands, demolish the barbaric religions, and build your own. 

What more can I say? Other than ""If you dont like it, mod it."" and ""I killed (absurd number of) peasants with (tiny number) of (elite troops).""

The Greeks have phalanx that buckle down enemy infantry so your cavalry can finish the job. And the barbarian have cool unique units like the druids and fanatics.

I began to watch Rome Documentaries, read historical accounts and see what lead to the eventual decline and annihilation of the Empire. In the beginning of Rome: Total War you have a choice of which house to represent Rome.  Julii, Brutii,or Scipii. When your orders come in from the senate you are eager to do the biding to further this penisula into an empire. As you progress you are rewarded though the senate with influence in the political wheel. WIth family members and a vested interest in the outcomes of each town with what family member to lead it. Which is easy to determine through the very easy to learn UI. Now the Graphics are dated however its brushed aside as you gain fame and conquest through lower Europe. 
There are many reviews and great aclaim for this Total War Masterpiece. Problems did arise with my own gameplay but they are not with the game persay. You have to forget the world in which we know and put yourself in the culture and politics of the era. This alone will start to forge your understanding of what these men and women endured daily. Military  victories and winning against 3-1 odds are awesome. Learning battlefield strategy is learned quickly as there is a vast amount of information in game you can utilize to win the day. But its not all about conquering your enemies abroad but at home. In game you will start to to see beyond the game into why each house is not only doing the Senates will also to further the house they represent. 
I would also recommend all the DLC as it increases the immersion of the era and offers many more hours of gameplay. 
Also there are Historical Battles to play. And if your like me and study the battle before you play it, your immersion will be 10 fold when you may know the outcome however when it really has happened...exciting.

5,Rome Total War,14136172,english,"I have sunk over 200 hours of my life into this game, and guess what? Every last one was enjoyable. RTW is my favorite title by Creative Assembly, and my favorite real time strategy game as a direct result. The main thing most people sink hours into is the Imperial Campaign, which can last an upwards of 20 hours per campaign if drawn out. Your goal is simple, conquer 50 territories in the known world, and of course, Rome. The most focus in this mode has obviously been given to the Romans, as they have unique mechanics in the campaign, such as the ever hostile senate, the Civil War, the reforms of Gaius Marius, and so on. This isnt to say the other possible factions are any less far to play, far from it in fact. Playing as Carthage, you have access to mighty war elephants, the Greeks get their Spartans, the Germanians get Bezerkers, everyone has a unique element that mixes up gameplay in a way that forces you to adapt different strategy for each campaign. The AI for battles can either be brilliant, or mind numbingly awful, depending upon the difficulty you set it to. However if you want a real challenge, you are going to have to take your skills online. Despite being a very old title, there still is a good chunk of people playing this online. Most of them are experienced veterans, so dont be too upset if they wipe the floor with you the first couple of battles.

Vanilla RTW is a very good game for its time. It spits in the face of history in most cases, it is not well balanced in many cases (for instance, Roman calvary are better in 9/10 situations than similarly priced Roman infantry), but it's still worth playing.

NOW ITS MODS

Its mods are amazing. The Europa Barbarorum mod (google it) is absolutely phenomenal. There are also two excellent LOTR mods set in different eras. 

DOWNLOAD EUROPA BARBARORUM. It is one of the best mods I have ever played. It has a tremendous focus on historical accuracy and was painstakingly researched. It's the sort of mod that should of gotten the developers a full time development studio, it just reeks of quality. 

You will get 60+ hours into EB and then give up because, well, the enemy combat AI just can't keep up, and that apparently is an issue that is hardwired in and can not be improved significantly through moding.

I must say though, if you want a real challenge, go download the 'DarthMod' for Rome: Total War, It has a few fixes and a few relacements, adds/removes a few thigns that makes the game more challenging than the original.

82,Rome Total War,13506769,english,"Even 12 years after its release, Rome: Total War continues to have a surprisingly large online community, outsizing those of more modern TW games such as Empire. My brother and I still have regular matches; he's the only one who's ever beaten me, and even now we're on par.

Rome is a fantastic game. Its controls are easy to master, the campaign map and in-game menus are well-organised and easy to manage. A wide variety of factions and units mean you can fight using any strategy you like, and the higher difficulties provide a genuine challenge for even the most seasoned players. If you haven't quite got the hang of the real-time 3D battle map (which is gorgeous for its time), you can practice in a Custom Battle or automatically resolve a conflict in the campaign map. If you're only playing for a short period of time and want to make campaign progress, this acts as a good time-saver. However, losses in an auto-resolved battle tend to be higher than in one you manage yourself; as such, I would recommend using the manual battle map.

All in all, Rome provides an incredible gaming experience, and I still enjoy it more than a decade after its release. While it may have been outshone by more modern TW games, Rome as a standalone game has aged well, is still fun to play and is now REALLY cheap in the Steam Store.

83,Rome Total War,13504325,english,"This game is by far, my favorite game. Hands down, no competition. It is old, but I've yet to see any other strategy game come close to this. The graphics are decent, considering its age. The gameplay is complex enough to not be bored and just steamroll through everything, yet simple enough to actually know how to use every feature this game has to offer. 

The game is basically you controlling a faction during the time of the Roman Republic, and trying to become the best nation. Diplomacy is simple and allies will betray you constantly, unless you would just completely dominate them (and even then, they still might attack you!) The AI is pretty simple to defeat, their entire strategy seems to be just throwing all of their units at you and seeing who wins. 

The challenges come when you get into the Roman Civil War. This is an in-game event where the 4 roman factions fight each other for control of Rome. Up until this point, you've just been steamrolling through barbarians with your heavy legionnaires. Once the Civil War starts, you're fighting 3 other roman factions (2 of which have just as much land as you if not more, each) and they have the same troops as you. If you're not playing a roman faction then this will never happen, but it's called ROME total war for a reason. 

If you're into strategy games, buy this game. Even if you're not, you should at least give it a try. The controls might be difficult to use at first, but the tutorial is very helpful.

Even if you play the campaign mode in easy, it will still ask you to stay vigilant about risks of rebellion in your very own town and keep your countryside safe with legions camps and don't waste your money.
The campaign is very long ,I haven't finished it yet and been playing for 3 hours and I haven't conquered any land yet.
The AI is really challenging and even in easy you have to pay attention on your troops managment.

The only negative part and the main default of the game is that I have already encoutered several nasty crashes while playing, I don't know if it's due to the core of the game being inadapted for windows 8 computers or the Steam client.

Regardless the graphics and crashes it's a great game and it's worth the 4 euros I've payed, if you're looking for a strategy game with plenty of actions and historic go for it with blind eyes.

99,Rome Total War,13428879,english,"For me, this has to be the definitive Total War Game.

Rome Total War is in many ways a much better game than those that followed it. The combat and mechanics are fairly straightforward, while not being overly simplified and the campaign managment is streamlined and not overly burdensome (completely unlike RTW2.)

While not perfect in all ways, it is fairly easy to mod things yourself, in order to change things around a bit. Want to give barbarian tribes paved roads and stone walls? Easy to do and takes less than five minutes. 

Roman units and hoplites are a bit OP and the IA can be a bit stupid at times, but all in all, the game provides many hours of enjoyable play, while the combat animations are far more realistic and weighty than those using the more recent Total War Engine.

Even after all these years I can still spend hours on it without getting bored. The combination of turn based strategy on the campaign map and real time strategy during the battles gives you a lot of freedom and allows you to be creative while reaching your campaign goal.
Although, once you've figured out the AI's flaws you can beat the game at the hardest difficulty fairly ""easy"" (I can understand this might be a turn down for some people) but it will still take a lot of time to do so, especially the full campaign games.

Or you could also get RTW II as it has been fixed, regardless both are good buys. For RTW though id recommend getting really any mod with it to expand the campaign as its kinda yeah, but hell it was ""the first"" TW game that really sold. This game is just sheer badassness all the way, when you carve your way through either the Macedonian phalanx, the Raving Gauls, and the Carthaginian Elpehants, which hilariously can turn on their own allies, its funny. Not only are there amazing battles, but also you have to think and actually manage your cities, its not just a blitzkreig, since you need to move governors (if you want to control the settlement intself) and much more other stuff. Like taking don shrines of other religions, making that town your religion etc. The first time I played the campaign, I Literally took over Gaul as the Julii in lightning speed. But my economy got raped, so i had to use cheats to dig me out, which was kind of a pussy thing to do, but then I learned. If you wanna play something else than vanilla I would also recommend Rome Toal Realism VII, as it is also pretty epic. Not only are there a kabagillion cities, but there are also some other factions. Now back to the game, the multiplayer is also quite solid, it has never crashed on me or bugged out (except when my peers had shiz interent). But I would assume you would come here to either play the campaign, or download a mod for it as its multiplayer, is generally dead, unless you have someone to play with. Yet it still lives on, since this game is such a f@cking masterpiece. So im just giving this 10/10, because its so freaking awesome.

It builds upon the old structure and enhances it to the extent that the vanilla/original game appears cartoonish and amateurish in comparison. 

For anyone who has wondered time and again why for instance our ancient Romans seem to be popularly portrayed extensively in a modern UK english accent, (for some bizarre reason), you'll be happy to hear true latin, ancient greek and celtic languages.

26,Rome Total War,12200648,english,"Let's start with a confession. When Rome Total War was released I didn't buy it, didn't play it. Turn based sounded boring, I wanted real-time because that was cool. So when did I first play it? After Rome 2 was announced, I wanted to play with the ancient world but release was still months away. Then the release was utter garbage. Thus I turned to Rome Total War.

So lets start with the TL;DR part.
Good: The feel of combat. It's not fast, a bit to slow but formations collide. 
Good: Size, this game is huge. Large amount of provinces as well as factions. Improvement over Shogun 2, stuck in Japan.
Good: Atmosphere, Senate missions as Rome, three seperate factions. Lots of different other factions too.
Good: Mods, mods, mods. There some excellent mods out there for this game.

Bad: Graphics, the graphics sure aged. Then again it's an old 3D game, they rarely age well.
Bad: AI, AI isn't the smartest. The game is easily gamed, then again newer Total War's still are.
Bad: Egypt. Egypt was greek at the time, not pharaohs, well not styled like the rulers of old. Just graphics but I'll mention it anyway.
Bad: Resolution, no real widescreen support and no 1080p at all. Highest I can get is 1600x1400.

So should I still get it? Well it's different for sure. I got into it after I played Medieval 2, Empire, Shogun 2 and Fall of the Samurai. I could make the journey back and was pleasantly suprised. On the other hand my main gaming PC wasn't very available at the time and I played mostly on a laptop. So older games was something I was stuck with either way.

Give it a shot if you like ancient history, a slower strategy game and long battles. If you like historical accuraccy give Europa Barborium a spin. From a pure gameplay perspective it has an overwhelming amount of units, recruitment, moving and battles take ages but it's sure authentic.

This is a great game, it has aged but not to much. It's deep but not to deep and I'm sort of sad the path Total War games have been taken lately.

Every battle that you choose to participate in (you can auto-resolve if you want, generally in the case of overwhelming odds) is epic. So you routed the enemy army?

1 point less for the NAT issues in multiplayer and the fact the multiplayer part is now even dead.
Originally it should not work anymore because the Gamespy service shutdown, but it still works somehow, the strong MP community is desperated though.

Graphics 4 of 10

It's a really old game and the first total war game with 3D units instead of animated 2D sprites so you can't expect much in the way of graphics. and what you expect is what you get.

Learning curve (the lower the number the less learning curve there is) 5 of 10

The tutorials are good and the game is fairly simple to get into. This game has some learning curve for those who have never played any other RTSes but for those who have played other RTSes before they will have no problem getting into this game's controls.

Gameplay (on the battlefield) 7.5 of 10

Pros.

+Siege battles are very fun and challenging without being too hard.
+Land battles are Fun and tactical without being too hard.
+The AI is very good for a game of this age and can keep up with human opponents.

Cons

-some units are a bit over-powered such as elephants.
-some units are completely worthless unless under very specific circumstances such as the incendiary pigs that are only effective against elephants and have a tendency to kill more of your own people then the enemy’s that are killed due to the attack.and they do the same thing that a barrage of fire arrows from your archers could do.

Overall the land battles are very fun to play and are even better if you can find a human opponent to play with (CA recently migrated this game to steam due to the gamespy shutdown.)

Gameplay (Grand campaign) 4.5 of 10

Pros. 
+can be very fun when everything works well in tandem.

Cons
-Very dated
-It is nigh imposable to keep your budget in check when at war.
-diplomacy is clunky
-auto-resolving battles tends to end with your army losing a battle that anyone could win when controlling the units themselves.

Overall the campaign is good at times and really bad at others.

Overall 7 of 10.

Rome Total War is a game of two qualities; on one hand the battles are great and fun to command, on the other side the campaign is clunky, and not all that great at all. The good does outweigh the bad however. I completely recommend this game as custom and historical battles circumvent the horrid campaign and go to what is great about Rome Total War the combat.",1416547470,1416548890,TRUE,4,0,0.502306819,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,1157,13,671,0,407,1584333612

55,Rome Total War,13015027,english,"You may be wondering I have not recomendded total war.  Well the reason for that is quite simple.  If i had just recomended it, then my review would have been lost among a sea of other reviews that also recomend it.  Hopefully someone somewhere will actually see this because its in a much smaller pool.  Anyway Rome total war is an excellent game, tatics while rather straightforward most of the time are realistic and you need to have a basic understanding of strategy to beat the AI on anything above easy.  Every faction has different unit compositions to use so your tatics will have to change on subsequent playthroughs.  Basically Rome Total war has a stunning amount of depth and historical accuracy put into it.  While the graphics don't hold up a decade later, the gameplay is superior to even the sequel Rome TW 2 which came out several months ago.  This game is worth the full price even today, and if your looking to get into total war, or getting your friends into total war, this is a great starting point or gift respectively.  To give you some basic tatics, rome's usual goal is to when not facing phalanxes just mash your infantry into the enemy, as your infantry are essentially the greatest in the world.  While there is more to it then that namely using light infantry to hold your flanks whilst heavy infantry splits the enemy down the center, using your cavaly to take out enemy seige weapons or to flank a phalanx, thats all there is to it.  When playing as greece your goal is to not get flanked, as you have the most powerful phalanxes in the world and will almost never lose if you don't get flanked.  Carthages goal is to use elephants and support cavalry to literaly blow holes in the enemy line and crush enemy morale, whilst your infantry pin the enemies center or flanks in place, depending on the lay of the land.  If your parthia you want to make the enemy chase you and use hit and run tactics as you have the best cavalry in the world, and the greatest horse archers to ever live.  and so on.

While my steam play is only about 10 hours, I used to play this game back when you would goto the store to buy a computer game (or the fifth grade). That being said, I've easily put hundreds of hours into this game over the years.
This game was the first of the total wars I've played and stands second to maybe the newer versions of total war games. 
Smooth interactions on the campain and battle maps make navigation and stratgy easy. The A.I. can be easy at times but ramp up the difficulty and you may find yourself in a tricky spot during your campain. The game offers many different factions with a big yet easy to follow diplomacy setting and notifications to allow you to build up your own faction. 
Today the Mulitplayer is acomplishable but unless you have a freind that plays you probably wont find another player.
The steam version is up to date as you would expect and is a great  and cheap way to break anyone into the total war experience without beating an older PC to death with the high demands of shogun 2 (awesome game as well) and Rome 2 (which was dissapointing).

The music and the sounds are amazing.  The graphics of units engaging are amazing for the number of units on screen at one time.  I will admit that after I had captured Spain, the battles were getting kind of vanilla (distract with infantry, flank with cavalry), but when I went to different lands, the enemies had different units that challanged me in ways that I had to adjust my tactics.  One of my favorite moments was getting surrounded by two armies whose combined total manpower was more than my army.  I went into the battle thinking that I was going to get slaughtered, but the two armies were separated by a large distance, so I pushed my army to close the distance and engage the smaller army before the larger army could come up behind me.  There was an urgency to break the smaller army and get my units turned around and in position to engage the larger army (which btw was still larger than my army).  I was able to win but just barely.

86,Rome Total War,11933178,english,"  I was never a strategy gamer.  I always played Call of Duty, Medal of Honor, God of War, and so on and was reluctant to ever play a strategy game.  The few games that I did play which were strategy were Halo Wars and Endwar and both were not my cup of tea.  The execution and view of them were not of my taste.  It was games like this that deterred me from the strategy genre for many years, until my sophomore year of high school.  I was watching a History video in class about Spartacus' rebellion and recognized footage used in the documentary that was obviously lifted from a game.  I knew for some reason that it had to be Rome: Total War.  I don't know what it was, but I just felt the impetus to buy it.  As luck would have it, it was on sale for a dollar on Steam (with Alexander included).  I came into it thinking it would just offer the same as any other strategy game.  Was I ever wrong.
   I have an exceptional ability to tell whether a game is good or not and my misjudgement of Rome was rather monumental.  Unlike many strategy games which are either turn based or real time, Rome: Total War was a mixture of both. There is a campagin map which is turn based-driven where the player can move armies, spies, assassins, diplomats, and ships.  There are a number of cities which are capitals to regions that the player can come to control by conquering the city.  There is a little depth with the utilization of resources for income for the faction the player controls.  Players can also spy on other factions' settlements, take part in diplomacy with either leaders or other diplomats, assassinate individuals, or blockade ports to cities.  The campaign map is far from static between turns.  
   Nevertheless, the charm of Rome is not the campaign map but the battle map.  This is by far the best part of any total war game for me.  I am glad that I played Rome: Total War before any other strategy game because I would have missed out on the dynamic battles which the player get to partake in.  There are basically three flavors of battle:  siege, field, and ambush.  Battles range from besieging cities to fighting in other locals on the campaign map.  If an army is position in a forest, it has the ability to ambush an army.  This is a game changer for it could result in a force of fewer soldiers to defeat a whole legion of the Roman Empire.  The normal battles in the diverse terrains of Rome: Total War are a spectacle to be witnesses.  The player has the ability to either decimate an enemy army or survive the onslaught and exxecute a brilliant last stand.  Fans of ancient warfare and 300 will most definitely enjoy Rome in this regard.  Sieges offer a different style of play.  Siege operate both on the campaign and battle maps.  The player can create multiple siege weapons and assault the city he or she besieges after blockading the city for a number of turns.  Having units scaling the walls of a city or busting through a gate is satisfying.  The most enjoyable part of battles (and from one source I read it seems to be a valid claim) is when two battle lines collide.  The player feels the impact and the game is made just that much better for witnessing such a spectacle.
   As with any game there are a few weak points.  For example, naval battles are nonexistent and the player can only approach each naval confrontation with a auto-resolve action.  It really takes away from the game.  Also, the game is not historically accurate to any extent.  Various historical events, save for the Marian reforms and various natural disasters, have no real effect on gameplay.  Also, the AI of other factions is not the greatest.  You'll partake in many battles where you'll be wondering if the AI was really trying or not.  Also, there is the issue that two factions, the Britons and Egyptians, are just overpowering and end up conquering half of the map by mid-game.  It does provide a challenge but it is really annoyting when they eliminate most other factions before you get to meet them; i. e. Parthia.  As a matter of fact, the only time I got to fight the Parthians was when I was playing as the Seleucids.  Another big failing of the game is the monopoly on unit advancement and power that Roman Factions have.  There are basically four Roman factions.  This means that no matter how you play the game, by the latest turns, the whole world will be ruled by Romans.  Again, this takes away the ability of the player to fight a diverse multitude of enemy types.  Exacerbating the issue is the Marian reforms effect on the Roman faction.  It basically turns all of the units into damage sponges.  This would have been okay if other factions were able to advance in such a faction but that isn't the case.  The most sad case is Gaul.  Gaul can get most of its highest level units before the Marian reforms take place.  However, that is only because it has fewer unit choices than the Roman, Carthage, and Seleucid factions.  I understand that it may have been made this way to bolster faction diversity but nevertheless it breaks gameplay for Gaul.
  Now with all these problems considered, I now bring to light the most exciting part about Rome: Total War: the mods.  There are so many good mods out there.  Note, these go well beyond a few stat changes and skins for units.  There are overhauls, historical mods, fantasy mods, etc.  Among the most prominent are Europa Barbarorum (a history buff's mod), Roma Surrectum (a Roman buff's mod), Fourth Age: Total War (a Tolken buff's mod), and Terrae Expugnandae (a truly interesting mod).  There is even a Napoleonic era mod with actual units that use rifles.  The modding community is similar to that of Skyrim in that mods are available at many hubs dedicated to mods.  The ability to use mods in Rome just makes that dollar purchase that more worth it.
   Rome: Total War is one of those quintessential games that needs to be played by everyone that has a PC.  It encompasses many aspects of strategy games and does not fail to deliever on the ancient Mediterranean theme.  You'll scream yells of excitement and aggravation as you play it.  The replayability is astronomical, especially with the use of mods.  I currently have a total of 544 hours of gameplay logged by Steam.  However, I've see numbers as high as 1000.  If you buy this game, I guarantee that you won't regret it.

89,Rome Total War,11856687,english,"Ah, Rome. I never played it at launch or for years after the fact, but it was always on my friends computer. Which he was of course one of those little wank-jobs that always showed off his shit but never shared it.
	
No, about 2012 was really the first time I got to play R:TW, my first TW title being Medieval 2. 

Nowadays, people often say just get EB or any of the number of great mods. However, we're talking about Rome here, the base game as presented on Steam.

First off, with this purchase you get both Rome 1 (which follows Roman history from before the first Punic War to the early Imperial age) and the expansion Barbarian Invasion (which follows, of course, the invasions of barbarian tribes during the decline of the Roman empire). You don't receive the expansion Alexander (the campaigns of Alexander the Great) but of all the Rome expansions- Alexander is often regarded as the poorest by both critics and fans.

Rome 1 provides all the basics of a TW title. A campaign map where you conquer a part of the world. A skirmish game-mode where you fight the AI in a battle of choice. And Multiplayer (Now patched for steamworks as of 2014). Barbarian Invasion supplies the same package.

Within the Campaign Map you choose one of three Roman Families at first. This is where I start to have some gripes with Rome. For one, you have to conquer the other factions to unlock them in the grand campaign. Two, even if you just edit the .ini files to unlock them, the campaign is heavily focused on Rome. They get the most units, the most mechanics, the most events, and the most progression. While it's perfectly possible to enjoy playing the underpowered Gauls, I find these other factions to be relatively abandoned by CA. Some factions feel relatively the same, such as the Gauls and Germans, with only minor unit variations to give some feel to them.  Also of note is that some factions are simply over-powered beyond conceivable belief. Units such as Rome's Urban Cohorts are just horrifying when placed against the AI. This can make Rome somewhat of a snooze-fest once the Marius Reforms activates and you start to get the best of the Roman crop. Other factions such as Gaul have laughably garbage infantry for the most part. While some argue historical accuracy, I find it harms the game balance and the ultimate enjoyment available. But a discussion on Rome's balance is way beyond the scope of this review, suffice it to say, Rome is unbalanced- but it rarely matters in single player.

If however you only care for Rome, then RTW is for you. Each of the three families starts with an 'obvious' foe and paths of expansion. The Senate functions as a uniting force, rewarding you for following orders, showing disapproval when you fail. The whole game is built around your family as you grow both your empire and your influence. The game provides some great role-play as you follow the Senate's orders, checking to see if the masses or the patricians prefer you. As you progress, so will your power- inevitably enraging the Senate. It's moments like these where the campaign starts to shine. While I won't spoiler where that ultimately leads to, it justifies the slow start to the Imperial campaign.

Speaking of the campaigning, the conquest of towns is fought on the battle map. Here you command your army, including your general if he's there, and engage the enemy. This is where the meat of the game is, and here where Total War makes its name. The battles are some of the fastest in the series, with units moving rapidly and viciously. Veteran units can stomp multiple newbie corps single-handedly. A single cavalry charge can lead to a rapid route. All this occurs to the excellent soundtrack of Jeff van Dyck and combat mechanics that (mostly) stand the test of time.

I have a gripes here when compared to the later Total War games. For one, field battles (where units meet with no city or the like nearby) are unfortunately not too common in the later stages of the Campaign. This is due to the AI choosing the hide in cities. Due to this, you get to meet the siege battles of Rome- which are terrible. I'm not going to dance around this issue, siege battles are awful. The path finding of your units is all sorts of agony, and it only gets worse if you fight civilized nations that have large, built-up cities. You can have entire units enter into embarrassing formations where a handful of men are trying to take down a hoplite wall. It's funny, but it's hell. Siege battles can be ignored due to the great auto-resolve system Rome has, which can be used for field battles too.

Unfortunately, I have issues with unit path-finding in general. Cavalry especially is very cumbersome compared to later titles. You will just have to get used with Cav occasionally ignoring your orders and charging head-long into spear-walls instead of between that wide-gap in the line. Also, units randomly charging other units instead of the ones you ordered them to is also common- this includes cav. It makes the control feel archaic, and from what I've researched it just seems to be a bug with the formations. It's annoying and often makes me just go towards Medieval 2 and download a Rome mod (EB2, I'm forever hyped). It isn't game-breaking since the AI is just...

Meet CA's AI, from Rome to Rome 2 you're going to be playing with him. He's mentally insane, tuned seemingly for players that have no clue about formation tactics. The moment you figure out strategy, is the moment you realize that the AI is helplessly innocent, inept, incapable of learning, a terrible judge in terrain choice, a terrible flanker, and perhaps suicidal to boot. He's come in many different flavors- but really only modders seem capable of making him remotely competent. Increasing the difficulty will not make him smarter, only gives him a boost in unit stats. For a newbie, he's a good first opponent for casual player, but he won't teach you anything.

What is not a flaw of the series is its presentation. Rome's simplistic art direction may have aged polygonal graphics but it still holds up relatively well, appearing distinguished and fluid despite being a game from 2004. It's a standard that's been kept by just about every title. The music, which I've only mentioned once, is some of the best in the series, bringing a lot of those aged graphics to life with broad stroke of tunes. Even the voice-acting has some charm, in the hammy sense.

But we're not done, BI rounds out our package by being fucking painful. It's a campaign for barbarian lovers giving great variety to the barbars while still making Rome a fun faction. Notably a bit more balanced in the campaign the Western Rome campaign is one of the hardest challenges in TW history. It's meant only for series vets, even then it's infamous for the horror it gives. My personal opinion of it is that it's hard in the arbitrary sense, with unrest and religion stacking the deck on you. The AI isn't any smart notably (can land units by sea if the stars align). Most of the difficulty comes from rebellions, but the various barbarian tribes declaring war on you adds some fun. This campaign is historically inaccurate in it's portrayal of what troubled Rome. This is mostly due to the engine being incapable of modeling certain things. Historical inaccuracy is just a common thing in TW as it is- but I'm someone capable of ignoring this in favor of fun. BI besides the difficulty, is a neat addition to Rome and where I say barbarian lovers should go in lieu of the RTW.

Still, RTW offers a great package for TW newbs. Introducing you to the series with a game that still holds up, with great modding potential. For the gripes I have, RTW is still a great game. If you have to choose a TW, go with an era that interests you most. All of them have pros and cons. Between Rome 1 and 2? You get a complete product with R1 that is fully patched and 'done'. No dlcs, no patches ruining your mods, same era.

92,Rome Total War,11791903,english,"As a newcomer to the Total War series, I must express just how enthralled I am by the gameplay of Rome: Total War. It is an impressive strategy game that lets you live out those dreams of amassing a large army. Now these armies can be massive, carrying at least 1,200 soldiers, and don't even get me started on the reinforcements. However, it's not just a mere 'pick up and play' sort of game. This is a game that requires thinking, as a turnbased strategy game. You start off with a faction in the imperial campaign, where you are then given a large map of Europe that is populated with other factions of that time, such as the Greek, Egyptians, Gauls, Spanish, and many more. 

It is up to you to conquer Europe and extinquish all other factions from the competition. You can also choose to become allies with a few of these factions, if you want. The diplomacy feature in this game provides heaps of options, from trade rights with other factions, to extortion, or you can tell other factions to attack your rivals.

Each faction has its own economy, but I won't get into that. Admittedly, I'm not very good at this part. This requires constructing certain buildings to improve income, such as shrines to Jupiter or crops. You can choose to have each settlement have its own taxation. But set it too low, and your citizens may revolt and start an uprising. This is a game that requires lots of patience, and your experience should not be rushed. But there is no joy greater than conquering that final Spanish settlement, sending hundreds of infantry troops to slaughter them, while your archers lie back, and bring fire to the various buildings until finally, you have wiped their existence from the face of the Earth.

0,Rome Total War,11748963,english,"This game is on my Top 5 Games of All Time List.

Let's start with the presentation. This Games graphics are out dated, but the attention to detail and polish are abundant. Nothing was more satisfying then watching my cavalry charge send individual men flying. The world map is kind of bland, but you have a pretty good idea of what the terrain is. All of the cities are (or were) real cities, and many you may already know of. This game is a very well researched game. There are many historical troop types and landmarks. I can't even imagine how much time was put in to making this game as historically accurate as possible.
Overall, this is a well-presented game.

Now let's look at gameplay. This games battle system is hands down the best I have seen in any RTS ever. The attention to detail is astounding. Certain troops counter others, this is in other games. However, different formations and tactics can turn the tables on your so-called counters. You can be a regular Cesar if you play your cards right. The AI is not the sharpest tool in the shed, especially when it comes to troop movement. I have missed a table-turning oppurtunity in many a battle due to a units slow response or incorrect followthrough of an order. It could be said that this makes the game more realistic, but that doesn't make it any less frustrating. The game can be played in single or multiplayer player mode. Single player has three functions: Campaign, Custom battles, and Historical battles. The Campaign can be played as one of the three Roman factions at first and later other factions. Not every faction can be played as-at least not in th vanilla-which is a shame as many unique factions were left out. The campaign takes place over a world map as you and the other factions take turns building and managing an empire. The campaign is extremely immersive. Players personalities are reflected in how they play the game. I can be impatient, but I also am a procrastinator. As a result, I would impatiently blitz one enemy, then stand around repelling the attacks of another. The goals of the game are dependent on what type of campaign tou chose. A short one has small goals while a long one has large. Overall the campaign is the best part of the game. The custom battle option is fun for experimenting with new tactics or just goofing around. It is not something you will spend a ton of time on though. The Historical battles are just that, battles from history. They put you in the shoes of real ancient commanders in battles that actually took place. They're fun, but not very replayable. The multiplayer is the second best function of the game. It allows you to play online in battles with other players. The type of battles vary, from sieges to free-for-alls. There are even some historical battles exclusive to multiplayer. Overall, the multiplayer is great for when you want a change of pace.

Over all, this game has a good presentation, pays attention to detail, and is highly immersive, the best ten bucks you'll ever spend. 9.5/10

68,Rome Total War,11229255,english,"For an old game, it's pretty well made and executed. Definitely worth 10 bucks.

I used to watch a lot of Rome Total War let's plays and I got pretty excited when I was able to download this from steam. The game starts you out playing as one of the three Roman factions, all of their intros distinct and unique. As I started the campaign I had a mixed sense of awe and fear. My first playthrough as the Brutii I enjoyed ravaging the cities of Macedon, Thrace and Greece. I did play on easy but there were some battles along the way that had suprised me and kept me emotionally invested in my campaign forth to the east. I remember countering the Phalanx heavy armies of Greece, Thrace, and Macedon, with skirmishers, artillery and archers whittling them down as they marched toward me. The same tactic worked for every battle with me always taking the hill. However I remember being annihilated by being caught in-between reinforcements and the main Macedonian army. I won, I lost, and I would never make the same mistake again.

After deciding to raise the stakes (Hard/Hard) and playing as a much less civilized faction (Germania) I found myself squished in-between the armies of Gaul, Britannia, and Dacia. I began my campaign reuniting the german people and invading what is now France and Britain and then proceeding into the territory that is known today as Austria. My empire was huge, to the west were the Spanish and to the east were the Scythians, and to the south were the Romans. With the Spanish and the Scythians at peace with me and Dacia all but scattered across the lands, I began my march into the Alps and into Rome itself.

For the Romans, it seemed too late, battle after battle I left their Hestati and Principe armies defeated and scattered, their war machines burnt to the ground and their cities pillaged and burned. They could not stop the hordes of horsemen nor the cries of the beserkers, Rome was crumbling. However, I faced as much more devastating enemy as I conquered their cities, holding them. There were constant rebellions and with the Romans building navies and giant army stacks at sea (and then landing in my territory) I had a rough time with them. When the Romans took a city, I couldn't take it back, simply because their walls were too strong to hold at siege. The Julii and the Scipii were battling the Numidians and the Carthaginians to the south, and then using the wealth from those campaigns to take back their homes. The Brutii were marching entire armies of Urban Cohorts, Legionaries, and the Praetorian Guard at my doorstep. Soon, my economy collapsed and I had begun to fear the threat of being overrun. I could take Rome, but could I hold it? After countless battles I eliminated the Julii and both the Brutii and Scipii were on the run. My armies all had silver/gold chevrons weapons and armor (upgrades) after such battles, so I was able to defeat many of their experienced warriors.

Then I decided to download Darthmod for Rome....

Every battle against the Romans was different than before and it had me running scared. I fought smaller army stacks and although I would outnumber them my men would leave the battle completely depleted. I couldn't auto-resolve otherwise I would end up losing and with the Egyptians, Pontus, Thracians, and the Spanish barbarians marching toward my gates I had one hell of a time. All in all, I had more fun than any other game I've played. The mods bring me back, and the battles are fantastic.

91,Rome Total War,11011234,english,"Rome's Legacy wasn’t built in a day, and the game that bears its namesake was not free from this either. Unlike the empire, however, Rome the game's glory was ripped from it in a single moment---Rome 2's release. 

For nearly a decade, we the true lovers of Rome awaited its fable return, and begged the gods of the Creative assembly to return to us our legions! After the wonderful gift of Shogun 2 we thought certainly that this would be given to us, and that it would be glorious. Now that all the other classics had been given sequels the greatest of them all certainly was overdue for a revisit. Rome 2 was not a Total War, but a Total Joke... Unless you count the design choices conflicting with your desire to enjoy pillaging all of Antiquity-- But that was about as much a war as the British fighting the Zulu; the Zulu being your enjoyment.

This prompted me to return to the original. Was it hard to put aside my Nostalgia to write this review? I would have to say nostalgia had no place in my experience with this game. For as many hours as I put in it all those years ago I can't say I had a plethora of memories to go on. Once I conquered Europe as the Saxons, and once I pitted Carthage against Egypt and both full stack armies were obliterated in an epic stalemate. These were my two favorite memories going into the game.
I started up Rome and went for the Expansion ""Barbarian Invasion"" first. I picked the faction I always played as back in the day and took on the Vandal horde. We marched south into the Baltics and settled in present day Croatia area. Eventually the ERE decided I wasn't fit to exist and attempted a Reconquista. A fifty-year war ensued where we engaged the enemy professional armies with our militia. Suffering through the great losses of our people we pushed south taking Thessalonica and Achaea. The war finally came to a close after the third Siege of Constantinople took the city, and destroyed the ERE's last European Legion, and subjugated the most powerful city in the world during this point in history.

The fledgling Vandal Kingdom of the Baltics established and independence now secure I reset the clock (And the game) to play the Vanilla. 
I decided to go a different route than I did when I was younger. Instead of picking Carthagians, or Scipii; I picked the Brutii. It took me a total of 6 minutes to realize what I just did. I was playing the Roman faction that was tasked to take the same exact lands as my Vandal kingdom had taken in the Expansion. I was essentially building the same ERE I would invade centuries later as the Vandals.  

As I am still in the middle of my conquest of the Greek-Macedonian Alliance, I can’t really say that I curb-stomped them... In fact Athens remains defiant and un-siegeable from a practical standpoint. While the Greek armies of Athens  send every one of my Legions home completely rekt, the Macedonians force our defending armies to either remain garrisoned, or all-together abandon settlements to defend more critical points against the armies of the sons of Alexander at our gates.... Eh, at least the Senate likes me.

So obviously I enjoy the game. I knew that before I even re-bought it on steam the other day. Despite being a decade old the game gets a ten for just the enjoyment. But I'm so confident in this game I am going to take it the extra mile and rate it like it was released a month ago, and compare it directly to Rome 2.
Pros-

-Competent AI
So the AI will not be winning any genius competitions, but put Rome’s AI up against Rome 2's AI and it will mop the floor with Rome II's pretty-boy face. Not only does this apply to the battles but the Campaign AI will actually give the player legitimate trouble.

-Soundtrack
Good, solid, mood setting music that changes based on the situation.  This music will get you PUMPED, and you'll remember these tracks for a lifetime. The track number is a little lacking in quantity, but quality is perfect. Medieval 2 might be the only one that can beat it.

Units-
The Roman factions all have the same units just painted different colors, but the Foreign factions are all unique to some extent. And don't think any faction is left out. Each one has their own death machines. Carthage has elephants, Egypt and Britain have Chariots, Greeks and Macedonians have Hoplites-- All of which will thoroughly ruin your day with brutal efficiency. The Barbarian Expansion scores a little lower on this to me, But the expansion still gets clearance on this issue

Religion-(Barbarian Invasion only)
This is a very simple religion system where the player can convert to a new religion at any point. Ironically the people will convert much, much faster than the player's own royal family. In short it's simple, but works.

Engine- This Engine was designed for this type of game; Rome II's was designed for EMPIRE's Ranged based combat. Though the clashes can be anti-climactic at times; you'll never get the ridiculous mosh pit of Shogun 2 and Rome 2. 
Animations are also nothing to write home about, but they function, and don't jump around for kill animations.

General Speeches-
Yes. THIS IS HOW YOU DO GENERAL SPEECHES PEOPLE.
Cons- 
Graphics- Graphics are dated, but it's a decade old; Since I said I was Rating this as if it was last month I can't not count this.

..... ummm.... come on that can't be it...

Diplomacy- All total war games fail here, it functions but the AI can act a fool on a regular basis. the only TW game with decent diplomacy is probably Shogun 2.
Seriously there’s not much to find wrong with this game. If you like Grand-Strategy and/or RTS this game is the one for you. Is it my favorite Total War game? Um, no I can't say it's my favorite, but it is the original champion. It didn't earn that honor form being a PoS. It was the first one I played back a decade ago, and it echoes a long forgotten day that CA had more pride, love, and passion for this title. Back then it was their baby, and it shows.
for $9.99 Rome and the expansion is an investment any lover of strategy will not regret.

If it was released last month:

Modern Day Score- 7/10

Overall and timeframes aside:
Final Verdict- 8/10 

When all is said and done Rome has aged moderatley well. While it does show it's age; the old man it more than capable of holding it's own and even going toe-to-toe with modern titles. It is the Jack of all trades, but a master of none.

Barbarian Invasion, the expansion included in the gold edition, details the demise of the Roman empire through the invasion of various playable barbarian factions.

13,Rome Total War,10852902,english,"i had two problems running this game on windows 8.1 64 bit (first: game doesn't launch, only a black screen and then returns to desktop; second: problem ""Failed to find Steam""). I finally managed to resolve both, so in case some of you have the same problems, here i post the solutions. I tried many solutions i found on internet:


-copied the Steam.dll file from C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam
-deleted the ClientRegistry.blob file from C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam (Make sure you are not logged on Steam when doing this).
-tried every possible compatibility mode, but not working
-tried disabling steam community in game from game properties on steam
-tried the solution down here.
     1: Right-click on ""Computer"" (in XP it was called ""My Computer"") and click on Properties.

    2: in Vista / 7, on the left click on ""Advanced System Settings"". On XP, Google search for how to change your system path, because I can't quite remember where things were in XP.

    3: In the Advanced tab, you'll see a button for ""Environment Variables"". Click it.

    4: In the upper section of that new window, you should see something like ""User Variables for [your username]"". Scroll through to find the one called ""PATH"".

    5: Highlight the entry for ""PATH"" and click ""Edit..."".

    6: You'll get a too-small text box that has a field on the top for ""Variable Name"" and a field under it for ""Variable Value"". Put your cursor into the ""Variable Value"" field and hit the [End] key so you know you're not inserting text in the middle of another entry. If you push the right arrow key it should not scroll.

    7: Add a semicolon [;] to separate your new entry from the others. This is the key to the right of the 'L' key, without      pressing Shift. Correct -> ; Incorrect -> :

    8: Paste in the path to Steam, which for me on a default-install Windows 7 64 system is: C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam

    9: Press OK, and re-launch Steam so that it gets the new environment variables. (It might work without re-launching, but hey why not.)

    10: Run the game normally!

-finally, i changed the default setting for the use of integrated or dedicated video card, to integrated (mine is Intel HD4000).




After all this passages and a system reboot, now the game starts. I don't know exactly if only one or more together of the above solutions was the key, but i know that if you do all of that, the game will start.

51,Rome Total War,10629101,english,"This game is one of the best grand strategy games ever made. While light on diplomacy, this game focuses heavily on the latter two words of the title: Total War.

Starting out in 270 BC, you take the helm of one of the patrician families of Rome: the Julii, the Scipii, or the Brutii. While functionally the same, each one has you expanding the empire in a different direction, against different enemies. You must serve the Senate and People of Rome (the SPQR) during your campaigns if you are ever to realise your true final goal: domination of the other Roman families, and the siezure of Rome itself. After completing a campaign as one of the families of Rome, you unlock several new factions to play as, each with their own unique units, religious buildings, locations and much more.

The Good:
+Turn-based campaign map and real time battles keep the tempo just right. You'll never get bored or be bombarded with too much action.
+Very diverse factions, but the Romans typically are the best to start with, due to their favorable situation. More veteran players will like the other factions for their increased challenge.
+Challenging campaign that forces you to think about what you are doing, and hopefully not make decisions you'll regret.
+Graphics have aged well for a decade old game, and it runs very well on modern systems. Only very underpowered machines will struggle with this game.
+Music is intense and epic, and gives the battles a sense of awe when they are large enough.
+Battles are fun and can be very challenging. Don't be surprised if the AI outsmarts you sometimes!

The Bad:
-AI is not always very good. It does not handle sieges very well, and naval warfare is usually trivial as they rarely keep sizeable fleets. Also, weak factions will attack you (often the most powerful faction in the game) for seemingly no reason, and enemies on the brink of destruction will make outrageous demands to you, while your armies are at their doorstep.
-Diplomacy is very limited. You can make very limited demands and offers, make alliances and trade rights, but that's about it.
-Feed back from the game's building and condition descriptions are very poor, giving the player almost no feed back.

The Iffy Stuff (stuff that some people will like, others won't):
=The game is VERY long. Even a short campaign will run you a few hours, and you'll need to set aside a few days to do a long one. However, this means this cheap game will provide TONS of entertainment.
=The game is quite old, so some will scorn its simplicity, but others will like it.

Played it since my teen years, bought and played it again. Choose a Roman family, rise in status, fight barbarians, and seize power in Rome herself. Or you could be a barbarian heathen. Easily one of my favorite games in the series and one of the best RTS games of all time. 

The only problem perhaps is the autoresolve battle AI seems to leave a lot to be desired. However; if you wanted a turn based game I recommend The Republic of Rome Tabletop game (playable by your lonesome but better with friends you aren't afraid to lose) or your favorite Civilization. The Historical inaccuracy of certain aspects is also fairly blatant but it is forgiven due to the game being more about cinematic sword and sandal warfare than a rough simulation of historical events for that I recommend something by Paradox Interactive.

The game's strenghts lie in it's great battle system and it's fascinating overworld of intrigue. If you want a hardcore tactics game it can be that but there is also an arcade mode for people who just want to watch the sword fights but do not wish to get heavily involved in tactical movement.

58,Rome Total War,9959725,english,"Rome: Total War is what its title advertises, the Roman Empire (and the other factions that existed during that period) and the vast, complex and often overwhelming task of leading your chosen faction to greatness. The game is a unique blend of turn-based strategy and real time tactics that Creative Assembly has turned into an ever flourishing series that has earned its praise many times over.

You control everything from what buildings to construct in your cities, to which factions you want to conduct business with. That's the turn-based part. Where the ""real time tactics"" come in is when you fight a battle, commanding your units in real time, as you might have guessed.

As far as combat is concerned, it's solid to say the least. You have a great amount of control over your units, even being able to tell them where to move siege towers. However, there are, of course, flaws. It's always frustrating to have your soldiers attack enemies that you didn't send them after, especially when those enemies just happen to be the very thing that can chop your precious soldiers to bits.

The diplomacy also suffers a bit, since the AI tends to reject even the most reasonable offers, no matter how much they would profit from them, unless you have a diplomat with a high influence stat, which is gained through successful negotiations. This creates a vicious cycle of useless diplomats, leaving you to solve all matters with the sword, rather than the pen.

77,Rome Total War,9812915,english,"Possibly the best TW game on the market. It may just be me viewing it through nostalgia-tinted lenses, but this game definitelly surpassed the competition in my book.

Pros:
- Good unit variety, building variety, and so on.
- Far more colorful and vibrant than later entries.
- Good variety of civilizations.
- Decent dificulty curve.
- Replayable to almost infinity due to variety of strategems and civilizations.
- Decent modding community and re-works through dedicated websites.

Cons:
- Realism slightly lacking.
- Some balance issues in multiplayer (barbarians lack morale, phalanx beats any other unit one-on-one etc.).
- Poor diplomacy.
- Community has partially moved on to Medieval II and later, meaning less mods and reworks to add replayability that    otherwise.
- Graphics slightly dated.

In short, the game has much to reccomend it. The main complaint I find is that the game hasn't aged well compared to others, that the graphics are out of date etc. While some have a point, the old graphics have a certain charm and don't detract from the gameplay one bit. In fact, I take that as a point in their favor as it means that older systems can run the game without frying from the effort.

45,Rome Total War,9315514,english,"Rome: Total War is the oldest Total War game available on Steam, and can be considered the basis of the rest of the games which followed (although I would totally rebuy Medieval: Total War if they ever added that). In previous games, the overlying board played like a giant Risk board, where you moved armied from province to province, instead of having the entire campaign map laid out and moving your armies to specific locations. This was a DRAMATIC shift for the series, and one which really helped to establish it at something unique from other strategy games.

Like all Total War games that followed, you move your armies around the map to strategic locations in your turn, then the rest of the other players' turns elapse. At any point where two armies meet and fight, the option to autoresolve or fight on a tactical campaign map is provided, which is where the real-time portion of the game takes place.

Rome is also the first game in the series where the armies were polygonal as opposed to sprites, which was a RIDICULOUS feat for graphics at the time. It's still relatively streamlined compared to modern Total War games, but it still stands up to this day. It's an excellent, excellent game, and well worth playing even now, a decade after its release.

Now, at least twice in the past few years, I've thought about the game, reinstalled it, played it for a day or two, then uninstalled it again. Why? Because, really, in the end, I'm underwhelmed.

RTW CAN be a fun game. I've done multiplayer against friends, and enjoyed it immensely. I like the various units available. With the Roman factions, I like playing the various quests to win approval in the Senate and among the populace. I wouldn't call it the worst game in existence.

So why, then, am I still underwhelmed?

First, there are some serious problems with this game's battle mechanics. You will have to literally micromanage your units, and like 1-year old children you won't be able to leave them alone for a while, because if you do they will do amazingly stupid things. For example, I had a cavalry unit chase after some routing archers, went to another spot of the battlefield, then when I went back to the cavalry unit, I saw they had decided it would be an awesome idea to charge headlong into a line of spears, and were suffering tremendous casualties. This doesn't even cover that sometimes you could give individual units specific orders, and they'll just ignore you. Then there are some SERIOUS pathfinding issues. Units will take the most random routes to go from point A to point B, even when there shouldn't be an issue. The biggest example of this I can think of was one time when I was besieging a city, and was charging my men (who were not routing) down the main road in the city - apparently, ""go charge at the enemy right in front of you"" translated into ""turn around and head back outside of the city.""

Second, the campaign map part of the game will be annoying. Diplomacy is virtually USELESS. You could set up alliances with all your neighbors, get trade deals, and generally be peaceful...and then suddenly, for absolutely NO DISCERNABLE REASON, all your neighbors will, one by one, declare war on you. OK, fine, this game is called Total WAR, maybe that can be forgiven. However, none of your opponents will EVER accept a peace deal, even if you've destroyed all their armies in several embarrassing battles, and have taken all their cities except their capitol. You could offer them the best peace deal ever that would ensure their survival, and they would still say, ""Nope! Fight to the end!"" On top of this, naval battles are just annoying: while they automatically auto-resolve all naval battles, they rarely involve the complete destruction of one side. You could have a fleet of 300 sailors up against a fleet of 13 sailors, and it would still end with the enemy getting away somehow. Aside from blockading fleets, I end up just not caring about navy battles.

There are also some issues and bugs that I've noticed in the Steam version of RTW that I didn't see in the original RTW or its expansion. One of the biggest issues is that reinforcements seem to ALWAYS be delayed. Originally it was sporadic enough that it helped make the battles random and unpredictable...now, I no longer expect the reinforcements to come, because the minute I get into battle I get a notification that the reinforcements - either for me or the enemy - have been delayed.

In the end, RTW is just not an enjoyable entry into the TW series. After a certain point of wondering why a one-city nation decided it would be wise to launch an attack against my empire, or after the fifth time I've suffered casualties because my men are wandering around the battlefield like wet hens and ignoring what I told them to do, I lose all interest in playing it, and uninstall it.

Five years later, I still go back to it every now and then. I've had many a 14-hour marathon day playing Rome Total War, quite often back to back. I'm pretty sure I got a chance to play as every civilization before I switched computers and lost my progress. I've even gone through the Barbarian Invasion campaign a few times.

*My British faction leader, supported by two other armies, slaughters a quarter of the entire Brutii force over ten years, littering Poland with heroic victories. He eventually meets his end, known as ""the Legendary,"" defending a town against a Roman force three times his size. Succesfully.
*An elite squad of Berserkers sacrifice themselves on the walls of Rome itself, eliminating two entire legionary cohorts and flanking the wall's other defenders.
*Four hoplite units hold Sparta against a full-size Roman army, earning a 100:1 k:d ratio.
*My prize Egyptian army meets a humiliating defeat at the hands of Ponitc troops, navigates around the army, and marches straight into a Pontic city.
*A Roman town is betrayed by Spain's finest, throws them off every year for three years until reinforcements can come in and ravage Spain's western coast.
*A Carthaginian gambit to take Rome early fails miserably; a generation later, we're back with five armies that now include line-ravaging Armored Elephants.
*Betraying Rome by landing an army next to her city - as well as every other non-Brutii city on the peninsula, and bloackading every Roman port east of Palma.
*Falling in love with my faction heir, as he's my only general who can fight at night. He later on earns three bonus command stars at night, and sacks Constantine by the light of the moon.

The spectacular graphics and extensive detail behind each character and race.
Whether you choose to play as a Roman or a Gaul, each family member has their own traits and differences, so every new playthrough has it's own new experiences.
The battles are utterly amazing, whether you're flanking your enemy with cavalry, using your archers to hold off twice your men, or bringing reinforcements that either you or an AI can control.
Then there's the diplomatic side to it, you can put a spy in an enemy city in the hopes that when the time comes, they manage to open the gates for your men. Or, sending an assassin to kill an enemy captain, maybe send your diplomat to win over the enemy?
However you choose to play the game, it's up to you. But it is definetely worth the price tag! 8/10

34,Rome Total War,8745005,english,"Rome Total war is a rare breed. A realistic RTS game without the chaos of real life interfering with it. Historically, this game is fairly accurate, and the Roman fighting style lends itself to more user friendly battles. And here is where the game is such a drastic improvement on the previouse titles in the series.

Organised Chaos
Whether it is by phalanx or testeudo, the battles are a lot more organised than its predecessors. Battles are based on your ability to organise, coordinate and react to the adversity, more than the troops at your disposal. Gone are the morale sapping archers on the hill top and heavy cavalry charge from Medieval TW2 - Rome brings you a more balanced feel to the battle, even if it is elephants vs peasants.

Macro, not micro management
What I like most about Rome (and where they seem to have strayed from the path in more recent releases) is that these are strategy simulations, not population management games. The management evironment is simple and straight forward, the interface is both familiar and intuititve while still giving you the ability to go into more detail if those damn peasants insist on revolting every turn.

Rome is a great game to either pick up and play or delve into in for days on end. Rest assured there is a battle around every corner, usually where you least suspect it.",1389994443,1389994487,TRUE,4,0,0.498074561,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,91,2,4694,0,1379,1440103831

But this game is at its supreme best in terms of multiplayer which is still amazing nearly 10 years after its release this game got me into multiplaying full stop. It has a great variety of factions to choose from and with each having a very different approach to warfare which gives the game loads of different tactics and army builds to utilize and choose from. i advise this game to anyone who wants to play the Total War series it is amazing fantastic and just a brilliant experience which you will love if you like stratagy games.,1373896590,1388544129,TRUE,4,0,0.565217376,1,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,226,10,56115,0,6128,1594617381

94,Rome Total War,8400590,english,"With the failure of the recent Rome title, this game certaintly deserves another go. The game is set during ancient Europe, where the many factions of the time wage war for dominance. Many of these you can play, even so more with mods. The game does focus on the Romans however, and you can choose one of three families to play as to dominate your enemies and eventually become emperor of Rome by overthrowing the other families. The actual warfare itself requires tactical thinking, unlike other ""strategy"" games where you can mass-produce units and zerg the enemy, you must actually think about the positioning of your units as well as their strengths and weaknesses. Outside of actual combat, the game takes place on a map screen,similar to a Civ game, there you manage troop recruitment, finances, manage settlements, build forts and send out dimplomats to make allies or trade. The game will also appeal to fans of managment sims, as you must manage every aspect of your settlements such as repairs, construction, defense, population, happyness ,trade and religion. On the field of combat you really must tap into your inner general. Using the terrain to your advantage can be a deciding factor against a larger ammount of opponents, funneling the enemy over a bridge will reduce their effectivness, allowing you to take on a smaller ammount at a time. All the units MUST be managed properly or they will be slaughtered, so charging your cavalry headfirst into a spear wall is a big no-no. Morale is a crucial factor of the game which gauges your troops willingness to fight, and if broken can be disasterous and cause MASSIVE routs. Things like exaustion, casualties, murderous hounds, and a lacking commander (and much more) can all effect your troops morale. The last great feature is the family member system, that allows you to play historical(or not) figures and level up traits that help(or hinder) morale, combat strength, city managment and more. So that lame 1 star general your sending up against that guy who has been wrecking everything probably should retreat. 

Overall, I love this game. Easily my favorite RTS game of all time and I HIGHLY suggest picking this up if you want a real strategy experience that will test your abilities to lead men in battle. My only complaint is the game doesnt explain much of the real important mechanics, so I suggest reading guides/watching videos.

The highlights so far: Telling him it took me a while to get back to him because I was busy banging the bejesus out of his aunt and that she screws like a minx.
Saying I got locked out of the house and had hot diarrhea in the side yard, having nothing but my socks to clean it up. After he responded got him to tell me when the last time he shit himself as an adult was.
He texted asking me if I knew of any DUI checkpoints coming off the beach and I said no but told a story about a cop busting me for DUI and offering to let me off if I blew him in his squad car. ""I told him 'then take me to jail Mary cuz the only Dick I like in my mouth is my own.'"" Then got him to admit that he's tried sucking his own dick.
Asked him ""have you ever had those days where you just wanna shoplift a box of Cap'n Crunch, smoke hash and watch All Dogs Go To Heaven while wearing nothing but a wizard hat?""
And last night I texted him ""If I was twenty years younger I'd totally take this Tom Brady up my poop chute, I dont care how thick his hog is.""
He always responds and laughs and plays along with the weird shit I ask him and seems to have a new-found admiration for his uncle and his crazy antics. I cannot wait until he sees his uncle -- maybe on Christmas -- and tries referencing the insane shit ive been texting him.

31,Rome Total War,8166652,english,"Shogun 1 may have been the first of the Total War series, but Rome was the real ""breakout"" entry in the franchise. Pretty much every TW game since can trace its core roots to this game. The map style where you have cities/strongholds that control a ""province"", and only by besieging and conquering that place can you can control of a region. Otherwise your armies march around the map and fight wherever they end up meeting. If you have played a TW game before, but not this one, what you will find in this game will all seem very familiar to you, with a few features missing here and there (Naval Battles are autoresolved, for example)

So how is the game now? Well, it's still what it is a decade ago, and the Rome of a decade ago was one of the best games of that time. Getting over the obvious things like graphics and perhaps a few gameplay annoyances that more recent games have improved on, you can easily enjoy this one. Since Rome II is out, I suppose few people will look into this one. Then again, Rome II is apparently a bug-filled mess, so those who want to fight it out in this time period can look at this game instead. You could very well be happy with what is here and play with this until Rome II eventually gets itself fixed up. 

There is a chance you can run into some bugs, but those should either be easy to resolve or not be totally game-ruining.

Eventually when you get strong enough, the Senate will get suspicious and start asking you to have your leader commit suicide.

They were not particularily strong, academic or friendly, Instead they would sit on their back all day and eat, read, take baths, etc. They wanted to show the world how to live. And they did this through a latin-invented word: dicipline. A small, relativley scrawny Roman Legionary would find himself a shoulder's distance away from thousands of clones of his, all with a crapton of armor and a gargantuan shield. Using precise formations, fighting manners, and commands the average Roman could fight beyond his own power. In Rome: Total war you can really get a feel for how this works, fighting in the Campaign to make your own Rome, or other nation or testing your skills in the Multiplayer against real people. Fight as all of the great powers of the time; Rome, Macedon, Gaul, Germania, Brittania, Carthage, Seleucia, Parthia, Egypt, Scythia, and many more against eachother. This truly is the best strategy game ever. And then there is the soundtrack. This game gives you a sense of succes or bitter defeat, and the campaign is unforgiving as real life. If you lost a battle on your frontier, suddenly that army may punch right into your homeland. And it would be you who lost that battle

A decent AI considering the scope of the game (try adding a formations mod such as Darthmod formations)
MODS (like really, get them)
A family tree system that lets you groom your generals to become leaders of your empire and creates a deeply immersive environment.

38,Rome Total War,4022196,english,"Rome: Total War. One of my all-time favorite games. Taking place in the late Roman Republic, you assume control of one of three Roman families vying for power. Depending on which family you select, the Senate will usually direct you against one of three adversaries - the Greeks, the Gauls, or the Carthaginians. The beautiful thing about Total War, however, is you can simply ignore the Senators and go on a campaign of your own... Egyptians? Invade them! Is the Senate demanding you join in on the war against the Macedon, but you'd rather become allies? Go for it! Just make sure you keep a home guard, because Civil War is a constant threat!

It has been almost ten years since Rome's release. It hasn't aged terribly bad - the AI is somewhat atrocious, the graphics are dated, but the game is still genuinely satisfying.

82,Rome Total War,866673,english,"This game is a must have for the strategist, or history nut. Take control of ancient empires, the Romans, Greeks, Macedonians, Gauls, Germanics, each with a hugely different playstyle.

There's a massive campaign, custom battles online; you can take control of historical battles and turn the tide, for example, one of the battles where the Romans were defeated by Hannibal, you can figure out a way to lead the Romans to victory, set right what went wrong, but the game only gives you control at a crucial point, where the Romans are about to be defeated, it's like figuring out chess problems, where you're given a scenario and you're about to be checkmated, but have to find a way to prevent it and still win. It's a really interesting view on ancient warfare, nothing before has given us such an interactive take on it.

My biggest gripe with this game is that the campaign is single player only. It would have been incredible if you could play it online with people. Multiplayer only has custom battles, where you just assemble your own army and fight on a chosen battlefield. Those can however, lead to glorious, to-the-core strategic battles.
