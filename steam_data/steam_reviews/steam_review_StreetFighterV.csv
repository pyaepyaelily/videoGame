i tried going into the training area after to see if i could learn that way, nope its just a basic dummy.

. Overall better playability, graphics, artstyle, combo options and nostalgia value than it's predecesor.
. Smooth pick-up-and-play experience for any fighting game enthusiast, SF Fan/Veteran
. Diverse roster 
. Arcade Mode features classic SF2, Alpha and SF3 arcade runs.
. Good music selection w/nice options (choosing music rotation for many game modes, switching characters's individual voice language for e.g.)
. Still being supported after 5 years with a new season comming soon.



-CONS-

. While having a big roster, gameplay doesn't feel deep can become stale and feel less dynamic over time
. On that note, some of the newcommers are straight forgetable (like SFIV)
. Although improved, the fight money system is still flawed and very overpriced 
. Story Mode's lackluster ""story""
. Online play is still not great 
. Still looks cartoony influenced
. Presentation wise seems simplistic 
. Unpractical, stale designed UI filled with plain looking message screens
. Took almost 5 years since launch to become a fully fledged title



//////| RECOMMENDED: Only for fighting game players and Street Fighter hardcore fans.

//////| NOT RECOMMENDED: To casual players. There's far more exciting looking, worthy playing titles that are much more accesible to pick up and have fun with.

It's a fighting tournament at places all over the Earth, featuring themes based on nationalities. It has fighters compete with each other to become the best street fighter, and eventually combat the leaders of Shadow Law, the organisation which hosts the tournament.
Fighters aren't realistic in the sense that they fight by using normal fighting techniques. Even though their moves and appearances may be based on existing fighting styles, their visual representation is exaggerated or imaginary, with lots of lighting effects. Each fighter's appearance is based on where it comes from, or what fighting style it adheres to.

PLAY
Two fighters pit against each other in one-on-one combat, on a two-dimensional plane. Fighters can kick, punch, grab, and wrestle each other, but may also defend from it, in a predetermined number of rounds. The fighter which does the most damage to the other fighter wins a round.
A multitude of different fighters can be chosen and controlled, and they may engage in combat on their own, if controlled by a computer.
It has different modes, ranging from a general storyline, to individual stories for each fighter, or one-off fights, which can be setup or played together.

SKILL
It's viewpoint is dynamic, making fights visually stylised.
Each fighter has it's own reasons to fight, and all fighters control different, and they utter comments about each other.
It allows purchases of additional fighters, costumes, music, and arenas. Alternatively, those are achieved by winning fights. 
It also includes extra content such as, artworks, which can be found by playing it's modes and difficulties.
Costumes may be choosen for each fight, but also during the story for fun or preference.
It has online functionalities, including a profile, which saves each fight it's statistics, and makes sponsorship possible.


This ghastly image shows a fighter during the main storyline, which has been customized with a morbid costume:

Though you'll encounter a few smurfs in ranked, it's far less common.

Also, if possible, avoid like plague fighting against obnoxious characters i.e Karin and Rashid and  button smashers i.e.  Bison players. Those characters... pure disgrace. From my experience, it's not fun in the slightest playing against them, even when I win FYI. 

Karin by far is the worst one. I wish there was a way to shut her up. Or even better yet, remove her from the game for good.

86,Street Fighter V,74512618,english,"SFV is hands down the worst entry in SF with one of the worst net codes in any game I've played in the last 5 years(I've played for over 2 years on console before getting on steam). The game has been bastardized into no defensive options and hard locking characters behind V-skills and V-triggers. To explain it, I'll put it to you this way... SFV is like punching a wall with your bare hands, you punch over and over and over again, your fingers bloody and broken but you are seeing a hole forming and progress. So, you continue to punch and punch until the drywall falls off and it reveals through the dust another layer of a brick wall behind it. At this point you pull out a pickaxe, the only tool you have to break that wall, but your so broken, tired and in pain to even swing it. But, what if you were to just use the pickaxe to begin with against the dry wall? You would have more strength, more will power and energy to take on the brick wall. 
  This is what every match feels like in SFV, your ""pickaxe"" (v-trigger) is the ultimate decider of fate and what makes and breaks characters leaving the whole roster mostly boring and only interesting it the short seconds of your trigger activation that open up your combos and the meaning behind your character. This and the lack of defense options leads to players waiting your v-trigger out knowing exactly what your going to do because of the limited options in a majority of the characters and also the meta of ""throw looping"" which in itself is a boring and uninteresting style of play you have to deal with that makes every match up just a chore and when you use it feels cheap and not worth it compared to winning with skill and combos. But, it becomes the best and only way to play in most cases due to the net code dumping on 5 bar connections and not being able or not allow to react to most situations because of a net code hiccup. This makes the game 60% of the time unplayable and when the game is running good and responsive it honestly just not interesting and feels like a chore. 

This isn't a good streetfighter game, it has at its core a basic fighting game with potential but wayyy too many glaring issues still to this day to but unless its on a sale. If you are dying to play street fighter, get this as cheap as you can since we have to play it another year until SF6 comes out.",1597765824,1600191139,FALSE,9,0,0.50222069,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.66E+16,155,9,1122,220,234,1601308166

Pros:
Better graphics than 4.  Dynamic stages are kind of fun with different endings.

Cons:
OMG get ready.  

There are commercials ALL THE TIME.  Getting to fight a new guy, commerical.  Switching menus, commercial.
You get ONLY 12 fighters to start.  And some of the favorites are not unlocked.  Guile, got to unlock him.  For a game titled Ultimate Street Fight V, you would think you get everyone right?  Nope.
Play control blows to pull off moves.  Seriously even following the training, the window for a move is so narrow it makes the game bad.  But hey the CPU can pull them off flawlessly even in normal mode so cool.
You have to pay to unlock characters or you can play the equivalent of a full ten games to maybe unlock a single player.  But the same method is not available again.  But hey you can pay another price of an additional game to get what you thought you were getting with this purchase.
The characters compared to IV are dumb.  You have a really fat guy that has silly moves, a girl with way too large breasts and a thin frame that is a wrestler?  But hey take away Fei Long and make most of the characters you want to play locked.  Did I mention you get less colors and themes for characters too!  Yeah this game just basically gives you the bare minimum for 'Ultimate'.  Feel bad if there was just Street Fight V regular.  You probably only get Ryu and Ken with one outfit and two stages.

Seriously this method of Capcom, EA, and now Bethesda by wanting you to pay to play is just garbage.  If you pay full price you should get the game.  Else it should be people's duty to warn others you are getting a half game compared to previously.  This is a half game.  I have play eleven hours and unlocked one person, tried to do the training and the window never matches.  And that is with trying with an Xbox One wireless controller and an Xbox 360 controller.

Positive:
Championship Edition is actually a pretty good buy and the roster is great. There are a lot of unique characters this time around and you get a bunch of costumes. 

Negatives:
1. In-game ads. Just why... I already bought the game. 
2. Needing to read and click through the store notes every time I open the game... also why.
3. Not enough defensive options. There are some really, really cool zoning type characters in the game! But there aren't enough defensive options compared to USFIV and other FGs to make them enjoyable to play.  
4. The most important: Even with fiber and ethernet, online just feels bad. I don't know what it is, I think they even improved the netcode earlier this year. Lag happens in any game of course, but I wish they gave more options for leaving a laggy game esp when both sides know it's an unplayable match.

If you're coming into the game at Championship Edition, this version of Street Fighter is easily in the top 3 SFs of all time. If you came in before Championship Edition, this version is easily one of the most annoying because of how new characters are earned.

It leans very heavy on the ""hard read"" aspect of fighting games, but once you understand the flow of a match, it becomes second nature. All of the characters have their own style and unique design.

I think it only lacks when it comes to single player modes, and story (you have to download a DLC to play the ""general story"") which might seem concerning to some even though it's free.

I think it's alright, and I'll be waiting to see what other characters they add to the roster next year just to have fun and to get mad at the game.

56,Street Fighter V,74593898,english,"ok in 2020 the net code is honestly WAY better than i expected. After hearing ""oh the game is dogshit because of the netcode"" or ""game is great other than the horrific net code"". I havent had any issues on connectivity issues or match lag. And the only times I did have any lag was because either I had 2 bars of internet or the other person had trash internet (yes the times i did have connection issues i messaged the other person and they said they did have poor internet). And yea its no mk11 netcode but it is better than what you read up online, thats for sure.

Now onto gameplay. The gameplay is very good. I see the balance in most characters and you will be able to do pretty good in online matches with any character. If this is your first Street Fighter game this would be a pretty good pick. The only down side to this game is that the tutorial is absolute trash, game doesnt explain all the hidden features (cross hits). The game feels pretty smooth and inputs are decent.  

The story, the character stories are honestly pretty boring. The character stories are just kind of bland, non exciting (except for a few), and just overall sleeper. In the character stories you only have 3-5 matches where you fight. The stories get very confusing and feel like the devs didnt put work into it. The graphics, well there are no graphics in character story. Its just a slide show with pictures that dont exactly represent what you are listening too in the moment. The general story is decent at best nothing more. Not much to say about general story other than that.

Advertisement, in the summer update/sale (when i bought the game) before every match, even training mode, it would say ""SUPPORTED BY CHAMPIONS EDITION STREET FIGHTER 5. 25% OFF. BUY NOW"". EVERY. SINGLE. MATCH. it genuinely got so tiring. i understand if you put it in once in a while, maybe once every 5 matches or so. but every single match? yea no thats just plain bad. At the beginning of the summer sale (Aug 8th) i was thinking of just buying the Arcade Edition SF5. But after reading a lot of reviews i just bought Champions Edition. Just the hassle of spending 120 hours just to get all the main characters was just tiring to think about. Plus im pretty sure you have to spend at least 100 more hours to get all the dlc aswell (I THINK). Also there are more dlc's you have to buy to get the full game, which is pretty scummy if you ask me. I would understand if you packaged it into 1 dlc. but splitting it up into multiple? i dont think so. 

Esports. The esports are very good. Being a main game in Evo there is a lot of traction for other smaller tournament organizers to start their own tourneys which you can attend. Online is filled with a whole lotta tourneys that you can enter for free. Once you understand how hard a lot of what the pros are doing you will also get hyped over SF5 esports.

They're still going to create another DLC just to make sure everyone really understands that capcom thinks you're an idiot...

in short, the game sucks. Story mode means nothing and the gameplay is completely limited, the characters were created to be played in a unique way, online matches take time because both players are afraid of being punished.

moreover, the game has always malfunctioned on my computer. Most of the time my antivirus told me that this game sucks, and you know what? The antivirus is right!

I advise you not to buy this game.

65,Street Fighter V,62715079,english,"Over the past two years, I've tried a few time to give SFV a honest shot here and there and after a solid twenty hours and 150 matches, I gotta admit to myself that I simply don't enjoy playing. Mechanically, my biggest gripe is that  the rewards for jumping in vs using an anti-air and how much damage characters can get off a crush counter is so lopsided that I'm kind of astonished.

Netcode-wise, everything that has been said over the years still rings true; when it works, it works. Unfortunately, when it doesn't, it becomes a nauseating slide show where both sides spam buttons as they teleport through the rampant rollbacks. 

Those two things aside, out of the 39 character currently available,  I only found myself having fun with three, (two of which are dlc from later seasons). While ostensibly there  seems to be a ton of variety in terms of how characters play, the limitations of the system homogenizes them to the point most of the cast feel the same. As a matter of fact, some characters play so similarly there's no real reason to pick them other their slightly more nuanced counterparts other than aesthetics (i.e Why pick Ryu when Ken/Akuma/Sakura do most of he does, but better?).

Speaking of aesthetics, I actually like the overall art direction SFV has taken, particularly with the UI and stages. It all feels polished and really makes it seem like a spectacle where two world class warriors are about to duke it out everytime you load into a match. That said, when applied to characters, the art style can actually quite ugly when applied to most characters . This lackluster presentation also extends to a lot animations, most of which seem stiff and robotic to the point of lazy and downright jarring (compare Cody moveset to Menat's for instance)

Overall, I'm not so much disappointed in SF5 as I am in myself for trying so hard to like it.

 You've got other options in terms of fighting games people, look into them.

UPDATE: I'm writing this as of 2/19/20, after the 5.014 patch which was supposed to fix the online. Well, online is still rough, for me at least. Being a fighting game fan truly is suffering.

Update 2:  8/9/20. Came back thinking I hadn't given SFV a fair shot despite putting 40+ hours into it on my first go. After another 20+ hours, I came to realize that I was using my frustration with the game as both a way to instigate and supplement my other means of self harm. Never before has a game triggered such a reaction within me (not even in my dark days of playing Dota 2) , and for that I came honestly and whole-heartedly say this is worst piece of entertainment or media I've ever had misfortune of buying.

Although '09er/SF4 players find the game is too offensive, the gameplay is actually quite good now that they fixed a lot of things that held it back. 

To get an idea of just how rushed and botched this game was at launch, it used to only have 16 poorly balanced characters, had no additional V-Trigger and V-Skill options for your character, had just about no offline mod except a barren survival mode and a bare-bones training mode (that thankfully both got updated) and terrible character balance.

Is it a fun game? Totally. Is it difficult for new players? You bet. Will you lose a bunch of ranked matches and never see your LP increase from 0? Probably, it still depends on how quick you pick up on the game but for yours truly? Definitely. This game has a steep learning curve for beginners and it will get very frustrating learning every character's combos to their V-skills to just about everything. But, the game does offer a lot of interesting characters with different types of skills and fighting styles for everyone,  and it does have a mode where it teaches combos for all of em. Granted, some might be more complex and harder to pull off but with enough practice it gets slightly bit easier. In short, I do recommend the game for those who want to experience the different types of fighting games out there, it will be difficult and at the time of writing this review I, myself, is admittedly still major crap in the game but Juri does keep making me want to get better at the game and attempt to win matches.

OG review:

Game/gameplay: Simply amazing.
Netcode/online experience: Simply godawful.

I have been loyally playing this since day 1 on the ps4. Eventually got it for pc thinking that might offer a better online experience.
It doesn't. 

Please don't misunderstand: this game is an incredible entry for the series, though you can only get the true experience with local play. And at this point I've mostly given up on sharpening my skills online since every other match has enough lag to make either a win or loss feel cheap. Frame knowledge and muscle memory goes flying out the window in the face of this sketchy net code. I was able to let it slide until this year, as every other major fighter has proven there is no excuse for such a shirty net code for a modern triple A fighter. I mean, this is STREET FIGHTER... Sure, you can get lag in any game, but next to the likes of DBFZ and Tekken this is just embarrassing. I kid you not, the recent Soul Calibur VI beta was a better, more reliable experience. And that's a network beta... hoo boy... 

So, Capcom... instead of putting resources into 17 more Chun-Li costumes.... fix your game. Please stop pretending there's nothing wrong with matchmaking. I am unfortunately giving this a thumbs down until there's a notable improvement.

However if offline is your jam, you will not be disappointed.",1538627327,1596675153,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.66E+16,156,17,10291,274,1048,1601775968

*The best looking fighting game to date imo 
*Friendly with starters with a wide input buffer (you can mash some moves)
*Big characters roster for players to chose a style that suits them
*Decently and continuously balanced

Cons:

*A pretty old game that received so much negative feedback wich in consequence will give this game:
- Long online waiting time for a match to pop up (more likely as you go up in rank) that will translate into:
-- The game will auto pause the search of an oponent with no warn nor option to turn this off
-- If there are few players online, the matchmaking will make you wait long as it seems to evade pairing you 
    with the same players more than often.
- Short lifespam so you'll be better waiting for the next entry while playing other fighting games
*A will to try and sell you more than half the game in hard, cold cash (Characters, stages, skins) while some skins, stages and the freaking, FREAKING MAIN STORY are not optional to pay with FM (even though they say is very bad). And how they will try to sell it to you? Well, by:
- Making the ways to get in-game currency slow and not very entertaining
- Giving you options to waste your FM in: extra tries for survival, chances to get a skin or to get a title for 
   fighting an unforgiving and broken CPU character, etc.

The singleplayer thinks too much of itself but doesn't deliver so it just feels lazy. Capcom have been putting less and less into each game and I have personally had enough. 

Go back and play Third Strike on Fightcade 2 though, that game is fantastic and has some of the best netcode out there.",1596549763,1596549903,FALSE,3,0,0.556749821,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.66E+16,337,5,2833,0,2833,1565289914

55,Street Fighter V,30123534,english,"Fake combo fighter V.
Many chars are simply limited to single routes for combos. Take Necali, after his hard foot stomp that shoots people into the air he only has the option to  medium dp, do a light foot stomp EX stomp or level 3 while not in super sayian mode even in super sayian mode he doesn't get much more. Even tho Most of his other normal moves intersect the hitbox of the opponent during the air stomp and you should be able to hit them especially considering how much a raw Hard stomp RISK level is for necali to do after they nerfed it during S1 and left him a weaker character, it should obviously hit them, but instead they just clip through. 

There are many examples of this with the other characters too, and some have LESS limits imposed on them then others making them better and the games actual usable character roster low. G is a good example of this, a character that is so broken it is possible to do a 2x life bar taking combo with him in training mode. Far less limits imposed on him then the other characters.

You feel like your on a railroad playing this fighting game, and even when you win you don't feel like you won, as there is zero freedom of expression and that is the CORE problem with this game.

The games netcode is also terrible, its not true rollback, but a hybrid version, that uses alot of framesync code, and can be exploited by people that do not run 60fps, but 30\15fps and MANY MANY PC users abuse this, just look no further then the forums with threads complaining about stages running slow, thats the kind of hardware many are trying to play on, and they do it mostly to cheat, as it does not cost more then 200$ ish for  a PC capable of running this game 60fps locked.

My initial feelings upon getting into the game was that this was a very polished and complete installment to the franchise and.  after a few hours in training and story, can fully appreciate how well this bridges the gap between SFIV and SFIII.

The V-System at first felt a little jarring and gimmicky to me but once I started to get use to it I discovered a system not entirely unlike KOFs max gauge and the combat overall has a very familiar, albeit more accessible 'floaty', feel to it.

As a primarily single player gamer one thing which really stands out for me is the amount of content there is on offer with a complete and lengthy fully animated story mode, individual illustrated character stories (which act as story prologues for all of the cast) as well as a set of arcade modes which mimic each past installment to the franchise with traditional, pre cutscene era, ending sequences.

Basically, M. Bison is planning to take over different parts of the world, and his 2nd in Command, F.A.N.G, will stop at nothing to help Bison, and it is up to the heroes to stop Mr. Bibson. It is simple, but it does have some great and memorable moments like Peter who is the strongest Street Fighter character ever, alongside fights against new characters with new special moves that I wish you could play as. The story itself is also well written and it gives each character released at the time good screen time and even offered the ability to play some characters early. There was definitely a lot of effort in, and while it has it's flaws, like how some characters are portrayed (Especially Red Guy with Crazy Hair), I still think it's good enough for a 6/10

Gameplay: If you played Street Fighter before, this will sound familiar: 6 buttons for attacks, 3 punchy attacks, and 3 F E E T attacks, and command inputs for specials, press multiple buttons for EX moves, yadda yadda. What's new is a mechanic called V-Trigger. At launch, you could press both M attacks for a special skill and when your meter was full, you could do either a Reversal, or press both H buttons for an install or unique mechanic that could change strategies or extend combos. In Arcade Edition, they added a second Skill and Trigger, both are welcome and open up for more playstyles. This works really well and helps each character feel more diverse from each other. The fighting itself also feels very smooth, the game clearly understood what I needed to do and I never felt like I was getting the wrong move because of the game's input detection, it is really smooth. Combos were kinda-but-not-too-much put into the simplification blender, mainly with how links were changed. In SFIV, the devs took 15 lines of bad stuff and made you do multiple 1 frame links per combo, which I hated. Here, the tightest links are 3 frame links, and I prefer this much more, it helps combos be so much more consistent, and when I dropped a combo, it was my fault, not the link's fault. You are given some openness with the V-Trigger system and some EX attacks give you extra juggle opportunities. I have so much praise, there isn't much to complain about, it's a great mix between deep and simple. If I were to change one thing, I would still change the combo system to still allow a bit more flashyness in combos, but the gameplay still deserves an 8/10

Graphics and Presentation: This game was, if my research is correct, Capcom's first game made in Unreal Engine 4, and they NAILED IT! Characters look great and mesh well with the slight anime style the game has. Moves look flashy and V-Trigger effects look dramatic and fun to look at. Characters are also highly expressive and can even have extra animations when you whiff attacks. Also, tons and tons of well designed costumes that even reference other Capcom games, even forgotten ones. Does anyone remember Power Stone? This isn't a joke, is there literally anyone else that remembers the series? One issue is that the hand drawn stuff in character stories and Arcade endings can be mixed. Most is pretty good and has a noticeable style, but other times we see Abigail do a thing. Still, the good heavily outweighs the negatives, and deserves a healthy 9/10

Sound and Soundtrack: Street Fighter soundtracks just keep getting better. Not only do we still have really satisfying sounds, including a CRUNCHY Crush Counter sound, but the OST itself is AMAZING! The orchestral scores mixed in with some Electric Guitars and Dubstep works well and makes for some memorable themes. Remixing these classic themes is what each Street Fighter needs to do *cough* SF3 *cough* SFA3 *cough* There was no theme I ended up hating in this game at all. Hideyuki Fukasawa did amazing on this game and it gets a 10/10! Say it with me! RAAAASHIIIDOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Replayability: Labbing is one thing that will keep you coming, but with the current combo system, it won't be as long as other fighting games, but the Training Mode is still detailed, and the online mode lets you train with the opponent's character after a set or if they leave early like a pu-
On top of that, the game has these Special Fights that are basically events to get the Capcom costumes and even crossover music at times, so you'll want to get those. AND FURTHERMORE, this game has a neat feature where you can actually buy the DLC characters without paying, you can just use the in game currency, Fight Money, to do it. No microtranactions, just do missions, fights, and other things and the character you want is yours. It is kinda grindy, and some Trials are stupid, but they still pay off in the end. It gets a 7/10 because the grinding is still annoying

Online: Things get weird with this one. In my Tekken 7 review, I talked about how there was no way Tekken 7 used Rollback since even the most unmodified Rollback will still have amazing online. Street Fighter V, to add the cross play multiplayer (Which is a great addition), had modified Rollback. This ended up in some..... Weird online, lemme explain. So when you play the game most of the time, the Rollback works well and you get a smooth game. Good, neat, but then all of a sudden the game just has a stroke and dies on you and you're like ""WHAT"" and here's why: Apparently, when modifying the Rollback netcode, Capcom screwed up somewhere and it causes these really random and unpredictable spikes in lag. And you wanna know something weirder? It's one sided! So while you're freaking out about the online, your opponent is having a smooth experience, or vice versa. This is so bizarre, and I have no idea what could have caused this either. It is very unpredictable. There was that fan patch some time ago, but I wouldn't trust fan patches when it comes to online. You're basically limiting yourself to only people with that same patch, otherwise the game just gives up and eats it's own skin, so yeah. Fun. Still, when it works, it really works well, but those spikes still hurt the game's online, putting the rating to only an 8/10 since it's not too common, but also not uncommon. If they just fixed this weird spike issue, it would be a 10/10 no question

Final Thoughts: Wow, I had a lot of good things to say about this game, and after my 2 most recent reviews of fighting games (That you should totally check out by the way just saying), it's nice to say that this game deserves an 8/10 with the side of a Chess Piece. It is amazing. From the great graphics, to the fun gameplay, and good crossplay (Unless it's not good), Street Fighter V manages to strike a great balance between easy to learn and hard to master. While still not perfect, this is a fighter I can actually recommend for newcomers to learn the ins and outs of fighting games. Now if only a certain OTHER fighting game was more like this in this aspect... Oh yeah, the game is also on PS4. Yeah, only PS4, it was because of a deal between Sony and Capcom mainly that caused this. There were rumors about a Switch port because of a random Tweet by some gaming retailer (That was probably a mistake more than anything), but there's still no Switch port, so keep that in mind. Also this game gets dirt cheap on sales, you basically have no excuse to not play it when it goes on sale

53,Street Fighter V,45130947,english,"Seth has jojo references. This game is perfect. 10/10. But seriously, all jokes aside, don't actually get this. If you must, get it on discount. I have many cons with this game and this is speaking from my experience, and I'm going to rant about these cons, and if you don't want to hear it, then click off this review, and if you do want to read on, I may sound a little harsh, and I'm sorry about that, but I've got to talk about this. It's very frustrating to me. So please, bear with me here. Fight money is a stupid mechanic and the games combos and mechanics are very linear, while fun for sometime, matches can get boring quickly. I want the matches to be exciting and over the top. Seeing the same five hit combo being done over and over is not exciting. It is repetitive for the loser and the victor. It would be better if you could unlock content as you played, like in street fighter 4. Why can't fighting games be like the good old days, where you didn't have to pay a dime? Capcom has already made enough money, so for them to have the gall to charge money for classic characters and basic costumes shows how much they don't really care about their supporters. Don't support companies that have stupid business models like this. If you're wondering why this games reviews are mixed, the constant dlc, ads on matches and the grind is why. This game needs to be improved, and practices like this should not stand. These practices ruin great games. I mean, I wouldn't mind a few things being DLC but over 160 dollars of dlc? Come on! Not many people can afford that. I hope that street fighter 6 goes back to street fighter three and fours roots. Thanks for reading. Also, I do have some pros on the game that you can see below and some other cons I wasn't able to include.  

PROS

Great music (except for Juri's theme. It sounds lackluster.)

Big character roster of 40 + characters

Great animations, many of the attacks have impact.

Great voice acting for both languages

Extra Battle mode adds some fun challenges.

Plenty of trials for each character. Over 30+

Arcade mode is awesome. Remixes of each games character select and game over theme add to the appeal. There are also different routes for each character to take. 

Crossover BGM is great. Themes from Mega Man, Devil May Cry, Ghosts & Goblins, Monster Hunter and more. So even if you aren't a street fighter fan, you have something in it for you.
Demonstrations give you an idea of how to play each character. 

Artwork gallery is an awesome addition, you get to see each of the characters as they looked in previous games and see special artwork as well. Doing certain tasks in arcade mode also provide a good incentive to earn them.

Seth is actually a good character now. Also has references to Darkstalkers, Jojo's Bizarre Adventure: Heritage to the Future and other classic Capcom fighting games.

Easy for beginners and experts to play.

G is a great character.

Lucia Morgan from Final Fight 3 feels right at home with street fighter 5's mechanics.  

CONS (Many)

Survival mode is tedious, should not need to unlock character colors.

Fighting Chance needs to go, loot boxes are not fun for anyone. I don't think it's cool to spend and spend until you get the thing you want. Unless you like gambling away fight money.

Online is not the best. Sometimes there is a bad amount of lag.

Story Mode was inconsistent at points.

Characters are locked and have to be bought with 100,000 fight money. Of the 40 characters so far, you only start with 16. There will be 5 more added for season 5, which brings the final roster up to 45 characters. Stages and alternate costumes are also locked.

Grind is too slow. Only 50 fight money per victory, none if you lose.

Don't like the crossover costumes.

Many of the background npcs look bad, They distract from the fight. 

I do not like F.A.N.G, annoying character with an annoying personality. If the goal was to make an annoying character, then Capcom succeeded.  

Main menu UI is bland.

Not much variety in combos. V-system is not a good mechanic, feels linear and boring. 

Necalli needed a bigger role in the story.

Ads during matches, they are optional, but you have to turn them on to get fight money bonuses.

Bad business model overall.

It's Street Fighter. It's a fighting game. Don't expect the same level of polish and content as Mortal Kombat. Feels like a really good fighting game stuck with production values of 15 years ago.

If you have friends that like playing fighting games or if you are okay with just playing online go for it. As a fighting game it's a really good game. As a full priced game in today's market it lacks the production and care it should have to cost what it costs.

1. Nice graphics
2. Lots of characters.

Cons:
1. The story is shit. CAPCOM, unlike NRS, can't write a compelling story mode.
2. Haphazard tutorial.
3. Character tutorials are filled with increasingly ludicrous combos that are hampered by the CPU being allowed to block. On top of that, each character's skill set is incredibly difficult to remember.
4. Command instructions always assuming that your character is on the right side of the screen. NRS effortlessly got around this problem, so CAPCOM has no excuse for not doing the same.
5. Arcade Mode gives shitty character endings featuring a single page in a comic.

I played this game on PS4 when it came out, hated it for the above problems, and sold it to Gamestop. After a couple years, I heard it got better, and I had money I wasn't using, so I decided to give it another go on Steam. Fighting games aren't supposed to be super-complicated when it comes to gameplay--it's why NRS gameplay is so good, and why the likes of Tekken, DOA, the Soul Series, and now this are so terrible.

52,Street Fighter V,71653502,english,"SF Series is probably one of the reason why im into gaming ever since. It’s safe to say fighting games would look vastly different if Street Fighter didn’t exist. Here are some major pros and cons of this game:

Pros:
- Rock solid fighting mechanics
- Varied roster
- Killer graphics
- THICC Girls
- Tons of depth
- Music/BGM is damn good
- LAB/Traning Mode is a major improvement

Cons:
- Story Mode is lackluster
- Survival Mode is repetitive
- Online play is iffy for now
- Will take time to get used to this game 

Conclusion:
Longtime Street Fighter fans will probably find a fantastic fighting game in the fifth installment, with plenty of depth to keep them on their toes until they master the new intricacies Capcom has introduced. Newcomers shouldn’t have trouble finding a foothold and working their way up to become fearsome competitors in their own right.

60,Street Fighter V,21246675,english,"First of all, don't bother buying the regular edition of the game. Farming FM (fight money) to buy cosmetics, characters, stages, themes, etc is a waist of time, meaning you will NEVER be able to unlock everything. Just buy the champion edition and avoid the money trap.

Notice the regular edition of the game is 25$ CAD the champion edition is 40$ CAD and the upgrade to champion is 33.50$CAD. Yeah don't make the mistake of buying the regular edition, because if you want to upgrade its gonna end up costing you a lot more money.

*Notice, not every dlc is included in the champion edition, so make sure you go read about it before purchasing.

Street fighter v has the following game modes: arcade, story, character story, survival, training, trials, ranked match, casual match and battle lounge.

Arcade is boring, story is boring, character story is boring, survival is boring, training is essential and trials save you time by showing you potential combos instead of figuring them out in training mode.

So with that out of the way, if you want to buy this game because you want a single player experience, then I do not recommend this game. Go buy mortal kombat or injustice if you prefer a single player experience.

Now to the real topic, multiplayer. Ranked match, casual match and battle lounge are all essentially the same. In all three modes you will be doing the same thing. You select a fighter, you select a stage and you try and beat your opponent. Obviously in ranked, you will gain points that will make you rank up or rank down.

And that's it, that's street fighter v.

Now, do I still recommend this game? No, because e-sports...that's all this game is about. There is no content to keep players invested into their game. 

This game has done absolutely nothing to improve on it's predecessors.

It took street fighter 4, redesigned characters move sets, removed ultra combos and replaced it with V-triggers, which is essentially the same thing. Both come back mechanics can be used to cancel moves, just like in street fighter 4, where you could cancel a move with 2 bars.

So at this point, there is nothing new. All the mechanics from 4 are back into 5.

Street fighter 4 used to have cool modes, like breaking the car, kicking the barrels. Sounds stupid, but stuff like this is whats missing. Street fighter alpha 3 had a coop battle mode and a world tour mode.

P.S. The online lags, the innate 6 frame lag makes it even laggier online and finding a match online can take a very long time. The game is not really balanced.

35,Street Fighter V,70801341,english,"Had a very nice run for my first fighting game experience since Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 for SNES. Been playing videogames nonstop since i was 8y old, im currently 31 and despite having a lot of experience with all kinds of games and being good (above average) on most of them i thought i wouldn't be able to play SFV because i found the game was too difficult! Yes, despite the player base saying it is actually ""too easy"". 

Maybe it's easy for the players that have been around fighting games since always but it was quite a challenge for me to even start linking VERY EASY combos with consistency, i almost gave up because i couldn't do it and complete my main characters challenges to learn their combos, lol, i thought that ""maybe i suck on fighting games, pheraps i should move on"" but i kept trying and after a lot of frustration and hard practice, i completed all challenges, and started landing combos during online battles, which felt GREAT!

Once you start getting the hang of the basic stuff very well, you start winning much more often. I won't be playing anymore because i think i've had enough fun and overcomed all my goals which was to reach the top 100k in the world rankings, it was very difficult but i was playing with the wrong mindset. People starting with the game should be playing to learn the game while having fun, don't  tryhard too much or else you'll get much frustration and rage, take your time, improve slowly, enjoy the low rank matches and use it to test and learn stuff until you feel good enough to try and push your ranks SLOWLY and be ready to drop ranks a lot during the process, be open minded. 

My top 3 characters were Gill (around 2k games), laura (around 1,6k games) and Ryu (around 460 games) it was a great run, reached around 6200 rank points on Super Gold rank and every little accomplishment felt great, like: Landing simple combos consistently, nearly not missing special command attacks, learning and landing newer and better combos consistently, anti-airing consistently, improving defense under pressure and stoping getting mad about being destroyed in the corner b4 i've learned to fight it and control emotions, playing calmly and inputing commands calmly but fast and precisely, stopped being anxious on practice mode because missing too much, started using EX bars, V-gage and V-reversals more efficiently, learning some technics like, shimmy, wake-up throw tec and others, i even feel like i improved a lot my emotional and psychologic resistency while competing online which was always a big problem for me! The list goes on with other little things i probably forgot.

Anyways, great game if you are willing to practice, learn and lose A LOT, also, you can have a lot of fun on the lower ranks  without trying a little bit harder but don't expect a ""win button"", ""rank up button"", ""Shortcut to victory"" kind of stuff. The 1v1 fighting game universe is for the strong minded, things aren't handed to you in a silver plate but i guarantee, every little achievement that you earn with your sweat and effort is WORTH IT. 

I don't think i will be playing anymore but i'm leaving with a very positive experience. Thumbs up, recommended!",1592175124,1592175124,TRUE,0,0,0,1,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.66E+16,348,8,22519,0,22410,1592282228

I have always enjoyed Street fighter games and I really wish I could recommend Street Fighter V, but the lack of serious automatic punishment for players that disconnect in online matches (rage quit) just encourages cheating and creates a very frustrating experience for those just trying to have fun or get better at the game. It happens all the time.

The higher the ranking the worse it gets since players at those levels care even more about their score.

This game was released in 2016 so Capcom clearly have no intention of truly fixing it. They encourage rage quitting to become part of the game meta; they should add it to the command list. :)

When I get an online match against a player with a high number of consecutive wins I already think ""Here comes the rage quit..."" and there is nothing you can do. You can try to add the rage quitter to a blacklist but by then the harm was already done.

So even if you find this game with a big discount I don't think it is worth it. Unless you only plan to play local multiplayer or versus AI.

65,Street Fighter V,49633982,english,"""Fucking three years later and Alex still has no reliable anti-air. Fuck this game"" - My original sarcastic review

Allow me to explain the crucial negatives of this game before I explain why I still love it. Looking back I've come to really understand what it struggles with in terms of its player base and what it should've done differently. This game is unfortunately rough on casual and new competitive players, which was the bulk of who this game was marketed too. 

TO CASUAL PLAYERS:
To make this as blunt as possible SFV does nothing for casual players in terms of content, fun alternative game modes, or any kind of reward for that matter. Arcade mode exists as just a novelty. Survival mode while I'll admit does have some fun ideas that definitely could've been fleshed out, falls way to short to categorize it as ""fun"". Story mode is a damn joke. The most fun anybody playing this game casually will have, is playing against a friend after learning one special move for 20 minutes. Outside of that there's nothing for them.

TO NEW COMPETITORS:
For starters, this game is not friendly on the ""teaching"" aspect. This game will teach you the absolute bare minimum and say ""Alright now have fun"". Through the game alone you'll never understand the basics of neutral, understand the purpose of some moves and buttons, understand frame data, understand spacing, understand just about anything you'd expect the game to teach you. If you want any of that you'll have to scour through numerous videos on Youtube and decipher game lingo you won't fully understand until much later, and the problem with all of this is that SFV starts feeling like a ""chore"" instead of a ""game"". This is what would start to turn new players off, but if you're at all like me you'll sit through all of it and grind. Why? Because you like beating other people's ass, that's why.

The gold I got at the end of this poorly executed gray rainbow was the knowledge I received from all the content creators, all the pros, all of the friends I made that knew more about certain tech than I did. Your reward becomes the knowledge that you worked so hard for. Finally understanding the game's ins and outs was a damn near revelation for me and changed the way I thought fighting games worked. Plus this game offers some of the most gratifying gameplay and satisfying outplays I've had in years, and that alone made the struggle worth it for me. Is it perfect? By all means no, and this game could've been done light years better if some priorities were in order. But I'd be lying if I didn't say I loved this game, despite the massive head/heart aches it gave me.

Summary: If you're a masochist like me for learning but like screaming about how much you outplayed a random player. This game's for you.",1552928899,1591445531,TRUE,0,0,0.524090469,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.66E+16,296,11,74215,863,26303,1601833791

Purchase -> Download -> Install -> Try Offline -> Try Online -> Realize it only connects to Pc players (no problem) -> Realize that theres only 1-2 players of your rank online -> Search Fixes -> Realize that Capcom(a.k.a. Crapcom because of multiplayer experience related issues) patched all the community's ""netcode"" fixes and finally blew the game --> Uninstall -->REFUND!!!(my first game ever that i refunded) 
Still recommend the game for OFFLINE vs CPU or Friend, but... well, then why would even bother buying this SFVCE?

EDIT: ->Realized that Steam doesn't refund after 2 hrs playing, and i spend more than 5hrs trying to solve the online play issue BUT I SOLVED IT No TNX 2 Steam or Capcom Support.
It seems that the version i installed was different than the ones of the peoples online so it would never connect to anyone on any platform, just connected 2 times to other PC players probably with the same version.
So the solution is
1)Delete the content at the folder 
C:\Users\YourUsername\AppData\Local\StreetFighterV\Saved\download
2)Verify Files Integrity of Street Fighter V in Steam
3)Open the game, and wait for it to update and restart

As a game in itself, I had to go into the options to turn off the capcom promotional ads during loading times. The ads are not what you would think they are. They just tell you about tournament dates and capcom events. Pretty handy if you want to invest yourself into the community. 

This is my first traditional fighting game and I love it. It is welcoming to new players and there are plenty of guids to help you through the way.  The game lacks a tutorial but if you just stick sometime against the bots and go into the training mode to practice, you can find out the games ins and outs! There is also the ""word on the street"" series that capcom made on the street fighter V youtube channel to help you out! It provides a lot of amazing information. 

With 40 characters in champion edition there is so much to do in this game. A lot of lovable characters and fun costumes to put. The general story was dissapointing, and I needed to go to my dlc options in my steam library to actually get the mode, which is a weird thing that they decided to do. The individual character story's however are super fun, fully voiced in japanese or english! With amazing art to go along with them.

This game is a amazing experience for a new comer to fighting games and I totally recommend it to anyone who wants to get into it!

Also some of the combat feels smoother. Hard to explain concisely. But for example in 4 I found some characters to really not play well who have become favorites for me in 5.

But speaking of that, I do have to note one of the cons even though it's mostly pros. Unlocking characters is a tedious grind. I mained as Akuma in 4, locked in this one until you get a solid amount of ""fight money"" which is the xp system. I've started maining Cammy instead, and she controls a lot better than in 4 I think, but you only get about 50 FM for a win (I think? Maybe it's rank dependant?) and even just one of the characters costs about 10,000 to unlock. You also get a good chunk from playing with the story, but by doing all of them I think it's only enough to unlock one character.

- V skills are cool but having V trigger just be an install for most characters is pretty boring and they use it to justify locking certain character's movesets (Karin) behind a time-limited mechanic.

62,Street Fighter V,22683944,english,"I have been playing this game since launch, and I have paid dearly for a lackluster game that didn't work half of the time because I was a fan of the series.

After playing this game for years while broken, they released the Arcade Edition - which was finally the game they promised to release at launch - Capcom has decided to put advertisements or ""sponsors"" in between my battles after I have paid over $120 for the privilege of playing SFV. 

I have paid more and more money into this game though microtransactions and all it is doing now is fucking me. I have paid more than enough to be able to just simply play my fucking game without something being shoved down my throat. It is UNFUCKING HEARD OF, and I will not support Street Fighter or any of its sequels anymore. I have loved Street Fighter since I was a kid, but fuck it. They dont' care anymore, neither do I.

This game is absolutely sickening.

They took a great thing and put it behind a pay wall, and then put ads in it. Those ads say ""supported by"", well I am the one who supported this game, and it fucked me.

FUCK CAPCOM, FUCK THIS GAME, I AM DONE BEING FUCKED BY EVIL FUCKING GREEDY CORPORATE BITCHES!!!

I do not recommend this game because it has broke my heart and it requires you to pay close to 120 dollars just to get the full game after advertising the game for 60 dollars, and after you pay 120 dollars, you will be subject to ads.

Fuck this, I am going to go play King of Fighters, at least they are not greedy money hungry dream fuckers.

Update May 2019,

Now that they have placed ads in the game and pissed off their fans so much, they made an option to turn them off.

However, with the new update in May, the netcode is now fucked up again. The game runs like shit and slows down during special moves causing the timing to be off and has basically destroyed any semblance of a game that is left. All in the name of the all mighty dollar.

You heard it here folks, they fucked up not fucking up.

Absolutely not recommended for ANYONE.

If it is in my library, it is because I have paid way too much fucking money not to play the game, and that is the only reason I play it, and I do so in 1 player mode.


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Update April 2020:

I am in isolation, so I am playing this game because I feel trapped into it considering how much fucking money I have put into it.

The online matching system is still a joke.

I still do not recommend this game for any new players. If you haven't put a penny into it, I am warning you not too, you will regret it. You will be overwhelmed with MTX and bullshit.

For the ones that got conned into paying out of the ass for this piece of shit game, at least it is running better, at least for now.

What is the sad thing, is that when this works, it is the best fucking fighting game ever released in the history of the world. It is too bad the gaggle of cocks at Capcom had to fucking get greedy and ruin the infrastructure, add advertisements, and nickel and dime their fans into the poor house.

What a fucking waste.

Update 05-19-2020

The game has come a long way into improving relations with its fanbase.

Survival mode now has a continue option where you can save your game and return to it later. Which is kick ass, and there are a lot of other little features that are coming up that they should have included in the original 4 years ago.

They are reducing pricing on the content that in my opinion should have been released at launch.

When this game first released it was certainly in bad shape, but at this point I can definitely say it's worth your time and money. I recommend getting the champion edition though, because $10 extra for all the characters, skins, and most of the maps is much easier than the alternative.

After setting vsync to off, the game play feel better, response faster, easier to do crush counter,  guard, counter attack, and higher chance to win the opponent. The game play make more sense, at least I able to see how others win me.

If you are fans of Ryu, Ken and Akuma this game may be frustrating. Their kick, punch, dragon punch and special move are weaken a lot. V-Trigger can help to restore back the power but just a while.

For vsync off go to \Users<username>\AppData\Local\StreetFighterV\Saved\Config\WindowsNoEditor\Engine.ini.

Then add these 2 lines:
[SystemSettings]
r.VSync=0

After make file read only

31,Street Fighter V,24078169,english,"Game itself is maybe a 3 or 4 /10 but if you know the history of the game and Capcom itself it drops to 0/10 very quickly.

SFV released with promises of creating a more 'fundamentals' based fighter with less reliance on 50/50 guessing scenarios and more on footsies and spacing. If you have played SFV for more than 5 minutes, you'd know this was possibly the biggest lie ever told, as SFV is entirely about 50/50 guesses and absolutely nothing to do with fundamentals. 

SFV released using a FTP system. Except you also pay for the base game. You win fights, get points, unlock new characters. Anyone who has played these type of games before know that these fail 99% of the time with the company devolving into greed based gating, which is exactly whats happened here. Not only are characters locked behind a paywall, but so are stages, costumes, costume colors, soundtrack pieces, and changing your in-game name. As if this isnt enough, theyve lowered the currency gain over time to where my 1000+ in game hours unlocks 3 characters and a single stage, so it would be a straight lie to say that its FTP, as you will never be able to play enough to unlock the things you want.

The game released with huge issues and it was obvious to everyone that the game was incomplete at launch - similar to No Mans Sky. Arcade/Campaign was completely missing, the touted 'Survival' mode was in the game, but the AI was and is dead on arrival. You can very literally sit in front of the AI opponent pressing literally anything you want and you will win. Its DOA. This is in addition to extremely dumb fighting mechanics for the actual game, such as DPs having no invulnerability causing them to lose to everything, even the jump attacks they are supposed to counter - this has since been changed.

A rootkit placed secretly on peoples computers, horrific design for a game released on PC making it look and run more like a bad PC port than an actual PC game (controls are always shown in Controller terms, and there is no help coming from inside the game for this). Lowering in-game currency rates to exploitative levels, and absolutely no community outreach is how they treat the people who buy their products.

After all of this, Capcom finally cashes out by releasing the ""Championship Upgrade Kit"". A more accurate name would be ""On Disk DLC"". Capcom charges 30 USD for new players to buy the bundle, essentially removing the current FTP part, granting access to all the characters and stages. The kick in the nuts? If you bought and suffered with SFVs FTP system from launch, which was 20 USD up front, youre paying 25 USD for the same kit a new player buys for 30. Spending 45 for a product youve supported since launch when new players would get the same deal for 30. 

Capcom isnt blind or stupid. This game was an extremely lazy cash in on SF4's success. They did 1/10th the work and made 200x the profit. Still to this day the 'General Story', promised years ago isnt implemented. 

It looks from my eyes like one of the early bastions of fighting games is about to go down in flames due to their own greed, and if this is how they treat their customers, then they deserve it.",1467632763,1588969768,FALSE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.66E+16,152,29,57804,0,53502,1590351642

SFV was my first traditional fighting game (I mostly play Melee as my main fighting game). There are a few annoying match ups but overall the game is really solid now. Lots of fighters, stages and players online. It's also really satisfying to play using a fight stick. I feel like there are tons of small things to learn and ways to improve. There are a good amount of tutorials and character guides out there on YouTube if you are a new player who is struggling. They helped me out a lot. Fundamentals, overall strategy, character specific things to look out for, etc. 

If you are new to fighting games, I think SFV is a great one to pick up. It isn't overly complicated for an absolute beginner and there are clear skill gaps between novice, intermediate, advanced and pro players.

2,Street Fighter V,68107771,english,"I would like to state that my whole review will be extremely biased, offensive and discriminative against game types, publishers and developers so if you become easily offended please do not read this review.

The 1990s... Well, I miss good old arcades you know. I mean it was something really serious to make an “Haannndoooken” with Ryu or Ken. A Shooorrryouken was already impossible but very cool. At those days it was so exciting to just to insert a coin and start fighting. Damn even that character selection screen was another fun itself. Nobody even realized Ken was a clone of Ryu just because it was difficult to create significantly different characters. Nowadays it is far easy but creativity is a problem you know. That's why we have a character called Fang in this game.

The most important philosophical question for a teenager was “is it possible to do a Handoken in real life”. God knows how many people watched that ztupid street fighter movie (one with Van Dame) just to see one real-life Handoken... Yes, that was a complete disaster. 

Back then it was difficult to develop and publish a sequel. Do you know how long we had waited to see Mortal kombat 3 after 2? Yes, I gave an example from Mortal Kombat because I have no clue what sequel was after Street Fighter 2. Come on... I mean who gives a cshiet about street fighter after experiencing special abilities in Mortal Kombat... (Even the movie adaptation was far better) Also I admit that Street Fighter usually had more fancy names such as ""Super Street Fighter Turbo Alpha Ultra Ultimate Unplugged Vengeance Edition"" with the great legendary ultra superb character Akuma Matata who was another clone of Ryu...

Ok, I know that at the beginning Subzero was a clone of Scorpion but at least they had different abilities... I mean imagine that you are a child at 90s and at one side just a ""Handooken"" of the street fighter but at the other side crazy fatalities of Mortal Kombat...

Yea yea... Ok, back to recent Street Fighter.. well I have no idea about why we need to download a DLC in order to play the main story... I tried for a long time but I couldn't download it so hanged with old good versus mode... Well, it is neither good nor old anymore. After listening to the conversations between the characters I decided to keep the game for the times that I get bored of other things. I mean just check the depth of conversations between voice acting of this game on You Tube, you will understand.

Ok, I admit that I never was a Street Fighter guy. I love mortal kombat and I respect others like Tekken , Killer instinct even virtual fighter (or whatever was its name) ...etc. But İ was a fatal fury/king of fighters type person.

Ah yes, Street Fighter review... why the fbomb they still develop Street Fighter games. I mean, if you do, why I have to pay extra to play with Blanca? Rashid and his sandals had to be the ""unnecessary extra character"", not Blanca. So you would have the chance to keep the official statistics of the hembecilles with checking people who buy that character.

Forget Street Fighter... Have you ever play good old Battle Arena Toshiden?

29.04.2020 PS: @Developers: Today I found the way to download and to play the main story. After finishing that I wanted to add a few constructive points. I know that Poison and Abigail are assets of Camcom but If you want to play big and use elements of Final Fight why you did not use Mike Haggard, who was both more suitable and a prime character? MK did it with Cratos which was a far suitable choice when compared with Terminator. Leaving Blanka out and creating a roaring black clone and naming it ""Natali"" was not a bright idea either. And I don't know what were you thinking while designing Camy's suit (overdose erotic for a game that has no blood and no death in it) but she is never going to be a ""Mai Shiranui"", neither Lucia is going to be a ""Blue Mary""... And classic Mr. Byson was already quite original you did not need to place some pink smoke/flame powers and declare him cousins with ""Iori Yagami""?

But really I want to ask something. Did you hire a team and assigned them the duty to just to create that FANG character? That much irritation cannot be creation of just one guy. What the huck that ""vroom vroom"" voices from Abigail anyway?",1587978466,1588116831,FALSE,2,0,0.478573203,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.66E+16,582,23,1781,0,1421,1588148717

Oh, you CAN unlock those characters through grinding endlessly for single character but as most of the popular negative comments have stated, it'll take you 2,000 fights for a SINGLE character! Hell no, give me back my money Capcom. I will NOT support your horrid business practices! 

ALSO before I end this. Not many people talk about or mention this but...The story background splash art is TERRIBLE. So low tier for a game company as big as Capcom. Like really bad! What the h man?

27,Street Fighter V,21386830,english,"It's the most logical choice of traditional fighting game you could buy at PC/Steam side. [b]But Why?[/b] There is actually two reasons for that. First off, game have it's own matchmaking system called [b]Capcom Fighting Network[/b] and you create an account in it. With your CFN ID, you can play Street Fighter V from your desired choice of platform or you could compete with people who use other platform. Game allows crossplay between PC and Playstation 4, it's must have because of FGC in PC games is not much of a crowded place.

The second reason is Street Fighter IV released in 2008 and had a 8 years of life time until Street Fighter V comes out at 2016. If you took it as a base calculation, the life of Street Fighter V will continue till' 2024. Well, it's a presentiment - I think Street Fighter V is a game that completed it's content with Championship Edition released. Back when it's released there was only few characters and there wasn't any singleplayer content.

Well, other than reasons game looks awesome. The art style they choose for Street Fighter IV was sucks - in my humble opinions - and they improved everything about art in this.

Also I might say if you are a new player in this genre, this game is slightly easier from other Street Fighters - but those franchise itself have a huge learning curve that you have to invest time over time to get the point of playing your choice of character and moving around with him/her isn't a burden. Just don't mash buttons and expect to win, get in trials mode to train yourself how your character play and get in some play matches and develop a muscle memory against other characters by getting beaten up. Get used to be beaten, because [b]understanding game > winning casual matches.[/b] Every character have a certain way to attack you - memorizing it and finding a way to get around it is the key.

I definitely recommend Championship Edition, due with an humble price you get all the characters and most of the costumes released so far. You could get the normal edition and farm your way up to buy some characters with in-game currency - but it's not too much of an easy way considering one character will cost you 100.000FM to get. There is still plenty ways of farming money, like leveling different characters up until the soft-cap 20 and gain 1000 per their leveling up, but one Season Pass was cost the same with Championship Edition and if we compare it.",1456152100,1587898928,TRUE,9,3,0.544923186,1,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.66E+16,426,95,7420,0,1981,1589622279

Although I have played other Street Fighter games, this game is not good for people that do not know how do combos and moves. The conclusion of a tutorial is a godsend for younger players. The graphics are very strange. The characters are models in a game that moves in two dimensions. A new system called the ""V-Gauge"" is introduced, and to use your move, you must take some damage. Each one is unique to each character. The way you pull off your V Move is differing between each character. Thew mechanics are not updated too much beyond this, making the game feel very familiar to other games in the series. Now I will talk about my biggest problem. When you turn on the game you will notice something wrong with the character roster. Your starting roster consists of Birdie, Cammy, Chun-Li, Dhalsim, F.A.N.G, Karin, Ken, Laura, M. Bison, Nash, Necalli, R. Mika, Rashid, Ryu, Vega, and Zangief. Yes, a game that came out in 2016 has a roster with sixteen characters. Several fan favorites such as Sakura, E. Honda, Guile, Blanka, Akuma, and more are available for purchase. You can purchase skins like Chun-Li's police outfit, Ryu's Mega Man costume, and Cammy's sleapwear, but these costumes cost $1.99 each. This game has a surprising lack of content for a $20 game. I was very shocked that Capcom (the creators of Street Fighter, Resident Evil, and Mega Man) would do this. Anyway, to some up my review, this game is extremely mediocre, stingy, and restricted. I did download it when it was available for free, but if you want the entire game you need the base game ($20) and the expansion ($30). Basically, if you want the whole experience, you need to spend $50.

Avoid this scam like the plague.

Some people told me that Arcade Edition, and later Champion Edition fixed many of the issues. But a lot are still lingering. Some new issues have also arrived. 

I won't even spend a lot of time speaking about how it feels like a major step backwards when compared to the excellent Street Fighter 4 in terms of gameplay. 

It was done by amateurs. They let you configure the controls, by re-assigning the buttons, but they never tell you what function you are re-assigning. This is asinine. Are they for real? Or just trolling? Years later, SF5 remains a joke. ""Fight Money"", anyone? 

Most of the illustrations are atrocious and amateuristic. The cinematics and art on all SF4 games were light-years ahead of it. 

Many of the classic skins are still locked and need egregious effort to be liberated. Not to mention luck.

Yes. You already paid for the content. It is already in your machine, but somehow you still need to ""earn"" (LOL) the skins, but having to rely on chance, pure luck. Some people can earn their desired costumes really fast. Others, take forever. A loot box mentality that benefits no one. Way to go, Capcom! Out of business, silly company! 

In 2020, they dared to release a game that makes the assumption that people using the internet, with steam accounts and playing online are incapable (or at least unwilling) to use English as language, with no one actually favoring doing it. Because in my case, the game comes with Brazilian Portuguese as default (probably done by some illiterate trained monkey), that won't even let me alter it to English. Such restriction is insulting! 

Yes, we should all be grateful that translations were made available. But I don't enjoy it being shoved down my throat. Translations are like wheelchairs and crutches. They are great when people truly need them, but are detrimental when you don't but end up being forced to use them.  Having OPTIONS (the key word) is FINE. Being forced, restricted to a local translation, is BAD. Capcom needs to get in touch with reality. 

Yes, there is a workaround by making alterations to the configuration files. At least on the pc version. But I think that a message needs to be sent (with our wallets) that such practices are just stupid. Having the choice to play it in English is mandatory for me, an essential component of any game. Not having it, is a cardinal sin. Learn your lesson, developers. 

Unlike SF4, SF5 is utter cancer. And a total scam! I asked for a refund, after purchasing a bundle that included the original game (for just 15 local bucks) and the expansion (for around 55 bucks), and they wanted to refund only the main game and not the dlc. This is a dirty tactic that needs to be denounced. Sell the game for pennies, but treat the expansion as DLC (instead of offering as a stand-alone game) is a way to only reimburse the small amount spent on the base title, while keeping most of the money invested (the DLC). 

Gladly, I discussed the matter with Valve, and received a full refund. Unlike Capcom, Valve deserves to be commended for their integrity and respect towards customers. 

Also, I can not post this review about the champion edition anymore. Just the main, base game. So Capcom can easily dismiss it as irrelevant and pertaining only to the old version, even though I am actually describing the current, Champion Edition, sold as a bundle with it. Shame on them! 

Stay the Hell away from this game. An abysmal failure on so many levels. And should you purchase the losers-edition (by losers, for losers) , remember to pay attention to being entitled to a full refund and not a small portion of your investment.",1587303594,1587304183,FALSE,3,2,0.513259232,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.66E+16,1841,3,26,0,26,1587230897

And in the same time, they were also asked to make the game balanced.

68,Street Fighter V,67561174,english,"Street Fighter V, launching issues aside, is arguably the best Street Fighter title to date. This is not because of the fancy graphics and great use of the Unreal Engine, but the fair mechanics that are difficult to master and hard to exploit.

There're characters from all the previous Street Fighter games, plus some weird additions that, if you give them a chance, they might proof to be entertaining enough to at least get to know their background story. Plus, the new characters aren't near as bizarre as the ones from Street Fighter III, so if you've survived those, I can guarantee that SFV's are OK.

On the downside, I would like this game to load a bit quicker, both on startup and between battles. I don't have the fastest computer, but it's pretty decent to run a 2016 game, so I would expect the startup screen to come up a bit quicker.

Online play is where it shines. After you experiment with several characters, going online and try out your new skills can be quite fun. It allows cross-play between console players, giving you a wider choice and not-so-long waiting times. Latency seems quite decent and it played smoother than SFIV from my point of view.

Lastly, I bought the vanilla game without any additional content, and I am having fun even without all the characters unlocked. If you play for 3 or 4 hours the story and survival modes, you'll probably have enough ""fight money"" to purchase at least two characters (I've bought Akuma and Kage, being a fan of Ryu-style fighters since SFII).

 -No Dan, no Rufus, no El Feurte, no Fei Long, no Gen. Because who wants to be an interesting character when you can be Alex, Ed, or Laura?
-And instead of Evil Ryu there's Kage who is like Evil Ryu except with a shit hadoken and a really goofy design

5,Street Fighter V,65910338,english,"The basic game is fine, but it was very heavily build around microtranssactions, which makes almost impossible to unlock everything through the fight money system. You´ll still need to buy with real money everything else, though. This game really make you miss the old days when you just had to unblock everything inside the game, but Capcom really wishes you to forget that was actually a thing.

The graphics are OK, nothing really exciting or groundbreaking, except maybe some of the characters look really weird. The animation is not really great, because you can see how stiff some characters are when moving or the lack of creativity in some of the attacks because the limitations of 3D models. Compared with Dragon Ball Fighter Z animation and style, Street Fighter 5 has more in common with the last game.

Music is also a weak point in this game. Compared to the energy of some of the tracks in Street Fighter 4, the soundtrack of 5 is mostly boring. I didn´t liked all the music in 4, but so far I have no favorite song in 5.  

Finally, while I´ve been having a good time with online matches, sometimes the wait can be very long. It could be because my connection, but as far as I know, lots of people still have that issue since the release of the game.

Overall, it´s just a OK game but very abusive with microtranssactions. Recommended just for Street Fighter fans, people who doesn´t care for unblocking everything.

89,Street Fighter V,21265812,english,"SFV re-review

**this is AFTER the full upgrade to Champion Edition+Arcade Edition+buying all character season passes**

Revisiting the game after the half-baked launch in 2016, it's safe the say the game is where it should be now. Or where it should have been
3 years ago. All of that doesn't really matter now though.

Pros:
+ Good graphics for a game from 2016, runs buttery smooth at a fair frame rate. After re-installing the game in the same PC I had since launch it's behaved a lot better since.
+ Relatively easy to pick up. If you play fighting games on the reg, this is a good waste of time. The game takes you through a short tutorial about the V-Trigger mechanism the first time you start it.
+ Good connectivity. I haven't dropped from any online matches so far. The Battle Lounges are a neat addition.
+ Fully featured game modes. Finally got arcade modes and various challenge modes to brush up with. These were absent in the first iteration of SFV, so Capcom finally remedied that blunder.
+ Neat roster, interesting characters, cool skins to be had. The base roster starts at 16 characters and then more than doubles it with 3 season passes, with a 4th coming in.
+ Not a bore. At least not anymore. If you're not picky, you can fight anyone. Given the game runs the way it should for me now, I've had some dank matches I really enjoyed.

Cons:
- Everything costs money, or fight money. More characters cost money. More skins cost money. More colors cost fight money. Hell, the newest character Kage can't even be bought with money, he's a fight money exclusive.
- The fight money system is crazy. Earning the currency is a real grind. On one hand, every win feels truly rewarding. On the other hand, it drains the fun out of fighting if you're doing it to unlock content.
- The season pass system is crazy. Each pass gets more progressively more expensive. I bought all my passes on 50% sale. If they want more people playing this, either put them on sale often or make them cheaper. How on earth can enjoy a full fighting game without a full roster.
- The game trying to bend industry practices for fighting games. SF introduced the concept of bringing fighters in expensive batches and games like Mortal Kombat have followed suit. Shitty practice tbh.

Semi-issues:
~ The in-game ads. I've turned them off at the risk of gaining less fight money. It's whatever. I used to be angry about it but it's a non-issue after looking into it further.

Conclusion: It's a very good fighting game, and not many other titles bring the same gamut of intense action like Street Fighter. Picking it up as the Arcade Edition, or the [strike]Arcade Deluxe[/strike] [b]Champion[/b] edition is the best way to get the most value out of it if you dont' care about skins.

There is so little different between this and SF4.

30,Street Fighter V,64656872,english,"Too many issues to list in one coherent review.

Netcode is trash, the gameplay system rewards the use of whatever characters Capcom decides deserve that season (Vega still useless after all this time), playing this game has annoyed me in ways no other fighting game has. Even booting it up raises my blood pressure.

Horrible marketing practices with the DLC. Instead of making another Chun Li costume, fix the netcode and fix some characters. Ranked is a literal grind where everyone picks the same 4-5 characters. There's no creativity when it comes to the usage of characters. Everyone's Kage plays the same, everyone's Cammy is just gonna rush you down and force you to block forever. Lack of defensive options makes every game feel like a game of rock paper scissors on wakeup. This game has serious problems that just aren't worth dealing with anymore.

Some of the player models look like they're from completely different games sometimes. V-Trigger makes any comeback feel cheap on both sides. I never feel like I've been outplayed, or that I outsmarted my opponent. Just that they activated V-trigger at the right time. Mash MP until it eventually hits, then crank out the same combo everyone else hits. Rinse and repeat on both sides until one of you wins. The stubby normals in this game are a joke. Don't forget Ryu's anti-air jab.

After nearly 130 hours, which isn't much for a fighting game this old, the flaws in SFV have become too much to handle and I'm kind of embarrassed for having spent so much time on this miserable game. I genuinely question the abilities of anyone who claims to actually like the fighting system of this game.",1583595300,1583595300,FALSE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.66E+16,43,4,7837,0,7705,1585061713

35,Street Fighter V,64628123,english,"It's a freemium game that costs $20. The vast, VAST majority of characters are locked behind a paywall, for way too much real life money, and although you technically can unlock them via in-game currency, it takes two thousand victories to get enough to unlock a single fighter, not counting level ups. Two thousand. Keep in mind that this game also has ads, has TERRIBLE netcode, and most importantly, has a significantly lower skill ceiling than any other street fighter that came before it. All of the combos are bnb's, making it very accessible, but ultimately, boring, as almost all of the learning comes from grinding out matchup knowledge. Speaking of which, you cannot train with characters you haven't bought. This means that if you want to find out the frame data, options, punishes, and counterplay for a character you're struggling with, you're fucked unless you want to cough up the money to buy them. 

On another note, the balance is atrocious. Season 5 is probably the most balanced the game has ever been, but it is still blatantly obvious who's good and who isn't. Nash, who has consistently been a low tier since season two got almost nothing, while Rashid, who has been arguably the best character in the game since launch has been BUFFED. I repeat, they buffed the best character in the game. Why capcom.

This game also has about zero quality-of-life features that one would expect from a triple-a title, especially considering that Ultra Street Fighter IV had them. You cannot use playstation controllers on PC, you cannot set any given key on a keyboard to be a button, you can't skip through story cutscenes until about five seconds in, and you are forced to pick a character before playing online, with no chance to change them after a fight. 

And don't even get me started on the character design. All of the women in this game are designed like pornstars, to the point that I feel embarrassed playing them in front of anybody but myself. Laura, Menat, R Mika, and even Chun-Li are all just generic tits and ass characters that had their brains moved into their chest, and while previous street fighter games did admittedly have quite a lot of fanservice, they at least had dignity. 

The game's design also contradicts itself, as it is a very heavily fundamental-based game, which should revolve around footsies, but instead, revolves around rushdown. Take a game such as Samurai Shodown, for example, which is almost entirely fundamentals and footsies based, yet is still the most intense fighting game I have ever played, next to Third Strike. Samsho does everything that this game tries to do correctly. It is incredibly easy to pick up and understand, and its combos are very easy to execute, because they're almost always at about a maximum of three hits. A game like this should PUNISH pure rushdown on characters that aren't explicitly designed to be as such, not reward it.

In essence, and I'm sure you've heard this a million times, Street Fighter V caters to the casual audience at the expense of depth and quality. Even if you ARE a new player, though, this is not the best fighting game to start with. There's a lot of mechanics that can overwhelm new players, namely V-Skills, V-Reversals, and Crush-Counters, and the fact that 70% of the cast is DLC is also an amazing way to make someone never want to play a mainstream fighter ever again. They also fucked over veteran ""F2P's"" by making the champion edition upgrade more expensive than the base game. Ultra Street Fighter IV, if I remember correctly, was Five dollars, not Twenty Five. 

TL;DR, get USFIV instead. Capcom is way too greedy.

The online have never been great, but it wasn't bad either. 
It was fine before the new netcode patch in Season 5. It was playable, 7/10 matches were great on 4-5 bar connections.
But now, with the most recent patch it's unplayable. The game now drops inputs while playing online and slows down a lot to resync instead or skipping/rollback. I've seen matches where I literally get hit while blocking. The slow downs actually change the pacing of the match and obviously your own inputs and combos and what you see on screen.
Getting hit while blocking and dropping combos is a given now while playing online.
The netcode issue is specially more pronounced against PS4 players, and of course may get even worse if the other end is using Wi-Fi. It doesn't matter if the game says it's 5 bars, the issues persist.
PC vs PC seems fine, but it won't fix Brazilian Kens with 2 bars.

For offline content it's fine. 40 characters, a lot of stages, every costume unlocked if you have champion, arcade mode, story mode even though it's trash, and some combo challenges. And since there's Champion Edition now, there isn't much to worry about the unfair Fight Money grind that we had to face during all these years.
The game in it's current state is refined and it's pretty much what it should've been since launch.

I enjoyed this game the most during Season 4, when it was playable. But now it's time to move on to another game.

-easy to learn
-execution heavily reduced in comparison to previous iterations
-decent roster (now)
-Kind of balanced characters? some are obviously top tiers.

cons
-Netcode is STILL trash years later
-V-Triggers
-patient gameplay is not rewarded

7/26/2016 Update: The game still has terrible netcode; matches are extremely laggy even if the person lives 15 minutes away, and you both have ""good"" internet. At this point, Capcom isn't going to fix it. You should only get this game if you plan on playing offline, have a place around you that does weekly tournaments, or it's extremely cheap because there isn't even enough content here to be worth the $60 price tag.

9/26/2016 Update: See the 7/26/2016 update

11/3/2016 Update: See the 7/26/2016 Update (Game still isn't worth the $60 price tag. I really wouldn't be surprised if they slowly stop supporting the PC version of the game as well since they seem to like doing Playstation exclusive content already.) Maybe Season 2 of this game will bring with it a much-needed upgrade to the netcode since they are trying to push this game as an e-sport much more than they have in the past.

12/20/2016 Update: Season 2 comes with no mention of fixing the atrocious load times, the one-sided rollback that has been there since day 1, keyboard support, Arcade Mode, and many more problems that should have been fixed by now. Oh, and for the people waiting for the Linux/SteamOS version, you can assume that isn't coming out at all.

Much better alternatives: Third Strike on Fightcade, Guilty Gear Xrd Revelator (Join the Discord, and you won't have issues finding a match for GGXrd), Killer Instinct (Sadly you need Windows 10 for this one), Tekken 7 (Comes out in Spring. Wait for the reviews, but from what I have heard, the PC version runs like a dream and is the closest version to the Arcade)

6/23/2017 Update: Tekken 7, Blazblue Centralfiction, and Guilty Gear Rev 2 are all out on Steam. Skip this game and get one of those instead.

9/13/2019 Update: Tekken 7, Under Night In-Birth, and Guilty Gear Strive are all things, and this game still has some of the worst netcode out there.

2/27/2020 Update: They updated the netcode. It's now worse as it has the horrible teleporting issue caused by poorly implemented rollback AND slowdown caused by the changes.

           I don't know what Capcom did behind doors but it has worked so well for them and I wish them all the best for the next decade or two.

Bad is the lack of server support for this; was the money you got from us not enough for good servers Capcom!?  I wan't to play multiplayer but the damn connection barely even holds up that even at the beggining it is extremely naggy and annoying to read connection lost.

First, the base game is essentially incomplete. There are only sixteen characters unlocked, but with the Champion Edition upgrade, there's a full roster of forty.

The business model this game launched with was inexcusable, but with the Champion Edition, you can get the complete experience for a much fairer buy-in price. I can recommend that, though you should feel free to wait for a sale if you'd prefer. But the amount of content in the CE is solid, and the netcode, famously bad for years, has recently been improved (and is promised to continue improving).

- The game shows ads in the middle of the game

So I've given this game a negative review a couple of years ago and I decided to change that because it's not updated with the current state of the game. For the sake of preservation the original review is down below.

SFV has improved a lot over the years, to the point where I can safely recommend it. People will say that ""it shouldn't take 4 years for a released game to be good"" and I agree, but don't forget how many changes SFIV went before it became as iconic as it is today. SFIII also went through 3 iterations before it became one of the best fighting games out there. And let's not even get into SFII. Capcom just can't do things right the first time when it comes to SF it seems. Anyways, while there's a lot of DLC, the 16 character base roster is fine and getting fight money to buy out some characters isn't too bad at the start because of all the one-time EXP you get from character trials, watching the character videos, and character stories.

The main complaint in my original review was the online lag. It's gotten significantly better over time. Just a couple of days ago there was a patch that finally improved the netcode. It's not perfect, but it's better than before. I've found that Battle Lounge works properly even with people from other countries, and casual/ranked matches are enjoyable.

The updates over the years have done the right thing this time: Give characters more options. Suddenly some bad matchups become tolerable when you have a different V-skill, and seeing your character do new stuff is cool.

As for the gameplay, this is the controversial point. A lot of people don't like the feel of the game because of a plethora of reasons. I'm not a huge SF player but I do like fighting games, and I enjoy SFV considerably. The gameplay might not be as tight as SFIII or SFIV, but it's enjoyable nonetheless. The game is more accessible without killing off all depth and that's a hard task when it comes to a 30 year old franchise. It doesn't make it so easy that a beginner can pick up a controller and get double perfects on anyone that knows what they're doing. It's struck a good balance point IMO. Balance-wise, it's Street Fighter. There's always going to be a ""better character"" but you can play basically anyone and do well.

Of course, the game has it's flaws. DLC is a worrying issue and there's a LOT of it, there's still a small amount of laggy matches, rarely unplayable but any amount of lag makes a fighting game less enjoyable and worse, and a lot of costumization is locked behind Fight Money which I don't like.

I picked this game up for 8 Euros on a sale. That's a steal for a game that can give thousands of hours of entertainment, and it goes close to that price regularly on sales. You can buy the champion edition upgrade for 25 Euros which will give you access to all characters. That's a good value if you can get it as well.


[b] Original review: [/b] This was a dissapointing experience. The Battle Lounge, the only place you can challenge friends in, has extreme lag even when my friend lives close to me and our connections are good. Battle Lounge is unplayable from my experience. Online VS randoms was better, but still slightly laggy, enjoyable but still you can notice the lag, and that's unacceptable for a fighting game.

Also, it took me atleast one hour to get the game working. Avast blocks it, and a bunch of fixes didn't do anything. Turns out running SFV as admin makes it stop working, I consider myself a tech savvy individual, but even with the help of multiple guides, it took me 1+ hour.

This is without mentioning the fact that characters like Akuma and Guile are DLC.

I can't recommend the game in this state. Buy TEKKEN 7 or Injustice 2 instead.",1513981695,1582467349,TRUE,0,0,0.520577669,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.66E+16,118,10,4162,0,33,1600281557

29,Street Fighter V,52792398,english,"Pros:
🔹The voice acting is top-notch.
🔹You can choose English or Japanese voice acting for each individual character. 
🔹Ranked match is quite difficult.  So, this game presents a lot of challenges and challengers.
🔹There are a lot of people playing online.  So, it's quite easy to find a match.
🔹Street Fighter V is a safe investment if you're looking for a fighting game you will be able to play online.  It has remained popular even since its release.  A lot of games have come and gone in the past few years, but SFV's popularity has never waned.
🔹There are tournaments in which you can participate if you reach a high enough level of skill.
🔹Buying the Champion Edition is a way to negate a lot of the criticism of this game because it includes a lot of the characters, costumes, and content.

Cons:
🔸Street Fighter V lacks polish in many ways.
🔸Severely flawed game design.
🔸Questionable game mechanics. 
🔸Character balance is not very good.  This can be seen even in characters choices people make in tournaments and in ranked match.  You will see far more Guile players than Nash players, for example. 
🔸The netcode could certainly be a lot better.  However, using a wired internet connection and playing against people who use a wired connection definitely improves the experience.
🔸Far too many microtransactions.
🔸The costume colors seem to be designed in a way that makes it difficult or perhaps even impossible to get all of them.  In fact, some of the colors are exclusive to the PlayStation version of the game.
🔸""Fight money"" seems to accumulate far too slowly.  This makes a lot of in-game purchases difficult, such as buying characters, stages, and costume colors.
🔸There aren't many defensive options.
🔸It would have been nice to have more language options than just English & Japanese for the characters' voices since people play it all over the world. 
🔸The lobby system is nowhere near as good as it is in games like Guilty Gear Xrd Rev 2 and BlazBlue: Centralfiction.  Even if there are 8 people in a lobby, only 2 of them can fight.  The rest have to wait for their turn.
🔸A lot of the characters have combos that last far too long and do far too much damage.  Once you get hit, your buttons won't do anything until the combos is finished.  There is no way to get out of the combo.  Combo-breakers do not exist in this game.  This type of thing can make for a very boring and frustrating game.  For example:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5H2yrjcamrE

Street Fighter V seems to be designed in a way that makes it more fun to watch than it is to play.  In a lot of cases, I find myself enjoying watching SFV events more than I do actually playing the game.
It doesn't seem as fun or as enjoyable to play than previous Street Fighter titles in the series.
I believe that a game should be primarily designed to deliver value to the people who purchased it.  It should be fun, enjoyable, and rewarding to play.
I do not believe a game should be designed to nickel-and-dime people with microtransactions.  I also don't believe that a game should be designed to manipulate people into playing, even when they don't want to by offering ""rewards"" in the form of in-game currency.  This type of thing seems like a chore list and takes a lot of the fun out of playing it. 
It's difficult for me to recommend a game when it's obvious that the game could have easily been designed to be better, more fun to play, and more consumer-friendly. 
As a huge fan of Street Fighter, I want Street Fighter titles to be as good as they can be and everything they can be. I want them to be well-designed. I want people, including myself, to be very happy with the experience of owning it and playing it.
There's other fighting games I would recommend over this one, such as Tekken 7.
Some people will enjoy SFV.  Others might think that it is simply not as good as previous Street Fighter titles, such as Ultra Street Fighter IV.
Reviews and feelings about Street Fighter V are very mixed.  So, I suggest trying it out yourself to see if it's your type of game.

So if you intent to buy that game please, be aware the game lack of stage and character content. It is very difficult to get fighting money and the game is full of micro-transactions. 

If like me you played Street Fighter 2 when you were a bit younger and decided to get back to it, with this game. Do not be surprise to see the likes of Blanka, Sagat, M.Bison and other veteran characters being locked. Personally I miss E.Honda but that just a personal opinion.

It might be me, but I found the characters very ugly.... Capcom use an unreal engine 4, but I really found the characters ugly. Despite the fact I like the colour, I found the SFX to be crap.  I would go as far as to say that street fighter 4 is far better looking game. In fact Street Fighter 4 is a better game.

Is it all bad? Well they are some half-baked idea in this game which could have make this game truly great. But to get access to it, you have to pay for it. If it wasn't for those 1.6 millions idiots who accepted all those micro-transactions, Capcom would have been forced to make some characters available. That remind me that some of the characters (Blanka, Menat and 2 others) who are normally locked are available for a limited time. This means that Capcom has the power to unlock them if they want.

So if you pay more than 5.00$ (or REALLY equivalent currency) you have been ripped off. In short the game could be titled: ""Street fighter 5 - pay to win ultimate edition"".

They simply disabled the third party mods and forced PC players to verify files (meaning it wipes out the fix) before they can play online.

So finally the game was getting a little bit good and then CAPCOM pulls out this champion edition crap? what the hell. The sad thing is that i'm beyond salvation now i will buy this ""upgrade"" shit is too late for my but if you are reading my review maybe it not too late for you save yourself.

Forums have given advice ranging from fixing registry entries to creating a second Windows 10 account, which is LUDICROUS. Again, first-year Playstation 4 release, come on.

This has nothing to do with online mode, this is offline! Going into Training and selecting a stage causes the game to go into slow-motion with audio desync. Once the match actually starts, the slow down is intermittent. Again, this is just on the High settings - the preset the Playstation 4 version uses - not Max.

In it's current Champion Edition state, the game is finally in a condition that I can recommend. In addition to its already accessible, yet nuanced gameplay, it now boasts enough content to justify it as a full game, and to be very honest, more.

SFV:CE is a complete Street Fighter experience. Despite deviating a little from its roots by empowering oki-play and offense, it has its own niche as an accessible (my friend felt it was much easier to grasp this game over to Smash Bros) entry to the series.

lets start with the cons

CONS-
-forced input delay
-cannot test characters before purchase
-cannot skip cutscenes in story mode
-extremely simlpified fighting game that makes checkers look complex
-awful balance 
-wildly innacurate hurtboxes/hitboxes
-terrible metagame
-netcode is atrocious at best
-instead of fixing the issues from season 1, you made them worse
-pseudo pay to win model
-characters are EXTREMELY expensive
-costumes are terrible, most of them might aswell just make the characters completely naked
-slow repetetive gameplay(i play 3rd strike mostly and many other games and they dont feel repetitive)
-crappy lobby search system
-shittiest music of any street fighter title to date (worse than Alpha 3's music)

PROS-
-screenshots look nice
-rewards you for playing like a moron

if this game had a different game and characters absolutely no one would still be playing i

all in all somehow ACTUALLY worse than Street Fighter 4 was

48,Street Fighter V,37876944,english,"[h1]Overall[/h1]

Not a bad game. My most played SF game and my first online SF game.
It is a lot more balanced than other 2D fighting games, in my opinion, in terms of damage/speed etc, and variety of styles/archetypes. 
Grapplers, zoners, brawlers and more. A lot of characters are unique. Each character has area where he/she is strong. No universal copy-pasted moves like parries and teleports (Hello MK11 =P).

Special moves can be executed with quarter-circles, full circles, by holding button and more. Not a huge fan of full circles or charged moves, but it is better for balance. 

Some soundtracks are good.

Art style is not exactly the one i would prefer, but it`s not anime!

Some costumes and character redesigns are cool. Cody, Balrog. Some are still silly, like Cammy, Ed.

Execution difficulty was decreased since SFIV. I played a bit of USFIV and it was harder to use some specials. Forced ""Negative Edge"" option in SFV has pros and cons. 

No icons for DS4 controller or even PC controllers with numbers.

Move list can be very confusing for newcomers. Blue fist icon, red boot icon. You should play a lot to remember everything.

There is no description of V-Skill or V-Trigger on character select screen or in move list. I had to search in Google.

Game is good, but i won't forget pre-CE release. Paywall, netcode, grind.

[h1]Original release[/h1]

A lot characters are locked behind paywall. Either pay or grind like slave. The most stupid part of that is that they locked characters like Guile and Balrog. At least Ryu and Ken are free. I'm not against classic characters as DLC, but Guile and Balrog? They didn't locked just another Shoto, but they locked characters with different gameplay style.
No arcade mode on release. Stages are locked behind paywall. Some classic soundtracks and simple recolors are locked behind paywall.


40 euros for Demo was too much. I refunded it and bought the key a lot cheaper.

[h1]Arcade Edition[/h1]

3 season passes + 1 DLC with three characters. Kage could have been bought only in-game.
They removed/reduced ways to get FM, and it became even worse grind.
Some balance patches were released.
Netcode is very bad. Two modders created 2 different netcode fix mods.
Two V-triggers now and V-Skills.

[h1]Champion Edition[/h1]

Haven't bought it yet. Will update review someday. 
It has all content, except CPT skins. You can consider it a full game. Don't know if they will fix netcode.

My gripes are the fact this game has motion blur, but you can turn that off. You still go against the odd laggy player if you set connection quality to 5. Ranked needs a best of 5 ruleset so you can learn matchups better, and study opponent habits for you to improve and overcome.

Other than that, neutral is great in this game. It has a nice decent pace that isn't overwhelming, and you don't need flashy thousand button input combos to win. I still suck but I'm enjoying the self teaching on fundamentals and neutral game.

98,Street Fighter V,62982677,english,"Disclaimer: This is my first SF game and 2nd fighting game Ive taken seriously, so this is kinda for fighting game noobs. I cant comment on offline modes as I barely play them.

Quick warning about the game: The arcade edition doesn't contain S1 characters again for some reasons. Shame on Capcom for not highlighting this on the store page.

On to the review:

I played SFV in order to find out why people make the claim that fighting games required discipline and serious training. Truth be told, I picked up SFV because of its price (was on sale for 10 bucks), and I can say as a former scrub/noob that yeah this game convinced me of that very premise. Through my journey with this game, I started from losing ~50-100 matches in a row to rookies (the main reason I still have a 20% win rate) till now 75 hours later(at the time of this post) being confident enough to take on silver and Gold and win. It took me a long period of Ls and sore fingers for me to even finally leave rookie league. With all that said, I would only recommend buying the game if you have spare time to play it. Like a lot of time on your hands to train and be better. If not, you probably wont enjoy it as much and your money is better spent elsewhere value wise. If you do have alotta time on your hand, I'd say the game's worth it.

The game frequently goes on sale for like ~10 bucks CAD, so I HIGHLY advice not buying full price. Especially if you plan to get the championship edition(honestly you are better of buying it as well). With that said, the game does have issues: The horrible netcode for starters. I've lost lot of games due to the bad lag that this game musters. Sure there is an UNOFFICIAL patch that helps a bit, but its not from Capcom and at the time of writing this the patch has led to some issues of its own since not everyone has it. There's also the ads, which are honestly scummy, I'd be more furious with it, but its possible to turn them off. The lack of in game guides also doesn't really help. Sure theres a brief tutorial, but it barely helps as each character has their own different combos and playstyle. Its sad that most of my learning came from youtubers than from the game. The ranked is also grindy as hell, I wont recommend it for everyone for their sanity.

This review may seem super long, but I think thats due to me being a bit passionate about it or atleast my experience with the game. Very few games have made me feel so happy with every win, irregardless of the enemies difficulty. Funny enough, it reminds me of my first time with dark souls. And even fewer games have given me that feeling of progression that comes less from the game mechanics and more from within me.

BUT, now that CE dropped, I gave this game another shot, and safe to say I am pleased with how this game finally turned out to be. Input delays aren't a problem anymore now, netcode is still shi*t and needed a fan-patch to work properly, but it still works okay before the patch.

If this game was free to play I could sort of understand the reasoning for how it is.  However this is a game I paid for and micro transactions are incredibly obnoxious.  You might think, ""I don't mind paying two or three dollars for a character"".  Think more like six dollars per character.  Yeah you can grind for fight money, but it's made evident Capcom expects to make the process of grinding so annoying you'll eventually cave in and just buy the characters with real money.  You can unlock maybe one character through story mode, but this is a one time thing and you can't replay story mode for grinding, only online.

All in all it's an okay game ruined by Capcom's business tactics.  I would really recommend trying out another game to not support this type of practice becoming an industry standard.",1580573670,1580573670,FALSE,3,0,0.543568492,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.66E+16,42,12,1223,0,838,1594527469

The awful netcode is surely the most noticeable and i will say if you are planning on only ever playing this game locally obviously that wont be a problem but as 90 percent of us will probably want to fight online at some point it will be an issue teleporting opponents and having hit someone getting the damage then time reversing and saying no you got hit instead is just one example. this game also has a nasty habit of eating your inputs, you press a button and it says no. Ive played this game with 3 different controllers and a fight stick and no matter what i use it likes to just tell my inputs no a fair amount of the time. also may i just say if you are new to fighting games this is definitly NOT a good place to start. you get very Very little help learning how anything works and will have to do outside research just to learn how your character actually works and god forbid you want to get a new character without the champion edition, get ready for days of grinding and doing every quest available just to get to the point to be able to afford a character. oh and last point thats just a personal annoyance is the fact that this game advertises the champion edition to you before EVERY match. Thanks street fighter i already paid for your game can i play it without ads please thank you. if you are a previously big time fan of street fighter im sure its probably fine but as someone who was new to the series i would rather play a fan made fighting game for a series ive never heard of than this. If you do still decide to get this game i wish you luck and hope your game has less problems than mine did and hey, maybe by the time you read this everything will have been fixed and itll be perfect but as of now i hate trying to play it and everytime i do its a chore at best and infuriating at worst. *edit still shit*",1577209669,1580364886,FALSE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.66E+16,148,14,6949,0,4549,1596821376

This is the EA of fighting games and shines a light on the problems with gaming today. An example of cutting out content and charging players a second time.

-if i choose to get only matches with people that have a 5/5 connection, i still get the shittiest connections.

-if i choose a low tier character i am absolutely doomed, and if im not playing a top tier it is gonna take a humongous amount of effort to play and have a chance of winning, even less skilled player can win against a more skilled person just because of the character.

-if i want to play outside of ""play room"" (basically lobbies, why not just call them that) i don´t get to choose what character i want to use, i have to use the one i set as my favorite.

-if i go into the challenges (basically every other games characters tutorials, why not just call them that), by default the game just shows the moves names... like, im fucking new show me the inputs, it is literally easier for me and it covers less space on screen.

-if i go into a challenge that needs a dash or a simple forward input mid combo i have to watch the demonstration to find out or figure it out on my own, why not just put it with the inputs?

-if i enter ranks as a rookie, i only get paired against bronzes, once i got to bronze i only got paired with super bronzes... i lost on purpose back to rookie because it seemed strange to me that i always got paired against higher tier people, just to get to rookie and inmediately get paired with a bronze... why not pair evenly? and if this is suposed to challenge me to tier up, why am i never on the other side where im playing a lower tier person?

-if i go into practice the game runs slower than when on the actual match so the timings i have practiced are worthless (because timing here is actually necesary for a lot of links and thats cool) but it is all worthless because another guy with a top tier character is simply gonna spam MP faster than your LP, and whose every special ability is unpunishable.

-If i want to play with a controller i´ll have to put double the effort into everything.

-if i want to rank it can take up to 15 minutes to find a match despite there being a shitton of players in Q (same rank).

-if i get a rank i get people higher tier and enormously higher level, im talking me being lvl 17 getting paired against people who are lvl 125.

AND YES, i´ll keep playing it because once you figure the game out you can deal with most of this issues, but what am saying is, there are characters that are so easy and cheap for begginers to use, that people without skill dont bother learning the game, and thus you end with a retarded pure grapple lvl 35 zangief on rank to who you cannot deal with because even tho he hasnt put any effort into the game he can win easily but me being the one who wants to fight in the fighting game (go figure such crazy idea) have to input so much time into it just to deal with that, dont make easy characters fuck sake.

that is precisely the issue, a lot of players who want to actually put effort into the game and learn cool shit and apply it end up just giving up and playing the same characters as the guys beating them up, and thus the game lowers its playerbase skill even more.

After a 100 hours, i have overcomed most of the issues listed above, still, retards playing shotas(Characters like Ryu, Ken, Sakura Akuma) and graplers have way too big of an advantage, i have switched to G, a top tier, and it is way easier to win like this, just wanted to prove a point, after a 100 hours i still get beaten by some random shota users that got into practice mode for 15 minutes at best, and me with over 20 hours in practice mode cant do much about their spam, because the game allows it, hell, they even get to be plus after some special moves like wtf.

So all in all, the real pain in the ass characters to play against are:
-Ryu
-Ken
-Sakura
-Akuma
-G
-Bison
-Ibuki
-Fucking Bison
-No, seriously, Wtf is up with Bison??",1577513351,1579052368,FALSE,1,0,0.441586107,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.66E+16,47,4,6985,36,1210,1601487325

They had a chance to improve the game in CE, but they opted instead for more OP Spam scrub characters like Gill & Seth which are just more Urien & G, instead of enjoyable skillful characters. The game play is still the Rock-Paper-Scissors guessing game Ono loves to play with kids. Every match is just that stupid tick-throw crotch-punch Guessing Game.

The only thing that sets the Warlords apart from the Lower levels is solely the ability to perform endless combos which take no skill except your own basement button memorization with complete disregard for anything happening on the screen. All the Top players rely only on the endless combos of some scrub characters

They've cut all the openings further, so nearly every move in the game requires even more careful timing with less frames, and none of it feels like it should, it always feels like you have to push the buttons at the wrong time.

That's not Fighting Game skill, thats staring at your controller counting beats not really caring what's happening on the screen.

They may as well make everything in the game 1 frame links at this point, as those are the only people left playing this game. 

Still the Battle Lounge doesn't allow you to limit players by class ranking so you're constantly invaded by Ultra Diamonds using their primary character just to show you what a 30 hit combo looks like in individual hits, and Battle Lounge was about the only thing this game has going for it, so...

Casual Match still has no option to continue playing after 2-3 matches if you end up playing someone you enjoy playing. Casual Matches still don't let you change your character, meaning there's literally nothing casual about it. 

The combination of the above mean there's really no way to enjoy a quality fun match-up where you're free to play around with different characters without being ganked by some troll who comes into Battle Lounge to show off his amazing button-pushing skills and who loves nothing more than turning the match into Rock Paper Scissors all day.

Ono is still a Pedophile, but the people at Capcom will punish you for saying it, and permanently ban you for mentioning it or his pocket kiddie lure.

Ono is the entire reason the game will never have any semblance of fair or balanced game play, nor do anything but pander to the pathetic kids who worship him. The game is pretty much like having your face down the back of Ono's underpants, like we're there to enjoy his most intimate dirty secrets and mental problems.

Perhaps the game could be Rock, Paper Scissors instead, and each character comes onto the stage and just uses the hand gestures for paper, scissors, and a rock, and each time you get it wrong, you just lose 65% of your health.

Also, these new stupid Extra Battles are pretty misleading and dishonest. It says it costs you 2000 fm for 4 fights, but actually its 2000 fm per fight, and mandatory 4 fights to get the ""free"" costume, which takes an entire month to complete.

Single Player content still sucks, and there's no way to increase the number of opponents so you never really get to play against all characters.

Champion added V2 skills that were obviously much better for some than others. A lot of characters still can't do 1/4 of what the scrub characters can do.

Its was a bit more busy when it came out, but its dying down again because no real problems have been addressed. Just not enough people willing to be dummy punching bags, exploited in a guessing game by the very few tick-throw scrubs the game design is tailored to.

----------------------
[Original (still 100% applicable)]:

Its a game designed for 1% of the top players to enjoy.  Don't waste your time and money on the game unless you want to devote months and months to the study and rote memorization of every bit of frame data for every single move of every single character in a game which trickle releases new characters throughout each year's ""season"".  

And after you learn all of that, you'll spend all your game play time blocking and blocking, unable to move or strike, but at least you'll now know why you can't move.  Your block stuns are massive and the recovery frames of striking a blocking opponent are almost non-existent,  so your fastest 3 frame strike is going to take you many more block stun frames before you can even release it,  and by then your opponents hardest punch will beat your 3 frame lightest punch so you're constantly being out struck by much harder and much slower strikes. 

On top of that,  if you do get a 3 frame window for your light,  sfv has strength priority that will out punch your light with any other incoming strike of harder power, further negating the ability to get out a 3 frame light strike. 

And add to that the crush counter that is a very fast medium strike for alot of op characters that will crumple you if you throw out anything slower than a 3 frame light,  and will often also crumple your 3 frame light coming out of your block stun as well.  

And add to that the ability for certain characters to throw out a safe EX move once they have any 3 frame window of vulnerability wherein you might have been able to get a strike in, which instantly closes the gap and beats anything you were going to do,  allowing them to repeat the entire cycle. 

And add to that certain characters that actually have v-reversals that strike you and lead to further combos or block strings,  once you did finally successfully strike him with your lightest hit, which instantly just turns into you getting hit instead, whereas other characters only have v-reversals that escape. 

Add to that the extreme unbalanced frame data and movesets that give some characters every single advantage and move and reversal and then just gives them more of everything whilst other characters have dinky movesets that cause them to be unable to do in kind what has been done to them, leaving only a certain clique of the cast able to apply limitless pressure and punishments to the rest of the cast which absolutely cannot. 

And add to that the Ultra of the same op characters that does nothing but give them even better frame data, recovery,  attack speed and comboing ability, Notwithstanding they already had the best in the game, greatly multiplying the design imbalances & poor game play

And you're left with an extremely one-sided gameplay that leaves one player essentially blocking the entire match, and only those that have memorized every bit of frame data from every single character can even hope to know at which point in the 99 second match you will have a 1/60th of a second window where you can successfully execute your lightest weakest strike which absolutely must be directly combo'd into your biggest longest combo or else all you were able to do was get that one lightest weakest strike on your opponent during the match. 

There's no sense of a fight.  Either your opponent is pressing his barrage of buttons with you unable to move, or you are pushing your buttons for a combo with your opponent unable to move 

And that's all the game is. 

Nothing that's enjoyable for anything but less than 1% of the number of people who have purchased the game and wanted to play a decent street fighter game.  

There should probably be a class action law suit brought against capcom for creating a game with overwhelmingly poor reviews which is designed simply so a few people can exploit the rest of the community of game owners.

95,Street Fighter V,61455006,english,"So during Capcom's ""dark age"" SF5 was released to poor reviews and unfortunately missed the game's sales target. The game seemed to lack the appropriate amount of content in general to begin with and lacked the character and color fans were expecting. Therefor the game's visuals are seemingly dull and pale in comparison to the franchises predecessors. Personally, i could care less how the game's graphics look but honestly the art direction Capcom's fighting game department took in SF5 as well as MVCI are strange. So for me it took away a lot of the nostalgia and love i had growing up with these sort of games. It just felt like they made visuals a backseat priority and focused most of their efforts on the feel of the game. So gameplay on the other hand is relatively slow, but feels smooth and enjoyable when both players are at their best! It feels exciting landing a hit and learning both the game and character mechanics are extremely rewarding and gives you a reason to continue playing. Although, you can always look up the proper information to help you understand the game better, if you're a slower learner. I'm honestly too lazy to go into detail about the game's flaws that are honestly not that important nowadays as we reach the end of the game's lifespan, so i'll summarize. Is the final copy of SF5  (Champion Edition) worth the price upon release? YES! There are plenty of characters to learn and choose from! So finding a character is a bit difficult only because of the variety of play styles to pick from. Also there are a large amount of stages and costumes to enjoy when purchasing the new Champion Edition. In conclusion, wait on the Champion edition if you are looking to buy!

It's hard to explain but it's almost like dating someone who is too impeccably defined yet basically boorish, as opposed to someone who is clearly flawed but interesting and thus more attractive. That is not to say that I think SFV is not a decent fighting game, it's just a sadly average street fighter entry in my eyes.

27,Street Fighter V,25658496,english,"Welp, I can once again recommend this game. Barely.

Positives:
+There's legit single-player content now.
+Still an online community with PS4 crossplay.
+You can technically unlock all the characters and stages for free. If you work.
+SFV has the simplest fighting system since SF2. You should be able to play any character you want!
+The fighting system is legitimately fun. Spacing is important, but it doesn't get as ridiculous as the focus-dash-canceling maneuvering of SF4. Every meter has a purpose, and can be spent in parts or all at once. Button priority is simple (mediums beat lights, heavies beat mediums, but lights are faster than heavies). You can't die to chip damage unless you get Super'd.

Negatives:
-SFV's version of rollback sucks. The community is large enough for now that you won't notice much, but it'll be worse whenever we all stop playing.
-The currency system is a mess. SFV wants all the benefits of F2P without actually being free, and there's little Skinner box ploys all over the place to try and entice you to slip into a cycle of ear-spend-earn until you accidentally spend real money. You get barely any currency from winning matches online, so you'll have a hard time unlocking all the extra content. Additionally, some single-player content (Arcade) doesn't give you currency at all.
-SFV has the simplest fighting system since SF2. There's not alot of combo variation, and there's only 1 Super per character for some reason.

Capcom is slowly becoming EA in terms of business model. They also have no early supporter loyalty. Typically if you buy a game in it's earliest state when it's released, the devs would say thanks and give those supporters something in return for helping push in funding for later builds of the game. Mind you, at the current time Capcom was in danger of going out of business. In the end, we got dumb costumes. NOT actual content and characters that we deserved in the first place. The handful of us that have purchased early waited for about a year for something refreshing to happen to this game. Then, it finally comes, Season 1! Only to be told to cough up more money. The backlash from this is STILL a visible factor in it's reviews. 

Capcom, if your brand has any sort of decency left for your patrons, GIVE US WHAT WE DESERVE! You're killing yourselves with these paid DLC characters. You did it with SF4, but, it was a big bundle with a huge balance update(s). Even released FREE updates for SF4. SF5 is a prime example of why you guys are going bankrupt. Quite frankly, you should have. I wouldn't have minded having USF4 to be THE Street Fighter for as long as anyone remembers the name Capcom. That game was nearly perfect.

Ultimately, SF5 isn't a terrible game, but it's subpar AT BEST. The lack of depth and a shallow learning curve makes the game boring and unrewarding. Games being released like the way that SF5 was, should be illegal. With the FCC targetting loot boxes, I wouldn't be surprised if they start trying to crack down on games that have stupid amounts of DLCs.

Now you can buy the Champion Edition Upgrade Kit and save a good amount of money. Best bet is to pick up the game on sale and then buy the Upgrade Kit, unless they give you the option to buy Street Fighter V: Champion Edition as that should be $30. While the base game is very much lacking in terms of characters, Champion Edition makes up for the 16 character roster by adding every additional character up until the 40th character (Seth) is added in February. Champion Edition is a great package to start out with, but I must say that the base game just isn't worth it by itself. Having 39 characters to choose from with multiple costumes to choose from will make anybodies' Street Fighter experience a lot better than base game's paltry offerings.

**Only recommended if you are willing to put up with a shrinking population and are into collecting costumes. The gameplay is pretty good to me, but it can either be an acquired taste or just something awful if you do not like the flow of this Street Fighter. This game is very offense orientated with certain characters struggling to deal with barrages of 50/50s and blockstrings. 

Make sure to get it when it is cheap for a decent time, but if you are paying full price (obviously when it isn't on sale) make sure you are going into this game committed to learning match ups and frame data. This game punishes those who don't follow frame data.**

SFV is -eventually- worth your time & money. It has been years in the making but the game now has a decent set of game modes, a respectable roster of fighters (though with some notable omissions imo) and a good selection of costumes & colours available for all characters - well, some more than others (I think I counted 20 costumes for Chun-li, naturally).

The gameplay however is still very much what you've heard about for the majority of the games lifecycle, somewhat of a low barrier to entry and mostly a pretty low skill ceiling compared to both other fighters and previous series entries. With the champion edition though, all characters now have a second v-skill and v-trigger abilities, so there is a considerable amount more depth and variety in moves than it initially launched with which does help keep the game interesting.

All that said - you can still quite easily find some decent enjoyment in the game now. It's just such a shame that the development process has been so publicly awful - and those 'Ad Style' costumes are still one of the most disgusting practices i've seen in gaming, utterly shameless.


>>Original Review below just for posterity<<

The greed is just astonishing, to go as far as put advertisements during load screens and plaster them ON CHARACTERS is just insane.

The pricing is ok. The fact that there is a ""free"" stupidly long grinding alternative seems (at the time) badly designed/presented.
I didn't try the game for 1+ year, so technical issues might have been fixed?

Pro :
 - Street Fighter.
 - Easy to pick/learn, hard to master.
 - Good artistic direction (overall look of the game) but EVERY female character design is still entrenched in its femme fatale eyes candy one dimension... a bit sad.
 - Powerful resolution scaling. Can run on low-end computer.

Con :
 - Netcode is really bad at the time. Lots of packet loss and the game does not run with a prediction system, meaning your game can have ""lag stuttering"" (the same an online video can have lag buffering).
 - The stage and characters are loaded at the last possible seconds (could have been done way sooner, e.g. when you found your opponent) and the loading time were quite long.
 - Comming back to the main menu (e.g. each time a duel ended) could take a significant amount of time (slow the overall pace of your session).
 - You cannot try the new characters in training... which for me is a no go. YES you have a 2 weeks test period when they are released but you have to be here each time.

The term ""DLC"" is not something that is usually associated with positivity, but in this case, DLC is actually a good thing. Now with the 'Arcade Edition' update, SFV has become more appealing than ever, and it will continue to do so.

Characters here have a wide variety of outfits to choose from (some characters even have new default outfits) and the V-Skills (and V-Triggers) are fun to use and work around with. The graphics overall appear solid for the most part (Ken's face notwithstanding) and the music feels mostly good. The extra missions added to AE may feel bothersome at times, but it does feel satisfying when you complete those missions and unlock content which certain fans would truly appreciate.

As arguably the biggest fighting game franchise of all time, this new game surely has big shoes to fill, and it does so slowly but surely in my opinion. Especially with this AE update, SFV has become less of a 'Street Fighter' game and more of a 'Capcom Fanservice' game which, upon hindsight, is not a bad thing at all.

And this was supposedly a 4 bar connection between the two of us. Playing against a random online, I ran into similar issues. The frame rate soft-locks at 30FPS for some reason and really made it annoying to play in addition to the somewhat laggy connection. Sometimes the frames would even go back up to 60 randomly and then you go from super slow to super fast in the middle of a match, making you whiff some moves or not know what happened. I played the Arcade mode and the first match went smoothly . The second match however, did not. Even not against another player, the game soft locked itself again to 30FPS. This time however, the game moved at a snails pace. Every 1 second in-game was about 3-4 seconds in real time. And that quite honestly is inexcusable.

Tried it again after the latest patch (Champion Edition).
If you liked SFV before, it's more of the same. If you didn't like SFV before, you won't like it now.

Some V-Skills / V-Triggers are still obviously the right choice, creativity is punished.
Footsies in SFV are still gimped compared to SF4. Combos are still medium into medium.
Some V-Triggers are still bull. SF4 had some jank, SFV calls it a mechanic.

The online is still broken. I prefer SF4's delay based netcode to this one-sided rollback crap. 
Since this game doesn't have tight links, it doesn't even need rollback netcode, I dunno what they were thinking. This does not compare to the netcodes of Killer Instinct, Skull Girls or similar games. I dread the release of Seth, they probably massacred my boy.

Capcom made mistakes with this game, vanilla was a shitshow, story mode was a joke, Arcade Edition seemed to be a last-ditch effort to keep the game afloat. It was not a good time  to be a fan of Street Fighter. And my review of SFV long carried a thumbs down (see below for the original). But Capcom learned from their mistakes, and the result is Street Fighter V: Champion Edition. A result which I can genuinely say I enjoy playing.

With the release of Champion Edition, both Gill and Seth have rounded out what is currently understood to be the final roster of Street Fighter V. With them comes a second Vskill for every character and a (much needed, if you ask me) balance patch. Netcode still sucks, that's just the way it is. Netcode will always suck. We'll just have to accept that.

The price for Champion Edition Upgrade is currently 25 euros, it is expected to become a standalone edition for 30 euros. 

This adresses the in-game currency drought that the game has experienced the past year or two. In game currency has all but dried up, with the total amount realistically being able to net you 6-7 characters before basically being exhausted and you're left with 25 FM per match. With characters costing 100k FM and most costumes/stages costing 40k FM, this is a painfully small amount of Fight Money. But if one were to buy SFV: Champion Edition, Fight Money stops being an issue entirely.

With SFV's issues now properly adressed, Champion Edition launches a version of the game that's clean enough to wipe away the dirt it has accumulated over the tumultuous last few years and may help Street Fighter claim its rightful spot as most popular fighting game once more. As a long time fan of the series, I can only hope.

REVIEW FOR SFV: ARCADE EDITION (leaving this up for archive purposes)

I shelled out a lot of time and money for this game. I love it. I love the characters, the gameplay, even the dumb and hammy story. I feel a connection to the Street Fighter franchise, being the game that got me into what is now my favorite hobby: Fighting games.

Lately it's been a chore more than a passtime to play Street Fighter V.

The netcode is... atrocious. ""Unacceptable"" does not begin to cut it. Getting a proper online match is a rarity. You'll lag with your neighbour, even if you're both using ethernet. This has been an issue since launch, and Capcom has shown little to no interest in fixing it. It's beyond frustrating to go into a match with a 5 bar connection and just see your opponent teleport and roll back out of any hit you get. When it runs well, it runs well. But when it doesn't... it's a trainwreck.

The DLC platform is what can be expected of 2018. You get 6 characters per year, with projected support to continue until 2020 rolls around. They're priced about as much as we've come to expect a DLC character to be priced. I gladly bought the season pass every time, even bought the game on PC too after several thousands of matches on PS4. The characters can be bought with Fight Money, the in-game currency. Incomes of Fight Money are meagre and far between, it was even cut in half a while ago. But you could still manage a costume and even a character every once in a while.

Notice that I speak in past tense. Which is the big reason this game gets a thumbs down from me.

The latest changes to the in-game currency system (nerfing income even further, after HALVING it last year) has been quite the nail in the coffin for me, a long-time fan of the series and Capcom as a company. 

With the... undoubtedly -bold- addition of in-game advertisements, Street Fighter V approaches the closest you'll get to a free to play platform while also still being a premium game. You pay for the game, you pay for the characters because there's no practical way of [i]earning[/i] them anymore. You pay for the costumes... and you get ads on top of it all.

I can't recommend this game in its current state, with the precedent being set as to its future. Steer well clear unless you can grab Arcade Edition at 5 euros or less. Go play Tekken. Bamco deserves your support more than Capcom does right now.",1544801009,1577052670,TRUE,0,0,0.539226353,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.66E+16,212,8,5905,0,655,1594558137

83,Street Fighter V,60001576,english,"The Game is finally worth the money. 3 years later. The base game has 16 characters and very addicting gameplay, but it just feels a little empty, and it was even worse at launch. When the Arcade Edition launched, the game was significantly upgraded, giving players 6 arcade modes to play through and balance updates. But despite all the upgrades, we were asked to pay for the new characters, more stages, and more costumes. Then in season 3, they also added loot boxes and ads in-game. Everything surrounding this game was executed horribly. But the Champion Edition upgrade fixes most of these problems and delivers a superb fighting game experience.

GAMEPLAY
Gameplay is fast-paced, and is a blast to play. The game has an emphasis on rushing down opponents, which can feel frustrating at first, but I the aggressive style only makes the game more tense and satisfying if you take the time to learn how the game works. There is so much more depth to this game that may not be initially be apparent to newcomers. Each character has unique mechanics, as is the norm, but new mechanics, specifically V-skills and V-triggers, add more depth to the gameplay and can help players potentially turn the tables. These do not replace the EX meter for special moves, rather the V-trigger meter fills up the more damage you receive, and V-Skills offer new moves to defeat your opponents. With a diverse roster, every fight feels unique and thrilling. Also, the netcode has improved, I've had an outstanding experience playing online with friends. I wish I had more to say, but for me this game is a fast, fluid, and entertaining entry in the Street Fighter series. I'd put it up there with 2, and I actually enjoy the game more than 4 now that the champion edition is available.

FIGHT MONEY
The fight money currency system is absolutely atrocious for those who do not own the Champion Edition. At first, you get a decent amount of fight money, maybe enough to initially convince you that it is easy to acquire and getting new characters and costumes is easy. But after only a day or so I learned of how fast that changes. Initially, fight money is easy to acquire thanks to relatively high payouts for completing each character's short stories, along with trials and the general story. Unfortunately, these high gains do not last. After you've completed all of that, you get very small payouts that feel like a joke, sometimes around 50 FM. To compare, it costs 100,000 FM for each character, stages cost around 70,000 FM, story costumes cost 40,000 FM, and colors cost a various amount. It's insane how little fight money players acquire, and how much it costs to acquire everything. Completing daily and weekly challenges give you a bit more fight money, but it doesn't increase your gains by a whole lot. So if you intend on buying the game WITHOUT the Champion Edition, you're gonna be in for a rough time that I cannot recommend to ANYONE.
If you do plan on picking up the Champion Edition, all of these flaws are solved. You no longer really have to balance using your fight money for acquiring stages, characters, costumes, or colors. With almost all the content being included in the Champion Edition package, most of your fight money will now go towards Fighting Chance loot box content. Fighting Chance is something I was greatly opposed to when it was implemented, but thankfully the loot box content is mostly tied to newer alternate colors, only a few costumes, and survival mode battle items. These loot boxes do not cost real money, and the prize pool is surprisingly small. There isn't much that Fighting Chance really offers, and that's actually a really good thing compared to more anti-consumer practices found elsewhere. Since there is not a lot else to spend Fight Money on now, the problem is almost nonexistent.
VISUALS
Characters and stages look gorgeous, with a clay-like style. There isn't much to say, as every Street Fighter fan has their preference in art style, but this is by far my favorite portrayal.

Overall, the game is fantastic to play, but not something I can recommend without the Champion Edition. But if you are willing to put down $33 right now, you will be getting an extremely satisfying, content-filled fighting game that is among the greats of the genre.",1576557416,1576979371,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.66E+16,526,7,3342,0,644,1600410919

So almost a year in and my point still stands, don't buy this game unless it's heavily discounted.

It's not worth full price at all and the sticker price of the game isn't representative of what you're probably going to spend to have all the content. you can buy characters with fight money but that means doing survival with EVERY character in the game on easy, normal, hard and hell (which i've done myself) but it's an absolute bore and you'll get sick of it quick

The netcode still sucks balls unless both players are on fibre, games like ggxrd do online netcode much better.

Costumes cost FOUR US DOLLARS PER CHARACTER

DLC / DLC / DLC & DLC (When it's said and done you are dropping serious cash to obtain content)

83,Street Fighter V,58519261,english,"ATTENTION FOR THE SLOW MOTION BUG:

For some users, the game will run in extremely slow motion, even on very high-end video cards. This is because Nvidia Control Panel (or its ATI equivalent) has decided to make it operate according to ""global settings,"" which is usually the ""Optimal Power"" setting. To fix this, go to Nvidia Control Panel > Manage 3D Settings > Program Settings tab > Street Fighter V (or add it to the list). Then for ""Power Management Mode,"" select ""Prefer Maximum Performance."" This instantly fixed the game for me, and now it runs buttery smooth. I hope you ATI people can find the solution on your respective control panels.

Edit: Also, if you're planning on using a specific controller to play as the first player (e.g. a fight stick), the game won't pick up that controller as ""Player 1"" unless it is literally the first controller plugged into your system. I had to unplug both my fight stick and 360 gamepad, and then re-plug the fight stick first in order for it to be registered as the main controller. No idea why Capcom opted for such an archaic controller recognition system when its contemporaries (e.g. King of Fighters XIV) have incorporated controller selection in-game.

[h1]SUMMARY[/h1]

[b]CONS[/b]

Unfortunately they made the game grind city! All the unlocks are behind a grind or paywall. This includes more than half the characters. If you want this game for anything other than multiplayer I would skip this option and choose SFIV instead.
The game also suffers from well documented and random online latency issues not related to bandwidth, causing frame dropping. The game play is fun but will require extensive training to get fulfilment. Street fighter can be frustrating at the lower ranks.

[b]PROS[/b]

The thing is with Street Fighter is it's Street Fighter and no matter the shortcomings if your a fan like I am, these things don't matter. It is still the greatest versus fighting game franchise ever made and this iteration is a great addition.

[b]SHOULD YOU BUY IT?[/b]

I have been hammering out Street Fighter since the first iteration in 1988. I have played them ALL extensively.
The game does come on offer often and would certainly be worth it if your a Street Fighter fan. Most of the dlc (characters excluded) is only cosmetic and not required to enjoy the game.

For me I would buy every street fighter game because I love the franchise so much but if you are just looking for a dun fighting game I'd recommend Street Fighter 4 over this.",1561967280,1574979343,TRUE,0,1,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.66E+16,1002,24,33717,0,29057,1600373547

8,Street Fighter V,27585352,english,"They had a rocky start with a barebones features on launch, horrible input lag and a small initial cast. But 3 seasons later, it has improved gameplay and single player features. The cast has a great selection of the classic characters from street fighter 2, alpha 3 and 4 return with their movesets creatively altered to give a fresh take on each character. This game also introduced a lot of new characters that each have really unique gameplay you've never seen in street fighter before. 

The mechanics, while simplified compared to SF4, still offers enough degree of depth to keep the hardcore street fighter fans playing. The v skill/trigger/reversal system, reversed button priority, crush counters, removal of chip kills/non ex reversals/option selects/invincible backdashes may not sit well with some fans, but I like the reward it gives to more offensive gameplay. The gameplay is balanced once or twice a year, and at it's current state, it is the most balanced in any street fighter game so far. Still can be improved. For single player offerings, there are plenty: arcade, survival, combo challenges, 2 seperate story modes and vs CPU mode.
They've also improved the input lag recently, which is awesome.

However, the online netcode is still crappy with the one -sided rollback system. That's the biggest factor holding this game back. And the FM system to purchase costumes and characters are pretty bad. No amount of grinding will allow even the most dedicated player to get everything for free.  Season 3 also sees the visual designs/animations of the current characters lack the polish it has for previous seasons. Also introduced is the Dojo. While it's a nice idea to have a clan concept in street fighter, it isn't implemented in a way that's useful. You gain nothing from joining a dojo currently, other than potentially winning a trophy to put in your dojo, which nobody cares about.

Overall though, a good fighting game which i currently enjoy playing. Will it be fondly remembered like the other street fighters like SF2 and 3rd strike? It remains to be seen",1480127859,1574842389,TRUE,1,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.66E+16,517,5,128963,803,80749,1601808876

Basically none of this matters anymore. With Champion Edition you just get everything, characters, costumes, stages, colors and all the little extras etc etc. If you still care for the game you don't have to suffer the botched FM grind and all the mistakes Capcom has made to sour the launch of a promising game that failed to deliver. However I must admit that the devs pushed through and kept improving the game and content. Let's hope next time it won't take them so long. 

***********

PREVIOUS REVIEWS:
During the last few months since my preious review capcom has admittedly tried its best to fix the problems this game has and improve on the experience. With Arcade Edition it mostly succeeds, finally delivering a more complete product with the much desired Arcade Mode that offers some cool unlockable artworks upon completion besides the usual endings.

So let's see how this game is improved:
- Finally D-Input support
- Netcode, at least for me, is vastly improved and stable
- load times reduced
- more single player modes,
- expanded cast of characters
- new vtriggers and a couple additional moves
- some revamped graphics 7 style in menus/character selection/vs screen
- Arcade mode A.I. uses characters/costumes and stages you do not own, so the game still has variety if you prefer this single player mode (unlike the still dreadful survival)

while still not perfect (the UI is still mediocre, clipping prblems among the minor complaints) it is indeed a much more complete game. And despite all the crap I gave Capcom in the past, I was lucky enough (or perhaps patient enough) to grind my way for 2 years and manage to get ALL the season 2 (and able to get the remaining season 3 characters) for free but in exchange avoiding to add any costume stage or title.

I was inclined to give this a positive review BUT I am hesitant to do so simply because of the constant mishnadling of the Fight Money system which , starting with Arcade Edition, strips a lot of FM away from new players, replacing it with gambling your limited FM against cheap A.I. battles and reducing the weekly rewards without warning.

the game is quite good at thsi state but i cannot recommend it to everyone, especially if you are a casual player or completionist who prefers to won all the stages and costumes, unless you are willing to spend some real $$$.

Perhaps capcom should re-examine how they handle their fighting games because their recent missteps might prove hurtful in the long run (as already proved with the equally mishandled MVCI - but that's a story for anither time.

That ends my current review of the game, perhaps with a little patience the game will work it's way to the ""thumbs up"" category

below is my initial review:

*****

I refrained myself from reviewing this game since its launch. There wasn't anything new i could have added that wasn't already expressed by many other users here so I felt I don't have much to contribute. I waited for months until more updates came out so I could probably give it a more fair review with a more clear mind.

Yes the core gameplay is really fun. Yes the netcode is attrocious. yes the launch was botched and many basic features like d-input support are still missing. But there was fun to be found in the game at times. I enjoyed the game as much as I could but still feeling a bit underwhelmed. 
And imagined that, I was not only hyped for the game before launch but was hyping it to friends in the hopes that it will be a great game to enjoy together.
Well not exactly. 

But I was actually waiting with much anticipation and excitement the new updates where we get many new modes and features and a much desired VS CPU option! Some hope finally started to build up again.
Unfortunately with the latest rootkit debacle I felt it was the last straw for me. Never felt so much dissapointed with a SF game. Yes fortunately it's safe now, with the latest patch  but I have unintalled the game for the time being untl everything is sorted out for sure.
It seems that Capcom makes very reckless decisions and knee-jerk reactions and focuses too much on their dlc plans (which in my humble opinion would have worked much better if they delivered a more polished product so fans would be more than happy to keep supporting the devs. I was actually thinking of buying the season pass as well before this horrible update happened, now I am not so sure)

Perhaps after some time I might get back to it, sooner than expected, perhaps not. Because I do love Street Fighter since the early days when SFII first came to arcades and I wanted this game to succeed. I might give it another chance at some point.

So this game doesn't get a bad vote from me only because it's ""a bad game"" but judging by its legacy it could have been something much more than this mess.",1474745057,1574799876,FALSE,7,1,0.551766753,1,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.66E+16,561,128,12616,202,7978,1601667087

58,Street Fighter V,57623133,english,"If you grew up on Street Fighter II, the Alpha series and/or The Street Fighter III versions then you know that the modern 3D incarnations are methodical and noticeably slower. Sure, as a benefit of modern gaming, the game has become a bit more technical and tactical and less reliant on twitchy and fast reflexes to compete. Depending on your style of play this is either great or terrible. I'm the latter. I couldn't play IV because it was too slow compared to what I was used to and had hoped V would at least ramp up the the speed a notch. No such luck. 

The emphasis this time around is online competitive play which is fantastic in theory but in practice, well, there would always be issues with lag which is absolutely unavoidable. Now, your mileage will vary but it is always a factor because of the inherent nature of playing over the internet. If you can forgive this then I would also add that it should be a strict requirement if you're a serious SF player to own a decent fight stick. Otherwise, be prepared to constantly be dominated by expert players whom are undoubtedly rocking a fight stick. Every millisecond counts between a dodge, block, counter or a hit. This is not to say you can't be competitive with a decent gamepad because you can. Just don't expect to beat the elite players whom are on a fight stick. Full disclosure, I play with a Hori fightpad and I always miss and desire a premium fight stick with Sanwa components. 

Now most of the above is obvious but it still needs to be mentioned at least for the purposes of this mini review and clarification. With the Chamipion Edition landing soon you're probably asking yourself should you finally make the plunge and jump into Street Fighter V?

I just spent damn near an hour writing a lengthy review about why I do not recommend this game, and Steam opted to not save it when I clicked ""post review."" So, unfortunately you will be reading an incredibly shortened version. Sorry.

Positives -
+Characters look good
+Audio is nice
+Gameplay is solid; combat system works well, no issues with controls
+Endless Battle mode is always a welcomed addition to the multiplayer
+The IDEA that Capcom wanted to emulate MK's successful story mode is great. The actual result... well, see below in the Negatives section.

Negatives - 
-Clipping is prominent. Ken's hair clips through his neck/shoulder line; Birdie's necklace clips through body, etc.,.
-Story mode underwhelming and full of confusing scene cuts, limited character development and overpromotion of characters who offer little in terms of moving the story forward, or are mishandeled and end up being useless to the story (Charlie, Necalli, etc). 
-Multiplayer matchmaking is wonky (from my experience). Oftentimes get paired up with a guy 3 ranks higher than me, resulting in limbo where I can never move up because I don't play people in equal skill. Hinders multiplayer.

Overall, it's just a really rushed game by a developer who should know better. Single player was ignored prominantly in the early stages, and a lousy story mode was dumped in to placate. Multiplayer is what it is - a screwy matchmaking system and people rage quitting to avoid losing points. There's some fun to be had in it with endless battle. It's a shame, because the core gameplay is great. I love the battle system, the controls are fluid and fully functioning, but there's not enough here, and what IS here is full of half-hearted work. There's no reason the ugly clipping in the game should exist, especially with a major game developer like Capcom. Shoddy work. In a world with MANY options for fighting games, don't waste your time with this when older installments or other series altogether are better.

Score System: 0 - Unplayable; 5 - Average; 10 - Perfect
(Note: each category is not necessarily weighted equally when determining the overall rating)

Gameplay: 9/10
Graphics: 6/10 (should be much higher, but the ridiculously obvious clipping prevents that)
Sound: 8/10
Story: 3/10
Replayability: 8/10

Overall Rating: 7/10 (Good)

Worth Purchasing at Full Price/Discount: 

Okay, here's the deal: If you're willing to accept the negatives I gave this game, it's worth a discount pickup or a lowered full price. The 7/10 is coming from the fact that the gameplay is tight and there's plenty of replayability. The ""not recommended"" decision is coming from the horrid consumerism that is plaguing this game combined with an overall rushed job that has taken literally years to finally produce a finished - yet at times still amateur - product.

Championship Edition should have been what the original release was.


Time of Review : Season 3.5, After Cody Release
Pre-ordered this game when it was announced. Finally fed up with this game. Please don't be fooled by the amount of hours i have in this game (does not include offline time/lan time even) Ended my rank somewhere in platinum (top 45000~) out of 300-400k (?) accounts.

Pros : 
- Training mode 
Training mode has better tools than USF4 for frame data and customization. 
- Some waifus.
Only selling point of this game. 

Cons : 
Gameplay wise
- The removal of reversal Dragon Punch (DP, Shoryukens) The Crush Counter punish for invincible DP's should be enough of a detterence to make reversal DP's a more cautious choice. But they removed them. The entire Crush Counter system needs to be reworked.
- Option selecting (defensive tool, the most basic is protection against blocking and throws) was removed, making a previous snowball an avalance. 
- Announcements of buffs and nerfs to characters come randomly out of the blue. The season 3.5 patch was an afterthought announcement at the end of a tournament. Capcom's balance philosophy stated, ""Don't greatly nerf characters, buff the weaker ones instead."" Guess what happened? The high tiers were hardly touched and other low tiers got hit with the nerf hammer.  Better buff Cammy and Nerf Zangief.

Non-Gameplay wise
- Unlocking characters takes forever to do. Each character costs 100,000 fight money (FM). But you only earn 50 FM per win. That's right, you get 0 FM when you lose. And only wins against other players in the random match making counts. There are weekly missions that net you 5000 a week. So casual players can take quite a while to unlock one character, to realize that it doesn't suit them; fat chance, better save up. 
- Battle lounges are poorly optimized and buggy. Lag isn't uncommon, even with five bars of connectivity. You don't earn FM here either. Only useful if playing against a friend you can't play with in LAN.
- Break out the wallet. Currently $70 right now for the game and including up to the season 3 cast. I bought the game for 60 with a half-assed ""pre-release"" roster and horrible netcode. And I had to save up for every character (still don't own all of them). This game wouldn't be worth it if it was free.
- If you do buy the base game, each individual character will cost you 8 dollars or so. There isn't an option to try a character before purchasing them, unless you spend hours in story mode replaying that one cutscene with your character.
- Season passes should not be a thing for fighting games. At an arcade, it would be ridiculous to charge someone another quarter to play the character they want. All the characters should be unlocked with the purchase of the game.
- Along with the random balance patches, community feedback seems to do absolutely nothing.
- Newer players might not know, but one update they installed a hidden root kit. You can look it up to read about it.
- Loot boxes? Really? At least you can pull one of the dozen outfits for Chun-Li.

I picked this game up after being fighting games adjacent (street fighter specifically) my entire life. Played SFII as a kid, was good enough to beat my friends at MvC cuz I knew inputs, dabbled in SNK vs capcom... so, pretty casual when all was said and done. One day, I got the bite to jump into the deeper experience Street Fighter had to offer. I wasn't disappointed! Learning the ins and outs at my own pace has been so rewarding. The fighting is fun, and the feeling of reading an opponent when you start getting to that point is revelatory. It feels like working on a skill. 
The challenge Street Fighter provides doesn't end with the match. It continues to challenge your psyche. Can you hold it together after your loss? Can you get your head back on straight after getting perfected in a round? Did you make the adjust? Learning to lose. Learning to hold a win without thinking you're hot shi* and inevitably inviting conceit to sabotage your progress... This is what Street Fighter, and fighting games in general, is really about. If you're new to fighters, I find Street fighter to definitely be the most digestible before exploring other perhaps more difficult or more fast paced/flashy options out there.
If youre looking for a game to really sink your teeth into, a game where you can develop a relationship with the character/play style of your choice to take head to head against other people trying to do the same.

18,Street Fighter V,57303880,english,"To put it bluntly, I can't stand this game.  I've bought this game twice (on PS4 and later on PC), i've played through the big story mode multiple times, i've grinded fight money to unlock a few characters, but i've ended up at the same conclusion both times.

Ignoring the awful launch this game had (few characters and very very little to do), the game just isn't fun to play.  It feels horribly slow when compared to most other fighting games, even past Street Fighter games.  The big story mode is terrible too.  It's incredibly easy up until the very end where you fight Bison with Nash and then with Ryu.  It's not written well and is only outdone by Marvel Infinite in the sheer amount of cringe it exudes.  Playing against the CPU in other modes is a crap shoot.  The computer is either far too easy and does practically nothing to you or will absolutely beat your butt without a second thought.

Despite being 4 years old by now, it's still weirdly expensive if you want all the characters, even on sale.  That doesn't take into account the AWFUL monetization this game has going for it.  It gives you the illusion that you can earn all the characters and (most of) the stages for free by just playing the game, but the game is incredibly stingy with giving you fight money.  You REALLY NEED all the characters, even if you don't want them, because it gives you more opportunities to earn fight money because all the trials and survival modes are separated by character (instead of just selecting a character from the character select).  They've even taken away fight money you used to get from completing the story mode and now finishing it gets you absolutely nothing.  Playing against other people online is your best bet, but you better be a godsend at this game and have tons of time on your hands because you only get a piddly amount of fight money for winning and losing a match gets you nothing.  You can't buy most costumes with fight money either.  Most of them can only be bought with real money and you can only get a fight money costume in the store after you finish a character's story.

Oh, yeah, and it has loot boxes...because we all love those.  They are kind of hidden away in a separate part of the store, but the game usually has events to get you tickets to use in the loot box part of the store (and getting into those events costs fight money).

On the technical side, the game runs weirdly on PC.  From a fresh install, the game ran like a slideshow and stuttered constantly.  I had to mess around in my graphics card settings to get the game to stop running like a slideshow in game.  The online is also fairly inconsistent.  It was either fairly good or really bad.

I'll give this game a few positives.  The art style is similar to SF4 but it's been improved and (most) of the characters look much better.  I don't know what it is, but Capcom CANNOT make Ken look good in 3D (compare him in this game and him in Smash Ultimate...it's like night and day).  The other thing I liked was some of the new characters are neat and far more memorable than some of the ones from SF4 like Abel and El Fuerte (I liked C.Viper and am sad she didn't make it into this game.  Juri is easily the best new character from 4)

Overall, i'd avoid this game.  It's just not very fun to play and feels more like a chore than a fun fighting game.  There are FAR better fighting games out there from other studios, whether you want a 2D fighter or a 3D one.  Capcom needs to get their fighting game department in order because they are easily being overshadowed by Arc System, Namco Bandai and the return of SNK.",1573926652,1573926652,FALSE,127,9,0.653846264,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.66E+16,603,26,449,0,449,1566350624

45,Street Fighter V,56940877,english,"Honestly, this game gets a lot of hate due to every character having a skin with ads, there being an ad setting to get the ingame currency, most characters being DLC, and the game lacking a strong defensive playstyle. However, I wouldn't say the game is necessarily bad; it just has lots of paywalls. However, the game isn't ""pay to win""; it just doesn't let you play certain characters, have certain skins, and have certain stages. If you REALLY want a character you could either grind (most people's problem with the game) or just buy the individual character for six dollars. Which isn't a high price to pay. The story mode and singleplayer is pretty bad (as expected for a fighting game) so if you are looking with a fighting game with a good story YOU SHOULD NOT BUY THIS.

I bought the game when it first came out and I was a little salty when the second season came and I already couldn't play half the characters. But if it wasn't for that I wouldn't of gotten into playing the character that I like to play now.

TL;DR
Does this game have some noob killing strategies? Yes. Does this game have a paywall for certain characters? Yes. Is it sometimes frustrating to play? Yes. Is it the best Street Fighter? No. Should I buy it? Yes if you are willing to play the base characters. Are the base characters fun?

54,Street Fighter V,25642589,english,"The worst great game that's ever been made.  As a fighting game, it's great.  As a software program, it's terrible.

The mechanics of the game are approachable, for a fighting game anyway, and you can learn them with a little practice.  There is the usual great selection of traditional and new Street Fighter characters.  There's a lot to learn, but anyone who is motivated can learn as much of it as they want.  There is a thriving tournament and e-sports scene (that nobody who reads this review is going to be good enough to succeed in, but everyone starts somewhere).  And a great community around the game, not so much on Steam per se, but on Discord, Twitch, Reddit, and other websites.  And it's hard, and the competition is cutthroat.  If you're the sort who likes to get frustrated and throw your controller, expect to buy a lot of new controllers.  But it's a very rewarding game to play.

The problem is that the game does not play very well over the Internet, and that's where almost everyone does most of their playing.  Even overlooking the many blunders that Capcom has made - the rootkit fiasco, the disastrous launch, the two years it took before the game servers worked reliably, the promised Linux support that never materialized - and all of these except the Linux situation have been fixed - the poor netcode still stands out as a glaring problem that really hurts the enjoyability of this game.

One thing that reviews seem to like to complain about is the DLC, but that's a phony problem.  There are basically three types of DLC: characters, stages, and costumes.  If you buy Arcade Edition, you get the first two seasons of characters included, and you can easily grind enough in-game currency to get one or two more DLC characters for free.  Most people play only two or three characters, some play only one.  And you don't need to have a character to play against them, only to use them yourself.  Stages and costumes are purely cosmetic, and they help fund ongoing development and e-sports prizes.  So you are hardly on the hook for a fortune in DLC.  It's entirely possible to play this game at a high level and spend nothing on DLC.  Besides, stages other than the training stage make the game lag.

As someone who's no stranger to fighting games and yet has never really played Street Fighter games before (my last game was SFII on the Game Boy, of all things), despite some caveats I do actually enjoy this game. The core gameplay is good and the art style is a real treat. It's also one of the more fanservicey games in the series, but tends to cater to both men and women so that's fine by me.

It could use some streamlining for newer users. On the first start-up there's a forced tutorial which isn't an issue in itself but the game doesn't let you tweak the settings right off the bat, compelling most players to skip it and come back to it later. And upon reaching the main menu you are bombarded with a multitude of unskippable notifications catered towards current players as well before you can even touch the options to tweak it towards your system.

Aside from the rocky first start-up, even if you buy the Arcade Edition + Season 3 Pass you'll be missing a sizable amount of content, from costumes to stages(!). In-game currency is an option to buy a few of these things, but the cost is steep, encouraging players to spend real money on them instead. Thus, if you're not keen on dishing out real money you'll have to handle your scarcely-earned Fight Money carefully.

42,Street Fighter V,55196833,english,"although I like Street Fighter so I support SFV, but honestly I would rather suggest buy something else, or even SFIV.

this is one of the games which is difficult to say. because I'm not that good at it. since I'm not hardcore fighting game fan, I'm not really comprehending all the game mechanics and balances between characters. only occasionally playing few online matches. I'm casual, however I played more than 500 hours and thinking that's good enough to give criticism as just casual gamer.

everyone might remember Capcom released SFV unfinished, that happened few years ago. then they updated story mode which was just mediocre both for ""story"" itself and game mode. frankly it was fun just as much as watching that 1994 Street Fighter the movie.

then they updated really lazy arcade mode which is basically going through VS mode few times with random AI opponents. at the end of it, you get a one page of manga. I mean, I don't hate comics, but if I want to read them, probably I wouldn't try to play video games. what they updated is just bunch of images from previous games. if you were hardcore Street Fighter fan, probably you already have seen them numerous times before.

then they added new skins and characters which is behind of absurd paywall. they don't look bad, but that's literally only thing good that I can think about them.

and that's the literally whole history of SFV. from the beginning till the end it still feels very empty. I know it's just fighting game, but the presentation is simply unimpressive. it's like, they're selling bunch of DLC characters but otherwise of characters themselves, that's everything what you get. just few pages of manga.
in the other fighting games, each characters have unique intro/ending in their own story mode. and not just for that, they're using same assets over and over. even in the character's cut scenes, they're using game stage's pictures as background image. couldn't they just try something? is this really made by capcom?

even then, the reason why am I ""recommending"" SFV is its price is dropped half. if it's on sale then you probably would get it lesser than ten bucks. SFV isn't completely horrible game so I think it's just acceptable.
I don't know. I still have small faith upon capcom that they would be amazing again. recently they're getting better, and I still like Street Fighter franchise none the less, so who knows, maybe they would be cool again with SF6 or new updates for SFV.",1568978937,1570107635,TRUE,6,0,0.523535311,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.66E+16,86,25,45053,64,31320,1601395935

Disconnections are common with very little consequence. Graphics are alright but it’s so poorly optimised on some stages you’ll need to lower them to look like an unloaded Unreal game to keep the frame rate.

For their microtransaction model they’ve chose… all of them. Fighters, stages, costumes, colours, titles and adverts. If they were smart they’d have released characters and stages for free to keep players coming back then make a fortune selling skins and taunts from those with cash to splash.

Should you buy the game?
If you like fighting games or just got into learning fighting games, SF is a great starting point. Buy the regular edition on sale(its super cheap), play the vanilla cast and learn some tech. You'll still have plenty of fun and learn a lot. Don't listen to the haters saying top tier characters only exist in DLC, Karin and Rashid are played at high level by Pros and those characters don't require DLC AT ALL.

Is Multiplayer active?
YES. This game has Crossplay with PS4 which expands the player pool. I can get matches in less than 3 minutes usually

What about ingame ads I keep hearing about?
You can turn that sh* off. 

What about netcode? Is it laggy?
Not gonna lie, Netcode is still sh*, but its sh* across all japanese fighting games. if this is a factor, you're better off playing MK11 or something non-japanese.

Does it have waifus?
No, but it has THICC mommas

You start the game with ~16 characters, most of which are mid to low tier currently (season 4) and to buy the rest of the 24 characters you need 100.000 Fight Money for ONE. You gain fight money ONLY by leveling up characters (1000) and winning matches (50 EACH MATCH), so they're hoping that you'll get pissed off and just buy them with real money instead. Alright, the character vega, ever since he was released, had a a few extra special moves on his stage, thus getting an advantage. That is also true here, BUT instead, you have to BUY the stage.

TL;DR this game costs ~80$.

Not like it plays that well, either. They made it so that you can't die from cheap damage, because barely any moves do cheap damage. They all do recoverable damage, which is stupid, because you can now easily just stay blocking forever if time is running out. Also, they made the inputs ""easier"", so now it's extrepely hard to, for example, with ryu, crouch block and then MP overhead, since going neutral on the stick can now be very hard.

pretty fun game, despite the cheaters using speed hacks and beating you even though they only know one move.. which I am assuming is why the servers go off randomly at times.

The most annoying thing coming from DLC Character bundle. Capcom has proved that they are increasingly greedy. 
Now they separate character roster into 4 groups. One comes with the base game. The other three coming from 3 different bundles called Season Pass (1,2,3). So if I want to enjoy the game with full roster, I have to spend a terrible amount of money. 

The Base game's price is very ridiculous ($117). It is even higher than SFV Arcade Edition which includes Base game and Season Pass ($21). What is the point of that, Capcom?? Are you trying to steal your customers' money??

If you don't want to buy characters through Season Pass, you can still buy them individually in game. But the thing is you can only buy character with Fight Money (making from playing in game, but honestly it is very hard to make). If you wanna buy a character with real money you have to buy it with 1 additional costume. I call that Forced Purchase.

There are a lot of other annoying problems coming from DLC policy.  Clearly, when we get along with Japanese game companies they prove to be the greediest.

Noone of that is remotely as fun as in 3s or 4 for that matter.

First, it plays great. There is some freshness to how it feels while still feeling true enough to the SF series. Personally I felt SFIV felt a little tighter, but I don't mind the slight change with 5, as at least it doesn't feel like a complete copy paste (cough - Soul Calibur 6 - cough).

Second, this is the best looking SF to date. Nothing wrong with that! The animations, definition and colors are outstanding. However, while I don't mind the modern, clean, somewhat minimal appearance of the UI menus, I miss the more energetic and fun UI/motion graphics from SFIV and SFIII 3rd Strike. Same goes for the music. It's really great, polished and classy music, but lacks the oomph of prior entries.

Lastly, the roster is... interesting? Once you have all 34, there are plenty to choose, including long time favorites (speaking for myself), a nice variety from across the generations of SF, but also some odd additions (throw aways, IMHO) while leaving out some other old favorites. I would have replaced some of the odd ones with some more popular fighters from previous entries.

Altogether I'm glad I finally bought the game, reluctant as I was for so long, but I'm also glad I waited for a sale, because it truly isn't enough game for the money without at least some of the added DLC. But I wouldn't completely write it off, as many disgruntled players seem to have done, because it's still a solid fighting game, and keeps long time SF fans like myself happy to be playing another entry.

There's a few issues, net code being one of them although it has gotten better recently. About 1/4 of the online matches still lag even with the connections setting is at ""4-5"" which is up from 1/3. I know when some people see things like this they wonder if the PC just isn't good enough or if there's issues with the person's internet so I'll provide my PC specs along with my net info..

OS: Windows 10 64 bit Home
CPU: i5-7400 @ 3.0GHz
GPU: NVIDIA Geforce GTX 1060 3GB
RAM: 16GB DDR4 CORSAIR Vengeance LPX DDR4 DRAM 2400MHz C16

My PC is hardwired directly to the modem and the net speed is up to 100Mbps and the ping to the servers is pretty low.

I do have a couple other issues with the game and if these things I'm about to mention get implemented into the next Street Fighter I won't be purchasing it. One of the worst things done to the game in my opinion was that Capcom decided it would be a good idea to take their real starter roster and break it up into a base roster and 2 DLC packs (Street Fighter V, Street Fighter V - Season 1 Character Pass, Street Fighter V - Season 2 Character Pass) aka the Arcade Edition and the first character DLC pack should of been Season 3. As someone who didn't get the Arcade edition and just bought the base game and the Season 1 Character Pass it really feels lacking still. Unfortunately, they also decided to break down every part of the game and turn it into DLC or in game microtransactions (music, stages, continue in challenges after defeat etc. etc.). I understand they want to make money, but what Capcom did with this title is kind of crazy. It just doesn't feel like a complete experience next to previous Street Fighter titles.

The in game currency is an issue as well as pricing to buy things is just so ridiculous due to the tiny amount of fight money you get for each win (50). There are daily quests that offer small amounts of fight money as well(some 250 some less), but the quest that offered a reasonable amount of fight money was actually removed. If you are someone who is looking to purchase characters with fight money instead of spending cash, you probably want to just forget about the characters as they go for 100k fight money. I'm just not a fan of the fight money system and think the community should be getting a much more complete experience for the price we're paying. I'm really hoping Capcom makes some better decisions in the next Street Fighter game.

The bad netcode should be enough to say it really isn't worth it, but if you do decide to pick this up don't get anything less than the Arcade Edition and I'd wait for 50% off sale (or buy all 3 separately if you can get it for under $20). Honestly, if you are looking for a good fighting game the Mortal Kombat and Tekken franchises are better options that give a much more complete experience for what you're paying for.",1555877318,1562866197,FALSE,113,5,0.840396225,5,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.66E+16,3147,53,6120,0,3428,1598168349

As of the time of this review, the online community is still thriving, in large part due to cross-play with PS4 players, an extremely important feature.

Let's address the elephant in the room. The majority of the negative reactions to SFV have to do with the terrible launch years ago, questionable cost of the DLCs and bad netcode. From what I understand, the game has improved considerably since its release, and the price can be managed by waiting for a sale. That leaves us with the netcode, which is really hit-and-miss.

Wait till the DLC goes cheap
Majority of the characters are locked behind the DLC
It is possible to unlock them through playing the game but will take you a very very very long time to unlock all of them.
They also fugged up a while back with the game opening a security flaw and never compensated anyone for it.
They're ruining the SF franchise by trying to model it after android market games. This does not bode well with me and you shouldn't have to put up with this crap. This is a PC game not a bathroom break game

41,Street Fighter V,53753741,english,"Street Fighter V started out shaky with its original release 3 years ago as of this review. In its initial release, it was probably only best suited for hardcore fighting game fans that enjoy grinding it out in online play. This was mainly due to the lack of single player content.

However, with the free updates since it's release, the single player content is filled with fan services with multiple Arcade Modes themed to previous entries in the Street Fighter series. There is also a Story Mode that in true fighting game fashion comes up short on the story writing side, but is nonetheless entertaining for its quirkiness.

The ability to unlock characters through in game currency is also nice for penny pinchers, though to unlock all the DLC characters that have been released over the years, it's unfortunately too much effort to expect to be get by without buying the season passes to ""unlock"" them all. But if you are someone that is only interested in a couple of DLC characters you are only interested in, completing the single player content and the weekly missions should provide enough rewards to get yourself a few free characters of your choosing.

All that said, Street Fighter always delivers a solid fighting game engine, especially with the added updates to varied V-Trigger abilities and extra character variety. In my personal opinion, of all the 15 plus variations of mainline titles in the Street Fighter series (Street Fighter 2, Alpha, 3, and 4), the current version of SFV would likely rank in my top 5.

91,Street Fighter V,36056103,english,"I preordered the ""Deluxe"" Edition months before it came out, but missed out on the Beta. Because of that, I went in completely blind, but expecting something as good as Street Fighter 4. Now SF4 is a ton of fun,  and I still play it often; however I cannot say the same for SFV. I gave it a chance from day one, but there was one problem; pretty much no single player options. That's right. All you got at launch was a series of poorly drawn art with some exposition that you could beat in roughly 5 minutes usually. There was no challenge, the AI was braindead, and all you got was a costume related to the story. While that's pretty cool, there's a catch. 

Story costumes and colors past 1 & 2 for EVERY costume are locked behind the in-game store. Meaning that even though you unlocked the costume, you STILL have to use your fight money to buy it; and EVEN MORE FM to buy the colors for it as well as the default costume. Even worse, there's only so many ways to get FM, and even fewer at launch. Your options are to beat the 5 minutes stories for some chump change, do daily challenges for less FM than that, grind online mode for days, or play the dreaded Survival Mode. 

Survival Mode is probably one of the most unforgiving and unfair modes I've seen in a fighting game. A lot of games have it, and it's pretty straight forward; fight a bunch of characters and get recovery items or boosts inbetween fights. However, for whatever reason, Capcom decided to make this such a chore, since prior to the Story Update (which came way later than it was supposed to mind you) it was the easiest way to get FM, and lots of it. The easy and normal difficulties are a joke, with the same braindead AI from the Character Stories; but then hard mode happens. 

See, the thing with the AI in this game, is that they fall under two extremes; braindead or psychic wizard. When you play the game on anything past normal, you get psychic wizard AI. The CPU starts reading inputs, doing frame perfect tech, and other things beyond human capabilities (unless you're from Japan or South Korea). This is where Survival becomes a frustrating chore, throwing like 50 psychic wizards at you over and over until you either lose all your progress, or find a way to break the AI and cheese your way to victory. 

Of course, those were just problems from Day One. It gets danker, I swear. After months of waiting, we got the alleged ""first"" Story Update (implying there'll be more *shudders*). Now this should've been available day one, and I think Capcom realized that so they made it free. Thank god. The story was so unbelieveably hammy and unenjoyable that I think selling it would've been a crime. Basically, M. Bison tries to suck up the electricity from Earth and take over while everyone sits in darkness, but then the Street Fighters just kinda all team up and kill him with awful motion capture/animation and voice direction. 

Speaking of animation, lets talk GRAPHICS. Like, the fact this game runs on Unreal Engine 4 is absolutely shocking. For the most part, the models are decent; they could use some more polygons but it'll do. However, comparing this game to Tekken 7, or even Fighting Layer EX (which is in hecking ALPHA) is depressing. Its not even really the models, the lighting in a lot of the stages, especially after season 1, is just so awful. The shadows are really low quality and the bad lighting just brings out the worst in the models. 

Now let's get down to the most important part, because whether or not a game looks or sounds bad, you gotta look for whether or not it PLAYS bad. Like I stated earlier, I love SF4, I even liked the previous entries like 3 and the Alpha games, but SFV is missing one thing those games had; FUN. Street Fighter V is NOT FUN. In fact, it's just tedious, like it's a job not a game. When you play a competitive game, there should always be moments where you have fun whether or not you lose. In this game, I felt none of that. Victory felt unearned, or dissatisfying; while Losses were just confusing or awkward. I can't say anyone I've ever played with actually had fun; in fact, pretty much none of them even play this garbage game anymore. You know what they do play though? Street Fighter 4. Coming off of 3rd Strike, 4 was met with a lot of criticism, but eventually people warmed up to it, and the community got really large. Then V came out, and everyone who just got into 4 moved on to the new thing.

Jumping the ship like that was a bad move, and so many people regret it now. One big reason has got to be the eSports meme. eSports is a plague on the gaming community, turning what should be fun escapes from reality into a sport. Guess what? Sports are fucking boring. No one wants to watch a bunch of meatheads give each other brain damage for hours, and no one wants to just watch the same guys beat each other at an awful fighting game for days via Twitch or ESPN. 

Then you have companies like Capcom take advantage of this, and lock things like fucking colors and a level behind a paywall just to trick you into supporting more and more of these damn events.

Okay, rant over.

Street Fighter V
PROS: 
- Stages and characters look pretty nice besides stages from launch
- Plenty of Content if you're just getting in after January 2018 

CONS:
- Fight Money is a grindy mess now
- Awful lighting on some stages
- Additional characters after the first 8 cost $$$ or in-game currency (as if you'll actually have enough)
- Most costumes require real money
- Some pretty glaring balance issues

This game got a lot of hatred right from the start for lacking an arcade mode, story mode, online was hit and miss, etc. but at it’s core, this game has always had solid mechanics and a well balanced fighting system.  They simplified aspects while introducing new mechanics in order to make the game more accessible but also varied. Now currently with a roster of 28 fighters, fighting styles differ more than ever, even between the shoto characters.

Online lounge/matches are still a little wonky, sadly.  Good play feels great while laggy matches pop up occasionally even with 4-5 bar connection preference. Story mode has since been added but it’s meh, play it for the online currency to buy some skins/stages/characters.  If you’re coming because you liked Netherrealms’ story mode in games, then don’t bother.

January 2018 brings a big change in SFV that I for one am very excited to see.  Biggest being new V-triggers (unique character skills) are going to be added to every character making personal play styles show through even moreso among same character picks.  If you’ve thought about getting into Street Fighter, now is a good time.  I suggest grabbing it on sale and the extended roster if possible.

took 1 hour to figure out why it wouldn't launch.  it's because it can't launch into 4k. ok that's weird. go into options and change graphics settings. restart now it wants to launch in 8k?  what a bunch of crap.

so i get the game up and running and behold the glory!! .... the glory of Street Dentist V....  literally , WTF!  It seems Capcom spent the whole budget on hiring a dentist to be the lead art director?  The character art is down right awful, but every characters teeth and mouth are rendered in exceptional detail.  

Everything about this game is such a step in the wrong direction. I love the street fighter franchise but if this is the way that capcom is going with it. i say let the franchise die. and spend the extra money on making more monster hunter.

43,Street Fighter V,52719789,english,"Fun competitive fighting game, though considerably weak compared to USFIV. Training mode is very useful with many options to practice certain scenarios and learn some frame data. Great game to get into competitive fighters. Keep post processing and anti-aliasing at medium and the rest at high/ultra for the game to look the best. This will help reduce motion blur and anti aliasing at high looks very bad in this game. I personally like the art style and animations. very stylized and the graphics would hold up pretty well after 10 years. Wish most V-triggers weren't cheap power ups for getting your ass kicked(Akuma,Ryu,Ken vt-1) Probably the best looking game in the series maybe below 3S. Online is eh but amazing compared to Smash ultimate online. Crossplay with PS4 is pretty cool. Even though character passes are expensive and anti consumer, it's not that bad considering you can rack up in game currency to buy them just playing through character stories, arcade, etc.(though it may be time consuming). Really hate how many costumes are through fighting chance or you have to use irl money. Also wished the CPT stages came in a pack rather than buying each CPT Season pack to get those stages. A lot of DLC but most of them aren't needed to have a good experience with this game.

Basically-
Pros: graphics and art style, good tools to help players improve, In game options to unlock characters, accessible but not still keeps a fair skill ceiling(considering a chunk of the top players are veterans like Daigo, Tokido, JWong, etc.), option to lower or completely turn off motion blur, Crossplay with PS4
Cons: Online, Brazil, Excessive DLC, disappointing compared to previous installments, cheap v-triggers,

The mechanics are solid, with a focus on offensive pressure and an unforgiving neutral game. There is a wide variety of characters to choose from with more added every season. That being said, at the time of this review, the netcode is far from perfect, leading to many bad connections. At least 1 in 25 games can be incredibly laggy but it changes based on location and rank. This can make playing the game online frustrating if you are trying to play reactionary. There is a blacklisting feature that allows you to make sure you never play that particular player again which has come in handy. Also, the offline features of the game are just ok, but not where this game shines. There is an arcade mode that allows you to mimic playing all other street fighter games prior. There are also trials to learn character combos throughout the seasons. Because of the lack of offline experiences, I would recommend you get this game for the competitive fighting game aspect, rather than a solo experience.

- Wondrous fighter selection
- Amazing gameplay that rewards time spent within training mode and labbing out solutions, with wins against the competition.
- Netcode that includes terrible rollback at unexpected times, ruining about half of the matches you play in Ranked or Casual (Battle Lounge is where the game is at it's best with online play)
- There is not a better game in existance for sitting down beside your friend and playing 1,000 sets. Unrivaled local gameplay.

There is so much content that is just left behind a big paywall with the only reason to purchase said content is during a sale. Some of the best and most fun characters in the game are only purchasable with money, which I guess can be arguable with fighting game season passes in general, but damn do they charge a lot for every current season pass ($30!). Oh please, don't even get me started on those ""crate lootboxes,"" which give out tons of free fan service, but only if you spend the time to open multiple boxes.

Currently in this game, and I'm not sure if I'm just stubborn, but it seems like Capcom puts a LOT more thought into the costumes of the characters rather than its gameplay infrastructure, servers, and well, more characters. I'm not even sure if Capcom's gonna even be continuing with adding more characters since there has been no sound with more content after Kage, who's essentially an Evil Ryu knockoff (a character whom was loved by many in the golden ages of Street Fighter 4). 

Well, if you read this far, and still desire to play SFV, then do it, get it when it's on sale, the game is tons of fun minus all the grinding, the paywall characters, lootboxes, and the like, but learning and playing against other people is probably one of the best and greatest things about fighting games, there's a lot of gimmicks in the game, but none are invincible to be countered.

I don't know why people complained about the netcode and maybe it has been fixed but I'm able to play with an internet friend who lives veeery far away and we had no real problems everything ran fine in 1vs1 friends game.
It is worse in MK10 for example and i had a really bad online experience there.
yeah it's shame that you have to unlock everything by grinding hard but that's like for other games as well and i think it would be less interesting if you got everything pretty easily and then become bored so much faster by the game. I'm just used to grinding / farming games idk for example that you're limited buy with real money (I know that there are microtransaction which are only available by paying but could be worse that theres nothing you could unlock only by farming ingame without paying)
all in all i can say it's very fun especially with friends to play (against)
for me it was worth the 19,99 arcade edition to spam hadoken and try all those crazy characters out (: <3

I will say that the addition to the sonic cross was a start, but every other character is too buffed up for it to make a real difference at high levels. His sonic boom is even at best with most characters with the ability to fireball so that leaves his flashkick which has NO VARIATIONS TO IT!! If one flashkick is missed or blocked it could mean all of the hard work you put in for that match was for nothing. For example, Imagine if Ryu or Ken didnt have a LOW or MEDIUM punch Shoryuken and all they could do is the HIGH punch Shoryuken every time.. this is the fate you have set for us Guile users since the early 90's with no evolution to his character design besides an overhead that is a pretty standard move for all characters!

Possible solutions: Give Guile a roll move.. what soldier can't do or learn to roll in 25 years? Give Guile a flash kick that vairies in height (low medium high). Give him a downward flashkick of some kind that he can use in mid-air. Just a few suggestions that would help him evolve. I will not recommend this game until Guile starts to really evolve.

Characters are great, the controls are fantastic with controller and arcade stick, combos are more accessible than in USFIV but still complex, balance is pretty good. Best fighting game I've played so far, and I've tried quite a few. 

Matchmaking is really good as long as you stick with a 4-5 or 5 connection, finding a match doesn't take too long either.

60,Street Fighter V,51223901,english,"This game is really solid and a ton of fun, with some really unfortunate drawbacks:

Good:
- It's very accessible for new Street Fighter players, and there is a lot of content to enjoy if you have the arcade version of the game.
- The characters are incredibly fun to play with and there's a lot of variety here.
- Even though the moves are easier to input than ever before, the game still feels very technical in terms of footies, 50/50s, etc. Just check out some of the high level tournament play of this game.
- You can't chip away at the character health with normal specials if they are blocking. You'll need to do a Critical Art attack to accomplish that.

Bad
- My main complaint with the game is the the DLC. I would love to get some of the stages and characters -- especially the ones from SF2 -- but it would require a lot of grinding to unlock everything or actual money if you don't log on at the right time.
- The Critical Arts in the game can very quickly turn around a fight much more than you would expect. Too often you'll be ahead and suddenly lose half your health. It's exciting to watch happen, but as a player it can be frustrating.

63,Street Fighter V,51121801,english,"Playing this for a few months now and I gotta say that this game is perfect for introducing beginners like me to fighting games. I've seen some of the past street fighter games and this one is pretty much the same thing, but as all fighting games in general, the only thing that changes is the meta. For this reason I can not recommend any beginner to pick up ryu. Instead go with someone like akuma, guile, ibuki, or even kolin because these characters have great tools and specials that put them at advantages whenever defending and attacking. Overall a really good fighting game, but there are some things that I don't like..for starters the art style and some of the character models in this game just look terrible. If you bought this game to play arcade mode then you're gonna have a bad time. The cool rival cutscenes and bad ass art from sfIv isn't presented on here which makes this game feel so empty. I'm not expecting the same thing but at least make it feel like im playing a fighting game! Online isn't terrible however I don't know why capcom hasn't made a region filter to make it to where I don't play dudes from latin america and Eurpope. They aren't gonna update the netcode so why not just add something to make the online experience more enjoyable? Speaking of online, I don't know why I have to go into my ""battle settings"" to change whatever character I wanna play before going into multiplayer? Why not let the player decide what character he wants to pick at the start of  every ranked or casual match?! This is very annoying and often ruins the flow of things. The matchmaking takes a long time too, which shouldn't because I know there's lots of people online always. I don't mind costumes in this game but I hate how a lot of characters that don't have a lot of tournament presence often get no costumes at all. Chun li, guile, ibuki, cammy get all the costumes while fang, necalli, alex, and claw get squat. At least be fair with your costumes! Like I said this game is great for beginners however, I'd recommend any beginner or person in general to just stick to ""ranked match"" you'll always get person at your level and the online connection will mostly be good. Casuals at a lower rank like bronze, silver, and gold is filled with nothing but smurfs and laggy wifi warriors. Seriously there are people at bronze and silver that will have lvl 60-70 characters that will just be wrecking noobs like me in casual matches. Character levels don't mean anything in this game, but  they are a good indication of how long a player has been on at that same rank. I don't mind fighting someone who's better than me, but when you fight veterans at a rank/level that is intended for beginners, than you will never learn anything. So if you're a beginner just stay in ranked honestly. As much hate that street fighter gets, I feel like the only thing it should've done better is the art style/presentation as well as the music. Most casuals like me and hardcore fans like seeing pretty, flashy, and stylish designs, and art accompanied by great music.",1560012927,1560012927,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.66E+16,1,1,49457,365,11497,1601617495

1. The fighting is solid and much more accessible (which is also a negative)
2. Arcade mode is amazing. It spans over the course of five games.
3. The community is very helpful to newcomers. 
4. The soundtrack is incredible.
5. The roster is among one of the best in the series.
6. Brilliant training mode with so many options

What's Bad

1. The launch. Please Capcom, don't ever release an unfinished game again. Ever.
 Even after AE, Street Fighter 5 hasn't fully recovered from the abysmal launch
2. Netcode still needs work.
3. The story is awful.
5. Micro transactions.
Strangely, even if you haven't purchased a stage, you can still play in it in Arcade and Online mode. 

Also, beating story mode and trials will give you enough fight money to buy an entire season of character. Though you still can't unlock everything without spending anything.

6. Though it's much better now, the game is still unbalanced.

How they can improve

1. Costumes. You want to make extra money? Fair enough, we all do. But before you start asking for more money, give us plenty of free costumes to play with first.
2. If it's still needs work, don't just release it.
3. Capcom needs to communicate and listen to their fans.

As of now, it's a solid fighting game. I'd rate this game a solid 7/10. Hopefully Capcom will add even more content this year to make up for this games launch.",1535730959,1558176054,TRUE,0,0,0.486486495,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.66E+16,119,4,8825,0,5567,1596957193

94,Street Fighter V,50684354,english,"I paid £15 for the base game and I consider it worth the money given the hours invested in to the game.

That said, I refuse to buy any DLC as I feel it has greatly impacted what we receive when we purchase a full title.

To Elaborate on that:
I feel that fighting games have suffered as a result of DLC, in earlier fighting games you would be rewarded for playing through the game with each character by unlocking characters, costumes and stages.
In 2,000 ranked games I have unlocked one extra character and one costume.

The story mode is uninspired and dull, I had played through with two characters and found no incentive to play through again, that said I have not played the free cinematic expansion which may offer incentive if you are interested in what I presume to be better than what exists in the base version.

I feel the biggest strength this game has is the community and what it offers to players who enjoy playing a competitive fighting game - the online system is good, I play 4-5 rated connection games with perhaps 1/10 being laggy messes and the rest being enjoyable and competent experiences as opposed to playing locally, it's not perfect but it's a good system for the most part.

If you enjoy the competitive online aspect in a fighter then I would recommend this to you, if you seek a single player experience then no, I suggest you spend your money elsewhere as others will offer you more for your money and the DLC will not be so exploitative as it is here. - I have no problem with DLC but I dislike the approach this game has taken, it gives me a feeling that I'm playing a demo and would prefer they added unlockables for playing and experiencing the whole game and the efforts put into it as opposed to the gamble of the fortune shop and season passes for characters, for a competitive game I think it makes sense to allow players to use who they wish or at least making them realistically unlockable (I prefer ussfiv approach having all unlocked at start) and offering say 1-2 costumes/stages for playing through the whole game and then charging dlc for addition costumes and stages would make it acceptable.

Because of the practices I give this game 7/10 for the genre, it would be closer to a 8.5+/10 if it was not for the fact that that I feel games such as this have devolved from the ps2/xbox era and what they generally offered then when you would pick up a game, all due to the DLC model which sacrifices overall quality of a finished product in exchange for cash.",1558093127,1558093408,TRUE,2,0,0.532280505,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.66E+16,30,8,25547,0,14290,1598792283

This iteration hurt me in my soul Capcom.
Even with the issues, I stayed loyal, and kept playing; waiting for you to make this game right.
To this day, lag in matches is worse than Street Fighter 2 when it was ported to the SNES.
Playing that version is the only reason I am still able to land a few hits when this lag happens.
I literally time things in my head, and execute commands I don't see happen.

My PC has been updated twice, and still these issues persist, so I know it is not my box. 
Cheating and rage quitting are still rampant, and all your system does is keep us from playing those players again.
Meanwhile, they are allowed to keep their ranks and titles, because Capcom really just doesn't give a shit.

The paywall is trash, thumbs down for that alone. 

In terms of being a decent game, it might be OK as a weird 2D tekken hybrid, I'll probably play some more- but it is far from inspiring any hope that we will ever see a Street Fighter game as good as 3rd Strike or Alpha 3 again.

However, at the time I'm writing this, the base game is $8, the game plus season 1 and 2 passes (12 extra fighters) is $20, and the season 3 pass (6 more fighters) is $15.  I bought all of them, and for $35, it was definitely worth it for the complete package.

Overall, definitely pick this one up if it's on sale at these prices, but not at full.

The first thing you need to know is that the days of ""Super Ultra Turbo Arcade Edition"" are over. Buying the core game gives you access to the core fighters and all future balance patches. This means you won't need to buy ""Super SF5."" I really can't stress this enough; if all you want to play is Ryu, congratulations! You've bought him (and all the other core fighters) forever!

Each season, Capcom releases additional characters, and while you can buy them with in-game currency, the costs are pretty exorbitant. However, the entire character pack per season is priced similarly to expansion packs of olden days. The difference now is that they are optional. The game has a ton of cosmetic DLC, as well, though don't let that intimidate you as it's not really necessary to play and you can pick and choose the specific items you want if you care to purchase. I know some people feel wronged by this, but the game is continuously supported through balance patches and, honestly, devs gotta eat.

If you're looking for a single player experience, the game has arcade and story modes, as well as tutorials, lessons, and combo trials- in case you want to learn the finer points of fighting games. I wish I could say more on that, but it's single-player offerings don't really grab me in the way Netherrealm Studios or Arc Systems games do. 

The game isn't without flaws. Color palettes are locked behind in-game currency and the prices are ridiculous. Then, there's the whole boondoggle with Ad Costumes, which Capcom seems to have quietly rolled back (no official word on if we'll see them again, but none saying they're gone for good either).

It's still one of the most played/relevant FG right now, and will be for at least another year.

It's not worth the online where even at 5 bars you can FEEL the lag and the input delay fighting you at every turn and it pisses you off and you lose not by your choices in a fight but the connection. But most of all it is a WORTHLESS single player game with a basic story mode they tacked on that just sales the next set of DLC fighters and the other modes that are in every modern fighting game out now all for $70. Street Fighter 5 doesn't feel new or next gen it feels old and boring and a huge step back for the series and that's what makes it hurt the most, that Street Fighter basically the face of fighting games the main stage for EVO for most people didn't live up.

One $25 DLC PACK and a now added $38 DLC PACK plus whatever skin packs they throw in for you just so you keep coming back again and again.It's just NOT WORTH IT

91,Street Fighter V,21294220,english,"SFV is the 5th main installmeant in the SF Series.
And it's also the second worst SF to this date, only beaten by SFIV.

Where do we start?
How about the good points, since there're not many.

- The Training Mode in this game is amazing.It offers you so many options that you can recreate basically everything with it just fine.

- Some of the newcomers are absolutly great, Menat, G and Falke in particular.

Time for the negatives.
- An extremly unrewarding gameplay, that dumbed the Fundamental and Core Aspect of Fighter so hard down, that literally everyone can beat everyone. Why is this bad you may ask? Cause it discourages practice and learning the basics. Why learn basics, when you can pop V-Trigger and get a free comeback.

- Every Character is fixed to one specific playstyle and the few ones who are unique, are terrible bad. This means that everyone plays the same character the same. There is no player uniqueness to be found in the pure approche to the characters themself.

- While the game has some good newcomers, it has 4 bad ones for every good one. Who thought that Abigail was a good idea?

- Hurt and Hitboxes make absolutly no sense. You can punch Abigails Head for example and it will do nothing and parse right trough it.

- The Ingame Shop. You have ingame currency. Currency that is hard to come by. 50 for a win online and around 4k trough weekly missions. Then costs one Stage 40-70k and a character 100k. Either you grind forever or you flock over real money.

- The Balance is terrible, certain characters get favored by the devs (Akuma in particular) and others have been bottom 5 since their release. Capcom also has the habit to take one particular character of a Season, mainly the 5th character and make them absolutly broken in the next Balance Patch.

- What leads into the diversity of the game. You will mainly see the same 5 characters. The times were people picked the char they like and want to be good with them is long over, SFV encourages you to constantly pick the Top Tiers.

- The game has an ad system, that punishs you for not using it. This extends loadtimes, is of course bugged, puts adds into the background and of course, gives you the ingame currency.
So if you don't want to see ads every 10 seconds, you have to let go of the precious Fight Money. Oh and the amount you can gain is limited, to make sure you don't get anything with Fight Money either.

- And lastly, the online. Bad and instable Server, a terrible Netcode that makes Tekken 6 and SFIV Netcode look like they're godlike and for some reason their Rollback Netcode adds extra delay. The entire point of Rollback Netcode is to smoothen the online experience to the point that you have no disadvantage compared to playing offline. Doesn't work here.
This is also a big problem since 3 years and the Devs installed a Rootkit as answer to the complains.

Hands off, there are many better Fighter on the Market, it's not worth it for the name.
It's not worth it for nostalgia.
It's not worth it for the health of your pocket.
And it's not worth it for your mental health.

4,Street Fighter V,47532217,english,"Hello everyone, I just wanted to quickly share my thoughts about this game to help people make a better decision as to whether or not they really want to purchase it.

Here are the things that I like about the game:
1. The gameplay feels really smooth, and after they heavily reduced the input lag Its no longer difficult to hit confirm or combo.
2. This is going to be a controversial plus, but I enjoy how this game is slower than other fighting games. As someone who is new to the genre, I find this really appealing. I feel like I have some time to think about my inputs or read the situation. Don't get me wrong, fast paced combo heavy fighting games are great. However, it's a harder starting point.
3. The characters and music are for the most part phenomenal. The music especially feels very high quality and like it has personality to it. Now, with the characters there are some that feel a bit bland, but then you get a character like G. He is honestly the only reason I tried this game out again, and he is the only character I listen to in English since his lines are pretty funny and entertaining. Otherwise I have everything set to Japanese, to which the characters sound great. 
4. The different modes are pretty entertaining. I really enjoyed the game's story mode (which is a free DLC). I realize it was a bit cheesy and didn't have the best plot, but it was still fun to play through and I found it enjoyable. The individual stories were fun as well, but they are far too short in my opinion. I find myself spending the most time doing the Challenges/Trials or doing Survival mode. It's nice to be able to just learn combos in game, getting a feel for your favorite character. I realize they aren't always practical, but its a good starting point. Survival mode is a fun way to practice your character against an onslaught of opponents (even if the AI is a little broken).

The issues with the game:
1. A large chunk of the characters, maps, and costumes are paywalled. You can earn in-game currency fairly quickly early on if you have arcade mode. I forget though which ways of earning money are unavailable in the standard version of the game. Either way, you ultimately have a really difficult time earning money, because they give 50 fight points per win. For reference, a new character costs 100,000 fight points. Unfortunately, that pittance won't get you anywhere, and the huge amount they do give you early on won't get you too far. Maybe a few characters or maps, and there are tons behind large paywalls.
2. They attempted to put ads ON the characters in game. I had a negative review about this game for awhile because of that, but they did remove it to my knowledge. The Ad-sponsored characters are still an option apparently though, but they appear as the default skin.
3. Something that really, really bugs me after trying out other fighting games is that there is no way to train online with your friends. You can make a private lobbies and play against your friends, but you can't actually start a training session with them. I really don't have anyone to practice with locally, so it's pretty much just trials and survival for me, which is no where near as fun or helpful as playing a real person.

In the end, I'd say it's still really fun and worth getting on sale. If you try to buy the game and the DLC (referring to character packs here) your wallet will be really hurting. Best way to save money though, (and unfortunately this requires a leap of faith, thinking you may actually play enough to justify it) is to buy the deluxe package that includes the character packs. 

Think that's all I have off the top of my head for the moment. I might update the review in the future once I'm a bit more experienced with the game or have a new thought.",1544824967,1552689573,TRUE,0,0,0,1,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.66E+16,227,15,8452,0,4911,1597032819

BUT Capcom's handling of the microtransactions is nothing short of a travesty, and it has only gotten worse as the game has gone on.

I, and by extent others, love the feeling of working hard and achieving your goals, which is the beauty of fighting games. The game itself, even though polarising veterans of the series, is very newcomer friendly and will allow new players to see the fun of the genre. However, for as much as I personally like this game the amount of frustration and disappointment this game brings is nothing to neglect.

- The Online Match Making System:
More often than not I was matched up with people who are just simply way higher rank than me or way lower, never feeling fun or a real challenge. While I was a rookie I was being matched up with super bronze players over and over and only rarely finding people of my skill level. (Also Lag sucks)

- Single Player Content:
Look I don't like playing fighting games by myself, but that's just me. However, if you're a person who likes playing by them self ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) and are tired of the online experience than sadly the single player content is very lacking and is excruciatingly easy. The Arcade gets old and tiresome real quick with no real charm. The General/Character stories are as well way too easy and repetitive.

- Tutorial:
There is none. And it sucks.

- Controller Compatibility:
I primarily play on keyboard personally and I found it to be one of the hardest experiences being that V-Reversals are impossible while I was on Non-Mechanical and flawlessly transitioning between attacks is frustrating to say the least. That leaves you with a few choices. Pad, best ergonomically and best for movement. Or Stick, best for transitioning between attacks and good for movement. So unless you want to never play fully you're going to have to buy one of these options.

Don't get me wrong I love this game but for what it's worth the game just doesn't live up to the legacy it should have. So but Tekken 7.",1550887210,1550887239,FALSE,1,0,0.476190478,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.66E+16,17,5,9085,0,1918,1594664713
39,Street Fighter V,49162053,english,"As a lifelong fan, I've never seen a SF game polarize the fan-base as much as this one. A focus on making it accessible for newcomers as well as making it entertaining for E-Sports fans have pushed Capcom to make a game that puts everyone squarely into the ""Love it"" or ""hate it"" catogories. That being said, after about 100 hours, I can tell you... I get it. Both sides, I get it.

I was ready to shelf the game until I found my character that fit my play style, and so I instantly loved it. 
Then I got bodied repeatedly and I hated it. Then I leveled up my game and I loved it again. 

And we can repeat those last two steps a few times, but that's what online will do to you. When it plays right, it's beautiful. When it's laggy-- and unfortunately, that happens more frequently than a modern game should-- it's a frustrating mess, watching your opponent insta-react and blows that connect, suddenly don't connect and you actually took damage and WHAT IS GOING ON YOU STUPID LAGGY PIECE OF $&#$... but I digress.

Now that we're currently on season 4, the game is balanced pretty damn well. The rest is the SF we know and love: Graphics on point, tight controls, solid gameplay, yatta yatta.

This game is so annoying and broken in some ways.

While the gameplay is decent overall, there are a bunch of little quirks that annoy the heck out of me and take away from the overall experience. 

For example, why does my PS4 controller NOT WORK on this game by default? Ridiculous.

Why do I have to download and apply a title update EVERY TIME the game starts?  This just lengthens loading times.

Why does the game have to log me in online, whether I want to play online or not?  Why not log me in only when I choose to go online?

Why are so many characters, stages and costumes behind overpriced paywalls?  Yet the main game still costs $25?

Why did the game force me through an absurd tutorial that I have no way to skip through (to my knowledge)?

While this is a subjective point, my opinion is that the art direction of SFV sucks - I dislike the huge chunky characters with hands and feet twice the size of their heads.  Looks ridiculous - I get artistic exaggeration for showing moves, but this is overdone.

As an example, Ken looks terrible - ugliest model in the game for sure.

I do like the SF franchise, but this release is the antithesis of a fun fighting game, quite ironic that I attended more tournaments for this game than pretty much any other fighting game yet, even though I did never really care for it.

Here's hoping that we will see a new SF title by the end of 2020 or something, any more dev time spent on this pile of trash is a huge waste of time if you ask me.

Since the release of SFV Capcom managed to prove more than one time that they are a company capable of producing great games, such as MH:W, RE2 and (possibly) the new DMC. Kinda sad that the fighting game fans have been stuck with this game since 2016.

Until something interesting happens with SF I'll luckily be able to spend time with BBTag, BBCF, UNIST, Tekken, DBFZ, SCVI, Smash and all the other good to great fighting games that are available. Only downside being that most of 'em do not have a whole lot of players within my local scene, if any. Oh well.

This was a review update, see below for old version

-----------------

Season 3 has finally rolled around, so it's time for another review update:

PROs:

- Roster is now at 25+ characters, with the next set already announced, coming throughout 2018
- Big arcade mode, extra battles and more have been added, for everyone that wanted more offline content from their SFV experience.
- Said extra battles allow you to wager your Fight Money to earn even more, or to unlock special costumes (Viewtiful Joe Rashid being the first one), which means a number of premium costumes will be unlockable for free
- Every character got a second V-Trigger, which shakes up the whole roster and adds new and exciting options for each playstyle imo
- Anti-air jabs, throw loops and other annoying things have been removed/reduced in strength, which should make the game more enjoyable in the long run

CONs:

- SFV is still littered with DLC, such as Season Passes and dozens upon dozens of costumes. If you are annoyed by stuff like that, take it into consideration. You can unlock things such as stages and characters with FM, but it will take dedication to earn that currency.
- If the Season 3 preview is anything to go by, Sagat may be the last character to be added, which is sad :(
- Ken's Battle Costume is still in the game and hasnt been changed",1467642400,1549635642,FALSE,0,0,0.523809552,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.66E+16,251,16,20650,0,19720,1597525679

76,Street Fighter V,27722830,english,"I really wanted to like this game.  I really wanted to enjoy it.  I am not a hardcore player though and so this game is basically unplayable.  You either have to be an expert or enjoy being beat to a pulp by experts.  With no enjoyment of the online options for play I had to call this game lost...the only other options were to play survival...fighting the same 10 oponents in the same order...on the same stages.  Capcom provides no casual gaming option here.  No classic arcade mode.  They provide no realistic way to make in game currency after the day one training is done.  They do offer a daily challenge system but it requires competitive online play often difficult for casual gamers to take advantage of.  Hardcore competitive players will like it but for a casual player there is no joy in this game...no endings to work for and a story mode that is terrible.

My second problem stems from my completionist nature, I like to get it all.  So for me the DLC and cosmetic packs are an issue.  Only small portions of it can be bought with in game currency (less than 30%).  Over $350 is currently required in real money AFTER you bought the game to unlock everything.  The season pass is a joke...season passes traditionally have included all DLC released in a given year or in many cases all the DLC released period.  For Capcom the season pass doesn't include stages, costumes or ""exclusive, seasonal, promotional"" things either.  Capcom got greedy.  Next is the exclusive and time expiring content.  This is a kick in the balls for loyal fans who just can't afford $30-50 every time they release new skin packs or holiday stages.  Lastly the DLC in game distribution system means that while the game may go on sale on steam the DLC never will.

Don't buy it if you are not rich, if you are a casual gamer or if you want arcade mode.  Do buy it if you are a pro-gamer and have a deep pocketed sponsor.

April-2-2017 Update:  Capcom keeps lieing to the community on this game.  I recently bought several costumes to discover that a seemingly random assortment are not including all 10 colors with purchase requiring more drudgery through the god aweful survival mode to unlock them when yet others randomly seem to include the colors in the purchase price.  Secondly they had been promising daily missions to earn fight money since the season two update.  Currently we are at best getting 3 mission updates a week and as few as 1 some weeks.  It has now also been announced that Capcom's promise that all future DLC will be for both platforms was a lie as more PS4 exclusive content is being leaked.

May-25-2017 Update:  Capcom falsly advertised the CPT2017 DLC as containing ""daily"" missions for those that bought it.  They anounced today that in point of fact they will be ""monthly"" missions.  They are incapable of telling the truth.  Don't buy from Capcom.

June-8-2018 Update:  This game is now nothing but a DLC costume and stage microtransaction POS.  Capcom is constantly adding overpriced DLC and the Missions and Extra Battle options to make in game money have been mostly changed to betting FM on fights that have insane AI and near cheat key reading computer fighters.  When they are not doing that they ""let"" you pay 10,000 FM (200 Wins of in game currency) on 4 part exclusive skins...and if you fail any one part you get nothing.  The DLC Barbie shop goes strong meanwhile the play mechanics and net code are still issue filled and half assed.  If Capcom can't charge you for it they are not fixing it.  We finally got arcade mode which turned out to be ok but not great.  It reaked of half ass effort.  SFV is now the Crapcom Online Casino.

November 21, 2018  Crapcom added a couple new features.  They officially added loot box exclusive drops in the vein of exclusive colors, skins, item buffs and art (much of which is included for FREE in the Street Fighter Collection but requires loot drops in their flagship game) requiring the purchase of YET ANOTHER in game currency called ""tickets""...the drops are blind and no statistical data has been shared about the drop probabilities.  In addition they have now added game play items that change the balance of play for survival modes...probably soon to be implimented in other modes pushing them one step closer to a ""pay to win"" model.  Next is another mode called dojos...which let players spend more in game money to customize a stage with loot box dropped items.  The stage requires you to log into Crapcom's website and can not be edited in game.  According to the terms of service you give Crapcom the right to monitor and use stats from your Steam or PS4 account including play times, contacts and other games in your library.  Since its web based the feature will not be usable after support for the game is cancelled.  Another couple fucking BS features while the netcode and game mechanics issues still go unressolved.  

December-11-2018 Update:  Crapcom strikes again.  They have added a new update adding in game ads in the style of the ""free to play/pay to win"" model games.  They spin this as you get bonus Fight Money for playing with ads on... in reality they are penalizing the players that turn them off.  Its a BS move by some greedy marketing pricks in the corporation.  If you want fight money bonuses which are pathetic at best (max 250 FM per day) you have to now see promo ads plastered on stages, wait screens and the character models themselves.  Additionally, turning this off has the quiet penalty on the dojo points system as well... something they NEVER mentioned in the lead up or announcement.  In addition to that, there is the little fact the update broke the game...for many many Steam users the game gets stuck in an endless loop on startup as it endlessly restarts to load the new content.  Crapcom strikes again.

December-20- 2018 Update:  Crapcom doubles down again with garbage tactics...they are pulling the long established season pass.  We now have to buy each character for $6 effectively amounting to a 50% price hike.  Oh you can still buy them with FM but they nerfed the FM value too.  You can no longer get the colors and the extra costume if you use FM to buy unless you want to again shell out more after the fact.  Crapcom's actual response was to tell players that this is a better way to do it for the game...they fucking want you to believe that you have to pay more money and you should fucking be happy about it.  To top it off we got yet another update to add Kage and they STILL have not fixed the update restart loop.  Steam USERS had to find our own fix.  They have also massively nerfed FM again.  They have cut 85%+ of the weekly FM yield that you can earn but its ok...Crapcom isn't punishing those that won't play with ads enabled with FM deductions...no they love their players and would never do anything like that.

Was definitely a sad thing to be part of it at the beginning but this is now a full fledged fighting package with the best SF fighting of the entire series history. 

The micros are insane for cosmetics and fight money is an utter mind bending grind. But you don't have to use either of those. I just buy everything and really never spend fight money on anything.

Online has a good chunk of players at different levels but I wouldn't say very many true casual players are in it very often. 

This is currently my favorite fighting game of all time right up there with Tekken 7.

Wholeheartedly recommend this game. By far easiest street fighter for newcomers and casual players. Tons of dopamine moments.

Instead of showing the (short) advert once or maybe even twice during an arcade playthrough, it does it between every bout. That's 10 times during an arcade playthrough!

87,Street Fighter V,48443348,english,"[h1] VERY LONG IN DEPTH 2019 REVIEW FOR THOSE WHO WANT TO UNDERSTAND THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS[/h1]

-------------------------------------

This review exists so you wouldn't have to spend as much time researching as I did - I spent something 6-9 hours trying to find answers because of the negative reviews and Youtubers. I wasn't worried about the price, but the possible ""wasted"" future time investment.
What I can say now is that it's easily a 9/10 game if you enjoy improving your skills, reflexes and like to be competitive. I'll talk through most of the biggest complaints and top ""reviews"", so you would understand the good parts, decisions and rationality behind the ""problems"". I spend a lot of money on all my hobbies and I can't even spend more than $20 in extra characters / stages / costumes / whatever I want EVEN if I want to! Instead I just bought both SF5 music albums on Steam for $40.

The key part is that every negative review is extremely exaggerated. Instead of reviewing that you can get 6 characters bundle for $9, it's presented as $24. 
Instead of buying all stages alone with steam money for 75$, you can get them as bundle for $15, and realistically you choose 1 stage that you like, buy it with Fight Money and play on it. EVERYONE DOES IT.

- ""Full priced game has X"". A $20 game is not a full priced game and never has been, a $60 one is. The lower price point allows more people to join the game and increase it's population size while other players who might want to spend more money on it, can do so. Beeeeeeecause the game is 3x cheaper than a ""full priced game"" and Capcom needs revenue from somewhere to keep it updated and alive. Every online game in the world needs some method of keeping the revenue stream running.

- Plenty of reviews about how the game has $500 worth of ""DLCs"". Never seen this as an upvoted review point in any B2P or F2P game ever, even when other games have $20,000 in DLCs. The game is not P2W and you can get everything that you realistically desire with maybe $5-10.

- Very balanced and every character is tournament viable, but scrub mentality exists massively in the online communities. Local communities is the DREAM! This game truly is all skill and no luck, don't listen to the scrubs.

- The Fight Money grind is big because people play this game normally with 1-2 characters and you get your first 3 locked seasonal characters with fight money very easily. Nobody ever plays this game with all characters. Just like all other online games and ESPECIALLY this game, people mostly play 1-2 tricking their favorite character(s). 

- The ads can be turned off and will never affect you in any way. Capcam very definitely has learned to not put them in anymore. The reason why they started to exist is because if they don't earn any revenue, they can't keep the game updated or alive.

- Moot points such as ""You can't practice against CPU character that you don't have"". Nobody ever does it in any game, not even in this game. This process, IF EVER DONE, is 99% time done in 1v1 with another player who mains or plays the character because you don't practice against 1v1 against CPU if you want to be a high level player.

- Big patches are a problem? What game doesn't have patches? Is updating a 3 year old game a top negative review worthy now?

- Netcode is not as bad as people make it to be and often people can't see their own problems. Games have to choose if they either ""slow down"" or ""keep it at a normal pace"" if there's lag. Either option is fine and Street Fighter 5 prefers "" keeping the normal pace"".
I didn't blame the netcode in start but thought that it's bad. My problems were tho that I had bad PC / always chose the worst connection settings / always played at night / had an unresponsive controller. Once I fixed all of these issues, I have no problems at all.

To sum it up:

> No fishy marketing tactics
> You won't be manipulated in any way, no gambling or lootboxes or anything forced or stopping you from getting better
> You can disable ads immediately
> Buy the game, play it for 1.5 hours and you can refund it if you want
> All my friends play it now after I picked it up and I'm having a blast in ranked and with friends
> I even bought both music albums in an instant because the music is just THAT GOOD
> Form your own opinion(s), don't succumb to the edgelords negative review bombs like ""ADS LUL xDDD"", ""SF2 WAS BETTER"" etc.",1547996160,1548011827,TRUE,50,2,0.616836429,20,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.66E+16,50,3,7420,0,2832,1555873077

Capcom should be ashamed. This belongs on the Google play store. The worst RIP-OFF I have ever seen on the software market without a doubt, and yes, I play Vainglory on mobile... I Paid over 65 dollars for this on sale = most expensive (DOA5 was a way better investment) fighting game I have ever played.

I have like 3 of 12 Stages to use?! The Story, Art and gameplay are second rate. Bottom line. 
There are many way better fighting games out there that cost alot less. Shameful. 
How can you release this AFTER a masterpiece like SFIV?!?!?
Capcom is recently behaving very shortsighted and making TRASHY and GREEDY product here. The ONLY thing that got me to buy this c-rate game was the belief that I might mod some of the CHEESY CHILDISH costumes away...NOPE. Capcom makes it so that only their trashy unfinished costumes are useable, turning this game into a frustrating money pit with little hope to suppliment ARTISTIC TASTE or enjoy any replayability or ability to repair the unfinished continued money grab. Lazy and poor quality. >>8-bit console games had better content than this ______.<<< (MAMEmulator is BETTER people!!!)

98,Street Fighter V,48347562,english,"If you're a fan of Street Figher and fighting games in general, I'd say you'll get your money's worth for 20€. That's usually how much the game costs when it's on sale. The package includes all the characters, except for the 6 from the latest season pass. 

It's up to you how much more you want to pay for the extra content. Personally I would wait for character packs and stages to be discounted, or buy them with fight money which you can earn in-game, albeit very slowly. The costumes are not really worth it, because the underwear is usually censored with granny panties and there's a bunch of bugs, like legs and objects clipping through. You're better off with installing mods, which are client-side only, so you don't risk getting a ban.

The biggest thing you'll appreciate about the game is Cammy's as- , I mean the graphics! The game is built in UE4 and by now they've added in all the visual candy (would not surprise me if there's some PBR in there), so most of the time it feels like you're playing a movie.

Aside from that, there's a reasonable amount of things to do. There's one long story mode, a small story chapter for each character, training, challenges, arcade, survival, casual and ranked online matches, etc. If you're a long time fan you'll definitely enjoy a few hours of all the different modes, before starting with the online matches. The character rooster is pretty decent and more will be added this year.

You'll have to play the patient game if you want to collect all the characters, stages and costumes though, it all adds to a pretty big sum.

Are you serious Capcom?  Who asked for this?  I am aware you can turn off the ads but this was the answer to removing the 2500 FM missions.

SFV's got some good things going for it. Like I really want more fighting games to use this Fight money system, cherry picking dlc and crossplay. But capcom makes it pretty damn hard for me to recommend it when every good decision is usually followed by 3 bad ones. Like this game used to put a root kit on your pc... You have been warned.

The pros

+ Very good player base (You can easily find people your skill level in ranked/lobbies)
+ + This the only version of the game you need to buy ever. More fighting games need to do this.
+ + + New Characters/Stages/Colors and some costumes can be unlocked with Fight money (the in game currency)
+ + You can cherry pick what characters/stages/colors/costumes you want.
+ + + CrossPlay between PC and PS4. This is huge! Ever fighting game on PC Needs this to have decent playerbase numbers. It's not really an option anymore.

The cons 

- - - Theres no good source of fight money any longer most of them were removed without reducing cost to anything. At best a few decent weekly. Just make playing people online the main source already, you idiots. 
- - - Lootboxes in a premium game.
- The netcode needs work. Can't even search by region, which is pretty insane. Also one sided rollback has still not been fixed
- - Most dlc is over priced, should be $1 each for how much there is. 
- No voice chat at all, can't even type in lobbies. Just premade messages.
- Games performance could be a bit better (it's not horrible, but it could be better)

[b] Should you buy SFV? [/b]

first, they took fight money out from single player stuff like survival, followed by the nerfing of weekly special missions, which had 5000 fight money, to 2500 fight money a week. 

then came the menat fortune telling, which are glorified lootboxes, which uses, guess what, fight money. also don't forget sponsored content... in full priced game.

now that mission(2500fm) is nowwhere to be found anymore. to add insult to injury, kage, the new character, doesn't have any other purchasable options, other than with fight money or 'in game cash shop', which is outside the bounds of the steam regional pricing.

It plays well enough, releasing arcade mode as a free update instead of another game as they've done in the past was great and I personally got in at the exact right time so I'm fine but would discourage anyone new picking this up. It's all because of the fight money shenigans.

For those uninformed, fight money was supposed to give you an alternate way to buy characters, stages and costumes. (You can't even buy all the costumes and stages with it btw.) They started out with weekly missions that awarded 5000 for a simple task (knock over a sign in a certain stage for example), gave out fight money for completing story mode, survival and the tirals. With the release of the Arcade update this 5000 money was cut in half to 2500 and you would no longer earn fight money in those modes, leaving only playing online and gaining character experience as forms of fight money. Me? I got almost all of that. Survival, story, I have tons, didn't finish all the trials though. This was supposed to be balanced out by adding weekly events in which you would gamble your fight money in a battle against a special solider. Pay 1000 to fight him, win 2500 for example, so +1500 and you could play up to 3 times. They introduced fortune cards, in game gambling with fight money to get certain outfits. You could earn tickets through survival per month and there was one free one per week.

Now at the start of ""season 4"" it appears the 2500 mission has been removed completely. It's been 3 weeks without one. This has been replaced with an online only mission that awards 50. It's also been replaced with the option for in game ads, adorning your character with a Capcom ad for the sake of 8 more fight money per match. If you happen to play in the Capcom Pro Tour stage, which was only obtainable for real money, you can get an extra 4. There hasn't been a free fortune ticket offering in weeks either, there were event battles where you could spend 50 fight money to play in and win them at a discount but the free reading appears to be gone. Then there's the soldier, play chances have been reduced from 3 to 1. Not only that there hasn't been a soldier as part of the event missions for the last 2-3 weeks either. There's an achievement for 1 million fight money. To get that these days it'll take about 3-5 years. Even purchasing a character for 100,000 will now take a ridiculous amount of time. For some perspective, at best you get and extra 12 fight money per online match, 5000/12 = 416. You would have to play 416 online matches per week to get the same amount of fight money you previously would for a single offline match.

50,Street Fighter V,47967759,english,"Just wanted to write a quick review to comment for those unsure about this product due to the negative reviews.

The whole ""Ad"" system that people are complaining about isn't really an Ad at all. Essentially, all it does it promote the capcom pro-league, sponsors of the pro-league and advertise in-game sales on special items. These are not ""Ad""s like the ones you see on youtube where you need to wait 5 seconds to skip them, they are either stickers, costume edits or changes in a stage's background which display pro sponsors and the pro league. The other ""Ad""s replace the black loading screen with a screen that'll show something like ""50% of costume pack in the store"", which isn't really an ""Ad"" in my eyes, but more of a notice.

People are also complaining about how having the ""Ad""s will give you a marginal increase in money etc, almost ""forcing you"" to have them on. They really don't. You get about 15 FM (The in-game currency used to purchase DLC for FREE) from an online match, wearing a sponsor costume or having stage ads on give you about 8 extra FM each. If you play enough matches, it's barely even noticable. As well as this, you get a large amount of money for completing survival on each character (Amount varies depending on what difficulty you complete, even easy mode gives you a sizable amount of FM) as well as getting lots of money for easily powering through each character's story mode, just doing this alone is at least enough FM for 1 character or 2 stages.

People complaining about how Capcom is ""selling out"", when all they have done is advertise their pro league like several other games do such as Rainbow Six and are recieving backlash for it. It's funny because people would pay actual real-life money just to get some skins that advertise the pro-leagues or pro-teams in R6S or CS:GO. The game it's-self is fine, unlike Tekken 7 you can get DLC if you play the game enough without spending more money on the game. Game looks great, feels great to play and even has a ""Low Spec"" mode for people who don't have the best of PCs.

3) Sound qulaity of speach is lower than Ultra SF4
4) Loading time takes longer than lower SF versions.

the game itself is a strong 5/5 for me. the system is great, the animation is gorgeous, and the characters stand out and have unique play styles to them. I'd say it's one of the best FTGs ever made. 

what is ruining it is the way it's profitting. I'm fine with paying for extra stuff EVEN when this is not a free to play, but there are too many things that requires paying. 
 
There is also a bullshit RNG system that gives you concept art of characters that aren't even in this game. What a freaking joke. 
And as a concept artist myself I can confidently tell you, more than 50% of the cosmetics, they didn't even bother to develop them that much, they just throw them out for a cash grab. they look worse then fan made stuff on deviantart. It's ok if you want to make money with skins, Riot does it, but do it with a heart and actual good designs? 
Also maybe learn from riot games and have a roster of free to play characters each week?

It's been a long time, Capcom. I have faithfully stood by you thorugh thick and thin. But, this game is just not what it needs to be, and what everyone wants it to be.

Pros:

Great Graphics, smooth gameplay, original look and feel. Super easy to connect and jump into ranked or casual games online.

Cons:

Okay, here we go.

Pucker up and get ready.

Because the only con I see in this game is a massive one.

There is only one single way to correctly play every single character in this game.

Example:

Ranked online. You queue up, get into a match against an Abigail. Cool, this guy is good. He shimmies and plays well.

Match ends.

Next match, against a totally different player playing as Abigail.

It will be the exact same match. 

Why? Because there is no diversity in the playstyle of V. Every character has one solid way to play them. To not play in that one solid playstyle, which you aren't locked into by any means, means you have a huge chance of losing.

Sure, you can change it up on the fly or play differently.

But, you will never discern one player's way of playing Akuma or Ken or Blanka from the next one's. 

Why? Because Capcom wanted it this way.

Sure, it makes it easier for new players to main and get used to a character. But, they will never know what it is like to face an Abigail that plays differently than the Abigail before it.

You can face ten Abigails, and you will most likely see a small amount of change up with how they play. But, for the most part, or majority of each match, it will be the exact same match as the one before it.

For any character.

The price of the DLC has already outpaced the price of the game itself by a lot. Also when you enter your name, make sure you really want to stick with that one because changing it costs 10 bucks.

It's also the least fun I've ever had with a Street Fighter game. It just feels ""off."" I don't even know how else to describe it. It just doesn't feel as good to play as Ultra did. It feels less responsive. The pace is weird. It's not a horrible game, but it's a step down from Ultra, for sure. Even the graphics look worse, thanks to really bad character design. The new music is alright though. Rashid's theme rips.

But there are plenty of other, better fighting games out there right now. Granted, a lot of them also have terrible DLC policies, but at least they're actually fun. Unfortunately, this one isn't.

18,Street Fighter V,38884094,english,"Street Fighter V has had quite the rough road hasn't it? Despite it's misssteps, it does appear to be getting better. The game still has some issues. The Story arcs for the individual characters are poorly done, with some questionable art. They do serve to give some background information, but feel underdone. The UI still feels a bit bland much like Marvel vs. Capcom: Infinite. 

However, the game is set to receive a large update with the arcade edition which will add new story content, update the UI, and add new characters as well. 

Visually the character models look good and are at least more cohesive than some of MvC:Infinite's character models. The score is pretty decent as well with some nice themes for various characters. They added Guile who has always been a favorite of mine, and now Blanka will be coming as well. 

Mechanically Street Fighter V feels polished (I say that as someone who fully admits they are a casual fan of fighting games). I've had smooth performance on the whole with only the occassional frame drop (I suspect this was due to the game downloading a title update). 

Is it worth picking up? On sale, sure. I would otherwise advise waiting for the arcade edition which will be $40. I got SSFV and it's character pass both at an affordable price.

UPDATE: Well Capcom you proved just how low you really can be. Street Fighter V was rough at launch. And because of that? I held off buying the game. It was only after you patched the game and made it what it should have been at launch that it was an easy recommendation to make. Now you have shown the audacity to put paid ads in the game. I mean you have a freaking ad placed over Guile's American Flag tattoo. I guess there is a metaphor to be found in there about America, capitalism and corporate greed. In this case I guess corporate greed isn't distinctly an American thing however. 

You should be ashamed Capcom and for this reason I am changing my positive recommendation to a negative one. Have you no respect for the games you create?

I would not recommend it to someone who have not played the previous itirations before. But because I'm a fan and this is my first online fighting game, I am happy with it. Gameplay is solid. But major problems are lack of content and the delay in frames.

Still a nice game to play. Still hoping for continued support until everything is ironed out.

Edit (19.12.2018) : 

After playing the game from its release upto now, I would give you my honest thoughts.

For me, who was a complete begginer to online fighting games, I find the game to be very addictive and fun. I main nash and i lost quite often. Those times I won, I feel very rewarded. Especially against higher tier characters and highter rank fighters. 

At first, I was very frustrated whenever I lose  because I dedicated myself to practicing and griding to get good.The game became toxic. When you main nash, you have to accept that you will not have the advantages other characters have. But I don't want to change my main because Nash fits my fighting style too well. I want to be the underdog and win. So I practice more. Tiers definitely matters on this game. Connection can be a problem sometimes. So I keep my preferred connection to 4-5 bars. I will have to wait for 5-30 minutes just to get a match and then, get bodied by a brainless ken with his unexpected DPs.

Then, I told myself that I will go my own pace. I will learn and keep learning. I will learn from my losses. I will always play with positive attitude and I will stop playing whenever I feel salty. I praise my opponents whenever they beat me and look at my replays to see why i lost. Then I go watch yt videos of pros in hopes of learning something from them... And now, I am having fun. I have friends online who are in the same area, who always plays with me whenever they see me online. And I am still improving. 

The downside of the game is its micro transactions. The way the developers are handling the game is not the best way. You will have to pay a lot or grind for in game currency to purchase most of the dlc. and it does not come cheap... Also, the latest issue, which is the incorporation of ads in a full priced game does not really please the fans and players. I myself is very unhappy about it. The netcode problem is still there. 

If you are willing to overlook that, then this might be a game for you.. I like the game for it's mechanics and hype. Hope this is helpful .",1480151068,1545210403,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.66E+16,26,1,209512,0,123018,1596138310

They killed MMX, and they killed this.

Logically, I should be able to double down on this, cause it IS a new installment, but I can't. So double thumbs down. Don't give them your money.

Update ?.? who fucking knows at this point: So, we got a paywall for characters, stages, and costumes. Netcode still shit. Smurfs still rule the online playground in low tiers. Gameplay is still heavily unbalanced.

This is an abusive relationship. There's a lot to like about SFV, and plenty more to dislike. Where there's a fun fighting game to be had, which emphasizes a more welcome environment to newer FG players, there's Capcom, who decides to spit in everyone's face.

Capcom's list of crimes have thus far included:

1. Releasing an unfinished game which lacked both an Arcade/Story mode.
2. Painful netcode issues since launch.
3. A fairly limited roster with more locked behind ""Fight money.""
4. A decrease in the way players get ""fight money,"" encouraging you to spend actual money.
5. Reason #4 wouldn't be such an issue if there wasn't so much content locked behind DLC. Currently, there's about $300 worth of it.
6. Ads. In a paid game. This one is quite recent, and as you can imagine, leaves a lot of us pretty salty.

And yet with all that... I still like it. I still like the characters, Ono's infectious positivity and enthusiasm, the more forgiving frame inputs (3f instead of 1f). SFV helped me get into fighting games, whereas I was too late on the USF4 train.

The issue is there's still a pretty fun fighting game here. It's not as complex as its previous iteration, but enough to keep professionals sated. It still has a big tourney scene and the most recent character addition, Kage, is one of the coolest goddamn things this game has released since. . ., well. I don't know. The G/Sagat dual release, maybe?

It's hard, because I really like the core of this game. Fighters, matches, and combos are pretty enjoyable. No, it's not as crazy as say, DBZF, but it's still Street Fighter.  Were it not for Capcom's insistence to constantly try to monetize this franchise in in gross, predatory ways, I think it'd be pretty great.

So, I kind of recommend it. When it's on sale (as of writing this review, December, it is). Arcade Edition is essentially what the game shoud've been on release. Kage is a fantastic addition. In game ads can be turned off (and that's not an excuse, but well, it's there), and I think it's a great entry point for anyone looking to get into fighting games.

I'm pretty nervous about what the future holds. If Capcom is willing to put in ads, WITH the numerous amounts of DLC, what else will they try to do? Some speculate (and it's ONLY speculation) the game is going F2P for S4, but that's only a rumor (if true, would explain the ads). But if not, how hard will they monetize it? What does this mean for future iterations of Street Fighter?

If you're willing to get past all this Capcom nonsense, there's a fun game still there. And, the best part? PC version gets mods. Hey, if anything, you've got access to all those extra Mika bits, amirite?

45,Street Fighter V,47288314,english,"So Streetfighter was my fighting game.  It was the only one I played and often times the only game I played.   When V came out and I saw the how negative the reviews were I bought [b]Tekken [/b] in order to open up my options in case Street Fighter V was never fixed.  

V doesn't look like a next generation game.  IV looks much better.  It plays much better.  The menu; which is so important for games like this, acting as a hub, is designed around the entire game rather than just competitive play.  Most of all IV has no sign of the extortionist economy or in game advertisements, but honestly I've played IV to death.  I want a new fighting game.

I went back to play Tekken.  Fighting games are hard to get into because of their steep learning curve.  The mechanics are much different from Street Fighter.  Trying to play it as if it was Street Fighter makes that learning curve more challenging, but it's worth the effort.  It's a really fun game with a lot of content.  I don't feel rushed into competitive play. 

Story mode in Tekken is actually exists and it's fun to play.  You're rewarded for playing the game with in game currency that's tossed at you faster than you can use it.  Playing the game for a few hours gives you enough currency to try  a few new skins.  The currency is designed as an internal game mechanic.  It's there to reward you while slowly opening new custom variations.  

Arcade mode in Tekken is an actual arcade mode.  It feels just like you were playing on the cabnet.   There are other single player varients to keep you entertained besides.

Street Fighter V takes about a minute in between matches.  Thats a lot of downtime.  Tekken plays one match right at the end of the other, leading to a far more satisfying experience.  

The charters in Street Fighter look like they're made of plastic.  Tekken is an incredibly beautiful game.  

Street Fighter has a very limited character and map roster.  Tekken was released with an extensive roster.  The Season Pass for Street Fighter gives you crumbs.  All three season passes don't add up to what would compared to other games would be considered a finished product.  The Season Pass in Tekken gives respects your purchase, substantially adding to the games content.  As DLC should do.  Nobody is against DLC.  If you really like a game then you're happy to pay for a fleshed out expansion of that game.  People don't like being pressured into paying for nothing, or paying five dollars for single skin.

Tekken throws more content at you for simply playing through the game than you'll probably even care to use.  That same content Street Fighter isn't going to expect you to purchase.  To access a substantial portion of the content you have to spend massive amount of in game currency.  They had some pretty cool skins in the challenge section of street fighter.  The fights were pathetically easy.  You had to pay some in game currency in order to participate but I thought it was whatever since they were essentially giving their customer base free skins.  Thats not what was going on.  It was a gambling game.  There were four reward symbols which you needed to collect before you were given the skin.  I spent an hour playing the same easy af fight attempting to collect the four symbols but I couldn't get them all.  It was trick.  It was a skinner box.  They purposefully design this game to psychologically trap you into boring, ungratifying game play.  It likely took a designer an hour to produce each of those skins.  So the value of it is one hour divided by how many thousand people make up their customer base.  Instead of just giving you it or making you spend a rediculous amount of in game currency for it.  They design a gambling mechanic as a core feature of this game. 


Games should be healthy for you to play.  They should work your mind and add value to your life.  It isn't just that Street FIghter doesn't add value to your life.  It's designed with the intention of harming you psychologically and exploiting you financially.  Do you really want to play a game that's designed to cause you harmd??  Even if it was free, this game is a spider web.  Avoid it at all costs.  It is predetory and manipulative.  Do not expose yourself to it.

Play Tekken instead.

Summary of issues

The game is ugly

There is no content

It takes a minute in between matches just in load times

The AI scales weird

You'll be expected to buy three seperate season passes which don't even get the game to the amount of content available in IV

In game currency is hard to earn and features of the game demand a very large amount of the currency to access

An individual skin costs $5

They just added advertisements before every match.  While the option can be turned off the you'll need access to the currency in order to play the game so you really can't turn it off.

Gambling Mechanics are a core feature of the game play so that the game is detrimental to the user.

The Story mode is just a bunch of still images as if the developers couldn't be bothered prefering rather to throw up some concept art and call it a day.

The tutorial at the start of the game is insulting to anyone above the age of 7 and doesn't go in depth enough to benefit anyone of any age or experience level.  It's like the tutorials in games from the 90s

Arcade mode is a joke.  It's just the same Arcade mode repeated several times.  It doesn't pay hommage to it's predicesors.  Compared to other tittles it's extremely lacking. 

The HUB is directed entirely at competative play. 

Maps and Characters are limited so even if you're a fan of the game you'll still become bored quickly.

You know how those free to play games on your phone have in game ads.  That's Street Fighter V now.  They added it on the 13th.  In front of ever match there's an ad.  Right now it's just for SFV skins but you know where there going with it.  Next month it will be a cocacola ad.  The only reason why they're starting with SFV related content is because they know if you turned on your game to a fucking advert where there would be a fucking riot.  But you'll be seeing those shortly.  

I love that they say the game is sponsored by advertisers.  I was under the impression that it was a commodity that was sponsored by me buying it.  I thought that was how commodity exhange worked.  You can see I have a good bit of time put on this game, but that's because I already liked street fighter.  It's the easiest fighting game for me to sit down and play.  I don't like this game.  It isn't well done.  After about 2 years of being released there isn't much in the way of content.  If I wasn't already familiar with this series I'd find this game unplayable.  I'm not even bringing this up to tell you that this game is a terrible game.  I'm bringing this up because this game that has had very little labor put into it's making even after about two years of shameless money grabbing is trying to tell us that it needs another stream of revenue in order to support itself.  This is the most unfinished blockbuster game in my library.  It's been two years.  What have they been doing?  Now they need to insert advertisements into the game to be able to afford to finally finish it.  They're not even working on it.  It's been two years and the game is still a piece of shit.  Other titles seem to be able to produce finished copies of their game on the release date, and they manage to do it with the money they collect from the selling their game.  

What do you think capcom is going to spend the money on?  It's not going to be spent making this game better.  

The basic copy of this game is what would have been considered a demo copy 20 years ago.  It's not a finished game.  You've got to buy three seperate DLC passes for the game as it stands and that's still very little content. And they need advertising to support what exactly?

Ken and Ryu should have similar but not exact copy's of each

have a different skin looking like Ken like other fighting games

the gaming industry which most don't. And try to point out pointless
sales of the past without realizing how many gaming companys 
already came and went or stop producing that game all together.
For Example, Activision used to do the Mechwarrior Series until the
3rd was done by who? Mircro Prose and Mechwarrior went to crap
afterwards. Hopefully Mechwarrior 5 vs Online is done right with
single player.
Four-DLC's are done because there's not all this money coming in from
the start to keep a game being developed on. Look to Killing Floor 2, 
they are always working and improving the game for over 2 years now

want added to the game.

Still Waiting for Tekken X Street Fighter That would Announce Until a Tekken Character is Character Pass 3 Yep People From Old High School are still forcing me to get every single bit of DLC for this game and yes i know Season 4 Is Out soon on Steam look's like i'll get that and the Capcom Pro Pass Tour Thing 2019! 

Yep Character Pass 4 is Confirmed for 2019 , So Get Yakuza 6 On PS4 To play Virtua Fighter 5 Final Showdown it has more characters then Street Fighter V Started with. I wish Sega could make Next Gen Eternal Champions, Virtua Fighter 6 and Next Gen Fighters Mega Mix all with playable Segata Sanshiro Day 1 Not behind any DLC or Preorder stuff behind that Iconic Man!

[list]
[*]The base game only has 16 Characters.

[*]Multiple Season Pass
	*They didn't even include the thematic stages of the dlc characters.

[*]In-game currency (Fight Money) is bad
	*I've played many f2p games with in-game currency to unlock things that are more generous than this game.

[*]In-game currency was nerfed after the Arcade Edition was released
	*They removed a lot of ways to get Fight Money.

[*]Skins that you unlock by In-game currency will only have 2 colors instead of 10. 
	*You can unlock more colors to your skins by completing survival mode using the specific character with the new skin. 
         Unfortunately, even if you already cleared the mode with the specific character you will still have to finish the mode 
         every single time you unlock a new skin for that character.

[*]Single player rewards are non-existent
	*You cannot get Fight Money in any of the single player modes.
	*The Arcade mode doesn't even have a proper animation when transitioning to a new country unlike the previous 
          games.
	
[*]Heavy File Size every update
	*Whether it's a minor update like adding new cosmetics or a major update, it will require you to download 2gb and up. 
          Some say it's because of the game engine.

[*]UI is still bad
	*I was expecting an overhaul in main menu's UI when Arcade Version was released, but they just changed the color to 
         gold.

[*]Ads style cosmetics and Ads in-game 
	*Yes, there are advertisements in the game. So far it's only SFV DLC ads, but expect to see real life ads soon if the 
          community accepts this ""feature"".
	*Enabled by default
	*I really do not support this.

95,Street Fighter V,47552286,english,"My mistake of buying the game is not reading the reviews throughly or I have no idea what the reviewers meant until I bought the game. I got tricked at buying the standard SFV at lower than usual price. Even though the price is cheap, I thought it couldn't be that bad since I still have to pay money. After playing the game for hours, I have only managed to get one unlockable character and realised that fight money (the in game currency used to buy new character) is very limited. Fight money is so hard to earn that non pro like me might probably unlock one or two more characters in a year. I have pressure spending my fight money and it stressed me out so much everytime I play a mission that requires me to use fight money.

If there are no other fighting games to compare prices and content with then it will be hard to rate SFV worth. I just bought KOFIV and it  put SFV to shame in charcter roster. Nowadays games took so much space on hardrive that people with lesser amounts of hardrive space have to choose their games wisely. Street fighter took a big amount of GB space and dissapoints me in giving me a feeling of having an incomplete game being stored in my hardrive. Every new pacth took more than 10 GB data of download and it's almost as long as downloading a new game.

My suggestion to all who haven't bought this game yet, check out other fighting games. There are lots of other and better options out there and you guys can easily look for reviews, ratings and suggestions of alternative fighting games that are out there. This will probably be the last time I bought Street Fighter series because I have lost trust in the direction the SFV team is going.

I'm leaving my original review below, but right now this is just a pathetic money grab.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It's hard to know what to think with SFV. By itself, SFV is a great fighting game with a good roster of characters, great visuals, and a good competitive scene. On the flipside, the mechanics are very dumbed down compared to SFIV and the roster is lacking many major characters from previous games (like Sagat and Blanka), while in terms of features the game has been sorely lacking since release. The fact that we had to wait so long to get a story mode was a slap in the face, and the lack of an arcade mode seems like some kind of sick joke.

On top of this, it seems like Capcom hasn't learned from their previous games and still continues their greedy, money grubbing practices by releasing a half finished game and releasing a ton of extra skins for real money that are unavailable with in-game currency and overpriced with real currency. It's a common theme with capcom, but I had hoped with the introduction of fight money that they would have stopped.

The online play is also pretty fun, but it lags quite a bit. It's often hard to find matches where people aren't lagging all over the place, which is very frustrating and makes it a lot less fun than it could be.

By itself, SFV is a good fighting game and I recommend it if you like street fighter. However, if you have to choose between this or a game like Guilty Gear or BlazBlue, I'd say go with the latter.",1489007128,1544837054,FALSE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.66E+16,2753,188,6383,0,6202,1578193870

11,Street Fighter V,47531884,english,"Although the gameplay is solid, the price of additional characters and stages on top of the base price of the game is absurd. Which ultimately kills the experience for me, as I recieved very little content upon the purchase of this game, and the fight money system is very poorly implemented, making for a tedious and long grind to unlock different characters.

My main gripe with the game however is that it has the business model of a free to play game, with the intial entry fee included, which makes the game very expensive if you intend to also buy additional characters, which I would reccomend due to the small initial roster size.

The gameplay itself is not bad, however it is not as technical as earlier entries in the series. Though by it's own merits it is very well rounded, however the game does suffer from balancing issues.

I personally felt dissapointed with this purchase as a long time street fighter fan, though if you have the money to spare then you may find some enjoyment out of this title.

--THE GOOD--
This is Street Fighter. A sequel to SFIV. SFIV revived the FGC hype, and about seven years later came this very rocky sequel.To begin. Personally, though i'm very noobish at street fighter and play casually until i ""get good"", i find the gameplay pretty fun. The skill floor between good and not-good players is insanely high, but not too noticable when you're plaaying casually unless you're fighting a noob-killer. Like any fighting game you pick up, you're going to have to practice a lot. This isn't a pick up and play game.You'll need to get used to excersizing your left-thumb. Minus some very strange desings, like Ken's banana hair and terrible fashion, the visuals are pretty nice in the game. Not too different from Street Fighter IV, except the paint looks more like thick globs of slime now. Which looks ... cool i guess? Arcade Edition has a much better single player experience than it's original launch edition, with traditional arcade modes from various SF titles, a training mode, and a survival mode. No matter what you think about Street Fighter, this version of the game stays true to some golden fighting game traditions, like endings after arcade runs. There are a ton of characters, unfortunately locked through pay-walls.Like I said, gameplay is nice. Even I don't fully understand it. I am not fully confortable with any character yet. Never have been, unfrotunately. I was always more of a tekken guy. There's a nice rock soundtrack to the game, sprinkled with some electronic vibes.

--THE BAD!--

Casual Player here. This here is one of those games that i really want to praise and really want to enjoy but Capcom is shitting on it every way they possibly can. I'm just going to say it. The way this game was released and the way its been updated it, it should have been  a free game. They released a game so barebones i could barely say it even had bones. It was an  empty hallway with so many places to build doors. The missing features that should have been in the game from the beginning were added to the game at an ADDITIONAL expense. I don't mind DLC packs, but a lot of whats DLC shouldn't be paid. Arcade Edition was what would have been an acceptable launch game. But no. Apparently now there are ads in game. No matter what support i'd like to give this game, Capcom keeps shitting on. I rarely leave Negative Reviews on games, EVER. Even when unsatisfied. But this game is a sad experience. I have a lot of friends who'd love to pay it, but don't like the DLC practices, and the net code. But putting Ads in the game that people have paid for is wrong. To get the expected experience from the game, you need to spend at least $80. And yet, you still get ads. They've broken this game. They can still fix it, but capcom treats street fighter like a cash cow. You don't treat a fully paid game like a F2P game. Unacceptable. The game barely even works with PS4 controllers. Screw this game. 
A lot of games are taking part in this stupid practice witth dlc. I unfortunately see it happening with Tekken 7. But Tekken 7 is LEAGUES better than this game.

Edit: After playing the game for a bit more, I don't feel the ads were as bad as they originally seemed. At least from a casual standpoint. They still are annoying and a bit off putting. But they aren't as obnoxious as they originally seemed and can somewhat beet looked over.
Though I still have reasons to praise the game, i can't look over the fact that every corner of the game screems ""GIVE ME MORE MONEY!"". However, though there are many other favorites, Street Fighter is probably the most iconic fighting game out there, despite not being the top selling or everyone's favorite. This is a golden piece to the fighting game community. There's a lot to this game despite its paywalls. A lot of which should really be free. Remember when fighting games had unlockables? But like I said, there's still a lot to enjoy to this game. So I'm going to give this game an UP-VOTE. Though i know this is the wrong choice. I want to give hope to this game.",1544582623,1544792133,TRUE,0,0,0.501576006,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.66E+16,275,41,472,0,278,1591955138

The game launched with a small roster, watered down movelists for returning characters, a questionable art style, sporadic netcode, no arcade mode, and soon DLC everywhere from characters to stages. Not to mention the PC port recieved an update at one point that had a rootkey installed with the patch. After a couple seasons of DLC the game was 're-launched' with the Arcade Edition adding an arcade mode, actual cinematic story mode, UI facelift, new V-Triggers, and better optimization for the PC port. This is when I started to actually enjoy SFV. 

I played the game when Juri first arrived but with how slow and clunky the game felt not to mention the poor optimization affecting my performance, I didn't stick around. But with the Arcade Edition update the game felt a little faster and ran much better. But there were still some problems I wasn't happy with. Mainly the DLC. In SFV you would earn ""Fight Money"" from completing trials or winning matches online (Casual and Ranked matches only) which you could spend on new characters or stages. Now on paper this sounds great, being able to purchase DLC characters without spending a cent, but with how little Fight Money you gain it hardly matters. With each update Capcom would slowly cut down on how much Fight Money the player could gain just so you would feel pressured to spend real money on their content.

Now this is where the game has truly hit rock bottom and the reason why I'm writing this review. On December 12th 2018 Capcom patched the game with the inclusion of in-game ads. These ads appear during loading screens, stage backgrounds, and on character models. This of course sounds absolutely ridiculous for a retail game to have especially post-launch. Now you can turn the ads off thankfully but leaving all the ads on rewards you with an extra 12 Fight Money for each match you win. For leaving these ugly looking ads on you gain 12 extra Fight Money per win. Only 12. That is pathetic. To make matters worse Capcom is reducing the Fight Money you gain from current missions. Before you could attempt missions 3 times each week to gain Fight Money rewards but now it is being cut down to only 1 attempt. Yet another attempt by Capcom to pressure you into paying real money for DLC. 

So to sum it up, Street Fighter V has everything that makes modern and mobile games garbage. Lootboxes, ads, gutted content to sell you as DLC later down the line. It has all the makings of a F2P game except you have to pay for it. Capcom used to make some of the best games in the industry but lately all they seem to care about now is how to make a quick buck for the smallest amount of effort. Capcom doesn't care about it's fanbase, all they care about is their wallets. Do not support this greedy company. They are not the same company from your childhood anymore.

This game is more approachable and with far nicer graphics and artwork than SF IV.  All in all, a fun game to play and spend time with.

The issue I have is that I'm subjected to in game advertising, before every single arcade match.  This is intolerable for a non free to play game.  Most of the charactors, which came with the game in SF II, are locked behind a pay wall here.  I'm struggling to warrant that kind of expecditure, even with current sale prices.  There are some really poor business practices going on here.

50,Street Fighter V,47468943,english,"Right, so, it's been a minute since I've written a review, but I usually only do so cause I feel something REALLY needs to be said about a game. Now, show of hands, who all thinks 30 gigabytes for a fighting game is an acceptable use of your hard drive space? Well, know that 19 of those gigabytes came in the form of a massive update today, December 11th. Was it for a massive influx of new characters that triple the cast? An updated story mode to include characters beyond the season 1 and season 2 content? New stages and costumes, alternate boss fight arcade routes? A massive pudding vat for the female characters to wrestle around in? If you guessed yes to any of these, well....just know that it's December, the season for disappointments. Best as I can tell, Capcom in their infinite wisdom thought players were starving for ads in their f*cking fighting game. Yeah, 19 gigabytes, to put Capcom Pro Tour emblems on Ryu or Sagat's belts. Because homeless drifting warriors would ABSOLUTELY be interested in shilling for EVO. Sit there and let that sink in a moment. Nearly 2/3rds of the hard drive space this FIGHTING game takes up, is devoted to ads. Ads for services such as stages, characters, alternate outfits, etc. Basically stuff players all around the world actively work towards purchasing of their own accord, without the need for ads. As if they somehow overlooked that crap, or something. Advertising for your game inside your own game, folks. This is what corporate desperation and insecurity looks like. Not only is this update intrusive as hell, but it's freaking redundant and needless. Supposedly it allows players to get bonus fight money. I don't know for sure, as the server is still trying to recover itself after that massive update, so I haven't been able to test it out. So maybe you get to walk away from victories in Ranked/Casual with a little more than pocket change and dryer lint. Was that worth 2/3rds of a fighting game? These also come in the form of pre-fight video advertisements as well, as if just the walking billboards weren't cancerous enough. You can disable ads altogether....but then you don't get any fight money, at all. If you want access to ANY of the bonus content, they're brazenly holding it hostage behind a paywall. Not that their previous system was much better, I wound up getting all the cast from money out of my own pocket.

As for the game itself, I consider it pretty solid. It takes a lot of diligence and dedication to really learn how any one particular character plays, though it's very inviting to newcomers. Easy to pick up, pretty hard to master. None of that matters though, unless your hard drive is rocking 4+ terrabytes. This is such an intelligence failure of epic proportions. Regardless of my history of triumphant victories and crushing defeats in this game, there's no way I can give this game a glowing recommendation in good conscience. Capcom has overstepped themselves, and I think they need to pay for their greed. If you're reading this and considering purchasing it, don't. Tekken 7's vastly more affordable, and Soul Calibur 6 features girls with destructible clothes and Witchers.

I hate that the day I write a review for a game I've spent over a hundred hours playing, I can't even give it a thumbs up. Was this worth your customer loyalty, Crapcom? This is just unsightly. May you one day grovel at Sagat's bare feet for lunch money.

EDIT: For those of you reading that already do have SFV and are yelling through the screen that it takes up a different amount of space, relax. I checked the specs on my system, and Steam says SF5 occupies just under 30 gigs on my system. Some variables may be at play here, such as not having story mode installed, or the fact that arcade edition is built a little differently from the initial release copy. Doesn't make the 19 gig patch any less egregious, or the actual new content any less small-minded. I'm aware also that a big chunk of this update was also devoted to making costume/stage packages. Costumes and stages which were already individually purchasable in the in-game store. So, more redendancies in this massive update that did not add anything new, yet STILL has to take up more than half the previous hard drive space.Also too, I made a mistake in regards to the fight money, you do still earn it at the end of ranked/casual matches upon victory, you just miss out on the shill bonuses if you turn the ads off. Fighting games have gotten agressively anti-consumer, and I'm not gonna turn my rating around till Capcom pulls their heads out of their @sses.",1544560485,1544725604,FALSE,11,1,0.598239005,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.66E+16,538,13,15373,597,7133,1602057067

84,Street Fighter V,47466632,english,"Capcom is lousy about hiding characters behind DLC. Takes forever to unlock anything in game, so you're better off spending the money for DLC if there is something you like. It's basically a free-to-play model that's not free-to-play.

They are getting better about including some form of a story and character development, which is nice, but it's still quite shallow if you're only interested in the single-player experience. Seemingly anyone who just wants to play a multiplayer fighter would tell you they don't care about any of that - but, they might also tell you to go play other fighting games for sake of latency and techniques and not-DLCs too.

All we've really got here is another Capcom title with a great presentation and Capcom advertising. There's a game in there somewhere that can't outshine the sh*t Capcom has smeared all over it.

Oh yeah - forgot to mention - everytime the game updates, Steam downloads about 10-15GB of content each time - not that you'll actually see 10-15GB of content added to the game. I'm actually convinced they couldn't build a respectable patch solution for Steam and so the game just redownloads entire, large chunks of itself each time even with redundancy. Plus you sometimes have to download additional stuff with the in game patcher too (which goes into your AppData or Documents - the point is it doesn't go where you installed your game content and it can eat up your C:\ which is quite unfavorable in my case).

Due to that and my love for street fighter, I bought the game on PS4.

After dozens if not hundreds of hours on PS4, here's my gripes unrelated to the PC issues:

- You VERY slowly gain fight money. This makes characters/unlockables a huge grind fest. As someone who does not play 1 character and thats it, I was forced to either pay up for characters that should have been included, wait months on end to unlock the full roster, or quit. I opted for buying Dragonball FighterZ.
- Premium ads and freemium tactics have absolutely no place in a full priced game (and now tying fight money to it)
- Gameplay is sluggish
- A lot of characters feel samey minus special attacks (DBFZ has the same issue but the gameplay is a blast)
- Online multiplayer connections are spotty and disappointing
- Bugs and features are incredibly slow to update/implement but the dev team seems to be trying

Overall, it had potential. The devs are at the mercy of the overlords and they tried their best.

Bad performance online. 

Search videos on youtube about the netcode. Game must run at 60 fps at all times because if your computer can't keep constantly 60 fps the online game desyncronize and the players start appearing disappearing.

My computer is: | i5 2500k 3.3ghz | 16 GB Ram DDR3 1333 mhz | Nvidia GTX 980 | internet conection 30mb/s optical fiber.

And I can't keep the constant 60 fps online. (Most of the solutions that are posted online don't work)

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Story is downloadable as a Free DLC ""A Shadow Falls"" free DLC, 4 hours of boring cinematics with some battles in between that you can skip, nothing special about it.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Arcade Edition includes 

Season 1 ( Guile, Balrog, Alex, Ibuki, Juri, Urien)
Season 2 ( Akuma, Zeku, Kolin, Ed, Abigail, Menat)

Not included:
Season 3 ( Sagat, Blanka, Cody, G, Falke, Sakura)

Expect two more season passes that are not included.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Arcade: I suppose that is a work in progress because it have several Arcade modes, SF I, SF II, SF III, SF IV and SF V. There is no difference in between each version despite the characters that appear ( Honda is not in the game so it don't appear in SF II for example), the number of combats, and the endings: 1 comic screenshot for each character and each version of the arcade mode... so meh.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The game menus, cinematics, character selection screens are designed for e-sports events and have long stupid boring cinematics that can't be skipped, making the game slow and annoying.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Unlockables: The game have Fight Money, and with it you will be able to buy new characters, Arenas, Colours for the costumes. 

You can get Fight Money in single player doing the missions, trials, demonstrations and the story. But you will have to play online to earn enough fight money, so if you can't play online you will have not much to do with the game.

Capcom done goofed with this one. It's an unfinished product not worth the asking price.

EDIT

I decided to update my review, due to recent development around the title.
First of let me say, that the compaints I initially had have mostly been rectified with the Arcade Edtion. However, the game is an online service with season passes for character. Unlocking stuff through in-game earned currency is tedious to say the least. Worst part though, the season passes do not cover the stages, so if you bought Akuma and want to play on his stage, better get that money out or start grinding online.

That is not enough for Capcom though, as they now decided to put in-game ads (that's right ADS in a paid product) on character costumes, stage backgrounds and loading screens. You can turn them off, but supposedly you will get less or no in-game currency through awards.

The game, mechanics, graphics, sound and overall is not bad at all. The reason I don't recomend it? Fight money.
The moment you start the game, you'll see yourself trapped in a scheme to make you lose hundreds of hours to make some, SOME fight money, that's probably not enough to buy you half a char. Don't make the mistake I made (buy this game) and please, don't make the one greater than this one, that it is to BUY THE DLCs! Don't buy the chars, don't feed development studios or so your money, so you can get a fourth-grade unfinished piece of crap game. Want to play a great game instead, with a complete game where the DLCs gives you aesthetics bonus only? Play the antecessor of this one, Ultra Street Fighter 4. Mechanics, sound, chars top of the line, with no trap to sell your soul to Beelzebub for half a color of one of your costume of one of your char.

Update 1: After some hours playing the game (that again, by itself is not half bad), I decided it was time to try online. Just then I've realized: I'd prefer to sell my soul. Really, Beelzebub would have developed a better server, because why two players close to each other, connection power between them 4 out of 5, are only able to fight each other seeing a frame every seven seconds? ONE FRAME EACH SEVEN SECONDS!! HOW IS IT POSSIBLE TO PLAY LIKE THAT? Oh, and this is on the ranked matches, which also takes 3 to 4 minutes to find an opponent.

39,Street Fighter V,42184001,english,"Update: Tried to get on after the recent patch. The lag was so unbareable that I thought I was on dial-up playing through TCP/IP direct connection with Warcraft 2...And that was better. I tried Capcom. Again, if I was being paid by a sponsor to play this as a life, I might play it. At this point. USF4 is my go-to for SF. Keep in mind this may be related to where I'm at but I can assure that my fast connection and other games do not have these issues. Furthermore as they have reduced input lag, the more I play the game, I more I realize it's just not fun to me. Continue on for my core review of the title.


Based on my hours into this title, you could assume I really enjoy this game. As someone who was involved in the FGC (fighting game community) from my starting days in Super Street Fighter IV Arcade Edition, I stayed the course by playing SFV to continue the gameplay with friends who hopped to the new title and I had high hopes of my own. Many complaints were raised high with USF4 in terms of speific gameplay elements and the fact that they continued to update the title instead of releasing a new title which caused commotion for players to desire a new title with many new changes. However once SFV came out, it was plagued with release issues, in-complete packaging, and simplicity gameplay that is way too limited to one specific flowchart. Unfortunately some of these issues are still present but for the most part has been ironed out. I am really torn on this title.

On the one hand, I like the design style, goals and training mode depth. On the other hand, I am not enjoying the gameplay completely as I feel like the creativity is removed from this title with combos and move sets which nullifies the training mode in my opinion when everything feels confined. The only obvious difference is you play a different character, but everything from approach, shimmies, meaties, combos, and approach nearly stays the same among all characters. This is minorly debateable in some SMALL instances but otherwise, every character has too much of the same goal, except some characters do this WAY better. This game is about aggression so every character essentially continues to be patched to be just that other than Menat and maybe Sim even though his options compared to hers is abysmal for controlling range. It is really disappointing for me as I know what Street Fighter is from the start and I am OK with change and new direction. The problem is, I do not feel this title has any personality which in fighting games I believe usually have the potential to show this when two players go against each other with the same character. You can usually tell the difference. In this case, it is so bland that you can almost call the game as you see it happening. Just an opinion more or less.

I will recommend it for the sake that I think it is easier for anyone to start playing and get involved. But I cannot say that I really enjoy playing it. It can be hype to watch top players play as how they read situations can be interesting but that's about it. The game itself can be fun casually but for someone who was invested into the FGC, it is hard to stay true when the only fun I could see out of it is profitting with cash from winning a tournament. Otherwise there isn't really any hidden tech or way to improve that feels tangible. I'm in-between and not totally sold.  I'm trying not to use USF4 as a basis for review, but it is really hard that in the end you realize USF4 had pretty solid gameplay, the ability to expand your gameplay outside of one single flow chart of play, diversity and new things to learn daily.My problem with SFV is most of this is non-existent and some characters just not viable. Maybe in a tournament you see a character with pathetic tools end up placing high, but I believe some of this is one-time situations. Alex just being bad and that's too bad because I think he's amazing, Menat over Dhalsim starting to fade, Why play Ryu when you can play Guile or Akuma and do everything but 100% better and more, Abigail over Gief, Rashid over rush-down Ken, Cammy over Karin. Just some examples though I am sure someone would disagree pretty quickly. I'm not trying to be super precise other than to be honest that most of these characters have the same style and the prior does everything better. To me, it makes zero sense. The biggest glaring part of this is that this game was made with online play/tournament scene in mind as its priority. Not casually. So when you fail to meet a sense of balance even then, that's a problem in my opinion.

I know people who really enjoy the easier execution and the game because it foreces you to be aggressive. I get it and I'm not trying to argue the benefit of that. But essentially, you are happy that everyone gets to play the same because maybe it works better for you. I'd rather lose and have a more diverse, amazing match where new tech and new things show each and everytime. It's exciting and makes for something amazing to spectate. This is just not it. And playing it feels just as lack luster in my opinion.

I'm sorry. I cannot recommend it at this point and that's disappointing because I want it to succeed. I really do. And I'm sure it is with all the money being thrown at it with the Pro Tour and such.

I got this game on sale, and still honestly feel ripped off. With the base version of the game, the majority of the the content is hidden behind a pay wall. Including most importantly the characters, I would be fine if it was just cosmetics, but over half the cast is inaccessible (don't even get me started on the stages, music, cosmetics etc). Was genuinely shocked to discover that Capcom's reaction to people's frustration with how slow in game currency was earnt at release, was to cut income even further! now the only way to get fight money (the in game currency), is through levelling up, or from online matches. The online matches give you 50 fight money for a win, for context to unlock a character is 100,000......yeah (new stages are 70,000, costumes are 40,000). That should tell you everything about the game's economy you need to know.

I have loved street fighter since I first played SF2 in the arcades.But what capcom did with SF5 has really soured my view of any future involvement with the series.

The servers are garbage. Matchmaking pretty much doesn't happen. The ""story"" mode feels like a $1.99 mobile game, not a finished product in a AAA franchise. I've had random slowdowns despite having a powerful PC, and have had to change the graphical settings to ""low"" just to get a consistent framerate (at which point, SFIV looks waayyyy better). The actual mechanics of the game seem wonderful, but I can't tell yet because I can't play against anyone but a lousy AI with no difficulty adjustments.

Capcom, why on Earth did you release this game in its current state? It seems, to me, like I accidentally downloaded a beta version, but I swear I spent a full $60 on it.

Pros
- Alot of Singleplayer content
- Good sized Roster of 28 characters in the arcade version (as of season 3, 2018)
- Many old and new characters that are really likeable/fun
- If you like watching it then there is a very high chance you will like playing it
-  Might be intimidating at first but incredibly satisfying to master
- Slower paced means neutral game is a larger factor than other fighting games (except Tekken)
- DLC characters can be bought with in game currency which isnt hard to get if you just play the story modes and leveling up

Cons
- Netcode is inconsistent but is more than playable for the most part as long as you set connection limits high
- Balance is decent but could be better

54,Street Fighter V,47006981,english,"This game is great if you wanna ease your way into fighting games in general. It has lots of tools that help you better understand the mechanics and helps you feel like youre improving and learning something rather than bashing youre head against a wall trying to figure out how you did the thing. 

However when it comes to the PVP experience with online play, it leaves alot to be desired. Fights can lag horribly even when you and youre opponent have great connections, finding an online lobby can be a pain as most that pop up are from people probably way out youre league if youre starting and those in youre range tend to have a poor connections. I will say that when it works its great and feels hella rewarding to see yourself rise from the ranks when you know what youre doing but the other times it leaves you frustrated and picking up bad habits that dont translate well at all when you play against someone who isnt laggy. 

There is another gripe I have with the game and that is it's seasons. Characters are behind these season passes and can be earned either through buying the pass or earning in-game currency. Getting the currency when youre new is easy but after awhile it start to become a slow grind. I would reccommend buying this game when its on sale so you can get the game as well as the other season passes. If you just plan on playing with the base set of characters I would still reccomend waiting till it goes on sale as even without online the single player is rather lack luster and just feels like any other fighting game with a arcade mode.

This is not to say the game doesn't have areas it can still improve on (netcode, for instance), but it's a much more polished and complete experience now. 

While there are microtransations (this is Capcom we are talking about, after all...) you can get all the additional important bits likes new characters and most new stages with the in game currency Fight Money. I don't play that much myself but still managed to buy all season 1 DLC characters plus a couple of costumes and stages all with Fight Money.

just a tip for beginners. don't play casual games. play rank games.
your opponents will be much easier in rank games (rookie to gold) than casual games.

i know many people says Capcom is money hungry, but think about this.
You can basically buy the DLC characters through in-game money. what other fighting game does that? Tekken? Blazeblue? Dragonball Fighterz? not a single game allows you to buy DLC characters through in-game money.
SFV even gives you free DLC costumes through weekly mission, and many times they are better than the DLC costumes you can buy with your real money.
and have you ever compared the SFV costumes with other game DLC costumes?
i think i made a point that SFV is not a non-sense rip-off game.

lets face it. fighting game is a genre that of an old era. they need your support to keep going on.

Sure you can unlock most of them as you play given is DLC anyways, but many modes gives you in-game currency only once (And found out the main Story mode doesn't at all anymore) leaving you to the grind as you keep playing. When previous entries gave you easy access to its content beating arcade and no much else, SFV expects you to either aim for winning streaks and the few valuable missions, or simply throw your wallet at them. Without any of its DLC or unlockables, this is a very bland fighting game when many others have a big character and stage roster from the start.

However, while still giving it a bad score due its terrible direction in content that continues to this day  (And to be fair a very weak and flawed story even for the genre's standards), is far from a bad gameplay experience. It has a much of a good feeling as previous games, with new mechanics implemented to give characters more uniqueness.  Solid graphics, various modes, and obviously online play.

I don't recommend the game if you expect a fighting game with the average content from the start given the game was released if almost nothing and kept most of it under a price tag and a grind system.

The game is accessible but still deep and mechanically sound, nothing to the levels of SF4, however. If i'm not mistaken there are no 1-frame links in SF5, which means most people can do some damaging combos with the right amount of time and effort. [b]Which is something fighting games require but most people don't want to put in.[/b]
At 80 hours in you will will have passed the tutorial. That is, you'll know all of the gameplay mechanics and most characters' moves and fighting style. You will be able to do some combos with your main and still hold your ground during most online matches.

That's my main gripe with people giving it negative reviews, and everytime I look at the playtime the person has at best around 50 hours of gameplay; that's only scratching the surface of the game.

Yes, Capcom did a dishonest move when they removed the FM (the game's currency used to buy stuff) bonus when you completed the singleplayer modes, leaving only the XP reward for the character used, and reduced the FM rewards for online matches and weekly challenges: 50 FM for each victory in ranked matches? Come the fuck on Capcom!
[b]Don't be scared, however, as you can still unlock Season 3 characters without buying the Season Pass[/b]. If you purchase the Arcade Edition (which includes Season 1 and 2 characters) you can earn the XP rewards from the singleplayer modes and level them up to earn FM; every level yields a 1000 FM reward and there guides ou there listing every mode that grants XP for characters used.

Or you can do what I did and buy the Season 3 Pass and use the FM earned to purchase extra stages.

The online is pretty shitty sometimes, but it's hard to pinpoint if that's the game's fault or the fact that most opponents I face are from South America. I honestly don't know. Sometimes it looks as if the connection bars are there just for show because a person with five bars will lag just as much as one with two bars.

Every negative review this game has received is deserved. The launch was a disaster (not enough content, poor communication and tons of issues), the first year of DLC was nothing but delays, excuses and frustration and, as icing on the cake, Capcom installed rootkits on to everyone's machines as DRM.

All that said, I'm leaving a tepid positive because (after 3 years), the game finally has enough content to be considered a full package and I haven't had to pay a dime for any of it (free modes, free characters if you play through the game's content) and the game itself is... okay. For a Street Fighter game, it's still disappointing but it's made significant strides since launch and I (and most) have way higher expectations for a Street Fighter game than pretty much any other fighting game series. Street Fighter II is the pinnacle of the genre, Street Fighter III is beloved among a certain segment of the community and Street Fighter IV was a successful reinvention of the series. This game simply doesn't stack up to those. 

That said, I'd still rather play SF5 than almost any other current, active game out there.

47,Street Fighter V,45553957,english,"Played this game on and off with friends until late 2017 when I bought it. Arcade Edition came out and I've never had this much fun with learning a fighting game before. But it's not all sunshine and pixies. Here's the meat of it:

Pros:
+ One of the most user friendly fighting games to get into (decent tutorials, great training mode, relatively simple input system)
+ Good array of single player & online features to keep you entertained when not playing with friends or foes (though it wasn't always this way)
+ It's everything you'd want in a Street Fighter game. You fight people and throw fireballs n' all that wacky jazz
+ Clean presentation, UI design, and great looking stages/characters (mostly)


Cons:
- Physics engine is all over the places sometimes (i.e. Necalli's hair)
- Poorly optimized, runs like bleh on anything that isn't a beefed up mega machine PC (though you can lower graphics settings to offset this a bit)
- Cost of getting everything & Fight Money. It's gonna take a chunk of change to get all the newest characters alongside the game itself. Or you could use the in-game obtainable Fight Money! (if the characters weren't so costly maybe...)
- Took two years for the game to finally feel like a finished product (Pour one out to the casual audience that paid $60 for a glorified beta in 2016)
- Small gripe, cinematic story doesn't come pre-packaged, has to be downloaded manually (and it ain't tiny either buddy)

It's not perfect. It's far from that, but I can safely say that in 2018, SFV is worth it. I've sunk over 400 hours in to it between my setup and at friends' houses.

57,Street Fighter V,45497972,english,"OK so there a lot of mixed reviews on this game, so I'll try to clear it up for you.

The pros of the game. It is really fun. The fact you can play with a friend in couch co-op is great and the combat is way cleaner than I expected. The characters you get are different in their attacks to a high degree and I could play with friends for a substantial amount of time.

There are cons are however. I'll start with some features that I don't use excessively. The online features. The matchmaking takes a while. It's not ridiculous, but if you're not patient then you'll get annoyed quickly. Something that really irritates me is something everyone uses. New characters. You start with 16, and there's loads you can unlock, so variety is good. But to buy these characters it costs 100,000 fight coins each. It takes forever to earn this. You only earn 50 for online fights, and 1000 for doing 10 character trials. You can earn about 8000 from completing them, so finishing the base ones (16 stories) will get you enough for 1 character. So it takes way too long to get characters, unless you buy in with legit money.

So my verdict, which you've probably skipped to. If you want to a game to play with friends at your house then this game is great. And it's good if you're willing to grind the crap out of it. However, if you're want a game to play online or you want characters but don't want to grind or to pay in, probably not the game for you.",1540813082,1540813082,TRUE,1,0,0.523809552,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.66E+16,24,2,841,9,487,1601053431

62,Street Fighter V,45485701,english,"After a few hours of gameplay, I have to join the crowd of angry players. 
Although the game is enjoyable, it becomes quickly appearant that what you're buying is an incomplete game, and that most features requiring fight money are made to encourage you to use real life money as you make very little money from in game activites. 
I cannot stress this enough : There is not enough fight money to be gained after you reach a certain level to buy everything. 

The events actually requires you to pay fight money to participate, and you must pay to try again if you loose the battle. 
At 7 hours in, I'm already feeling frustrated by the experience, and I'm wondering if I should not just give up now, because I have no desire to pay for the season pass and give more money to this terrible system. What is baffling is that you gain MORE money by doing combo training than actually playing the game. One of thing to note, also, is that most reward are one time only (per character). Meaning if you complete the easy survival mode once with R.Mika, you won't get the reward if you complete it again with her.

The actual consequence of this system is that you'll always play what's rewarding the most, not what you actually want to play. Meaning this game feels like going to work. You're grinding over and over activities you're not necessarily enjoying.

Another frustrating aspect is that by playing, you unlock the possibility to unlock stuff. You read right. For example, by gaining level with a character, I unlock the ability to buy color swap (at a horrendous price by the way). What was unlocked was not the actual color swap, but the ability to purchase it.

This game is even more baffling since I reinstalled SFIV arcade edition for comparison.
After installing the game, I had everything. All characters, all stages, but playing actually rewarded me with additional features, like taunts and such. 

Obviously, microtransactions are ruining the world of fighting game, because it now widely accepted to pay a hundred dollar for a full game. But SFV is charging you for a fullgame price, while working as a freemium game. 

The market is overcrowded with excellent fighters these days so... As sad I am to say this, SFV is the game to skip. Let's hope they'll learn the lesson for SFVI.

29,Street Fighter V,39906988,english,"First of all, I must say that I enjoyed USF4. I gave it a positive review, though there were some balance problems, I did not mind that much.

However, Street Fighter 5 Arcade Edition brings the phrase ''horrible balance issues'' to a completely new level.

I bought the Deluxe edition and then the Season 3 pass.

Basically, if you are missing an eye, a leg and an arm, you can still pick Ryu/Ken/Akuma/Sakura/ ''Insert shoto name here'', and still whip the asses of people who are playing as other characters.

It's completely ridiculous how biased this games is, when it comes to certain characters, who can do ABSOLUTELY ANYTHING and do a great deal of damage as well.

It's completely out of this world that even though you've invested a certain amout of time to learn about your character and level it up, and you've succeded in reaching the golden league - you then get paired with players way below your level.
And strangely enough, somehow, by doing two-three of the same moves or combos (which when engaged, cannot be stopped) they get you cornered, and while jumping up and down, they disable your blocking and stop you from standing up, and finally - beat the s***t out of you. Because - Who needs a reversal that actually works when you need it to work?!

So, if you want a fighting game with a great roster, excellent character balance, numerous options of gameplay, ways to break combos, and have fun both online and offline without having to study every freakin' frame and do the math, then I suggest you play Mortal Kombat or Injustice.

I love Street Fighter, but it's become just too infuriating to tolerate the numerous inconsistencies. It is way too difficult to get any kind of idea of what is blockable, what is unblockable, what is punishable, and what is unpunishable.

Update, September 2018:
- The game is still full of borken characters, with broken moves
- The matchmaking is horrible (You get paired up with players from leages way higher than your own)
- The prices of costumes, stages and DLC's are too high, while there is basically almost zero chance to earn enough fight money (in-game currency) to actually purchase any additional content.",1518006016,1538499393,FALSE,5,0,0.442225277,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.66E+16,72,17,16741,0,14306,1596204131

and also the arcade mode and story modes are pretty lame.

except those, the gameplay, design, graffic are not bad in a way.
I think it is pretty good to try if you are a fighting game fan.

34,Street Fighter V,22889598,english,"Updating whole review for 9/30/18

Base game has more stuff for the single player now but it's just as garbage as always. AI goes from walking into all of your buttons to reading your jumps to DP you as you take off in the span of like 2 AI levels.

Netcode is still garbage and I don't know if Capcom is unable to completely change it to fix everything or just unwilling. Tons of online players rewinding all over the place making the fight essentially not worth playing. A lot of the laggy people like to use people with invincible DPs because randomly throwing them out in the midst of lag works well.

Top tier is currently zoners with great normals (Menat/Guile/Urien?) or characters with massive amounts of pressure and ability to get in (Cammy/Akuma/Bison/Ibuki/Abigail). Arguably mid tier is enough to win even Capcom Premiers but if you watch them you'll likely see mostly the characters I named in top 8.

Capcom desperately wants you to spend real money. Characters cost 100k fight money and stages cost 70k while you get 50 per win. Your main source of income is leveling a character (1k per level) so it's likely you'll just want to spend money for at least half of characters per season. Most costumes are not available for anything except real money (like $4-$6) while characters themselves will also run you $4 iirc. One of the biggest robberies is costume colors which cost several thousand fight money.

Gameplay is still solid as ever but many people dislike the fact that defense is very weak which allows for ""robbery characters"" to use their vtrigger after getting beat on to make a comeback and steal the round. Between this fact and the awful netcode that will likely never change you will undoubtedly get upset at this game at some point so if you have anger issues with games you should just avoid it. 

All in all I would say the game is probably worth like $30-$40 dollars if that included all the characters maybe. Ideally you have local tournys or friends to play with IRL because online often sucks. Season pass doesn't give you EVERYTHING from the season (like costumes) so you may want to just buy individual characters and costumes as they interest you.",1462849335,1538345877,FALSE,47,7,0.533335567,12,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.66E+16,89,5,43261,0,29791,1598990380

Serious, though. Under the surface its a pretty decent game. I like the encouragement of offensive play as opposed to the overly footsy style of Street Fighter IV. This means comebacks are more of an occurrence and you always have to be playing your best. 

The character design is as usual terrible and stupid but by now you'll be used to that if you like Street Fighter.

My main issue is the business model. The money you have to spend to get every piece of content is disgraceful. A background stage is £3.19 individually. This also isn't included in the Season Pass. The saddest thing is that if all this content was free (as it should be) then I'd be touting this as the best Street Fighter (and fighting game) I've played.

Casual gamer? no worries, plenty of solo player content, but gets repetitive after a while.
now on to the pros and cons,

pros:
-great community
-a pretty decent character roster
-is a complete game after being in beta for 2 years

cons:
-rubbish connection for online play (shows a 5 bar connection, opponents are laggy as hell)
-pay to play (DLC has only 6 characters per season, and little to no extra content, waste of money unless on sale)
-if you dont want to pay, earning FM (in-game currency) takes too much grinding, not recommended at all
-repetitive, after a while it might feel like a chore to even start up the game
-arcade mode might have been on the Pro-side if it was gave more rewards, but merely a 'arcade' that gives a high score and some extra artworks, but that's about it

My overall verdict?
Whilst it is fun to play with friends, generally average game that is not worth the money unless it goes on sale. The connection issue, which has plagued Capcom's Street Fighter games since SF4 days carried over, making overall gameplay not smooth and very fustrating, especially online.
Beware of having constant disconnection issues and having to pay to play EVERYONE.

Second, you must know you are not buying the full product, even if you purchase the add-on season passes. You will eventually have to buy or grind for more characters. Alternate costumes and even alternate colors are often locked behind a pay-wall and cannot be obtained even with the in game ""fight money"" currency.

Speaking of fight money; you can earn this in game by doing various activites, but it is very limited. Expect to run out of standard methods of earning fight money fairly quickly. Sure, you can get a few characters with fight money, but that'll soon dry up and you'll be left with two options: pony up more cash or do without the characters. Like I said, you are not purchasing the full game, especially with more characters to be released (for cash) in the future.

Now, it is a good Street Fighter game, and for that it's enjoyable.

-
This time around I mean to talk about the game faults as it what was proposed to the players, especially those like me, lovers of the franchise from a very long time, but still play only casually for a lot of reasons: not having enough time to dedicate yourself to it, be it being bad despite training like hell or simply like the game, but has no intention of being extremely competitive.

So, let's start with what we've heard when SFV was to be released. Ono-san had given an interview where he talked about how he wished to spread wider the SF community and player base because in it's final very long years, SFIV saw only an increasingly decline of tournment entrants, base and casual players and low level players without being able to get better no matter how much they tried/trained. In the mean time, pro players got only better and the tournments only saw the same faces and same champions with very little variation and there weren't almost no surprises about who were to be top8 of an event or even win some premier. It were always the same ones, and besides the skill of the players were only bottlenecking like a pyramid, so Ono wanted to change that by making an easier game in which new players could be good, or at least feel like they're good by being able to execute a nice looking combo - in other words - look good even when losing.

To close that gap, he said the game were to be aimed at a new and casual audience and it's system would allow both pro and casual players to have fun alike, while not having a very large disparity in skill needed to play it and look good while doing so, either winning or losing.

What got stucked in my mind was the word casual. SFV was aiming to the casual audience, very different from the previous SF games, also what would be different was that Capcom announced they'd support the game through out the years, instead of releasing different versions of the same game with more characters and some balance changes - that part also got stucked into my mind.

So, I thought to myself, this game has everything to be the best of the franchise, or at the very least, one of the best. I thought they'd release the whole game, the complete package, with if not all, most of the characters intented to be in it, besides, they'd work on it for years,  making balance changes, adding new offline content - since it was, foremost, supposed to be a casual game for casual people - like new modes of game besides the arcade and vs we were so accostumed, following the line of MK and Tekken 7, a new story mode, and since we will never be able to escape anymore, cosmetic dlc's, too. I was fairly excited, even when I saw the price for the full game, VERY expensive - but I thought to myself again, at least we'll have all that stuff to play: new modes, new characters and the already beloved ones, couldn't care less about online, but it might be an interesting experience, who knows? It's expansive, but it'll have tons of things to do, so it must be an worthwhile investiment.

I was relieved to know that the zeni wouldn't be in the game, the only ""currency"" in game would be fight money, no real money involved, but then...

Then it came.

What should I say, no amount of words will ever be enough to transcribe my feelings when the game was released. To my surprise, there was even season pass and nothing of the likes was mentioned before, worst still, the season pass would cover only some of the characters and two respectives costumes. No arcade, no vs against cpu, a repetitive and boring survival mode that tested only our patience, horrible online support and 16 characters and even fewer stages with very, very little creativity to the point that the beta version seemed much better than the official released game.

Who would've thought that when it was announced support through out the years they meant some few characters and even fewer stages per ""season""? That the cosmetic dlcs were only obtainable with real money because they weren't even able to clarify what the season pass would be about? That the amount of FM we gained playing online was ridiculous and it'd never allow us - casual players - to buy what little we were able to buy with it. At least the single mode story for each character gave us some relatively decent amount and if we were a bunch of masochists, we could earn it harvesting and grinding hard the terrible survival mode? By the way, I found out I was quite the maso when I looked the hours I spent playing this mode and it seriously amounted to more than 500h.

I spent more than half of hours I have with this game in this terrible mode, what a huge maso I turned out to be and I didn't even know it, big thanks capcom!

As if turning out to be a huge maso wasn't quite the surprise, paying full and quite expansive price for much less than a finished game, it had so few content that one'd discover themselves to be big M's - like me - or they'd simply put the game away and spent their time with something else - the logical and smarter ones. The quantity of free content or content that we could buy with hard earned FM was so little, but what we could buy with real money were a lot more and expensive, the game also came with input lag.

So let's just flashforward some years since capcom have a history of ""making it right"" from the third one or so, then all we had to do was wait. So we waited, three years. Now the casual game that wouldn't receive any other name because it'd be supported for some time in it's core received the Arcade Edtion title, as you can imagine, finally, after three years, the game included an arcade mode, but also a few others called extra battles. All the wait was worth it, all the horrible balance patches, the undesired new dlc characters, the worse than terrible netcode, the maso discovery, the bad written sngle story for each character, the joke of a general story mode where you go from Brazil to England by motorbike with three people, being one inconscient, the very bad and inconsistent models, banana hairs, bugged hairs and objects - nevermind any of those - we now have an arcade mode with some extra battles and the barrils stage bonus is back.

All is good with the word.

Everything is just right and beautiful now, even if the story and survival mode don't reward you with FM anymore, even if each season pass costs as much as a full game, and if you prefer to buy the characters or stages with FM you better have finished all survival mode and story mode in all difficulties with all the characters avaiable without spending any of it in buying new titles, perfis or godforbid, dlc characters or new colors, that not only are locked, but once unlocked you must buy them to really have'em, even if a single dlc costume is only purchaseable with real money and it's not cheap, we now have an arcade mode that, for some reason, don't reward you with anything but some bad drawings as an ending and some okayish extra art that can be viewed at the gallery that the game now has, or simply googling it. Even if the new extra battles charge FM for participating in some sketchy fight with enhanced difficulty and psychic AI that is almost impossible to an average player to beat - and that, along with weekly challenges - are now the only way of getting FM without grinding online so the character can level up and so earn 1k FM for level - need I note that one dlc character costs 100k FM and the stages go from 40k to 70k and some colors are 20k and a victory in online ranked or casual is rewarded by 50 FM?

-Easy to pick up
- Learn most characters simple BnB's/Basics/Anti-Airs  with in the span of an hour
-Cross Play between PS4/PC
-Capcom Pro Tour active tournament scene if you're someone who likes to watch/study the game often
-Plenty of offline content compared to the initial  launch (Arcade Mode,Story Mode,Survival,Extra Battle,Etc)
-Nice roster that is only growing with more updates. 
-Training Mode is among the best from most current fighting games considering the amount of options it gives you, So you can get the most efficient practice in.
-Things can be purchased with in game currency(Fight Money)  however this is also a con and I'll explain why in the cons section.

Cons
-Netcode can be terrible at times especially when it's PC vs PS4. The rollback can be really deceiving at times what hits on your screen results in you getting hit and possibly even death. This is crucial for someone that is trying to hit confirm as it throws your whole game off. When you queue  up for online matches and specifically ask for 5 bar connections it can be really hit or miss, it either starts off really good and gets progressively worse over time or it's just bad from the start despite it being a 5 bar connection which on paper SHOULD be good.
- Remember mentioning how things can be purchased with in game currency? Well good luck with that as Capcom has lowered the amount of Fight Money (FM) you can get from in game tasks, The weekly missions/extra battle missions even give less FM than pre-AE or give non at all and instead reward you with a cross over costume with in the span of a few weeks note extra battle missions require a participation fee to enter which results in fight money being drained. In the end you will have to spend REAL money to purchase most characters/stages/costumes and trust me there are a ton of costumes. Keep in mind these are all optional and don't affect how you play the game if all you want to do is play the game/play online.
- Bad optimization for the most part,random frame rate dips even on the best PC builds runs pretty well for the most part however. :) 
- Input lag is a thing however it's been addressed somewhat going from 8-ish frames to about 6-4 frames iirc.

Overall as someone rather new to fighting games SFV is great for it's accessibility although some might say otherwise. I am only a Platinum rank but the fact that I was able to learn my characters basics within the span of a few hours/days and then just focus on solely improving is a huge thumbs up in my book. While the online can be hit or miss most of us know what we signed up for when we decide to play online. DLC can be real excessive sure but it's all completely optional if you're someone who just wants to play and improve it shouldn't affect you. Last but not least if you're on the fence about buying this game at the moment despite it being relatively cheap wait for a big tournament to happen the lowest I've seen this go for the base game is $10 but might as well complete the package so you can try every character that's out and see what character clicks the most to you :)",1536403779,1536403779,TRUE,10,0,0.611032546,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.66E+16,14,1,5999,0,5370,1589508076

87,Street Fighter V,44325431,english,"Unworthy of the SF Legacy.
The game economy of SFV has already gained a reputation as being one of the worst in game economies since launch. It was feature incomplete, and while we got an arcade mode with the same shoddy AI we've seen in every SF game since the original two years later, it came with another blow to the in game economy, slowing currency gains for all players further. They tell you you can unlock the stuff for free. Pick 3 characters. That's about all you're going to get.

Beyond the economy, the actual fighter's mechanics are lacking. Crush counter was devised as a solution to the jab spam seen in SFIV, but is a cure worse than the disease. Specific characters benefit from fishing for CCs, while everyone else will be unlikely to get one while setting up for them or even have their combo dropped because they got one at random. The almighty Tier List rules the game, and you either main a top 10 fighter or regret buying this. Professionals gave up the mains they played for decades because the balance gap was so wide. To make matters worse, Capcom somehow makes the Game as a Service design work against them, as their balance patches often exacerbate existing problems and leave the community guessing as to the motivations of their dev team. (Cammy buffs, anyone?)

And to PC players, Online is about the only time you will ever fight other people. It is the closest you will get to the old 90s arcade experience, owing largely to the shoddy AI systems that populate ""Arcade"" mode. It's still a pretty damn far cry though. Online play is perpetually laggy even for users on wired connections. This would be manageable if players didn't actively attempt to exploit this by creating an entirely new metagame for online, with characters that either use downback or 50/50 spam at the forefront. The Connection Filter should theoretically allow you to filter them. It doesn't. Players will register as having a perfectly fine connection, but still teleport halfway across your screen, while others will run smoothly but register as laggy according to the filter.

Look, okay. People don't like this game. It's made by Capcom, it has lootboxes (that cant be bought for real money, as of August) if you want all the characters you'll have to drop a lot of currency and yes, you will even then have to grind for all the stages.

I've loved previous entries in the Street Fighter series, including it's predecessor USF4 but hate everything about the priority system, the stiff, rigid, repetitive combos, the LP/K into everything gets dull as ditch water, fights are more likely to be finished on a LP/K than a spectacular super. It lags and has framerate issues online and offline, the loading intro/outro screens take forever, the ranked system is stupid with many people stuck down in Super Bronze so long they're practically gods at the game at this point. 

It makes no sense for people to have a high player level, character level 50, be amazing at the game and have a rank of Bronze I mean, c'mon now! It's not newbie friendly at all as most of your opposition online will be people who have been stuck in the various tiers of Bronze for 2 years meaning you're stuck with the thin-on-the-ground and frankly boring single player modes which don't net you much Fight Money at all for buying newer characters.

Oh and as for Capcom's promise of ""free"" DLC? Yeah, free if you want to spend days of your life not enjoying yourself grinding out fight money in Ranked or Casual match you mean, other than that check out the ocean of other paid DLC costumes and characters on Steam, guys!

9,Street Fighter V,44161249,english,"I really wanted to like this game as I used play Sf4 quite a bit on Ps4. This is basically a ftp mobile game that you pay for. I was hoping it would sustain my interest more after the Arcade Edition update but its still awful. It takes forever to accrue the fight money needed to unlock a new character and the starting roster is just a slap in the face. The starting roster is small and only includes a couple of mainstays. The single player modes are terrible even by fighting game standards thus making the already tedious process of simply unlocking a new character about as much fun as getting your teeth filed down. If  your browse the store, it seems like it has a lot of dlc content. That is just smoke and mirrors. Sf5 is half of a game that you get with the retail price and the other half of it must be purchased as dlc via the store. You will get about half as many characters, features and gameplay content as Sf4 or, really, any other fighting game for the same price. This game really should have been a ftp offering. 
In addition to being gouged, you also get to enjoy the most off-putting character designs the series has to offer. Some of the characters look great, others just look odd and creepy. The handful of backgrounds you get look nice and the classic Street Fighter mechanics are there but thats really all you have to look forward to with this. 
For this game to justify a purchase, it needs to basically double the included roster, expand on the single player modes it has, give you some free customization options (skins, colors etc) and rethink the grind that the whole fight money system imposes on the tone of the game. I think this is my jumping off point for the Street Fighter series and maybe Capcom, my formerly favorite developer, entirely.

That being said I'm a competitive player. For the average joe this game might not be for them. I love the mechanic change in this game compared with SF4 because in SF4 most characters could play very similar, as in for a natural good SF player you can pick random and still do very decent however in SFV you have the V system. This system  gives all characters a very distinctive play style. Ryu & Ken don't play the same as in SF4(not as if they use to literally be the same but very small stat tweaks). In SFV Ryu for example has the parry mechanic in SF3 as his V skill where as Ken does not, he has a different mechanic which allows him to dash at the opponent with a kick at the end and could be used to keep a combo going. V triggers also put them apart. Ryu's V triggers are VT1 which buffs his hadoken to do an additional hit and could also be charged to guard break an opponent. Ryu's VT2 buffs his parry to be able to counter most attacks in the game. While Ken has his VT1 his buffs his hadoken and physical special moves while making him faster and then there's VT2 which is a command move that instantly makes Ken burst into a shoryuken! Anyway, I like how characters feel very different from each other unlike most previous titles. What takes away from this great title is the DLC.

The following is why I enjoy SFV: (THIS IS ALL SUPER RELATIVE, BY THE WAY)

-I'm hooked on the SF mythos/lore.

-Guile is a character that was basically created for me.

-The overall feeling and pacing of the game is satisfying to play (It's okay to like more than one Street Fighter in my opinion. I cannot personally choose which SF is the ""best"")

-Character balance is better than it's been in earlier SF titles. While there certainly are still better characters than others, the gaps aren't nearly as large as, say, SF3/SF4's gaps were.

-I don't mind the fight money system. Since I enjoy the gameplay, I earn plenty of FM to spend on what I want. (I'm not a completionist) Full disclosure, it would be pretty time consuming to grind the fight money for absolutely everything. I only buy the characters I'm interested in learning and don't worry about costumes...unless it's Guile of course...stages don't matter either because I get to see them when I play online against others that have bought them.

-I enjoy playing against people way more than the computer...so I'm not worried about single player features. I was personally perfectly happy with how SFV was, feature-wise, upon release. I just wanted to play other people online and that has been there since day 1.

-I'm patient. No game is perfect. Lag will always be a thing. Luckily it isn't always there.

IMPORTANT UPDATE: Capcom implemented (and already removed) an update that installed what is essentially a rootkit in your system32 folder. Sure they removed it pretty fast after the whole thing blew up in their faces but this goes to show they're not above doing something as questionable as this.

I would further emphasize to think long and hard before giving money to developers like this.

On top of this the netcode still hasn't improved from when I last tested it out.
---------------
Street Fighter V has the potential to be a great game but currently it's just far too broken to recommend unless you're SPECIFICALLY buying it to play offline only with friends and/or a local scene.

The netcode is just flat out broken; opponents keep warping around the screen, animations don't play out and you get hit out of nowhere. You can hit an opponent and confirm into a combo and the game will roll back and suddenly you're the one eating a combo. This doesn't happen for me every game but FAR too often to be acceptable. Even when the warping isn't quite as bad, it still makes for a very annoying experience.

I was also hoping the story mode would add something fun to do but it was a chore to play through and even there the game kept freezing for the first few seconds of every match and in a few select places I saw some of the worst texture quality since the 90s even on maxed settings. The texture complaint is very very minor but it really makes me wonder did Capcom even try? With that said the plot itself was nothing to write home about.

Apart from the broken online mode and seriously lacking story mode you have:

The training mode which is very well implemented in my opinion, offering options I haven't seen in many fighting games such as recording an action for the CPU to do after it blocks or gets knocked down.

Survival which you can play to unlock colours for all the characters you own. It should be mentioned that this mode redefines the word 'grind'. You choose a difficulty and then beat all the stages in it, for example the 10 stages easy mode has and after you complete the difficulty, you unlock the colours. The problem is that if you lose at any point (the matches are only 1 round), you have to start ALL OVER. This becomes incredibly frustrating when you're trying to fight up to level 50 when the CPU starts blatantly reading your inputs at level 30. The game mode does nothing to teach you how the game works, apart from how to abuse the AI.

And finally the biggest culprit apart from the messy netcode: the loading times. There is no reason this game should spend so much time loading different screens. If you chain online matches together as fast as you can, you're still spending a quarter of your time staring at a loading screen and this is what the game installed on an SSD drive.

Soon you won't even want to go to the training room while searching for a match because loading into it takes about as long as finding a match would.

Unless Capcom fixes the netcode issues (bonus points for doing something about the loading times) I cannot recommend this game unless it is - as previously mentioned - solely for offline play.",1469280766,1533906056,FALSE,6,0,0.520032704,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.66E+16,406,7,4416,0,4352,1533905910

48,Street Fighter V,43959477,english,"Dear Capcom,

PLEASE FIX THE NETCODE AND PLEASE STOP CHARGING EXTRA MONEY FOR EVERYTHING! There are two major fixes for this game that I highly recommend to alleviate a LOT of the complaints here. 

1. Make everything cheaper. I mean, slash the prices, universally, in terms of fight money, AND real money, IN HALF easily. Costumes should ONLY be $2 or less. Not $4.99 for ONE costume. I'd be more willing to buy a costume at $1.99, and the reason for that is because this game has 34 characters at the moment. Reduce the prices of all of the DLC, and give us more ways to earn fight money, while cutting those prices in half, too, and you have yourself one happy fanbase.

2. FIX YOUR NETCODE. Seriously... I was playing with a friend with a 4-bar connection and it played like a 1-bar. TRUE, it could be HIS internet, but God dammit... It's been what? 2 years, and the game STILL lags? Come on, Capcom. Fix your shit.

Finally... So, the gameplay is great. I LOVE the new V-Trigger system, and while I have only messed around with two characters (Kolin is my main), I feel like the new systems are pretty good, and the modes I played so far will test your skills on the higher difficulty. It's just sad how expensive everything in game is, and would appreciate it if Crapcom would stop being so greedy. If Capcom would stop focusing on DLC and fix their netcode, SFV would be a perfect 10/10, but, it's only a 6/10 from me. Yes, it's still a passing grade, but it's not by much.

P.P.S you also get a story mode for EACH character _ in this whole game.. OMF _ You earn Fight money with them. That's amazing. Then you buy them. Owning them in  any previous street fighters will not unlock them for you in this game.

67,Street Fighter V,43901132,english,"Game gets a lot of flak for its DLC model. I always found people that whined about that kind of funny as I haven't spent a dime on any character and I own them all up to this point, yet all you see in the reviews are people complaining about DLC characters (with less than 20 hours on the game) and it being impossible to own them all without spending IRL cash. 100% false by the way. You can easily play the game offline and rack up plenty of fight money to purchase every character released. Granted that you do not buy any stages or FM costumes, which I would urge you not to if you really want every character. I've been around since S2, have every single character, and stil have 300K fight money left. This is all while buying 1 stage, and not being an online grinder. I also haven't purchased one DLC character pass. If you're looking for costumes, you really don't even have to buy them. There is a huge, and quite talented modding community that are very active. Odds are you will see something you like better than what Capcom is trying to sell you.

I've never seen so many completionists on a fighting game whine so much about needing to own everything. Guys, you don't need to own everything in the game. Odds are, you will buy a character and never use said character. I know it's true for me and I play this game a ton. The only DLC characters I currently use on a regular basis are Akuma, Menat, and Kolin. Unless you're planning on playing a ton of LAN matches with friends, you really shouldn't be worried about owning every character that drops, and like I said, it's very possible to own every character without spending cash. Especially now that survival has been made easier to finish.

At the end of the day, is it perfect? No. We still need more ways to earn fight money, but at this point, most people that have dedicated a decent amount of time to the game already have everything and the only people that are still whining are the people that barely touch the game and just expect everything given to them outright. If you are willing to play more than a handful of hours, you can earn a lot of the stuff. 

Other than that, this game is solid. 

+Looks great
+Soundtrack is the best since Killer Instinct (IMO)
+If you like mods, the modding community is killing it on this game
+Netcode is good, as long as you search for 5 bar only.
+VTriggers. Again, elitists hate this mechanic, but I like it. They argue that it's an instant comeback factor, while at the same time completely ignoring ultras in SF4 were the same thing.

-Matchmaker sucks atm. It will ignore location differences and purely focus on pairing you against your rank. Doesn't bode well for online stability. If you don't search for ""5 bar only"", you will see this happening a lot. I live in Michigan, and have been paired with people in Columbia, Romania, Sweden, and Brazil.
-Game uses one sided rollback, which is awful. If the connection is unstable, one player will have the advantage. Again, use ""5 bar only"".
-Ping bars are fake. I've seen 4 bar connections run like 1 bar, and 1 bar connections run like 5 bars. Did I mention using ""5 bar only""?

At the end of the day, I recommend the game. It's price is slashed now as well, so you really cannot go wrong here especially with all the added content that AE brought to the table.

I wish hadn't though, because once you take a look at this game for what it is, rather than what it's not, it's a super enjoyable game and a worthy installment in the Street Fighter series.

The game looks very polished and feels very good to play. Capcom has also made a number of small tweaks to the game engine that (I think) encourages more interesting play styles. I was a little conflicted about the Ultra combos being removed in favor of the V-Trigger System, but I think that matches do feel a bit less swingy without the threat of your opponent suddenly landing a big Ultra combo. Even though the V guage charges similarly to the Ultra gauge, once you have your V gauge charged you really have to think about how you're going to use it and you have to work to make it effective.

I think if I have one criticism it's that SFV looks a little drab compared to previous installments of the series. Even though I do like the re-designs for some of the older characters, I wish there was a little more flair and personality in the visual department.

The single player content (as much as I appreciate it being there) is a bit boring, but in the end, even though there's a lot to learn in SFV in order to be competitive, it's as rewarding as ever to put the work in and test your skills against some tough opponents online or offline.",1533154257,1533154257,TRUE,15,3,0.612627387,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.66E+16,195,1,1698,0,1267,1575683680

------------

The game itself it good. I trust Capcom to be able to improve balance and bring out more interesting content. For me as a total beginner when it comes to fighting games this is a game by which I feel well introduced into this world. I like a lot of the new characters as well as the old ones and do recommend checking all characters out.

Now that aside: I can absolutely not recommend that you buy this game to support the developer, because the greed, bad business practices and their attitude towards the customers that Capcom have shown are despicable and disgusting.

As a game that lives off of having a comunity and a product that is supposed to create a fun and exciting environment, this product fails dead on. Not once did I feel like a valued customer, not once did I feel that any changes to the reward systems or any introduction of new features has benefitted me, as a player and buyer.

You can virtually feel their hands in your pocket and can easily imagine how some clown in the accounting department has been thinking long and hard how to best part you with your hard earned money. No deal is really in your favour and no bonus comes without the introduction of a new cost that you're going to have to pay with way more than you received, even though game critical content still comes at full price and above.

No more combo system based on one frame links, so you don't get mashed reversal as soon as you mis-time a split second.

No more 50/50 wake up situation all the time, because you have quickrise in this game and most of the moves don't result into a hard knockdown.

No more vortex characters.

Better art style.

Good audio,at least most of them especially when compared to the horrible tracks in SF4.

Less emphasis on fireball zooning.

Much better balanced tier list resulting in a great variety of chosen characters,even though ryu and ken are still predominant online, but then again not as much as sf4, at least the vanilla version.

The gameplay basicly feels more dynamic, much less turtle oriented and more aggressive.

So...is this game perfect? Not by a long shot, the online mode is not as good as SF4 at least in the state it is now and this is aggravating for everybody, on top of that the single player is really poor with the abscence of arcade mode(yeah you read this right), this is bad especially for casual players but it will be fixed in the next updates.

Another unfortunate thing is the 8 frame lag, if you are an harcore player, this is somenthing not to take lightly, it doesn't ruins the game by any means at least not in the strict sense of the term but it's still bad, some moves will be hard to avoid on reaction and you will notice more responsivness in most other fighting games, SF4 included.

If you want single player content and missions and dont care about the competive aspect of fighting games and want mostly to play only online then this, like most fighting games, but especially this is not the game for you. Mortal kombat X would probably be a wiser choice ( apart the online..)

I can recomnend this game to all harcore street fighter player or people interested in becoming harcore especially by playing it with people offline. Dont misunderstand me though... I still think like most people that is not good to release a game so barebone and rough and the online is still a very important thing anyway, casual player or not, but i believe that like a rough stone with the next updates this game can become a shiny diamond.Still a good game even with the problems that could' ve been avoided by capcom.

I wont recommend this game for anyone. I'm just tired to deal with it and hope that it gonna be a better game somwhere in the future. I do not have a time for that anymore.

1. It launched like sh[b][/b]it. It was aborted from development cycle to get SWEET HOLIDAY PREORDERS. Y.Ono was constntly crawling before fans saying ""I'm sorry"" (even he did not have to do anything with it) to the point when he was literally overworked, collapsing and broken.

2. Netplay always was on a brink of unplayable in my region. Anything fixed was insignificant and overal netcode was (and is) bad, if you can compare it with something actually good. Netplay was NEVER THE SAME FOR CONSOLE AND PC (console had unintentional tecnical advantages and you could not see or react to anything playing on PC vs PS4 even with insignificant ping). Matchmaking would just connect you to people over the world without reason, servers could not even ping people in lobbies withing 5 minues and do it correctly.

3. Balancing over the seasons never made sense. Pro players hate it, they constantly calling out that game was and is sh[b][/b]it but still playing because either brand loyalty or they actually get money in tourneys. For avereage player it means that the game is just sh[b][/b]it.

4. CAPCOM is a piece of sh[b][/b]it. They launched underdeveloped game, their pricing policy does not make sense, they only milking brand recognition while riding it into the ground.

Я заебался. Я устал ждать, когда игра станет лучше.

1. Лаунч был дерьмо. И смысл даже не в том, что небыло контента, а в том, что игру вырвали из цикла разработки, чтобы навариться за предзаказах в праздники. Поэтому, всё работало кое-как.

2. Доработка после выхода - дерьмо. Игра до сих пор с очень посредственным нетплеем, если ты не живёшь в Питере. Лаг в 6 кадров + лаг нетплея + телепортации если ты играешь против консолей (да игра по разному отображает пинг у консолей и ПК, ставя ПК раком) = нет смысла играть.

3. СРАМКОМ - дерьмо компания. Они специально убили игру для предпродаж (покупки => косвенно нетплей), их ценовая политика - говно: регионы - не имеют значения, лишь бы навариться. (РУ: 80% игра 125% все ДЛЦ, такое же дерьмо в других регионах, япония получила 120%/120% патамушта купят), все нововведения с игровой валютой сделаны чтобы загнать её в 0 и чтобы все покупали СИЗОН ПАССЫ, за ГОД до выхода контента (КоФ - 4 персонажа + мелочи сразу за 500р, СФ5 заплати 1300 и жди год, покупки за игровую валюту не компенсируются). 

Задрали.

The blocking,fighting mechanics and ex drives is dope But the systems aren't that good limiting your gain of FM= Fight money. Which should of been totally grindible in all solo modes.

It only really seems to give you some fair amounts starting off on in the story modes missions. And you only get like 35% of the characters in game. only giving u enough FM to buy maybe two or three unless the dailys boost you a little.  But it still would take foever doing those and online matches to rack enough FM to buy half of them. The rest of them u will most likely have to buy with real money. Along with most of the costumes. The leveling makes no sense either i love me some leveling in my games especially when i gain benefits for that character making it worth wild. But i see no difference at all accept that i only gain some FM off character lvl ups. The DLC are just really lame to and a complete joke most are almost just as expensive as the whole game itself.

5,Street Fighter V,43254384,english,"The fighting in SFV is reminiscent to SF4. The overall appearance and animations have been improved when compared with the previous title. Visually, it's the best looking Street Fighter to date. The game it self is fun to play, but no matter how fun it is to play, there are inexcusaable cons within the game. Furthermore when the game was launched at release.

An example of a con is microtranctions. Yes, there is in-game currency, but like with most in-game currency tied in with microtranctions, it's far faster to buy additional content within the game by paying for it with actual money. Perhaps this wouldn't be such an issue if the content didn't cost so much fight money along with more ways to earn fight money? The answer to this question... DEFINITELY! I listed only this example because you can find more cons in other reviews that are explained in far greater detail.

Now then, I'd like to address the issues I personally have been dealing with this... Bipolar game.  When I first bought and played the game. It functioned properly, I was even able to use my controller. I stopped playing the game to take a break, an hour later I launch it again and guess what? The controller is no longer working, despite it remaining plugged into the PC through a USB. Granted, I fixed the issue by switching the Xbox One controller with a PS4 controller, also had to map the controllers through options, nonetheless the game became playable with a controller again. As of recently, the mood swings have became worse. By that, I mean no more response from both controllers. No reason, just no longer working with this game anymore. Though that's not even the major issue. The game's window is no longer opening after launch. I go to click on it and the screen flickers for a moment before either revealing the Steam window again or randomly allowing me to actually see the game. Even using Tab + ALT is a gamble on rather it'll work or not. 

Conclusion, If you don't deal with my personal issues yourself and don't mind the issues that were actually developed into the game, such as the fight money vs real money controversy, then I would recommend this game. Otherwise, I cannot give this game a positive recommendation.",1530566377,1530567426,FALSE,4,1,0.492435217,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.66E+16,367,14,944,0,477,1569709887

Put the time and the effort in and you'll have all the additional characters in no time. Unfortunately you still have to spend real life cash if you want Chun Li in a swimsuit though. 

Overall the single player elements are good and the multiplayer has been trouble free. The look and feel of the game is just right. The new character designs are well done too. I'm totally on board with this version and happy that it will get bigger and bigger well into 2020. Much improved over SFIV. The icing on the cake, so to speak, are the controls.

Some notes:
-Game did not run at first, it was being blocked by antivirus (currently using Avast), so you are forced to make it an exception on your antivirus or disable it to play.
-This is not a begginer-friendly game, it will just force you into a tutorial that shows you the key bindings. The rest is up to you.
-Keyboard input is painful to your hands after a while and you have no option to change the bindings.
-UI visuals like combos and keybindings/controls have PlayStation visuals. ( X, O, etc ) So if you have never played in one, you will have some trouble ""reading"" them.
-Language is bound by your system language, and there is no way to change that inside the game.
-3 Bars connection or below for online matches means teleporting characters during fights, you can set it higher but takes longer to find rivals.
-Insanly costly in-game-money items. ( You will have to grind for hours to get enough for characters. stages, customizations ) Or pay real $$ like they wanted you to do.

-AIs are badly and cheaply programmed so can't be used effectively for training. They simply detect when you dont have your defence up and start spamming attacks. They have no real strategies in them.
-Not a casual game. It will take you hundreds of hours if you want to be quite good at it ( Not taking that trip myself )
-Poor end-game, It will simply be knocking someone into a corner and not letting them get up or fight at all since there is no real recovery mechanic. ( Research high level gameplay )
-Characters do not have that many abilities, so its mostly spamming the same ones over and over.
-Characters are not balanced properly considering the few amount of abilities they have. ( For example some require you to chip away at the enemy health slowly without making mistakes, while in others you can smash buttons with your head and nuke their health no matter what. )

Now I just removed the game, and I hate it because of Capcom. I didn't buy the last season pass. I'll watch High level match on YT, and I'll still play with friends if they want/have the game (I'm part of a group who is really into fighting games for many years now). But I'm fed up with the progression, the fight money, the rootkit, the DLCs (I paid around 150€ during all those years and I feel like I don't even have a third of the content.), and now the loot boxes.
I'm a very old fan of Street Fighter. 
GG Capcom, I kind of ""hate"" you now. Post Street 3.3 / Dreamcast era, as far as fighting game are concerned, you're dead to me. I hope your shareholders are drowning in money.

Dernière edit : Je l'efface de mon PC. J'ai pas acheté le dernier season pass. Je suis complètement saoûlé de tous leurs délire de DLC, de Fight Money et de loot box.

Edit après la bataille : J'aime toujours bien le jeu et j'ai pas de soucis avec le online, mais ayant acheté le season pass au final j'avoue que je l'ai mauvaise. Ça devient n'importe quoi les politiques de DLC et les prix, sans compter cette histoire de rootkit dernièrement.

somone will jump at you do anti air input lag or teleport so no anti air so now you press jab to anti air mostly
i put so many hours in this game because i like sf 
when you lose in this game you don't learn nothing you just know that player won of lag
somtimes you get good connection but very rare
you want really good connection to play online if shit your ruin game for other people since netcode is garbage
i gives thums up because the game does feel like sf more than sfiv because they got rid of focus and replaced with vtrigger which i find more enjoyable than focus or red focus i rather them have no vtrigger or focus. The combos are easier to do than sfiv but sfiv combos are not that hard when you learn the timing of each hit

ryu is no longer in the game his been nerfed so much in se3 most his normals push player to far so can't really pressure much his damage is bad now no vtrigger cancels because less damage o they give him donkey kick so you can't see the nerfs think he was better in se 2  im done with sfv put a lot of hours in for nothing.

If you dash in medium kick somtimes get donkey kick which is super unsafe :(
another one to get donkey kick press CR MK into EX firebal EX donkey kick somtimes yay :P
i think it's somthing to do with the shorcut mechanic in game you get ca somtimes if don't use shortcut when doing CR HP DP into CA so your just get CR HP no DP just CA so have to use shortcut if doing that combo
this donkey kick error has only happened online i can hit offline fine so i don't know but the CR HP ito DP CA happens offline too game forces you to use shortcut so don't mash dp on wake up too because your get CA lol 
this games for dummies man say you get crossed up you can anti air from behind with some characters because of the silly hit boxes on some anti airs  it's just one of the worst sf games.

35,Street Fighter V,43007442,english,"English:

Street Fighter V is at the same time, a game that revolutionizes the franchise for the current trend (online) and a real disaster for the old guard of casual fans (offline). After the hype soon after its announcement, what was seen at the launch was a game with a full price ($60 USD) but unfinished, without content but online. This situation caused huge frustration to the fans who made SF the most important franchise of fighting games.

It is clear that the franchise could not fail to be part of the online gaming revolution that is happening (long time ago actually) but almost abandoning the offline mode for casual players brought terrible reception to the game that, except by the ""nonsense"" contentless, is a great game with an incredible gameplay (in my opinion better than SF IV but still so far for the best SF in terms of gameplay ever released, SF III).

As I said, its qualities are its competitive mode (when the server works, of course) and its gameplay. There are exciting new features, new skills and a drastic change in the style of classic characters, which caused some displeasure but brought new perspectives. However, its qualities end here.

Among its many weaknesses, there is the terrible choice of turning SF V into seasons. What initially seems like a good idea to keep the game always interesting, is a bad business for needing to buy season pass over the years. I'm not totally against games with season pass but if the idea was to do this, it's absurdly unfair to sell it a full price of the game at its launch. It'll be fair costs about $20 at the launch and the other $40 would come for at least the first two seasons (the others seasons could be a bonus additions). The justification for this is its second biggest weakness: the F*** 'fight money' (FM). Again, if we it were fair there would be no problems but Capcom's greed is something that always surprises negatively. Basically it is possible to buy all the additional content of the game using only the game money. The problem is that to make enough money you must be a PRO player (what 95% of players aren't) or you simply spend real money. This pathetic situation is identical to the online mode of GTA V. It makes you think that the company cares about the player giving him the opportunity to get everything ""for free"" but, in fact, it makes the game's content inaccessible to a huge part of fans forcing them to spend even more real money. Something that should be abominable by everybody is still defended by crazy fanboys, even if that most part of them can not even achieve enough FM to get the full content of the game.

Other negative aspects are technical aspects. Even the graphics being beautiful - which is an obligation with the capacity of the current generation -, the exaggerated cartoon style causes bizarre situations. It is not uncommon seeing hair or part of the fighter's costume to go through them bodies. The scenarios are very beautiful but they've to be bought as well (absurd). The alternative costumes are great and bad at the same time. Great because they offer good options like the classics (always the best) and terrible cause there are plenty of nonsense costumes with no relation with the characters (gangsta Ryu for example).

More negatives are the arcade mode finals (which came as a free DLC a long time after the original release), which are just a frame with a simple art (and dubious taste). The story mode has very fast fights and, most of the time, put in the game only as a pretext to justify being a fighting game, including the poor script - which is not uncommon in the series that always has a simple-bad plot.

The game is a landmark in the franchise. It has the great initiative to introduce even more the franchise to the competitive (what I do not like but it is very very necessary in the present days) and brings great gameplay, making the game really addictive. At the same time, it is the worst SF ever released in terms of content and (lack of) characters available available to casual gamers since SF 1 (1987).

If you are an almost pro player, very competitive and a long-time fan of the franchise, it is mandatory. But if you are part of the vast majority of casual player, it is not recommended (unfortunately). Street Fighter V became a niche game (for pro and online players) inside a niche (fighting games) of industry.

--------------------------------

Portuguese (Português BR):

Street Fighter V é, ao mesmo tempo, um jogo que revoluciona a franquia para a tendência atual (online) e um verdadeiro desastre para a velha guarda dos fãs casuais (offline). Passada a empolgação logo após seu anuncio, o que foi visto no lançamento foi um jogo com preço cheio (R$ 190,00 à época) mas inacabado, sem praticamente conteúdo algum que não fosse o online. Isso causou imensa frustração aos fãs que fizeram de SF a franquia mais importante dos jogos de luta.

É claro que a franquia não poderia deixar de fazer parte da revolução de jogos online que está acontecendo (faz alguns muitos anos já) porém, quase abandonar o modo offline para jogadores casuais trouxe péssima recepção ao jogo que, tirada a ""bobagem"" da falta de conteúdo, é um jogo excelente do ponto de vista técnico, com jogabilidade incrível (melhor que SF IV na minha opinião mas ainda bem abaixo do melhor SF em termos de jogabilidade já lançado, SF III).

Como já destacado, seus grandes pontos positivos são seu modo competitivo (quando o servidor funciona, claro) e sua jogabilidade. Há novos recursos interessantes, novas habilidades e uma mudança drástica no estilo de personagens clássicos, o que causou algum desagrado mas trouxe novas perspectivas. Porém, suas qualidades acabam aqui.

Entre seus muitos pontos fracos, posso pontuar a terrível escolha de transformar SF V em temporadas. O que inicialmente parece uma boa ideia para manter o jogo sempre interessante, se mostra um péssimo negócio por necessitar comprar passes de temporadas ao longo dos anos. Não sou totalmente contra passes de temporada mas, se a ideia era fazer isso, é absurdamente injusto cobrar um preço cheio do jogo em seu lançamento. Natural seria cobrar 1/3, por exemplo, no lançamento e os outros 2/3 viessem com o mesmo preço para, pelo menos, as duas primeiras temporadas (tornando as adicionais como bonus). A justificativa para tal são o seu segundo maior ponto fraco: os malditos 'fight money' (FM). Novamente, fosse bem trabalhada, não haveria problemas mas a ganância da Capcom é algo que surpreende sempre. Basicamente, é possível comprar todo o conteúdo adicional do jogo através do dinheiro interno do jogo. O problema é que, para ganhar dinheiro suficiente, ou você é um jogador PRO (muito acima da média de 95% dos jogadores) ou você simplesmente gasta dinheiro real. Essa tática é idêntica a do modo online de GTA V. Faz parecer que a empresa se importa com o jogador lhe dando a oportunidade de conquistar tudo ""de graça"" quando, na verdade, transforma o conteúdo do jogo inacessível para uma imensa parte os obrigando a gastar ainda mais dinheiro real. Algo que deveria ser abominável por todos ainda é defendido por fanboys transloucados, mesmo que a imensa maioria sequer consiga atingir FM suficiente pra ter o conteúdo completo do jogo.

Outros pontos negativos são aspectos ténicos. Mesmo os gráficos sendo belos - o que não passa de obrigação dada a capacidade da atual geração -, o estilo cartunesco exagerado causa situações bizarras. Não são raras as vezes que cabelos ou parte do traje do lutador atravessa seu corpo. Os cenários são muito bonitos mas também devem ser comprados (absurdo). Os trajes alternativos são, ao mesmo tempo, ótimos e péssimos. Ótimos porque oferecem boas opções como os clássicos (sempre os melhores) e péssimos porque há escolhas de imenso mal gosto que em nada lembram as características dos personagens (Ryu ""rapper"", por exemplo).

Mais pontos negativos são os finais do modo arcade (que veio como uma DLC grátis depois de muito tem",1529853580,1529853580,FALSE,4,0,0.523024201,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.66E+16,46,5,6548,4,2064,1601598216

Cons:
-The netcode of the game still sucks.

+ Finally a design that really separates some characters even for begginers (I am looking at you Ryu and Ken).
+ Continuous updates with new characters, costumes, stages, and gameplay tweaks.
+ I like the introduction of the VTrigger as a come back mechanism.  I am torn between that and the ULTRA from SFIV, but I think that both are pretty cool options.
+ The online is very solid.
+ Vibrant community that makes you want to get better at the game and maybe even attend a major tournament (EVO). 


CONS:
- I don't like the monetization policy here.  I believe that when you spend $59.99 on a fighting game, you should have access to all the characters.  You can charge me extra for skins, stages, music, titles, whatever... Heck, you can even charge me a reasonable extra $$ for a pack of new characters.  But $30.00 for 6 characters  that's $5.00 a character.  That's pretty shitty...
- How SFV started was bad...  Very bad...
- Story mode or anything story related is very bad, especially compared to what NetherRealm Studios has been producing lately.

Capcom are also making baby steps toward turning the game into a legitimate competitive platform as they attempt to remove throw loops and apply scaling to V-Trigger cancels and crush counters.

Gameplay is fun

Challenging - if you're new to fighting games, be prepared to get your butt kicked in online mode. Like, a lot.

Too grindy - It will take few years to unlock all content by earning in-game currency.
Unbalanced characters.
Exploits - Some characters can prevent you from standing up after knockout at certain animation frame. And there's nothing you can do against it. (Or maybe I just suck)
Long waiting times when searching for opponent. 
You can't redefine controls if you use keyboard (But there's a workaround for this, search in Steam forums)
Occasional lags.

97,Street Fighter V,41896590,english,"Street Fighter 5 is a mixed bag of good and bad decisions. I would recommend the game if you're a newcomer to fighting games and you want a simple, easy to learn fighter with a decent-sized online community AND you don't care about what Capcom does to their costumers. If you're a medium to high-skilled player with some knowledge in fighting games OR someone that cares about how a game company does their business, be aware of the following decisions that Capcom made with Street Fighter 5:


The good:
[list]
[*]Easy combos with about 6 frames of input leniency, although some characters may need frame-perfect setups on wake-up or for punish combos with micro-walks, but nothing nearly as bad as evil ryu combos.
[*]No game-breaking option selects. This isn't SF4, where you could beat every single option the opponent had on wake-up depending on the match-up, but there still are some simple options selects, they all have their advantages and disadvantages and are easy to counter.
[*]No hard inputs. There's no pretzels or charge triangles.
[*]Better netcode than SF4 (although that's not that hard)
[*]Easier to make comebacks, no chip damage death, no broken comeback mechanics (in comparison to SF4's ultras)
[*]No unblockables.
[*]Decent training mode, lacks an option to record a move after an air reset and visible hitboxes, but that's it.
[/list]
The bad:
[list]
[*] Ranked matches are plagued by players that quit after winning the first fight instead of playing the full FT3. This could be easily fixed by just forcing the player to play the whole FT3 instead of giving him the option to quit.
[*] New characters cost 100.000 FM, for each fight (ranked or casual, win or lose), you gain 50 FM. This means you'd have to play 2000 matches to unlock a new character. You do gain 1000FM every time your character levels up and there are weekly missions which can net you about 3-4k FM. There's also promotional fights against AIs that can net you some money, but they're rare. The lowdown is: you won't be able to have everything (stages, colors, characters, etc) without paying for a season pass or playing like a madman. If you buy the game now, you do recieve the game with past season characters, but this is an insult to the players who worked hard to get the money for them. There's also no way to buy a character individually, you either buy the season pass or you don't buy it.
[*]Characters are very shallow, with very little room for creativity (except if you play Urien or Menat), if you play Necalli you're bound to be bored quickly.
[*]Little to no footsies in comparison to other SF games, anti-airs don't do damage enough to discourage jumping. Extremely hard to whiff-punish (thanks to that sweet, sweet Unreal Engine mandatory 6 frames of input lag), you're bound to guess-footsies instead of reaction footsies with most characters.
[*]One-sided rollback netcode. You might be playing fine, with no apparent lag, but your opponent might be feeling like he's looking at a DBZ fight with instant teleportation everywhere.
[*]Game favours agressive play. Only 2 characters (Menat, Guile) can play defensively with success.
[*]Wake-up game is extremely biased for the agressor, especially in the corner, especially if the agressor is a grappler. In this case, you're extra fucked. This wouldn't be a bad thing if footsies were an integral and viable part of the game, and if defensive play was possible for more than two characters. As it stands now, you get knocked down and choose between defense, back jump or attack. Choose wrong, you're on the ground again. Did I mention that most of the attacker's choices cover two of the defender's options?
[*]V-triggers are either what makes your character good or they're a mediocre tool.
[/list]
The ugly:
[list]
[*]Capcom announced a Linux version that was supposed to launch on day 1 and never followed through or said anything about it.
[*] The whole game is plagued with bad UI decisions, god help you if you want to add a friend or watch a replay.
[*] Characters changes aren't commented by the developers, they give no reason why the changes were made, some of the changes aren't even disclosed on the patch notes.
[*] Nerfing and buffing is completely random, except when it isn't. Sometimes high tiers get buffs , sometimes bottom low tiers get nerfed. Rarely justice is made. Also, Capcom promised they'd wouldn't nerf high tiers, they would only buff low tiers. This didn't happen.
[*] Lobbies are winner stays on, and only one match is allowed at a time. If you join a full best of 3 8-player lobby, be prepared to play in about an hour. This could be easily fixed with a lobby system like GGXrd.
[*] Rampant censorship. Sexy camera angles were removed (Cammy, Mika), visible nipple bulges were removed, character designs were altered to be less sexy (Juri), slight cameltoes were removed. Supposedly, all of this was done so tournaments could be broadcasted without an age restriction.
[*] Survival mode is completely useless now that it doesn't give money. It does level up your characters, but it's not really worth your time.

Whether or not you find yourself a player that is concerned about the deeper balance issues, the game at its core is functional, looks good, sounds good, and controls good (somewhat, depending on what style of player you are). SFV came off a rough start but with AE feels almost right. It really feels like AE should have been vanilla SFV if we compare both products.

I am up and down on this game due to some of the balance changes and design choices. Mostly looking for more defensive options, and buffs for low tier characters to make them feel less situational. There are some other wonky interactions that boggle my mind but most of that is out of the scope of a general review.

11,Street Fighter V,41724280,english,"	One thing that can be immediately said towards SFV is its lack of polish and consistency. There’s many thing that can be said about the game from a gameplay and marketing standpoint that would properly give a proper idea of why this game should have never been supported, even it was for the sake of esports and growing some niche scene that would squander the opportunities presented to them anyway.
	One of the things I highly dislike about SFV was that the developers never properly explained what SFV was suppose to be. The initial thing presented to us through several interviews was the promotion of fairness, removing all of the many objectively garbage mechanics that plagued SFIV and offering gameplay elements that made SFV feel all the more competitive. But the of honesty and fairness is immediately challenged through the additions of various setplay and arguably braindead characters that are introduced to the series, giving a series of mixed messages towards its development. 
	Gameplay is stale. There is nothing present about SFV that makes the game feel “fun.” The way how the matches flow leaves much to be desired. The game was designed with footsies and promoting fundamentals in mind, lowering ranges of attacks and redesigning kits that fit this paradigm, but this ultimately backfires, disappointing a majority of the player base. There’s more call for diversity with characters, enhancing defensive options, and lower input lag to make SFV a more solid experience, but it always seems to be 1 step forward, 2 steps back with this game. I have personally played many hours of SFV, giving it many chances, but in between season 2, could no longer handle playing it anymore. Season 1 suffered from the throw loop meta while season 2 suffered from V-Trigger burst damage meta. While season 3 seems to have fixed some of the many issues, season 3.5 seems to once again taking a step back from making the game fun, leaving me to consider staying away from it significantly longer, if not forever.
	Much of the content is this game is locked behind a paypal or playing ridiculous hours that may not even be possible for most consumers in modes such as survival or completing missions through Capcom Fighters Network, which may quite annoying to many people as they feel forced to purchase season passes anyway. Many of the costumes and stages still require real money, which I don’t know why tbh. 
	Many people will be able to enjoy SFV and its core mechanics, but unfortunately this game gives me cancer.

...and one of the major pluses of V is that it's a platform that Capcom plans on adding to in the future. So no more Ultra Super Turbo Editions. Just plain old SFV with content added to it over the years. And you'll be able to purchase characters with the in-game ""fight money"" you recieve while playing the game. So outside of costumes, you'll be able to play for content.

Another thing I like is that it still feels like it has the insane depth of past games in the series, but a lot of the barriers of entry have been lowered. Frame links are 3+ all around now, and inputs on some characters have been simplified slightly from past games.

15,Street Fighter V,38879292,english,"I'm giving Street Fighter V a positive review because, at least from my point of view as a fighting game amateur, the gameplay is well-done, and that's the most important thing you can ask for in a fighting game.

However, this game is riddled with baffling or at least player-unfriendly design decisions. I can see the argument for making stuff like alt colors and new stages obtainable from microtransactions, but it's still not a good look and is as undesirable in here as it is in any full-priced game. That the game requires online play for making any sort of progress is just awful, though, and while your unlockables and online records are saved on Capcom's servers, single-player progress is stored locally only.

And speaking as a mostly single-player gamer here, the story modes are quite poor. There are some good ideas here, like the character stories providing individual character contexts for the main story and the main story having battles with NPCs. However, each battle is only a single-round. Additionally, in the main story mode, you find yourself jumping from character to character without ever really getting a chance to get  a good feel for them. And on top of that, the last few battles are a major difficulty spike. The climactic battle is naturally Ryu vs. Bison, but you get three unevenly distributed matches as Ryu before this one, and Bison just never lets up. And on top of that, the story itself is riddled with bad writing and lip-synching.

The single player is a missed opportunity to ease new players into the fighting game genre, but the in-depth mechanic and characters tutorials are even worse. They're in-engine cutscenes with no player input. I get the value of demonstrating how the mechanics work, but one really learns by doing it, not by watching.

At least the Arcade Edition update adds a proper arcade mode, which makes for amuch better single-player experience. However, Capcom continues to insist that players have to beat survival mode on its various difficulties in order to unlock alternate colors for certain costumes, rather than arcade mode. I bring this up because survival mode is one of the most unpleasant experiences I've ever had in a fighting game. Single-round matches whose health carries over from match to match, randomized boosts after each match (low on health and the only health option adds like 20%? Tough shit.), and being yet another mode where the AI is dumb until it's suddenly reasonably smart. And being a survival mode, if you lose one match, you're sent straight back to the beginning, back to the braindead opponents. Fucking hell, fix this shit Capcom. I know it's intentional, but it's no excuse.

Yeah, I'm pretty harsh on this game, but I do think there is a solid foundation here. It's just that Capcom seems to be making every other decision so as to turn off potential players.

20,Street Fighter V,41544560,english,"Sigh.. OK first off I have been playing Street fighter religiously since ginger haired and red shoed Ryu first casually walked onto our screens in 1987. Then standing in front of a battered old arcade machine with 20p pieces on the top ""booking"" your next oppennt's turn with Street fighter 2, and played all the spin offs, you name it, probably played it. So it was with a very heavy heart that I decided to give this a miss when it was first because as far as I am concerned, Street Fighter multiplayer involves two players, same machine. Nothing in the last 6 years or so of ""online multiplayer"" and it's varying levels of success, from shambolic to barely playable have changed my opinion. I waited untiol the arcade version was announced and waited till it was released.

 And I regretted it within 6 minutes.

 What have you done to this beloved franchise CAPCOM... The play seems so incredibly clunky, my ""main"" if you could call it that has been Vega since he was first playable and this version of Vega is absolutely atrocious.

 Gone is his fluidity. 

 And not just him. Akuma feels like he is constantly trying to move through sticky pitch. Ryu just feels like he showed up for a pay check and can't be bothered. 

 Its just so painful to see a franchise I have played and revered for years nearly brought to it's knees at the chopping block waiting for the headsman's axe.

 And what is worst of all. It is all for esports. If you are into esports, knock yourself out. (pun intended)

 If you're not into esports and just want a Street Fighter game that continues the glory of 2,3 and 4...

Where do we begin?

The launch of Street Fighter IV was something a lot fans had been waiting for for a long time. It marked the return of a beloved franchise and it also cemented a clear message into the market: Fighting games are back, and they are here to stay. Now where did it all go wrong? Capcom never really got out of the ""make updates for a game as a full release"" mentality, which was sadly just a product of their massive success in the era where that was the only way to do it. As a result, multiple versions of Street Fighter 4. The only people I've seen that defend this are people that bought Ultra SF4 way after the damage had been done. Capcom used an extremely archaic system and everyone knew it. There was no excuse. So why do I bring this up? Capcom has gone and done *the exact same thing*. Sure, you can make the argument that because people who have the old version get the new version for free it's technically different, but technically you would be wrong because it's still a new full release and it's being marketed as such. Not to mention, it addresses almost none of the problems that the Supers and the Ultras had, which is making people who originally bought the games feel like they missed out on content. If you are a new buyer, and purchase the Arcade Edition brand new, you will receive all of the characters released in seasons 1 and 2. This is yet again another slap in the face to the people who decided to support another vanilla release, even after the promises from Capcom itself that things wouldn't be the same. A likely story Capcom, a likely story. 

Now that my gripes with Arcade Edition are out of the way, let's get down to the real meat which is the game itself.

Street Fighter V does nothing to push the boundaries of the fighting game genre and does nothing new to establish itself as a Street Fighter game worth buying. It has less content than previous games, and the only *additions* are the fact that it has new mechanics, which are arguably dumbed down from previous games. If you're looking for a *new* Street Fighter experience, you'd do well to buy this if you've played the others. But if you're looking for a ""better"", or a ""next-gen"" experience, this game doesn't do anything for you. It looks prettier (if you get past the awful physics and lack of key frames with said objects with awful physics, and the fact that some characters have horrifying faces. Who knows? Maybe Capcom is trying to tell us that Ken has always been ugly.) but unless graphics are what sell you then don't expect anything.

56,Street Fighter V,21258152,english,"I don't think I've ever had a more bitter and tumultuous relationship with a game than I have had with Street Fighter V.  From the botched launch and the weeks of instability after, followed by a rootkit install, and topped off with a predatory DLC strategy, Capcom has managed to slam the brakes during the renaissance of fighting games.

But beyond all of the above, which is arguably forgiveable over time, they committed an ultimate sin.

They destroyed Vega.

For two games now, I've had to deal with a completely neutered Vega, starting with SFIV and all of its iterations.  Now Capcom has managed to destroy the core of the character by nerfing his poke/normals into the ground and changing him from a classic charge character to some bizarre motion, dual stance but can still lose his claw monstrosity.  A thousand years of shame upon your heads Capcom.

But for real, the game lacks excitement and energy.  It constantly feels like you're fighting the implemented systems, not your opponent.  I no longer get that 'street fighter rush' when playing...

Fortunatley, I've found it in other games, namely DBZ.

My advice is to skip this game.  They botched the launch and everything after.  They hid colors behind a grindy, cheap survival mode for half a year.  They included a coma inducing story mode while taking a year and a half to introduce a simple arcade mode.  They've included boring, uninspired 'original' characters while forgetting to include much of the original cast (Blanka, Sagat, etc).

There are so many good fighting games out there, don't waste your time on a mediocre one.  If you need a SF fix, pick up IV or the upcoming anniversary collection.

58,Street Fighter V,40911336,english,"Like many people, I used to think I just couldn't [b] do [/b] fighting games. The fighting game community is infamously niche-y and weird, and 30 years of just developing new techniques instead of working to recruit new people has made it really hard to break into. You can see people developing combos that go for 30 seconds and take away their enemy's entire health bar online, and there are entire fuckin' dictionaries of fighting game terminology. If you're just gonna walk in, not understand anything, fail miserably, and get your ass handed to you by someone who's been playing this game for half their life, why even try? I just assumed I'd never really [b] get [/b] fighting games, and moved on.

But then I started following a few people online who were solidly in the fighting game community—Gabriel Morton, primarily—and saw how much they enjoyed these things. Not just the basic genre and mechanics, either, but larger-than-life characters who've been around for 30 years and old games that don't play so well nowadays but have such life and personality to them. There is genuine love at the heart of the fighting game community, and I slowly realized that I really wanted to be a part of that.

So, after admiring all that from the outside for a few months, I finally bought Street Fighter V when it was on sale. I figured that, like Dark Souls, I'd just go in and ram the barrier to entry as many times as it took to finally break through. Hopefully, I'd start enjoying it after failing enough, and then I could finally join this world I so wanted to inhabit.

It was love at first fight (yeah, fuck you). I started playing on March 12, and as of today, March 18, Street Fighter V is the only game I've played since then. I lost my first 150 matches against real people, but then I actually started to win a little bit. I started out just button-mashing, but over time I've semi-consciously started figuring out what works and what doesn't, and developing coherent strategies as a result. I can feel myself tangibly improving, and that's one of the most amazing feelings there is.

Its a rollback netcode, so it actually works great and feels like an offline versus game if both players have a stable connection and are located reasonably close to eachother.  The problem comes when one or both players live very far from eachother or have a jittery connetion because the game will compensate for the latency by rolling back the oponent in front of you and they will teleport around, making it harder to react to what they are doing during a match.  This wouldn't be so bad, except the teleporting caused by the rollback is only experienced by the player with the more stable connection, while your opponent has a smooth game.

I know, I know, it's blasphemy (especially to the newer generation of players) for someone to say something as horrible as ""Street Fighter V is actually good."" However, if you have the independence and integrity to avoid the echo chamber and actually look at it objectively, you'll realize that this game, while certainly not without its faults (like *any* Street Fighter), is actually quite good. 

Arcade Edition brings so much great stuff to the table, making it a complete package whether you're interested in playing Arcade Mode casually or diving into ranked matches. I've been playing this franchise for 30 years. Some of my favorite moments from childhood involve blowing quarters in Brooklyn and Chinatown and trying to unlock the mythological Shen Long on SNES. Every major SF release has something special about it. The original was insanely difficult (imagine how much whining we'd hear today if the kids couldn't even perform a basic Hadoken); II was groundbreaking in its head-to-head combat and combo system; Alpha was just insanely fun and broken in crazy ways; III was a technical masterpiece and brought moments like the Daigo Parry; and IV almost single-handedly revitalized the FGC. The latest iteration is definitely more approachable, but it's not without its depth. And yet, it manages to ride that incredibly fine line coupled with few barriers and to entry and tactical elegance better than just about any any fighting game title out there today (of which we are lucky to have so many great ones). 

For whatever complaint you have, there's likely a character (not a mere function, mind you) out there for you. If you think it's too easy, ask yourself why you're not leading the CPT. If you think it's not execution heavy or it's without freedom of character expression, pick up Menat and see if you still feel that way. If you think the netcode is broken, check your own connection first and then try the FGC's current golden child, DBZF (which is otherwise very good). If you think the whole game is just a money grab, again, compare it to the rest of the industry and keep in mind AE frequently goes on sale and includes S1 and S2 characters. If you think Abigail is OP in S3, you be the one to find out his weaknesses and rewrite the meta. If you think there's too much guessing, study Tokido and learn to read your opponent (although I admit how interesting it is to watch Tokido struggle with the aforementioned Abigail). If you think there's no neutral... well, I'm afraid you're not too keen on the definition. 

In any case, you honestly can't go wrong with SFVAE if you've got enough of a fearless and open mind to allow yourself to enjoy it (even secretly) despite the few that love to whine on Twitter and ruin everything for everyone else.

76,Street Fighter V,40431089,english,"There are few good things about the game: Nice art style and music. If you have likde previous street figher art and music, you will love this one too. It also works flawlessly even on a low spec computer.

However, I still cannot recommend the game to majority of people. First of all, if you are like me and just want to play street figher offline PvP casually with friends, just know that many character/stages/costumes are behind a paywall (DLC) and each season pass is very expensive ($29). The game itself is not cheap, and with the season pass crap, it just feels like only thing capcom cares about is money. Theoretically, the characters can be unlocked via fight money (FM), but it is not feasible for casual players. Fight money is mainly earned via online matches, but you have to win. And for a casual player, this might be an issue as the experienced players tend to play more, but new players are less likely to be online (matchmaking generally does not find opponents at your level). If you win, you get 50 FM, but you need 100000 for a character, 70000 for a stage! Also, you can level up your characters by getting experience and every level will give you 1000 FM, but this is not easy for higher levels and requires days/weeks of play time to get significant amount of FM. I have played 47 hours so far, and could unlock only two characters. So, the only option is to buy DLCs. For that reason, I feel like if you would like to buy this game, just buy it when it is dirt cheap on a sale and buy with DLCs included. Or, just buy SF4 with all characters.

The arcade mode gave some offline playability, but this does not translate to FM, and to play all the characters, you need DLC.

There are also some technical problems which are not fixed for years. For example, netcode of the game is bad, it is not uncommon to see an online game skip so many frames that you don't even see what is happening in the game. Some times it is so bad that either you or your opponent is on the floor and you have no idea why.

TL,DR: The game itself has half the content, the rest is in expensive DLC packages. Unless it is very cheap, not worth it.

Online matches are nearly unplayable. Even with a high speed wired connection, low ping, and the highest connection opponents (5-rated), you will just get frustrated with the one-sided rollback of their horrible net code. Unlike other online fighting games with lag, this one affects one player disproportionately in the match, putting them at a severe handicap. Go ahead and YouTube ""one-sided rollback"" to see what I mean. It's comically bad.  Opponents glitch around like they're teleporting, and the timing of everything is affected so much and so unpredictably, that it's just maddening. It's too bad, because the game is incredible otherwise. What's the point if you can't compete against live opponents without wanting to smash your controller? The single-player features of arcarde mode, etc leaves some things to be desired too. Don't get me started on the microtransations and DLC.  If they ever fix the netcode problem, then it would be an A+ title and worth the extra $$$ to unlock the additional features you want. Right now, it's barely a C- and not worth it.

81,Street Fighter V,21323733,english,"2018 Review Updat... Ok finally an arcade mode!!!!! So this was my biggest complaint when the game came out 2 years ago, now i have a new one. Game 60 bucks, season 1 pass 40 bucks (when i bought it now its cheaper) season 2 pass 40 bucks, season 3 pass 40 bucks... so ive stupidly spent 180.00 on this game, do i have all the characters? yes, stages and alternate outfits? nope those also have to be purchased with cash or fight money. Are you kidding me!!! I will never buy another street fighter game again after this. However the game itself is finally good, but because of all the microtransaction that are super expensive and dont include all the content i cant bring myself to give it a good review.

Final verdict ONLY BUY IF SUPER CHEAP ON STEAM SALE.. youll need the money to buy all the crap the passes dont give you.


Old review below...

A classic arcade fighter with no arcade mode?!?!?!?!?! 

Ok i was very excited for this game. I have played street fighter since it first came out. This one looked amazing, then i played it. OK the good... Well graphics are beautiful, best looking in the series, some of the moves have been simplified however this is also a con because most of the controls i knew are now different.
 Ok now the bad news the character roster is the smallest its been in a long time, i know more are coming as DLC but come on it feels like i payed 60 dollars for half a game and then had to buy the season pass for the rest what a load of crap, second theres no single player arcade mode, wtf?!?!?! why on earth did they leave out a key piece of the game??? theres a story mode that is so half assed its not even funny, most characters stories ore done after 2-3 fights seariously????!!!!!??? I work on a boat so online play is rarely an option for me so i need a fun single player experience, and its not here. Next a lot of clasic moves have been removed or changed, M. bisons psycho crusher is now a super move only, chun li leg kick is now a special move not just tapping kick really fast and the list goes on and on.

 So my final verdict is this is a beautiful but unfinished game, its a step in the right direction, but dont feel in its current state its worth 60 bucks wait untill its on sale or if you can find a better deal on g2a.com or another site. Will update after some of the DLC comes out, but for now dont waste the money.

Edit: Ok been a few months and this game still sucks, still no arcade mode, i got the season pass and thus far everything has been free so wasted my money on that so dont buy it. Figured there would be some benifit to the pass but not really, they added more costumes that are cash only, so what the fuck is the season pass for?  Extremely dissapointed still. Been a fan of street fighter for over 20 years and this one has ruined it for me, gameplay is great content and execution suck bad. Im really upset about the season pass b.s. which is a waste of money. If id known the dlc was free i could have spent the money on the pay costumes i thought the pass was going to include. So capcom can still kiss my ass!

Edit again... Now they want more money for a second season pass ba ha ha this game has ruined street fighter for me. Screw you capcom.",1455910092,1519528746,FALSE,0,0,0.494827598,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.66E+16,356,5,937,0,650,1581894279
82,Street Fighter V,40361049,english,"So, here are a few motives NOT to buy SFV on Steam/PC:

0 - Not only we got to pay and fund the base game, we now have to pay for all characters, stages, colors and songs availables.
1 - Now we also have to pay for all stages(yes, you heard it right, all stages)
2 - We have to pay for news songs - Not a very nice deal, for a company that promised beta investors that they'd be getting some of the future rewards and in-game features -
3 - We still have to pay for colors(with actual money and in-game currency), 
4 - Cheating IA that doesn't let you make in-game progress in Survival Mode
5 - Missions that Require players to gamble, it's literally a pay2play system.
6 - Weekly Missions that reward you with nothing but a spit on your face for being a poor player.
7 - Cheating IA still preventing you to do some of the Harder and More Rewarding Gambling Missions

I'm not really going to get in details here, but you need Survival Mode for unlocking new colors and getting some FM to buy stages, characters, colors, titles(Songs can only be bought with real money); 

Even then, they're a lot expensive; here's is an idea, each stage and character costs around 70k to 100k, colors cost around 5k-20k. BUT THERE'S A BIG BUT HERE...: you only get 100FM for each victory in ranked matches, 50FM for each victory in Casual Match and 0,00 FM For playing a friend in Battle Lounge. All Profile Titles cost you around 5k.

You can't even get character EXP in Battle Lounge(Lobby) for leveling up and unlocking exclusive Character Colors.

And even when you do so, you still have to buy the goddam color for 10k, 20k or 30k (depends on the level). Even level 5 colors require you to spend at least around 5k.

Now here comes the ridiculous: You can get around 2500k for each week. That means you're stuck at gettting 10k per month, which results 120k in a year; and the game doesn't reward you for playing good, you're stuck to buying a Single Character OR a Single Stage each year(Not both)

There's a total of 8 stages I think, that means you'll need 8 years of your dedication into this game just for all 8 stages. There will still be colors to be unlocked, characters, costumes, songs, etc...

Your only chance of unlocking everything, is to buy all seasons. Now comes the real problem with the game on steam:

""THE PC NETCODE IS BROKEN""

By the way, each History Costume costs around 30k.. and some of the special ones like Nostalgia/Holidays/Halloween Costumes can only be bought with real money. Which makes it seem like a positive thing, because you couldn't really afford those with the actual in-game FM Currency, because you would never have enough in-game currency to buy those.

For a better Idea on how hard is to get FM In-game currency:

combos are easy, with few input windows smaller than 3 frames;
almost all characters can link 2 mediums and hit-confirm into a special-move finisher;
Gameplay is more aggressive, with defensive options like 3's parries and 4's focus attacks removed;

With the release of AE some characters got massive nerfs that have removed the entire reason you picked them to play in the first place.  Other characters got great buffs because they were considered weak before.  Capcom should gauge whether a character's base moveset is OP or much too advantageous before ever releasing them.  It is ridiculous to offer a character with a specific set of moves and then change it later.

So if you want to spend hours upon hours learning a character only to find in the next revision they are gimped and nigh unusable, rendering all of your practice pointless, this game is for you.

14,Street Fighter V,39931258,english,"[h1]Price and Value[/h1]

The Arcade Edition is the game you paid for when it was first released, youve pretty much been playing the ""closed beta"" up until now. The game is in a barely playable state, [b]installed malware[/b] on your computer (was removed, but that they would even do that is f***ed up), didnt have any substantial story/SP content and a tiny Roster of 16 characters.

Now you have the option to unlock characters by gaining ""Fight Money"", which sounds good in theory, but survival mode is notorious for being an insufferable grind, and game crashes caused many players to lose out on their fight money after completing the survival mode.

If you dont dislike grinding in order to unlock character/stages, then this might not be that bad, but keep in mind that you paid full price for a game that simply doesnt offer enough for its price tag.

Pricing for the season passes are ridiculous, the 1st season pass costed me 36 bucks. That season pass only constains 6 characters, and there are 2 more season passes youll have to buy for the (current) full roster. If you are not disturbed by that, then i dont know whats wrong with you.

People that have bought the game at release for 60 bucks have to pay an additional 96.50 bucks for all the currently available DLC. So pretty much 155.50 for everything in total which is a asinine as far as im concerned, considering how barebone this game is.



[h1]Gameplay[/h1]

The gameplay is fair, they have added some interesting mechanics and tried to make it more user friendly and less frustrating. They have succeeded in some ways, and failed in others. My personal opinion is that the game is shallow and gimmicky and not very enjoyable in the long run. Im a big SF4 fan and SFV feels like a huge downgrade in terms of depth and mechanics.

[h1]Performance[/h1]

The performance of this game is terrible. I cannot play this game fullscreen without having it on window mode, and even then it required me to tinkle with some ini files in order to get it working. My PC is pretty powerfull so that is not an issue here. The game was plagued by a hefty amount of input lag, which they reduced a bit, but is still sub-par.

[h1]Netcode[/h1]

Netcode is good when it works and absolutely unplayable when it doesnt. More often than not it doesnt work. Teleporting, and constant rollbacks are a common issue when playing online and make the experience absolutely dreadfull.

[h1]Artstyle and Graphics[/h1]

Im thoroughly confused about the people saying they like the art style or think the game looks good. While the general approach with the ink effects and particles does indeed look great, most of the game looks terrible. Kens face and hair are just laughable, same goes for quite a few characters from the cast such as ibukis face and alex. Then again you have good looking characters like Ryu, Urien, Balrog and Bison which is so mind boggling as the difference in quality is night and day.

The game looks like they hired a bunch of different artists from all over the place and let them do the models/animations. I cant think of any other way to explain that difference in quality and style.

[h1]Verdict[/h1]

I cannot recommend this game to anyone. They have done so much wrong with this game that you should absolutely not trust them to make it any better. Malware incident, lack of content, terrible netcode and high pricetag should really make you think twice before buying this game. 

The people that praise Capcom for the free Arcade Edition Update are forgetting that they paid full price for that game, and with this update it merely got to a state where it might be worth the original price you paid. 

The game is a ripoff with barebone ""mishmash"" content (Quality of assets varies to an astounding degree) and bad performance. Please think twice before buying this game.",1518100876,1518101130,FALSE,15,0,0.524717748,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.66E+16,76,1,3014,0,3014,1516994487

36,Street Fighter V,25761262,english,"Alright, listen up. I have like a thousand hours in this game and I know what's up. If you're looking to get into fighting games, Street Fighter V is the way to go. It's a very simple fighting game that's based around fighting game fundamentals, not gimmicky stuff flying all over the screen. It removes a lot of the execution barriers that come from older fighting games and allows players to quickly get to the part of the game that matters, fighting other players and not the game. 

Street Fighter V: Arcade Edition is currently the most popular fighting game in terms of sustained player numbers, stream viewers and tournament entrants and will be supported by Capcom for a minimum of four years. They've also made a promise not to divide the playerbase by re-releasing the game, the only thing you have to buy to play online is Street Fighter V, nothing else. The PC version of the game supports crossplay with the PS4 version as well, meaning you will basically never run out of players to fight through online matchmaking. The PC version will always be relevant and will always be the most recently updated version of the game. Because Street Fighter V is one of the most popular fighting games, there are also a lot of resources online that will help you learn.

As for Arcade Edition itself, you pay $40 and you get the game and all of the Year 1 and 2 characters, which is a lot more characters than came with the launch version of the game. Unfortunately, it does come with some stages locked, but it's entirely possible to unlock the stages you want by completing singleplayer content and purchasing them for free with ""fight money"". 

For new players, the game comes with a decent amount of singleplayer content, like a 5+ hours cinematic story, an Arcade Mode, Trails, Short Character Stories and other things, but Street Fighter V is definitely a game that is made more for local and online play. There isn't a decent in game tutorial, so if you want to learn more advanced things, you'll need to find information and tutorials online. A game like Street Fighter V is not something you can just simply buy and mash buttons to win online. There are no auto-combos, there are no braindead comeback mechanics and fighting games aren't something you'll understand right away. If you're willing to put in the effort though, they are extremely rewarding. I would highly recommend getting the game with a friend and learning the game with someone who is on a similar skill level as you. If you are looking for more of a singleplayer experience from a fighting game, Street Fighter V may be satisfactory, but I might recommend Killer Instinct instead if you are looking primarily for singleplayer content. 

This game does not deserve to get as much negative attention as it does, as most issues with the game have been fixed since it's launch. Most negative reviews for this game are written by people who do not have enough experience with the game (under 100 hours) or are people blatently disliking the game for it's poor launch and not reviewing the game on it's merits today. A lot of negative reviews also center around how Capcom handles it DLC practices. This is really stupid, given how every other fighting game either forces you to buy season passes, or worse, release multiple versions that you're required to buy to play online. 
Capcom doesn't owe you people anything, if you bought the game for $60 at launch (like I did) and expect Capcom to just give you every character for free, you're delusional. The developers told you everything you needed to know at release, told you exactly what you were signing up for and you intentionally ignored this, and bought the game. Other games like Rainbow Six Siege launched with many bugs and issues and charged the same amount for their season passes and people praise it, but as soon as Capcom does it, it's IRREDEEMABLE? Hypocrisy. 

I am no Capcom fanboy or shill, the game definitely has it's problems, but not enough to warrent such negative reviews. If you are looking to get into 2D fighting games, Street Fighter V is the best place to start and will teach you skills that you can transfer to other 2D fighting games. In my opinion, Street Fighter V is THE PC fighting game to own and has given me hundreds of hours of enjoyment and I am still just getting started. 

And fuck it, if anyone reads this and finds it useful/wants to learn more about 2D fighting games and lives in the US, I am no expert, but I'm always willing to help new people learn and improve.

41,Street Fighter V,39699262,english,"Street Fighter V had an excellent core fighting system, but the initial release focused too much on the online content, meaning that if you weren't good on a pro level, your options were limited. As time went on, they expanded, but with the release of Arcade Edition, the game can be considered truly ""complete.""

Arcade Edition is a free update to Street Fighter V's base package. Anyone who had the original game will have their copy retroactively updated to the new edition. This is a very good thing; the last time Capcom did an update on this scale with Super Street Fighter IV, the userbase was essentially required to buy the game twice. Now, anyone who picks up this game gets the new features. It's a good gesture of goodwill on the part of Capcom for the player base that put up with a bad scenario (yes, they could have charged for this content, in fact, previously they have), and it makes the game all the more appealing to those on the fence.

Arcade Mode is a real highlight, celebrating 30 years of Street Fighter from the original 1987 title all the way to the current game. The Arcade Mode features routes for Street Fighter, Street Fighter II, Street Fighter Alpha, Street Fighter III, Street Fighter IV, and a fairly ""normal"" arcade mode under the Street Fighter V tab. Each game simulated changes the roster to reflect the game, meaning anyone playing Street Fighter II cannot play as a character who only appeared in Street Fighter III. The upside is that the games are VERY faithfully simulated, with stages and characters bearing an identical or at least very close resemblance to how they looked in that game. The whole thing feels like a wonderful 30 year tribute, and with more content down the line, the mode will only grow larger and more impressive. Each route also features a unique ending, so a character who appears in all routes such as Ryu will have a different ending depending on which route he takes. The endings are handled in comic book fashion, drawn with great images by Udon that replicate the original ending of the game in question. Some would complain, but given the other modes' methods of presenting the stories, I'm not one of them; variety is the spice of life!

The major draw is a free DLC story mode, the first of its kind in a Street Fighter game. The story is split across two modes: Character Story and General Story. Character Story serves as a sort of prologue or mini-story for the larger story where you play as a selected character. The story is told storyboard-style, with artwork that looks very... ""anime"" for lack of a better word. The art's alright, but it clashes when the story shifts to gameplay as the two styles look very dissimilar. General Story, meanwhile, is a cinematic story mode using the game's engine, similar to any Netherrealm fighter. It's a tad on the ridiculous side, but it's nice to have a Street Fighter game where you don't have to rely on Japan-only plot guides to follow everything.

Aside from the required Versus Mode and Online Mode (of which I have not tried out at this moment), other modes are included, but most don't measure up. Team Battle Mode is a nice fluff addition that essentially recreates the gameplay of SNK's King of Fighters series, with teams of up to five characters fighting in either elimination or self-contained matches. It's quite amusing how close you can make this mode to King of Fighters standard gameplay; it has all the staples, including health regeneration based off time left, the Advantage System, retention of stats depending on the status of your team... One could call it the Street of Fighters! Er, King of Street Fighters? Either way, an SNK-styled mode kinda feels missing without their major SNK parody, but that's for another season pass...

Survival is fairly standard; defeat a certain number of enemies while gaining powerups along the way. This mode earned the most ire of all the modes when it was the only major Single Player mode, and while it's not as annoying now that Arcade Mode has superceded it and turned it into an extra, it's still quite hard, especially since this, outside of spending in-game currency, is how you unlock additional palettes for your characters. Easy's alright, but less-skilled players will probably not be able to complete anything past it. The upside is that, for newer players at least, completing each mode will earn some valuable currency to use in the game's shop.

The in-game currency system has its flaws. Once gain, corporate greed has consumed the gaming industry, as the game has made it harder to acquire in-game currency, requiring players who want to unlock everything quickly without grinding to spend real money. Worse, the promised Extra Battle to help add currency essentially turned out to be a skill-based Loot Box, possibly turning what was supposed to have been a 2500 FM reward into a mere 1000 FM reward through repeated failure (this is experience talking, and I consider myself lucky to walk away with even a little more than I spent!). Word to newer players, it's better and easier to get your currency through the in-game missions; they're replenished weekly (though this latest set showed up earlier than expected) and don't take your money and run if you fail them. Of course, if all you care about is fighting strong guys like a powered-up Akuma, this mode should do you well, especially if you don't need to spend currency to begin with.

So how does the gameplay hold up? Well, the core gameplay is mostly the same, but the game simultaneously feels both more inviting and more punishing to new players. There is definitely a difference between entry-level and pro-level gameplay, but going pro is a bit easier. EX moves return from the past game, but the super meter only needs storing up to three bars to unleash a Super, called a Critical Art in this game. Revenge and Focus Attacks have been removed, in their place is the V-System, which consists of two parts. V-Skills are a part of the character's moveset with a universal button command that can do things like act as an attack, or absorb damage, or any number of things. By landing these moves and/or takign damage, you can build up your meter for a V-Trigger, many of which offer unique enhancements of your character, though some of which grant access to/are new moves. Each character can select from one of two, so choose the one that best suits your playsyle. Ken, for example, can either enhance the damage of his special moves, or gain a powerful combo attack; a simple player might prefer the enhancement type, while a combo-oriented player would benefit from the new attack.

The character roster is a nice mix of familiar faces, obscure characters, and new designs. In particular, many of the Season 2 characters are very unique in their role. Abigail, for example, is a large character, but unlike someone like Zangief or Hugo, he is not a grappler, but a strike-based character. Ed uses a unique system to activate his moves for a quick attacking boxer. Menat uses a drone in her gameplay that she can attack in tandem with. Other characters have similar quirks, so the roster is fairly good. Even the returning characters have some differences in their usual style to make them feel unique from the others. Of note, many characters who return who were not present in Street Fighter IV's iterations are characters making their first leap to 3D, such as Rainbow Mika and Urien. It seems the developers went for some less-common characters, which I very much appreciate. Of course, if you miss some old favorites from the IV days, the Season 3 pass is mostly made up of fan-favorites.

This game has gotten something of a bad rap among the gaming community outside of the larger FGC. However, I myself find the whole greater than the sum of its parts, and with the new additions of missing modes that turned newcomers away, Street Fighter V is well worth it.

I was never unhappy with my purchase of SFV, and this arcade update definitely makes me even happier with it because the fighting game itself is the top notch greatness I expect from Street Fighter. That's why I have to recommend SFV despite Capcom's greedy ways making me kind of want to hit the not recommended button.

What I still totally hate is how long it takes to make enough fight money to buy stages and other things, many of which can only be aquired with real money. I have already spent around $160 on this game and don't have half of the costumes. I'm missing several stages too, but they are right there each time I play to remind me that $160 wasn't enough.
I think that's just trash.

I also appreciate how beginner friendly this game is to new players. When you first launch the game there is a tutorial that goes over the basics, and the new stuff for returning players. I like that it suits both beginners and veterans. 
Getting good at this game takes time. I have around 80 hours or so which isn't a whole lot, but the majority of those hours have been in training mode and trials focusing on one character. I have 80 hours devoted to one character and I still get my ass handed to me sometimes. The learning curve for each character eventually reaches a threshold, but the skill curve does not. Perfecting your skill after your learning curve reaches its threshold and you've learned all the combos you can learn, you still have to execute them with proper timing and use them when the situation grants it.

5/10

They stripped out a lot of the ways to earn fight money. 

Now you get ABSOLUTELY nothing for beating the General Story. So no reason to play that.
Arcade mode blows, the presentation sucks and with a lot of the characters missing from the rosters of those game its super incomplete and leaves a bad taste in the mouth of Street fighter fans.

The two V triggers are cool I guess. I would rather a second super and a better balancing of the general moves. The mechanics are still top notch and I love the aggressive feel and speed of this street fighter. 
Its good.

Capcom is leaning more towards getting paid now than previously, but the product is not worth it. There is literally no reward or incentive to play any mode but online because of the neutering of fight money distribution

Lastly, Barrel Break bonus stage before even putting in destroy the car? yuck. terrible. Destroying the car was all about how good it felt to fuck this car up. Barrel breaking was always lame. 
5/10 its pretty lazy. If you have friends that play, its the only way to go. That said, street fighter V is still a good game. The stuff they've managed to wrap around it for this update...not worth the fanfare. Feels lik e a midway update not a complete one.

Dont have this problem in other games. Instead of fixing knowing issues, they bring more updates for the new skins out that cost 3,99 what i can buy better things for in the Sale sessions of steam then putting it in here.

Loving the Street Fighter franchise but i recommend buy yourself Ultra Street Fighter IV or 3rd Strike instead of this game you will have a harder time learning but the experience feels greater and the gameplay much more enjoyable then in this game, only thing what had keeping me up playing, was that i got my Favourit Character Alex back, what is a shame in my eyes that he got into this poorly made game.

Hope they fix a lot of the problems in Super Street Fighter V and we get it for free because this game is half done and some people paid 59,99 what is 20,00 bugs worth at the time it came out and even now not worth the money many paid, we didnt get anything for supporting this game, instead they celeberate the 30th Anniversery in that way, we need to pay for new skins that came out. Other developers bring out some events where we have to do some in order to celebrate and getting something for supporting you all the years and having more fun playing those events instead of getting something. Shows only how they handle things in order to get money instead of improving the game.
 
Edit:

Capcom promised better servers, thats one promise that didnt happen. Only thing they brought in the arcade mode in my opinion 2 years to late, it´s fun but way too late. The new V-trigger system is exciting to experiment with but for some characters like Juri aren´t the smartest choice but it is nothing to improve over time. The game becomes somewhat in a finished status but the servers feel more worse then before throws me out of the game in middle of the fight and its annoying to fight against people online because you need to figure out in a lag massacre what button he would push next and hey the disconnects are so worse that i got punished for it, 1500 minutes i cannot go play online great work with the Punishment system that is for perfect working servers. Its a system for a working online experience not for this broken stuff. Some games ""when you get them"", are pretty fun and lag free and it feels to play like in a offline 1v1 session. Hope they go on for the improvements first, not for skins like in the beginning of SFV. I recommend dont buy it unless they fix the stuff finally ""what didnt happen in this month so far"", maybe then they see when theres no money income, that they need to work on it. 

And in my opinion there should be a best of 3 played in ranked not i loose the first ""or win"" and run with the points. My idea would be you need to win atleast 2 of this (where you cant go out) before you get your points, then this ranking system makes more sense in my eyes and bring more fun. A Reset of the ladder would bring some fresh air too and not every season sitting on the rank what you had the last, it is not a real season for me, only you know there coming new characters where you can spend Fight Money or Real Money on them, thats the whole season!

54,Street Fighter V,39648199,english,"I purchased Arcade Edition at the day of release, as I had been looking forward to getting into this game when it came out. It is my first traditional fighter pretty much ever, as I mainly play platform fighters like Smash. So yes, i'm a scrub (This review is being written at about 29 hours logged in).  I overall like the game a lot, but here is exactly what I think.

Pros:

- Mechanics are great in my opinion. Inputs were not that hard to pick up, combos feel challenging and rewarding, V-Triggers and V-skills are fun to use and incorporate into your playstyle, and a bunch of other great stuff.

- Characters all feel fun and unique. Whether it be by different moves, specials, personality, playstyle, mindset, specialty, look or feel, every character is fun in their own way, and there are a good number to choose from at this point. Even Ryu and Ken feel pretty different.

- Community is great. Currently the most active fighting game on Steam if i'm correct. This not only means the multiplayer isn't dead, but it also means that you can find streamers, youtubers, and other people playing this game. Plus,  there are a bunch of guides and tutorials made online, so many that you can find dozens just for your character.

- The fact that someone like me can get into this game about two years after it was released and already have some solid ranked wins, knowledge, and love for the game, shows how accessible it is. Great game if you are new to the genre like me. Not only are there the aforementioned tutorials and guides, but there are many different practice and training modes in this game, at least to me.

- Game looks great and is somewhat easy to run. I can run it flawlessly on max settings with a GTX 1050ti and an AMD Ryzen 1300X, and you probably do not even need that. Game looks great on lower settings too.

- Still planning to play more after this amount of hours.

Cons:

- God that story mode was awful. Boring as hell to play and the plot was even worse. I feel bad that people animated so many long cutscenes just for this end result.

- Online multiplayer is pretty barebones. Ranked consists of playing battles, gaining league points, and the more you have the better your rank is. Casual is just playing matches with random other people. I wish there were more online modes, and ranked seasons rather than a flat rank, or something else to keep players coming back to it. It also confuses me why there is no character/stage selection before a match, and you have to change your favorite character/stage before a match if you want to do something different. Battle lounges and play with friends is fine though.

- Don't buy it for the single player. This applies to every other fighting game ever made though.

- Many of the positives I listed were present in previous iterations of the game. I probably would have bought SF4 if it had more active players online.

- I now understand why Capcom is called scummy, and I agree. People who bought the game before AE and bought the 2 DLC seasons were given a big fuck you by Capcom, because now new players get them for free. People who bought the game before AE and didn't buy the game now receive an even BIGGER fuck you, because they don't even receive the DLCs with the update, which just doesn't make any sense. It's as if Capcom is trying to say that they don't give two shits about the early adopters of the game.

I was screwed over in buying this when AE came out, because all of the offline ways to earn fight money (Which equates to over 200,000) were removed upon release. So now I have no reliable way to earn fight money either, despite the fact that they added even more things to spend fight money on. Capcom didn't even give me a way to grind for it. Capcom claimed that they removed the offline FM because ""it was too difficult for beginners to obtain."" This is a blatant lie and i'm surprised that Capcom isn't receiving more hate for this, it is very similar to what EA did initially with Battlefront 2.

Missions and extra battle give a pathetic amount of FM. Missions award about 5000 FM or LESS each WEEK, and Extra Battle usually TAKES more FM than it gives. And don't even make me start on how little ranked gives you. 50 FM per ranked win is like earning a penny an hour from a full-time job. It should be 500 at least.

The fight money thing would be fine if the DLC wasn't ridiculously overpriced. Paying 30 dollars, only ten dollars less than what the entire game cost to buy, for six characters, is just greedy on Capcom's behalf. Not only that, but there are a ton of costumes that can only be obtained through real world money.


So that's all. Gameplay-wise, its great and totally worth 40 dollars. Just boycott the DLC if you can to prove to Capcom that these business strategies are gross.

The fighting mechanic were obviously made for noobs, so that the most unskilled player can easily beat someone who actually knows how to play the game. When you win in this game it doesn't feel satisfying like it should, and that's mostly because you have to put so much work into beating alot of the spammers that's in this game. If that wasnt bad enough the net code is the worst i have ever seen, and i've played countless hours of cod thinking that was bad back then. Also it seems certain moves makes your character invincible giving a hung unfair advantage, and capcom programmed a system into the game where your opponent's failure is rewarded with another chance at doing a previously failed move.The worst problem with this game i think is that people constantly try to knock you down, because if they can do that in a corner your most likely going to be at a major disadvantage. This would be nothing if this worthless thing called a game had a DEFENSIVE ROLL, and its now what 2018? where just about every fighter has evolved to add something like that in their game.....except capcoms. If it wasn't for the fact that i cant return the game i would have gotten rid of it a long time ago, and i think this game was just made to anger players to get them to buy dlc thinking it will make a difference.",1517012950,1517012950,FALSE,2,0,0.498129934,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.66E+16,5,2,5143,0,3918,1533854728

Now they are nothing more than a sham to bilk people out of as much money as possible.  If I already paid $50-$80 for the game, why the f4ck should I cough up -another- $50-$500 in some cases just to get 'extras'?

Imagine a fighting game without a goddamn Arcade mode.
Now imagine a fighting game with an arcade mode that may be one of the series's best, with a bunch of endings that may not be animated, but do pay tribute to series history.

This game does have it's share of problems though. For instance, those with Wacom tablets will want to unplug them while playing or disable Touch Keyboard from services.msc or else experience random crashes. And while most of the time I had a smooth online experience, I still encounter very laggy matches. 

However, despite these problems, this may be my second favorite Street Fighter. The stages have personality to them, the characters are wonderfully animated, the combat itself is probably the most unique out of all the SF games with it's V System and unique handling of the EX gauge, The UI and soundtrack is top notch, and with Challenges and Extra Battle there's a lot to keep you playing.

Best part about it is that it provides crossplay with ps4 so it is quite easy to find matches. I've been having lag free matches with 5 bar opponents so as long as the person you are playing against has decent internet, the lag should not be a huge problem. 

The constant addition of characters and maps forces people to pay money but I think it is necessary for the company to provide continuted support to the balance and maintenance of the game. 

Story is not worth wasting time on. I feel it was rushed to meet the demands of new comers to fighting game but it is not a core aspect to the fighting game. 

Lenient learning curve and easier combos compared to the previous installment allows new comers to get right to it. 

The experience is much enhanced with a fight stick but it is a personal preference.

This game for all that it is, has it's faults. The network connection has some lag issues, the interface is a little wonky, and adding/managing friends in game is a futile effort. Once you actually start the game however, it's great. The new things they added in for the Arcade Edition make it feel polished and shiny. Little things like announcing your win/loss ratio at the beginning of the match is pretty cool. 60FPS at 4K? Got you covered.

So why do I not recommend this game? Because it's got to be one of the worst cash-grab tactics ever. Capcom has absolutely ruined a fine game by monetizing characters and hiding them behind a pay wall. One can rush to their defense by saying ""you can unlock every character with fight money!"" What exactly does that entail? Well, for starters, the most reliable way is to complete the hard survival mode with every character. This is 50 consecutive fights per character you play. At what point do you tell Capcom ""I can't beat this to get the fight money necessary to unlock Menat or Ed, or Sagat..."" and just drop the $30? Pretty much every time, I'd wager.

(and make fm faster and not where you have to weeb-through the ranked tards that poop in a bucket.) good roster, nice alpha-syle fighting, M.bison still op.

3,Street Fighter V,26616681,english,"If I had written this review a while ago, I would say to wait to purchase SFV, but now the game is genuinely solid. It still needs some love in one area, which is connectivity, but i think it might be my net. Ive got good ping in most games but i think this game just requires minimal packet loss and good bitrate to function right online.

Overall, the gameplay itself is great. The game focuses heavily on mind games, player focus, frame traps, footsies (sometimes) and anti airs, and execution has been reduced from SF4. I can play the entire cast, and probably a fifth of them reliably, which is much better than what i could say about SF4, although some argue the easier execution makes the game worse, i disagree. there is still enough complication and complexity to make it fun and engaging. Character cast is good and plays diversely different, stages look nice, and the game has a lot of ""momentum"" to its play. Great new stuff is also featured, such as vskills, vtriggers, crush counters and the rest. This is all terminology, and I suggest reading up on what these are on a wiki or a guide or something going in. Youll want to know things like that and others, such as ""frame advantage.""

Other than the previously mentioned connection problems I face, some people think the DLC policy is pretty bad, and it is, but it is possible to unlock the important things fairly easily just by playing, every matchmaking game you win you get 50 ""fight money,"" every time you level up a character you get 1000 FM, you can get 6000-10,000 FM weekly doing challenges, winning survival on each difficulty for the first time on each character also grants you fairly large chunks of FM. Basically, play everything the game has to offer and characters suddenly seem easy enough to just unlock, with some patience.

I reccomend if you want a good fighting game to play against others with.

EDIT: Arcade Edition update is now out. Now is a great time to get into it, if you don't own it already. All of what I said still stands, but the game has been recieving small gameplay improvements and changes here and there over time. The game is even more complicated now, which is good.

4,Street Fighter V,39489604,english,"Not good for single-player, and terrible multiplayer.

I really did give this game a chance, a lot of chances. Almost 100 hours played before reviewing it.

SFV basically moved away from the direction of the SF series, now focusing on multiplayer and e-sport competitors. The offline content for the initial release was next to nothing. It took them two years to add an arcade mode for a fighting game, and the story mode sucks fucking dick. The story was ok but it's full of dumb stuffs here and there, it's like watching a B movie made by amateurs.

Survival mode is a huge grinding hell, but people have to do it if they want to unlock some costume colors. Unlike survival mode in other fighting games, in SFV it's not fully random when it comes to your opponents and stages, so you'll have to fight the same several opponents on the same stage for awhile. CPU never picked DLC characters and stages that you purchased.

The Arcade mode they added in early 2018 was the best offline content this game has. But you can't really unlock anything from it beside artworks for gallery.

Now, for the online content. For a game that literally abandoned its offline part, it supposed to have a great online mode, right? No! The online in SFV is TERRIBLE!

The netcode of this game must be one of the worsts I've ever played. If you meet someone with bad internet, it's not your opponent that will see things in slow-motion and getting lag spikes, you will also suffer the same thing as them. So if your opponent is lagging, you'll lag as well. Most of the times it's benefiting the laggers and giving them a chance to beat a player who's better than them. That's why a lot of (bad) players are exploiting it by gimping down their own connection.

The ranking system is so stupid that players are allowed to purposely demote themselves down to as low as ""Rookie"" rank, so that they can pretend to be a newcomer and fight against the real newcomers. So the real newcomers can be matched with a master in disguise. Crapcom think that's a good way to impress the newcomers, right?

The matchmaking system is kinda broken. You can set it to that you'll fight people with tier 5 internet connection only, but the system will make you fight a laggy bastard from some shithole countries with bad internet no matter what. It's almost pointless to set any value in the matchmaking menu.

Back to the offline content, you can unlock stuffs like additional characters, costumes, stages by earning Fight Money (FM), the in-game currency that you received from playing. Sounds like a good thing? Not really. It's not easy to earn them. You'll get like 1,000 FMs for leveling up your character level, a few thousands by doing the weekly challenges, and 50 FMs per one online win. One DLC character cost you 100,000 FMs. Some people say that it's a good thing Crapcom let us unlock DLCs without having to pay real money, but compared to the older games, these are stuffs we should be able to unlock by playing offline game modes.

To sum it up...
- If you're a hardcore Street Fighter fan, buy it
- If you want a fighting game with good offline content, buy it when it's on a big sale
- If you want it for local multi-player to play with friends and family, buy it
- If you want it for online multi-player competition, don't buy it

I can't recommend this game as is. Capcom should be aware of everything after so many betas and testings, I feel like I've bought a teaser of the actual game.

Ok, let's go to the reasons of my bad review:

Networking issues after launch are common and understandable, but not addressing them in a period of 24hrs is unacceptable. 

Not having an arcade mode is simply... NOT STREET FIGHTER.

Lounges are there and not greyed out simply because PRETTINESS, Lounge doesn't work.

You receive notes and prizes as you play, but you can't know what they are because they havent been launched yet.

Story mode... Story, what story mode? OH THAT SINGLE FIGHT I JUST WON??? Yes son, thats the story mode, not the tutorial.

Resolution... it will take about 10min to set your resolution to 1920x1080 GL;HF

If you play on a Keyboard, you cant rebind keys

here's what i think; it's good, but get it on sale, and i say that soley based on the overwhelmingly amount of DLC available for the game. i got this game on steam for 20 bucks, by now i feel like i've paid full price based on the remaining DLC which is optional, but if you're someone like me, you want sexy outfits for chun li, cammy, juri and R.mika.

other than that the online is insane, everyone plays as ken and ryu which are the most entry level characters to play as and if you spend maybe a few hours as these charaters you will most likely pros in no time, all other characters be damned and RIP charge characters (seriously if you're gonna buy this game do the community a favor and learn to play as different characters), but everyonce in awhile you do find someone who sucks just as much or more than you, or you get luck and win against someone ranked higher than you, the story mode is lack luster in terms of difficulty but is good to get fighting money to buy additional characters instead of using real money (which you may be anyway), the trails/challenge mode is good to learn how to chain combos with some of your favorite characters along with challenges that earn you extra fight money.

oh and the netcode is terrible, i fought the same kid from fucking italy 3 times in a row on casual, capcom it's been more thatn a year since this game has came out, fix your shit for christ sakes.

it terms of the fighting system in place i'd say; is close if not better than street fighter alpha in terms of accessibility for new players as well as old, it's easy to pick up and play, hard to master but oh so addicting.

all n' all Street Fighter V (as of now) is a good, if you get it on the cheap, i dont recommend getting it at full price, nor can i recommend the season passes, no matter what capcom is doing right, there's loads of in-game DLC to remind you how draining big companies can be nowadays in the industry (especially when they dont allow refunds for in-game DLC so watch out)

AND WHERE'S FUCKING ARCADE MODE!

Edit: there's now arcade mode, which is great, it's fun, but if you're an early adopter and havent unlocked or bought all the previous DLC characters, they dont include those.

so either pay up or grind, so says street fighter V, is it a good game? yeah, but the company behind it wants to nickel and dime you for every piece of content that could've been on the game on day one, while also paying half the price of the game itself for a seasonal content pass, not to mention the ass load of costumes at 4 bucks each.

Street Fighter back then was a 6 billion dollar industry. After Street Fighter 2, there would never be a Street Fighter quite like it, but incredibly worthy games. Just sticking to the main ones: Street Fighter 3, bold and innovative, one of the best looking 2d games of all time, and one of the most competitive fighters. Street Fighter 4, although having a tough start, impressed with it's wide variety of characters, flexibility was an extremely fun game to play with friends, it was also very balanced competitively, bringing about many classic battles.

Street Fighter 5 however, I love this series, but SF5 is a mess. There's enough to enjoy on the surface sure, the graphics are good, (though there's a lot of clipping issues and some mad decisions on character models). The music is actually quite amazing (but has have bad new tracks as of late). Great new characters, and some nice redesigns for returning ones. There's a fantastic crunciness and impact to the moves in general, Street Fighter 5 -feels good- when you're first playing it.

But when I get down into it, Street Fighter 5 lacks flexibility, there is one good way to play any character, Most of them don't have many moves. SF5 lacks any real enduring fun, as It's hard to play with friends because of the terrible designed ""Capcom Figher Network"". This game was built for one thing, it was built for E-Sports. And when they debuted that Capcom Pro Tour battle arena, or whatever it was, Capcom logos scrolling across the stage, a logo saying Capcom Pro Tour in the ring, watching it at evo, there was a billboard reading ""EVO 2016"". (Despite the game universe being in 1998...) Cool right? Street Fighter is E-SPORTS NOW. They did it!

In my opinion, all they did was break the series. Street Fighter is not e-sports because they made it that way, not at all. Street Fighter 2, even 3, and even 4 (before AE), were not built to be esports, they were great games that made great competitve fighters. They were because they were well made. Street Fighter was appealing because it took place in the world of Street Fighter, and it was fun. It didn't take place in EVO 2016, or EVO 2017, or The Capcom Whatever Cup, it exists in its own world. This series, which has featured amazing art from hundreds of talented artists, has inspired cartoons and movies, hundreds of comics books, clones, and spin-offs, there was probably even a Street Fighter cereal once. The world of Street Fighter is huge, yet here it is, reduced to a few shallow characters, some scrap art by Bengus, a story a 5 year old wrote.. and e-sports.

All this game hopes for is to be League Of Legends (Probably because, that game makes $$$). Go and play rank, you will go from bronze to diamond.  You can buy expensive costumes, you can buy the new characters! This game uses a service model - One problem, it costs $60. League of Legends cost $0. And even League of Legends wasn't built to be an e-sport, not to begin with anyway. Even DOTA was not actually built to be an esport, they just picked up on it later when the players made it so. Even Starcraft was not even built to be an e-sport, Starcraft 2 was though (And it stunk). Noticing a theme? That is, games than endevour to be good, creative, and competitive games will become esports. You do not simply make an esport, and you don't need to! SF5 simply -does not play as well as all the games it's trying to be like, because those games are MORE! And if you compare SF5 to the rest of the series it is much less!

If you want to be a professional Street Fighter V player, I recommend you pick this one up, Play it 12 hours a day, get good and make some money.

After 2 years the game is finally out of earlier access. Absolutely everything I complained about on my negative review has been addressed.

The game is now complete and packed with content. Multiplayer is solid and plays well with minimal or non existent lag.

Single player is robust with Story Mode and a huge Arcade mode with plenty of options to choose from.

Game has been optmize and runs very well at 4k now.

Good job Capcom.


Negative Review:

It's basically earlier access. The game is not finished and poorly optmized.

Multiplayer doesn't work... The server is unstable and you get disconnected all the time.

Single player is basically unexistent. There is no Arcade mode. All you have is 1 round fights in survivor or a lame story mode with bad static drawing as cutscenes and it's only 4 fights long. (1 round each).

No support for 4k resolution. 4k works, but the game goes slow motion for no reason. I have a Titan X and even Arkham Knight ran well at 4k on my system, but SF V and it's cartoonie graphics goes bananas when above 1440p.",1455692028,1516277119,TRUE,0,1,0.475248516,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.66E+16,882,96,3080,0,2133,1599313424

Capcom is getting really greedy, and this game feels more like one of those free to play cellphone games, except that you buy this game and pay for it.

I really loved the older Street fighters but this is giving me a bad aftertaste, i would avoid this game. 

I guess they learned that from EA.

After SFV released I hold back, because I read in what awful state it got released.

In last years Christmas Sale I picked up the Deluxe Edition (which equals the Arcade Edition) and having a blast with it so far.

Be careful though: It is a time investment if you want to succeed in multiplayer.

After the release of the Arcade Edition there is a lot to do in single player.

You've got Character Story (each Character has one, between 2-3 battles, background information for the character)

You've got the General Story (Cringeworthy Fighting Game Story, but eh, who buys a FG for the story anyway?)

You've got Trials for every single character (Trial 1-2 10 Trials each - consisting of harder combos each time, Trial 3 with 4 combos)

You've got the Survival mode (Easy,Normal,Hard,Expert) ranging from 10-30-50-100 Battles in a row with the option to buy upgrades or health between each match.

You've got the Arcade mode for each Street Fighter Era -> What does that mean? You'll be able to play the Street Fighter Cast available in SFV in their respective Arcade Mode. You can play as Ryu and Ken in SFI but not as Cammy , as she only got introduces in SF II. You'll play the character's story from the past Street Fighters and earn Gallery Artworks for each and every character you play through the arcade.

On top of that you'll get both Character Pass 1 and 2 with the Arcade Edition (12 Characters).

They also introduced Extra Battle Mode to give a new way to farm Fightmoney. With Fightmoney you can unlock characters (100k each), Stages (between 40-70k), and new outfits. You can also buy color variants. The color variants can be unlocked by completing the survival mode as well. Grinding out FM can take your sweet time though.

I only grinded single player and it wasn't too hard and I SUCK at most fighters. With AE removing single player fight money gains it'll take months, but that's more or less because if you played vanilla and didn't even bother trying more than a 1/6 of the single player content available, which would've given you a very healthy amount of FM (Fight Money) for characters, you should've done that a LONG time ago. If you hated anything about the gameplay or the DLC practices chances are AE ain't gonna bring you back. It was more or less for the people who never bought in. Now that AE exists with both seasons worth of character's if you didn't buy in, now's probably the best time. Plus the fact that all the characters you get from buying AE will leave you with plenty of character levels to get from the individual stories to aquire FM for, at the least, one season 3 character. And they're nothing like trials were combos and execution are required. A 6-month old child can do it, literally. No, I mean LITERALLY. An infant can beat a characters individual story. I've seen it. Look it up.

TL;DR if you never bought in do it NOW. If you bought in during vanilla, gave up, complained, came back expecting anything to change, and complained more, you're not very smart. It's still possible to get 1 character from season 3 via offline just do the stuff for levels and their you go.

75,Street Fighter V,22294989,english,"Street Fighter V's gameplay mechanics are great. I think this is the most balanced Street Fighter to date and is accesible to everybody. 

Talking about the offline play, it has a variety of modes that you can try, including story, arcade, survival, daily missions and trials. Each of these modes can give you fight money, which you can use to buy new characters, stages, colors and other cool stuffs.

Now, the online mode has some problems, at least for me. First, you cannot choose your opponent out of a list like SF IV, the game automatically choose him for you, keeping in mind only connection stability measure by bars. When I played SF IV, a 3 bars connection was at least decent, on SF V the bars don't mean anything because you will suffer from lag or roll back even with a ""4 bars"" connection. Clearly that isn't a 4 bars connection and something is terrible wrong with the netcode that hasn't been revised by Capcom in all this time. And I'm just talking about Casual Matches, don't ever try Rank because is a rage quitting fest. This is very subjective and can change from one person to another.

Overall, the game mechanics are really good and has a lot of offline modes that can entertaing you. The online mode needs more work, but I'm sure that will be better in the future. It took two years after launch for Capcom to be back in the right path, but now I can sincerely recommend this game for both casuals and harcore fighting game fans.

3,Street Fighter V,28508980,english,"Update January 16, 2018:
Arcade Edition is out, which can be downloaded as an update, HOWEVER...

They've left out the people who paid the full price of the game to gain the content from the original game! So we paid more, yet we gain nothing, and the people who pay $40 get the whole game we were supposed to get. This is the worst purchase I've ever made in my life, and this game is a disgrace to gamers and fighting game players, PERIOD. 

Good job on screwing us again, CRAPCOM.

(Old review)
This is the worst game release from a major franchise I've ever experienced. It doesn't run well on my PC although other UT4 engine games DO, I have to play it in the lowest settings possible, and it's extremely ugly.

Also, there's SO MUCH CONTENT that you have to BUY additionally, and I mean so much. I paid $60 for this game and got what should basically be a F2P game since everything you purchase is essential to you trying to even play. How? you can't even practice against characters you don't ""pay for"" because you would actually need to buy them. You can earn in game money, but by the time you earn enough for even one character, you could have just used your money to buy a complete game like King of Fighters XIV on PS4 or Guilty Gear Xrd Revelator, which in my opinion has so much more than this piece of shit game. 

I will NEVER, EVER buy another SF game after this and I even purchased this on my PS4 because I was supposed to be doing sessions at my house. I've since then sold the PS4 version because it's a waste of time and money since I can't use even half of the content, and you better believe I'm downloading the hacked version of this game if I ever want to try the other characters because I'm not giving these greedy scumbags another cent.",1482332055,1516135810,FALSE,7,2,0.527684987,1,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.66E+16,56,6,4348,0,3661,1579058870
4,Street Fighter V,34711494,english,"I promised I would change my review to positive if an arcade mode was released... Not only Capcom delivered, they surpassed my expectations with an arcade mode filled with content. 

You now have 6 different arcade modes, based on each Street fighter ""era"": SF1, SF Alpha, SF2, etc. Each mode has different music, a different select screen, a different cast of characters, etc. And the opponents you face have a different visual too, to correspond with the era you selected. For example, if you select SF1 or SF Alpha, Birdie will not be fat, but buffed instead.

Each character has one ending for each mode, and a few extra endings by doing some different stuff, like ""Beating the arcade mode with Ryu without using a continue"". Those endings are just a static image with some text, but they ARE interesting, since they correspond to the real canon of the series and the era you selected. And the art style also correspond to the time period (Ken is younger in 1, Alpha and 2, he is older in SF3, etc).

As for the game itself... I have very little to complain about Street Fighter 5. Gameplay is amazing, probably the best one in the series, the cast of characters is not as diverse as something like USF4 or SFA3, but Capcom chose a very nostalgic cast (while also adding some new chars here and there). The graphics are also great, being in 3D but with a cell-shading filter that makes everything look cartoonish, and the sound is perfect: sound effects are varied and in high quality without being too noisy, music is a great mix between new tracks and old tracks remastered, etc. 

Lastly, the game also has an story mode. And even though it's a very interesting mode to watch, it's not very fun to play. The story mode is long and has a complete story, but the fights are too short and easy, and you have no interaction in the cutscenes. And even though the story is long, it's not very well written. And not amazingly acted either, feeling like some B movie. But it's still interesting enough to ""play"" once, at least.


Anyway, there's very little wrong with Street Fighter 5 now. The main issue the game had is that it came out incomplete. With almost no single player content, few fighters and few modes, the game felt like a beta instead of a finished product. But Capcom promised they would deliver more content, and they did. They added a story mode, more characters, arenas with finishers (two for each side of the arena) and a very robust arcade mode.

I recommend this game a lot for fans of fighting games, even for people like me, who don't really care about playing online.",1504444607,1516135719,TRUE,1,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.66E+16,581,39,2805,0,2114,1565562783

7,Street Fighter V,39397084,english,"Since it has come out, Street Fighter V has been absolutely awesome to play. The original release did have some issues, mostly in a lack of single player content and a smaller roster size, but it's come a long way. The SFV Arcade Edition update (free for anyone with SFV) adds a ton of single player content, new balance changes, the new v trigger system, and so much more. Even without this, Street Fighter V is easily one of my favorite fighting games to play. It did simplify the combo system down from what was available in SF4, but that's not to say the game doesn't have its own complexities. If you are the kind of person to just invest time into the game and you invested in the game earlier, you can unlock characters just by grinding out matches, survival mode, and weekly challenges. 

For anyone new, purchasing the SFV Arcade Edition for $39.99 automatically gives you access to all of the original characters along with the season 1 and 2 characters, increasing the roster from 16 up to 28, which includes a lot of new faces with new original mechanics. Definitely worth a buy if you are into fighting games. With Arcade Edition, it's also recommended for lapsed Street Fighter fans. The game continues to have some of the most exciting moments without nearly as many gimmicks as other modern fighting games have.

21,Street Fighter V,39318779,english,"i suppose one can look at this in multiple perspectives.

in a monetary perspective, this game is far from the definition of 'value for money'. MORE SO if you had bought this game during/around the launch. the content is severely lacking, especially in the single player department, much more so if you compare it to ANY of the previous installment in the series. the one that stood out for most, was perhaps the lack of an arcade mode (although this is soon to be rectified ... after nearly 2 years from launch).

on top of which, we all know by now about the infamous capcom greed ... which means, all those dlc characters, costumes, and stages, in which you need to buy, or at least put in a massive grind to earn some fight money to buy them (except for the costumes; most can only be bought with real money).

so it's understandable the grief that comes with it; considering players who bought the game early to support capcom, ended up paying for a full priced game, with bare bones content, and THEN made to pay more for content which they had expected to be in it in the first place for that price.

even if you were to buy it now, you'd still have to pay another chunk of money just for the other fighters, again, unless you want to grind fight money (although there's very limited time for this, as once arcade edition hits, fight money from survival, trial, story, etc. will be gone).

so is it worth the money? that's definitely very subjective.

HOWEVER, looking at it in ANOTHER perspective, which is the gameplay ... well, this would be a different take.

personally, i always felt that street fighter v is a vast improvement over sfiv in terms of gameplay. if one were to look back even at competitive play of sfiv, you could notice that each character has almost pretty much one staple, optimal combo, and the players almost always just repeatedly do that same combo over and over.

sfv however, adds a nice mix of moves, changes to old moves (for older characters), that makes stringing combos possible from a variety of moves. as a result, players also tend to mix it up more, and you'd see people pulling off more variety of combos, depending on what moves they land on startup.

throw in v-skill and v-trigger into the mix, and now you get even more possibilities of really mixing up your gameplay. and when arcade edition launches, you also get new v-triggers, combo extenders; and all these makes sfv a pretty exciting fighter!

so the question here lies in what you are looking for as a player.

are you a casual fighter player, who just wants to enjoy single player content mainly? if so, perhaps there might be better choices out there like guilty gear, or king of fighters, or injustice. ALTHOUGH, this MIGHT change too once arcade edition hits, with arcade mode, extra battle mode, etc. all rolls in. this should be enough to skew most reviews that talk about content towards the positive again.

or are you a competitive fighter player, who values the gameplay and mechanics itself, and dont care too much about single player content? if so, sfv is a very solid game, much improved over sfiv (in my opinion), and adds some much needed variety to the characters in terms of moves and style of play (e.g. ryu and ken are vastly different now, dhalsim has had pretty much an overhaul, etc.), v-skills, v-trigger, v-counter, also adds a new dimension to the way you play, and to meter management.

all in all, it's a divisive game, and that's understandable. but how good, or bad, this game could be, depends entirely on which perspective you want to take.",1515873533,1515873533,TRUE,2,0,0.505651712,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.66E+16,1312,118,28136,6,8315,1601581790

You fight 2 or 3 characters and about 10 sentences of dialog. 

On the positive, the gameplay feels solid. I came from playing the old Street Fighter arcade games and settled right in to kicking butt with my favorite chracters. The graphics are awesome.

37,Street Fighter V,39106259,english,"What a difference a year makes.  When this game came out, it was a mess and the negativity turned me off of this game and it did steer me to buy Tekken 7 and its Season Pass.  I honestly thought that Tekken was going to become my main fighting game series and then the news of the Arcade Edition upgrade came out plus the 30th Annivesary Street Fighter Collection.  Capcom really did right a lot of wrongs with those two announcements and now I think the SF series is my main fighting game series again.

The game still plays pretty well and I have been able to get casual fights online rather quickly.  Heck, you can even play your main game while waiting for an online fight but when you get back to that, you have to start from the beginning and that is something I'd like to see Capcom address in a future update.

I wasn't subject to all of the grinding that people had to unlock those fighters.  Looking back, I wish I got this game when it first came out so I'd not have to buy Season Passes 1 & 2 (bought them both on sale) but I had to since they are going to change how we earn our in-game currency.  It's a good bet that SF VI will be coming out with the next gen consoles (2020-ish) and I will buy that game day one even if it's a broken game like this one was at launch.  I will not let the negative reviews at launch deter me the next time around.

I like being able to somewhat having a two button setup where I would use just the strongest punch and strongest kick button by just hitting the trigger buttons or however it is set up.  You can just decide to go with that six button set up or pull a Tekken and just four such buttons.  That is why SF in general is an accessible fighting game compared to the likes of Tekken 7 and both Injustice games which uses four buttons and more depending on the game.

You don't need the most powerful CPU and you can go below specs even with a two core/thread CPU as long as you have a good GPU and the GTX 1050 2GB version gets it done and you could go with pretty high settings but don't expect 4K gaming with that setup.

And for the money I'm paying, you only start with quite a meagre selection of fighters - compared to other fighting games available in the market (*fixed with seasonal character releases that can purchased in DLCs).

1. game closing down randomly

Now the price:
I bought this full price on PS4 when it was released and I was disappointed with the lack of arcade mode, so I just played it a few times and shelved it.

When it went on sale on Steam I bought the Deluxe version thinking it will be better. The Deluxe version still lacks a ton of content. You still have to buy the costumes separately.

I'm very disappointed with this game.....

Just go get Ultra Street Fighter IV.

A lot of what the negative reviewers are saying is absolutely true - the time between matches, the fact that one guy did the netcoide (and while its good, it still feels not fully made), unlocking a character using fight money takes way too long... their complaints are valid but I really enjoy this game. It does feel a little like early access, but I remember thinking Street Fighter 4 sucked at launch... and it did suck. Street Fighter 5 is in the same boat - its not a bad game, but they're still making it. By the end of Street Fighter 4's life (when SF5 came out) I thought the game was a shit ton of fun. This was the fighting game I had waited for. Street Fighter 5 will get there too, but I really wish capcom would develop faster - we love the game but we need you to deliver quicker and to make fight money not so impossible to get. 

I've put some good hours into the game and it's unlikely that if I play at my current rate I'll ever unlock another character until SF6 is out.

Mar 2017:
So, I lied and I kept playing. This game still has its issues. Ragequitting has been addressed, there's a few overpowered characters (Urien is #1 if you're curious), but once I switched from playing as Vega to Birdie I've been having more fun and gained more than a few levels. 

The game is still kinda rushdown garbage, but I'm having fun with it. For all the criticism I'm giving the game, I gotta say I'm having fun and loving it. I think the game is just controversial no matter what it does and maybe thats part of the fun. It's currently priced at $40 - if you like Street Fighter then its certainly worth $40. I think in a year this game is really gonna be swinging. Street fighter 4 took me some time to get into but I really enjoyed it, and I think I'll enjoy this.

Aug 2017:
I'm now playing this every day. I got up to the top 23,000 in the world, and then ABIGAIL came out and now I'm back down to 70,000. It's ok though, because it's ABIGAIL!!!!! I play tthis game every day now. The game is a lot more fun and while there still is some rage quitters, its a lot less than it used to be. Lag is still a bit of an issue at times, but I'm really enjoying the game now. I think its worth a purchase at this point.


Dec 2017:
Season 2 was really strong with good characters that are all very fun to play as, unique levels, and I rarely run into ragequitters anymore. I've got to say I think they listened to a lot of criticism in Season 1 and applied it to Season 2. Arcade Edition is out soon and I expect to see a lot of revamping that turns this game into what we all wanted it to be in the beginning.

97,Street Fighter V,38651969,english,"As a starting note, the game is very nice in 4k I thought. There was a visible improvement, so that's a thing to consider

For the game itself, it's bland. I could see why someone would buy it because they like the street fighter franchise, but I mostly just buy fighting games for the system and fun behind it. This game doesn't do me that service. It's the same rock-paper-scissors, inhuman reflex based fighting formula that I could have played my old dead or alive or even my old street fighter copies for. Contrary to the naruto ultimate ninja storm series for example(with 4 also being my personal recommendation to anyone who likes fighting games), there is little to no innovation. Anything that street fighter adds, mostly in terms of special moves and v-strike, is quite tedious to execute as the buttons are overloaded with quite a lot of commands. Not to mention that they're not even that creative nor good compared to what you can do with the regular abilities. Special moves are supposed to be a finisher, or simply something difficult yet rewarding to pull off. Naurto ultimate ninja storm generation 4 does this well, the special moves are hard to execute, easily interruptable by anything and sometimes hard to even hit, but they do a lot of damage and have a long, well-done and incredibly epic animation that really makes you feel like you've accomplished something. Or fucked up if you're on the receiving end. Street fighter doesn't really give you this feeling. Some moves do have an animation and can be quite satisfying to land, but I don't feel like they're any harder or more rewarding than regular abilities.

As a final verdict, street fighter has surprised me graphically, but let me down in most other aspects. dead or alive 5 which is significantly older still has more features. There are other things that redeem this game, the charm of the characters, the design, silly and entertaining, but as a game, it's not for me.",1514195042,1514195042,FALSE,2,0,0.482896239,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.66E+16,523,17,25,0,25,1514157075

Where do I start. It's an online-only game with particularly poor netcode. When I say online-only I mean it, there are no modes in this game at all.

Here is a game that released at 50-60$ AAA pricing but offered nothing but a shell of a Free to Play game, complete with microtransactions for cosmetics (which are 99% of the dev team's effort,) gradually adding new characters that are either completely alien to the game and dont fit stylistically or even visually that require either real money (10$ a pop LOL) to purchase or in game currency which you have to grind.

Insane, that's the word I am looking for. These people are clinically insane and belong in a mental institution and not in charge of a project like this. Everything is broken, nothing is supported. Trying to push some money grubbing nonsense like this on a niche market is insane, there is no other word for it. This game exists as some kind of reverse psychology project to trick people into trying other fighting games in order to make the genre more popular, would be nice if it were true but this is giving Capcom too much credit and unfortunately is not the case.

There are old arcade fighting games that are known through-out as C to D grade games in the genre, dated as they are, that function better and more smoothly than Street Fighter V.

Performance is poor and unoptimized, the character designs are ugly and unoriginal. The game is trying to sell you a 60$ free to play pre-beta to capitalize on the nostalgia of.... Street Fighter IV I guess? I am not sure who it's targeting. SFV is right now, the worst major release of the decade and that's big shoes to fill as the competition has been steep in the worst gaming decade yet.  

I have given this game more than a fair chance considering how many fighting games I've actually played throughout my lifetime and I can tell you objectively, do not play this game. There is absolutely nothing here. If you are interested in fighting games, do not play this game, you can play any other fighting game, but not this one. It will not teach you how to play properly, it will not show you anything that a good fighter can offer you, it is simply a horrible game with very limited offerings and fundamentally broken beyond repair.

Absolutely the bottom, absolutely the worst. No one plays this but Capcom employees and it is clear that they hate fighting games with a passion to make something so meticulously anti-fun and anti-skill. Not to say that the FGC doesnt deserve it, they are some of the worst trash on the planet (The original cancer, long before the words cancer or toxic were even used.) In fact, if I found out the game was outsourced entirely to the fighting game community I would not be the least bit surprised at how it came out, but it's Capcom's name and brand on the line not the FGC, which is largely niche and underground weirdos that mostly hold on to their genre because they dont understand fun or gaming as a whole but have nothing else.

Just like around the 2010~ MMA became big and the karate mcdojos were exposed as frauds that charged money to teach kids ineffective combat tactics by fat steven segal-lookin instructors that never been in a fight. The Street Fighter devs are exposed as hand-me-down developers that were always relegated to the fighting game department of Capcom because they didnt know how to make real games and have no actual talent.",1512898768,1513629682,FALSE,2,0,0.491926193,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.66E+16,10,16,38777,0,37061,1498283068
21,Street Fighter V,21266840,english,"Street Fighter V is a fun fighting game and is great for new players looking to get into the genre.

As a player who is still new to the genre I think Street Fighter V is a great fighting game. It's a game that has resonated with me in a very good manner. This is the first fighting game that I have ever connected with and has helped me open up my range to other fighters. You can also unlock all the DLC characters with ingame currency and not have to spend a dime more, but you can also buy the season pass if you don't have the time to unlock them all as quickly as you would like. ALSO Arcade edition is coming soon which will come with all the previously released characters from season 1 and 2 at a lower price, so you may want to stick it out till then.

The game itself feels really good and fluid, buttons come out quick. Combos are fun to do and its always the best feeling when you finally learn a new combo after spending hours in the training room and getting to take your newly learned skills to the test. 

Overall Capcom released this game as it was unfinished, didnt have certain features from the get go, but they are correcting their wrongs and trying to show the players that they do listen and care. This game has only gotten better since release in my opinion and is worth picking up if you are a street fighter fan, or fighting game fan in general.

Sure they're coming out with more characters as the game gets older, but i would much rather buy Ultra 4 or Tekken 7 rather than pay roughly 20-50 bucks for 6-12 characters. 100k for a single character, let alone forcing the charcter to play enough to buy one seems well over the top. Not only that but the matchmaking in this game is completely nonexistent. Once you enter casual or ranked mode, its just a hat pull. you can either play with someone worse in skill, similar or someone almost as good as daigo or ai ai. Although i'm still playing this game today, its still disappointing that you cant acquire new characters in a simpler way, or at least halve/remove a quarter of the cost for every map and character. Aside from the above disappointments, this game is at least playable.

The fact that Capcom isnt giving any of the existing owners anything aside from ""the new arcade edition updates"" for free, makes owning this game a big kick in the balls. they should at least give the pre-existing owners both season passes as well.

64,Street Fighter V,23123667,english,"I preordered this game and after 3 months of being released, I can't enjoy playing it. I really wanted to like this game; I have been patient but still trying to play is far from a pleasant experience. I never thought I would regret buying this game.  

Every other review is just accurate: No settings options to change the keys, most fighting sticks not supported (I have 2 that do not work), endless waits for playing ~90 seconds online (I usually read twitter and facebook while waiting until I do not have more updates and just quit the game) and each 1 of 3 fights will be unplayable due to lag, no arcade mode...

And I never seen any other review telling you this but on top of everything there is no car bonus stage. Seriously, I am also absurdly annoyed about that!

Edit - Nov 2017: I read that the game was fixed so my love for street fighter and the feeling that if this game could be awesome if only I could play it without the constant pain lag or 5 minutes waitting between fitghts; made me giving it a second chance a few months ago. My figthing sticks do work now and I can finally change the settings. The waiting times to find a match have been reduced but do not get me wrong, it is still usually over a couple of minutes between matches which it is better than it was but depressing. This also explains why I have so many hours on this game (yep, still reading twitter while waitting) and I do have lost of opponents with problem conections, they disappear and appear in mid air, sometimes I hit them and it turns out I did not as the game catches up... There is no arcade mode yet and on top of that it is the business model Capcom has chosen for this game. All extra players can be purchased or bought with fight money but unless you are willing to spend thousands of hours unlocking all characters, you will have to pay or go along without them. Having in mind that I did pre-ordered the game what I had in exchange for the full prize is a broken game that I could not play and a year and a half afterwards I do have a game with half roster, no arcade and lots of issues; I obviously can't recommend this game.

When I originally bought this game on PS4, I was pissed.  There was a severe lack of content and the servers were always going down.  But when I won my first ranked match by converting a crush counter into a v trigger install and cancelled into a super, I couldn't help but smile. 
Still, waiting for content was a slog.  Capcom would announce things every month.  I came to expect these things to show up at the very end of the month.  Then I came to expect some of the things would be delayed.  And when characters I loved in SF4 showed back up, they felt funny in my hands.  I cycled back to anger and cynicism.  I guess it didn't help that there was a death in my family and a lot of stress at my job and in my living situation at the time.  But then, Juri and Urien showed up in the story mode, and they were actually really fun to play, so I calmed down.
Season 2 has been a trip.  I haven't really felt the hype for any of the characters since Akuma.  The newcomers have done a lot to flesh out the roster with unique fighting styles.  Still, I would have rather had Rose than Menat, and pretty much anybody from Mad Gear other than Abigail.  Even with all these weird new characters, ninety percent of what you'll run into online is shotos. (Unless you're godlike and you only run into Laura, Boxer, and Guile.) It gets boring.
I think this game is really going to come into its own when Arcade Edition comes out.  The new V-Triggers look sick, and the inclusion of more legacy characters should shake things up.  Also, there'll be single player content other than the shitty survival mode and the laughable free story update.

Everything works now....  choppy online matches....still not quite ""recommend"" worthy.  Save your money right now.  I still regret spending mine. I'll update again after the March update they keep pimping.

04/01/2016 UPDATE!!!!!
Online is still super teleport-y/laggy. Nearly unplayable lag.  Online matches are more about who has better lag management and than who is actually better.  Still regret spending 60 bucks for this.  So still a ""No."" for me.

01/01/2017 UPDATE!!!!!
Online still as teleporty and lag crazy as ever.  Almost a year old and a basic, smooth connectivity is still beyond what Capcom is capable of implementing. You would think it would be top on the priority list....sadly Santa costumes are more important. Tekken in a few months, I'm done with SF5....piss poor.

After nearly 2 years, SF5 continues to receive more content, still overpriced, but at least the DLC is now purchaseable on the Steam store now, albeit on a delay. The online servers have been updated and the game has received more content. It's made a lot of progress, however, the content added is still shallow, and ultimately the game has devolved into a 'play once a week for weekly challenges' instead of the daily challenges originally promised. They're going to have a major update in a few months with Arcade Edition, so maybe that will give the game the much needed shot in the arm it needs.

I don't pre-order games generally - in fact I'd like to say I never do on principle, but for this game, and the USF4 upgrade I made an exception.  I bought new hardware to ensure I could run this game properly.

I suffered through the 3 beta periods where the game servers were down more than they were up, and had the same experience during the actual launch of the game.

#### as of Season 2, after 14 patches, this issue has now been resolved
## I'm still forced to use a third-party program to use the fightstick that I can use in *every
## other* fighting game - including USF4.

Along with everyone else I waited over half a year for the single-player ""story-mode"", which is definately fun, and brings something new to the franchise - but if I want to play a bit of arcade-mode streetfighter, I have to go back to USF4.  (This will finally be addressed after more than two years with the upcoming Arcade Edition.)

With these criticisms out of the way I'll point out that the heart of the game - the online - is generally rather good. I'd dare to say it's much improved over USF4 in that respect.

Cross-play with people on Playstation has kept the playerbase pretty healthy.  Having at least the option of not paying cash to unlock additional characters is a another welcome change of strategy from Capcom who - rest assured are still more than happy to drain your wallet for additional character skins and the like - Capcom's not going to stop being Capcom after all.

I do reccomend this game, but it's a heavilly-caveated reccomendation.  The Street Fighter franchise is one of the most respected in gaming, and yet Capcom cannot stop making misteps (including a recent ""anti-cheating"" update that installed a literal rootkit onto users pc's - this was fixed pretty quickly, but is rather inexcusable behaviour from any developer).

She forces a smile like someone put an invisible gun to her head, but she isn’t fooling anyone. Of course she heard it. Hell, the whole street must have heard it. Like all the other neighbours, she lives in mortal fear. Sometimes in the middle of the night, terrifying screams pierce the silence. Late at night, someone can be heard yelling profanity at the top of his lungs. Beastlike roars shake even the most confident residents, not sure whether they should call the police or an exorcist. Actually, do you want to approach someone like that? No, just smile and move along.

Surprisingly, the person in question is not a maniac requiring psychiatric attention, but an ordinary man. That screaming nutcase, that howling madman - well, that’s me. And the reason for the outbursts? You’re looking at it. The game’s motto is “Rise up”. It’s referring to your blood pressure.

Forget about salty - Street Fighter V will make you MAD. And there’s plenty to get mad about. But first things first.

Fighting games have always been rather niche. Sure, there have been a few smash hits over the years, but the reality of fighting games is that the genre is not very popular, neither in terms of sales nor players. The basic outlook of a martial arts video game in which two guys (or gals) beat the crap out of each other until one life bars depletes may not seem enough for the average “gamer” to shell out a fiddy on release and play for months. The usual modus operandi includes buying a fighting game, dabbling in arcade mode for a bit, mashing buttons with a friend, maybe even going online a few times before shelving the game indefinitely. Part of the reason for this is that fighting games are scary. As simple as the prospect of a one on one fist fight seems, the nuances to each new fighting game are overwhelming. For every character you can choose from, there are dozens of moves with different properties and applications. Depending on which character you are facing, the ways in which to counter them are just as numerous. Then you have the damaging combos requiring exact timing and precision. Of course, there’s also your opponent who is constantly trying to predict your next move while you are trying to do the same. Street Fighter is the series that embodies all of those principles as it pretty much put fighting games on the map. There were others before it, but ever since Street Fighter II, it has become the posterboy for the genre. Players who possess the drive to master a fighting game with all of its subtleties and keep competing are the exception, not the rule. Which is where Street Fighter V comes in.

Street Fighter V promised to be easier on beginners. In a way, it succeeded, but at the same time it did not. With the lowered execution barrier, SFV eliminated one of the most intimidating aspects of fighting games - hard-hitting combos are now significantly easier to perform. That doesn't mean they don't require any skill at all (Karin's Trial #6 says hi), but newbies will see results much quicker and drop combos less frequently. However, other factors have gained importance, such as spacing and mindgames. The outcome remains largely the same: A fighting game veteran will make quick work of a newbie - as it should be. Accessibility doesn't mean you have the chops to win tournaments after a couple of hours. A victory is largely the result of one player putting in more work than the other. No amount of tutorials will do that for you. Still, it feels like SFV didn't go the extra mile to ease beginners into the game, although the effort that was made is certainly appreciated. Some of the game's mechanics aren't that well-explained and new players will have to dig through resources online to find answers, experiment in training mode or learn things the hard way through lots of aggrevating defeats.

The matches themselves are an absolute delight to play: Hits feel meaty and satisfying and the match progression is very transparent, meaning you can always pinpoint the reasons why you lost. Unlike its predecessor, there’s not much weird tech you can master to play the game on autopilot - every move requires for the player to think beforehand and commit to it. After years of dealing with SFIV’s option selects, the honesty feels like a fresh breeze. Also gone are the damaging comeback moves with lots of invincibility. SFV does have comeback mechanics, but they require you to do the work yourself. If you land a comeback, you really earned it by outplaying your opponent and not because a mashed out Ultra took half of his health.

Exchanging blows with your opponent is a blast, but the same can’t be said of most things surrounding it. Especially not the online multiplayer. When it works, it’s great and barely differentiates from offline. When it doesn’t work, it’s a full on catastrophe. Due to the nature of the rollback netcode, whenever a faulty data package is being sent to the server it will appear as if your opponent is teleporting all over the stage, essentially rendering the match unplayable since you can’t reliably react to anything. Then you have random disconnects from the game server, sometimes even during the match. It’s the kind of stuff that makes you yell at your furniture. To be fair, those issues used to occur much more frequently and it’s great to see the game improving, but it’s still far from optimal. From personal experience, maybe every 10th player is a warping demigod.

Smaller complaints include the Capcom Fighters Network being unintuitive to use. To give you a taste: In order to watch a replay, you need to browse through your list of previous matches, select a match and add it to your replay queue; then you need to go back to the main menu and open your CFN profile from which you can actually watch the replay. It’s just needlessly convoluted. Plus, stat tracking still broken four months after release. At the time of writing, I use a third-party site to keep track of my matches.

A neverending source of frustration are the players themselves: You outplayed your opponent and as you are about to deliver the final blow, the screen goes black - because the scoundrel closed the program. Some are just mad they lost for whatever reason and this is their attempt at getting some kind of fleeting sense of superiority, some are legitimate cheaters boosting their ranks. Right now, a premature disconnect is not counted as a defeat - no points are lost and players even retain their win streaks. The game will temporarily lock you out of multiplayer if you exceed a certain disconnect ratio, but so far it has done nothing to discourage that kind of behavior.

Singleplayer warriors will have a hard time finding value in their purchase. There’s a story mode now, but like all the other attempts at telling a story with Street Fighter as a vehicle, it’s cringe-inducing for the most part. Fans will probably enjoy the occasional reference or an unlikely cameo here and there. Apart from that, it’s a waste of time.

At the end of the day, SFV expects you to play online - whether you’re simply mashing it out in Bronze League or go against the tougher players in Gold League and beyond. Additional characters, stages and other goodies can (in theory) be unlocked simply by playing the game and serve only as an incentive to keep you going. It all plays into building a community that is interested in the game on a competitive level. Unfortunately, some aspects of online multiplayer aren’t as fleshed out as they should be for an online-centered game, which sometimes detracts from the experience. Whether you want to put up with it is ultimately decided by how much you enjoy the core of SFV - the back and forth between you and your opponent. I for one highly enjoy it. Otherwise I wouldn’t get as hotheaded about it as I do.",1467468697,1511476202,TRUE,5,0,0.531118333,2,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.66E+16,506,24,96314,391,51665,1601766345

If i could actually play it properly lol.

Don't want to bash any Street Fighter fanboys here but seriously. How could you give this fucking horrible game a positive rating. I had to go through 100+ fixes to get this shit to boot up. Then the controller input is broken so i couldn't even move through the fucking menu with my left stick.

Okay 30 minutes later i finally got everything fixed and can finally play the game. Oh wait, the game runs in damn fucking slowmotion because for some reason a i7-4770 + Gtx970 + 8GB RAM is apparently not enough to run the game even at low quality. Despite having more than enough power to run the game I decided to search for a fix again and give it 1 more damn try. Found a video on youtube that mostly fixed the problem for people.

Guess what, It doesn't fucking work.

So i deeply apologize. I wanted to try a fun fighter game for a change instead of playing Tekken but this is just a huge mess. There is no way to play the game properly without going through thousands of fixes and the funny thing is is that the fixes might not even fucking fix your shitty game. 

So no, even if the game is on sale at the moment for 15 euro's (or even at the full price tag of fucking 40 euro's for a broken game). I'd rather buy 5 packs of gummy bears and become a obese piece of shit than supporting a company that doesn't even give a single fuck about bringing out their own games properly without giving everyone a damn seizure.

I hope everyone else that still has the game and enjoy's it to keep enjoying it. As I am stepping out of this mess. I refunded the game and I will try to buy SF4 instead and play it if it's playable. 

For the rest, If you want to pay for a game that gives you a free seizure and a huge waste of time then be my guest.

The input windows for combos are larger, the concepts aren't crazy complicated, and there's tons of information out there to learn the game. It's not as shallow as most easy to get into ""fighters"", but the game is just far more accessable. 

However, this game ain't perfect, but it's getting better (at the time of this writing).

Survival mode is garbage, there's no arcade mode, and the character's stories are way too short and easy. However, the general story that's been added is a pretty good challenge for a newcomer, and has a way harder difficulty. The trials that teach you combos are also fantastic, and will teach you great tech. 

This game at launch was awful, but it's progressively getting better. It's still a good game, but it's not where it should be yet.

16,Street Fighter V,36229990,english,"Fundamentally a good fighting game, but riddled with flaws that are unforgivable by a company that should know MUCH better by now.

First off, just have to state that Street Fighter is one of my favorite games of all-time. I've played since SF2 first came out in arcades, I've played SF1 in arcades, and every version of SF2 and SF3 that came after. I've placed in tournaments before, bought many of the home versions (SNES version was incredible back in the day, and Saturn/Dreamcast/PS1 had excellent versions of SF3/Alpha2/3 as well), and enjoyed 4 for a while there too, but not as much as the older titles.  Street Fighter 5 is what happens when a company caters to only a very particular sect of their audience and ignores the majority of players. This was evidenced by the game's poor release state, which was functionally an alpha version, lacking many of the staple modes and options that have been a hallmark of the series since inception. They have done things to remedy this over time, but they have also done some terrible things that should not be forgotten.

First on the list: Having to download the *ENTIRE* game every time a patch is released.

This has happened since the game released, and is very amateur of Capcom to apparently not know how to patch their game properly. Literally every time an update comes out, expect to download all 8+gb of the game each and every time.

Second: Releasing a patch that installed a rootkit on people's computers. 

They did this last year, in an attempt to stop people from cheating the system to get fight money through various methods. They released another patch to remedy this, but it did not remove the virus-like rootkit that was installed on many people's computer even after that. I'd imagine some folks still have capcom.sys floating around their operating system installation. What were they thinking trying to pull garbage like this? The funny thing is that people were going to such lengths in the first place to get around their fight money system because it was so poorly thought out and implemented to begin with. (see third point below) Because of their $h!t system, they got this result. To punish the abusers, whether they were cheating the system or not, they installed rootkits on ALL players' PC's. Let that sink in for a minute: This is a system level modification that could be exploited by others and lead to your entire computer being compromised by theives/trolls/hackers. That was their solution.

Third: The fight money/unlock system is a joke. 

Expect to get half the characters for the full price of this game, and pay double that to unlock the other characters. The average cost per character is $5 each. Not to mention new stages will cost you as well.  If you want to unlock them by playing the game, it will take weeks of playing to get a single character unless you grind non-stop and by the time you get a couple of them you will probably be tired of playing in the first place. The best way to get fight money should be online ranked matches, as those are the only way to really get better at the game unless you have a local SF5 group/friend to train with. Problem is, online matches are so slow to find anymore, and when you do the connection is a crapshoot and your enemy is warping around the screen half the time. This isn't an unlock system. It's intentionally made to torture players who are trying to unlock characters and stages to the point where they crack and spend money on this additional content. They want you to grind out the same worthless survival modes and content over and over again and follow guides to maximize your fight money payout for this monotonous process. None of this non-online grind actually makes you any better at the game, it really just makes you dislike it more by suffering through the same poorly made single player content over and over again. It is a terrible system apparently made by amateurs who have no idea how to engage with their players/fans sensibly.

I get that they are trying to adapt to a new model with their games, instead of releasing updates as full products over again as they have in the past. You can trace this method back to their arcade roots, when they would re-sell the same game with new characters and such to arcade operators and charge for an entire new board and graphics to update an existing cabinet. They had been used to this business model for a long time, and prospered with it, as Street Fighter is one of the most successful arcade games ever, if not the most successful one. They are having a hard time adapting to the current home console industry and it shows. It's like your grandfather trying to learn how to use computers. He may have learned AOL back in the day, and knows how to do certain things, but it's hard to adapt to learn other stuff when you are stuck in a routine like that. Capcom is the stubborn grandfather of games developers, learning to cope with modern life, essentially.

This game was rushed out the door for the tournament players across the world, without any forethought on building a solid foundation besides the base mechanics of the game. These players are always reliable to buy all the DLC and characters to stay relevant in the professional scene. Capcom knows this. That's what this game was catered towards, with all other classes of players a complete afterthought. It took them years after the initial release to finally implement a legitimate system to punish uncouth players who were abandoning (rage-quitting, LowTierGod-ing, griefing) matches when they were losing. Wait 10 minutes for a fight, do good in fight, opponent leaves because there is no penalty for him doing so, and you get NOTHING for the time you spent or for doing well in the match. They finally just implemented a system for this recently, as well as the ability to blacklist players if you notice them doing this, or having a $h!tty connection, etc..

Capcom is stuck in the past, and have seriously lost their way.  Without some serious reorganization within their ranks, I don't think they will stay relevant in gaming much longer. I would love for them to prove me wrong on this, but as I see it, this is the current state of affairs.

Unless you're willing to pay 2-3x the cost of the game itself in DLC, steer VERY clear of this game. Even if you do spend all that it takes to unlock the things that should be unlockable in the game itself, or available for a reasonable price ($1.99 per character, for example), you will be met with poorly made netcode for online battles, and long waits to even get into a match, only to pray it isnt a lag-fest, which it will be 50%+ of the time.",1509668175,1511398225,FALSE,129,2,0.830660939,7,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.66E+16,217,6,2837,0,2621,1556043026

Almost 2 years later, the roster's doubled (with paid DLC) and online is finally more stable and has rage quit penalties, but the game's still in an unfinished state without even an arcade mode and would be very lacking in content even with one. It's at a point where you can play it and almost not feel bad about your life choices, but why bother when you could just play a better game?",1510961725,1510961725,FALSE,4,0,0.475251764,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.66E+16,123,1,497,0,497,1462322797
30,Street Fighter V,36582128,english,"Nearly two years after release I think SFV is finally polished enough and enjoyable. If you're new to the game though I'd wait for the soon upcoming Arcade Edition that will likely be much more value (or get the game off a sale at any rate). Gameplay wise it's great, wide roster of characters and most of the old favorites are there at this point, I like the V skill system and I'm having a blast playing the redesigned Juri. The new characters added so far have been very interesting as well and additions like Menat and Zeku have redeemed the character design quite a lot. The game does feel more approachable and less heavy than USFIV, or that's the impression I got learning it.

The only downside is that the publishers have been really, really awful with this game. Everything about it is still overpriced and it's taken them this long to get the game to an overall better state with more content. I commend them that at least it's still running but I think it would be better off costing half its base price atm on all content. Hopefully Arcade Edition will be tons better for the game overall. I actually gave up on the game for a good while a year ago but the new content updates and character changes drove me back.

Capcom is listening to the fans and continously supports the game, with a huge update planned for previous owners in January that will add a LOT of extra content.

It's optimized well, and I have never really had any problems with crashing or glitches. The netcode isn't as bad as everyone says, but it will occasionally hitch if you or your opponet do not have okay internet. All in all, I absolutely love this game and am super hyped up for the upcoming update and support.

51,Street Fighter V,24898517,english,"Well, I bought this game about a year ago or so, and I thought that by now this game would be up to the level they promised it would be a year ago. The game only came out with 12 characters and barely any modes. Turns out all they did was make the rest of the stuff that SHOULD'VE been in the game at release behind a paywall. So, if you want more than 12 characters and like six stages in your fighting game that you paid $60 for in 2017, then you'll have to go somewhere else. Sure, you CAN unlock the characters via in-game currency, but as of now the system is grindy as hell. Pretty much all characters are 100,000 ""fight points"", the currency which you can earn via fighting online and playing story mode. Story mode gives a good amount of fight points, but not enough for a character, and if I remember correctly you can only earn fight points from it once. Winning an online match gives you 50 fight points, so if you wanted to unlock a SINGLE character via playing online, you'd have to WIN 2,000 matches. There are a few other modes in the game, like character stories, tutorials and survival mode, but the former two are like the main story where you can only earn money once, and survival mode sports a similar grind to online, but without the fun of actually fighting another person. Currently to get all of the fighters, you're looking at an extra $50 on top of the base price of $60. If you're a human being who values money, then I suggest you spend it elsewhere.

66,Street Fighter V,35642307,english,"I hate that Capcom released this game in an alpha state, but as of now it is a pretty good game, expecially if you play online

Good:
-Easy combo system, there are no 1 link frames. That's a very good think for me, because playing mostly online the lag can screw off my timing if the combos have a strict execution
-A lot of players, it's very easy to find online matches (at least in Europe), also thanks to the PS4 cross-play
-Most characters are very well done
-Large variety of characters
-Large selection of stages
-Tutorials for Beginners
-A lot of options in training mode
-You can buy almost anything in the game with fight money. If you finish the story modes and do some survivals/trials it's not that hard to earn over 1 million fight money. DLC characters cost 100.000 fight money, so that's not bad at all
-The netcode has some flaws, but has been improved. It's surely better than SF4, at least there's some sort of rollback
-The lobbies finally work quite well. When the game was released they were a mess
-The ranking system works quite well now, rage quit is punished and in ranked matches you usually find opponents of your level
-The music and sounds are quite good

Bad:
-There's not an huge variety of combos
-The gameplay is too much aggressive, the rushdown game is much more rewarding than zoning and defence. That can be annoying if you prefer some variety or simply prefer defence over offence. I'm a rushdown player myself, but I'd like to play versus more defensive characters/opponents
-A lot of guessing game, you can win or lose a game for single good or bad guess. That can be frustrating, because you can feel that you lost or won by luck and not skill
-I find harder to punish unsafe moves here compared to SF4, the frame data, spacing and animations of a lot of moves are made in a way that makes harder to punish them
-Some characters have an ugly expression in the select screen (mostly Ken and Ibuki)
-The netcode is not bad but could be surely improved. Sometimes only one player has lag, while for the other one it runs smoothly
-Not all stages have corner animations
-The taunts are too slow and it's pretty much impossible to use them in a real match, I'd like to see shorter ones
-No arcade mode (but they will put it in the SFV:AE update in january 2018)

The gameplay and overall feel are reminiscent of older iterations (ST, 3S) and heavily favors offence. This alone makes it a step forward from 4. The lack of defensive char (besides guile) can be a con to players with a more cautious playstyle though.

The balance overall and diversity of the cast really shines too and one can earn easily enough fight money to try any char of interest. The netcode is far from perfect but competent enough and PC/PS4 crossplay means a really healthy pool of players online.

76,Street Fighter V,35445676,english,"I really enjoy SF5 despite it having several shortcomings. 

The main selling point for me is SF5's smooth gameplay. I think this might be more personal taste but having really fluid movement at all times sets this game apart from many more mechanically stiff fighters. I feel this allows for a better more gradual learning curve for new players and doesn't immediatly force you into a stringent play style. 

I also really like the overall look and feel of SF5. It has amazing animation quality, a great soundtrack, and a fun cartoony aesthetic that have always been strengths of the franchise. 

The character roster is diverse and caters to many different play styles. Many characters that I initially didn't think I'd like ended up being some of my favorites. Some still need some rebalancing but all in all I'm pretty pleased with the current lineup.

The game features things like Story mode, Survival mode, Training, and Challenges but those are also pretty much staples in fighters so I feel  they fall more into that middle ground of ""these need to be included"" rather than being a straight positive or negative. I would call them adequate in SF5.

As far as negatives go, of which there are a few, I will try to go over some that bothered me the most.

Arcade Mode: Where is it? Maybe not the worst of the games negatives but I liked Arcade mode and I miss not having it. Also with the way the game feels somwhat unfinished it's even more noticeablely absent. Rumor is they will be adding one soon though, hopefully. Also if they do release one I hope they don't use just the base characters and stages  but also allow any DLC ones you've aquired to be used in it as well.

Fight Money: An in game currency earned by leveling up fighters, by beating certain challenges, and playing online matches might be the best/worst idea in a modern video game. At first it's great that you can earn Fight Money to unlock DLC characters,  skins, and various other things without having to pay real money. However, in tying a large amount of content to a virtual currency they've also created bottlenecks (like 100 round Survival mode) to slow and ultimately frustrate players into spending real money instead. Almost everything extra in the game has some kind of price tag attached and at times playing becomes more about gaming the system then enjoying the game. I feel like this also allows them to charge more than normal for certain things or even omit things that might have been included in a game without the feature.

Online play: Online consists of Casual (non ranked), Ranked, and a Battle Lounge which allows you meet up with 8 people and gives you more customization options. These are pretty good varitions but a couple things hurt online play. 
Lag. It's not uncommon to run into lag in online games but usually they do a better job of matchmaking. Using the default settings of 3-5, meaning trying to connect to another player with a ""3"" above average connection to a"" 5 "" good connection, will still dump you into matches with horrendous lag and the only solution is to block everyone who lags bad. Why have a filter that supposedly does that but doesn't work half the time? 
The other problem with online matches ties into character leveling and Fight Money. Because a small amount of experience is earned during online matches whether you win or lose and because leveling earns Fight Money people are constantly afk queuing using everything from scripted bots to holding down a kick button on a turbo controller to earn exp. 
The combination of those two things can make playing online a real hassle sometimes.

I probably could have given SF5 a negative rating based on either of the last two things but ultimately I think despite it's problems it's still one of the best fighting games I've ever played and continues to be improved upon.",1507038543,1507260632,TRUE,1,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.66E+16,99,7,110186,0,5607,1596311610

78,Street Fighter V,35424422,english,"Sorry folks, I can't recommend this game. I've played it a lot but I've struggled with it horribly. 

Cons:
-Capcom's business model, they'll go as low as it's needed to squeeze every dollar out of you.
-Too many 50-50 situations, especially when a character was knocked down and he's about to get up. The game needs a refreshing 3rd option at least in wake ups, to make the game less basic. Characters like Laura and Mika are especially annoying to play against because of the 50-50 system.
-The netcode for lobbies works horribly for some countries/ISPs, and this is mainly why I stopped playing this game. The game either works perfectly (with people that are somewhat nearby), or is completely unplayable with the very same people, depending on if the lobby set was randomly assigned to work from P2P or not.
-Matchmaking and going from one ranked/casual match to the next is slow. Even having fiber optic I've had to wait more than 10 minutes to find a match some times (looking for connections of 4 and 5 bars only).
-They intentionally made some characters look ugly to force you to buy (with real money) their classic costumes (check Akuma and Ibuki).
-You cannot play keyboard vs controller. You can play 1-player modes with keyboard if you want, but if you want to play 2-players local, you're forced to have 2 controllers.
-You can't assign the keys to whatever key you want in your keyboard without an external program, however, you can change what each button does from within the keys you're forced to use.
-When the game updates, you have to download around 10 gb.
-When you go to the stage/character select screen, instead of feeling happy for finally being able to play the game you bought, you'll feel punished because there are so many stages/characters that are locked.
-Fight money (in-game currency) was planned to benefit Capcom, not the players. I'll explain myself: it's impossible for you to buy all the characters, all the costumes, all the colors and all the stages even if you play 24/7. In fact, you wouldn't even be able to just buy all the characters if you played 24/7.
-Capcom's support, even though it's fast to answer, is not very helpful, and they can be disrespectful at times.
-Some of the character's faces don't really look like how the characters were in the past games. It's sad because some other characters like Chun and Ryu look so beautifully done.
-Story mode is: movie, fight, fight, movie, movie, movie, fight, fight, fight... you get it.
-Objectification of some of the female characters. There was some objectification in SF4, but it's gone to the next level here.

Pros:
-The fighting system is very accessible in comparison to the previous SF games, especially at the time of doing combos.
-Crush counters are very pleasant to land. Some people take crush counters as a negative, but in my opinion they're a welcome addition.
-VTrigger system replaces Ultras from SF4.
-Crossplay between PC and PS4.
-You can play as many of your favorite old SF characters (many with ugly new designs though, if you want the classic versions you have to pay extra).

My biggest beef is regarding the two choices for DLC characters: 

Spend $50 more to unlock 12 out of the 28 total playable characters (ALMOST A HALF OF THE ROSTER): $20 and $30 for 6 characters each. It's a cashgrab, nothing too new in the business.

OR

Spend days grinding enough FM (SFV currency) to buy one. If you're planning to spend FM on characters you can forget about buying other stages or costumes unless you still have the tenacity to grind FM for those as well. Honestly it feels more like a grindy MMORPG than a 2D fighter.

[b]Other Notes:[/b]

-I will say graphics aren't terrible if your setup can handle it.

-There's voice acting in multiple languages including ENG and JAP.

-Gameplay mechanics get quite advanced: cancels, links, reversals, true combos, etc. all differ with each character (although many share simularities)

-The characters are stereotyped to the core. Good or bad? I can't decide.

-The Street Fighter story is a fustercluck, even the devs know it. Therefore we can only get fragments of lore, never a linear backstory. Most of the fragmented bits bring more questions than answers.

-Doesn't really encourage replayability except online.

4,Street Fighter V,26913753,english,"Note : this is the third review I'm doing on this title. the original one was ~40hrs online gameplay and I rated it positive. 
We're now in 2017, second season.

The game being almost about human VS human gameplay so I'll rate this here.

Now after +100hours of online gameplay :
At short term with friends the game is fun, much more than the initial release, after the multiples patches but....it is STILL absolutlety in any way balanced, making it infuriating for network play.

Balance being critical in a game with large characters roster it is the very precise point which permit the review to rise or fall.
Unfortunately it falls, really, really down.

The game core actually lacks the presence of actuals goldens rules (main rules you'll never break no matter what).
The goldens rules should put the main game accessible and action/reaaction learnable and results understable by the players.
In this game, be prepared to be anti-aired by straight low punch, ultra being stopped by similar situation and so on...

The second flaw is that the characters roster is growing larger on a regular basis and the general character balancing doesn't evolve correctly to fix the 1st point.
Introducing more and more characters with obviously bad ideas such as:
* zoning though fireballs high firing rate
* 40% + juggle combo damages
* multiple normals being anti-air (of course one isn't enough, lets give them 2, 3 or more...)
* ...leaving more than half the roster with no tool to be useful in combat situation.

In network VS you'll find the same 5 characters over and over due to this evident lack of balancing.
It provides a really bad feeling at long term as the game seems disabled of more than half its potential (and it grows worst due to the arrival of new characters).

The whole SFV gameplay is a battle of action/reaction but it also fails hard here.
Having a human opponent at the other end doesn't helps : the gameplay gives almost no room for personnal expression and creativity : you'll always see the same strategies over and over and its boring if not frustrating.
In a regular round you tend to expect being able to read about 8 to 12 times the actions of your opponent and react accordingly ( or fail and be punished ). In SFV it is reduced far too low; expect a battle to be a 3 to 5 read at most. Multiples characters tends to do high output damage with quick stun effect behind leaving you open to much more damage. I think damage reduce is not correctly tuned here.

15,Street Fighter V,34855050,english,"Summary:
Contains the fundamental goodness of the SF series. Ruined by careless optimization/porting, freemium content, and design direction.
Not worth $60 CAD. Only worth if <$20 CAD.

As a beginner who is entering into the fighting game genre, I would not recommend this particular version of Street Fighter. The delay from your attacks is only obvious after you have played a more responsive game like Skullgirls. IMO playing this version actually has a negative effect of making a noobie spam his attacks hoping the response will go through.

Gameplay:
[+]Combo System
Great if you can pull it off. I do enjoy the difficulty of having more strict inputs compared to skull girls and having to learn what moves can link together.
[+]V-Skills
The V-skill addition is enjoyable. It adds a uniqueness to each character. Particularly in my case I enjoyed Juri's dash and Ryu's counter.

[-]Input Delay
As you have probably read from everywhere, the input lag is very noticable and really inhibits the joy of this game. Imagine playing a MOBA game of around 60ms, you click and theres clearly something wrong, but you can't put your finger on it until you realize the timing of the game is clearly mismatching from what you expected.
[-]Story is subpar
For those who enjoy the singleplayer part. The story is not very interesting. It is alot of build up that gets nowhere and alot of repeated character match ups. Furthermore, there are no cutscenes but there is voice acting, instead you are treated to a story-board style, barely colored, 'cutscene'. If this was the style Capcom was aiming for it heavily falls short compared to SFIV. Otherwise, I would write it off as Capcom cutting the funding/focus on this portion of the game and simply doing only a below-satisfactory job. (C- at best.)
[-]Freemium
I am bias towards these type of marketing strategies. If the game is going to include DLC content that cost money, the base game better be cheap or full of content. SFV is neither.
I find it rediculous that the base game, with so many bugs for PC, is priced at around $60 CAD ($40 USD) (at the time of my purchase). Additionally, the new characters all cost additional money and the 'ingame cash' you can accumulate is hard to come by. You have get a few 'dailies' that reward around 100, and you get some for winning ranked matches, You need a whopping 4000000 or some huge amount to actually buy a character. (It is possible to get around 2 characters for free if you finish all the story possible, repeating the story DOES NOT reward the ingame cash again). If Capcom really wanted to charge for characters, the base game should've at least been priced at around $30 USD. 

Technical:
[+]Netcode
In most games I've played, there is no noticable 'lag' if you wanna call it that. Of course, it is quite hard to tell anyways thanks to the input delay, but overall gameplay is consistent.

[-]Terrible Optimization for PC
The game itself on steam is quite terrible IMO. I run a triple monitor setup and I CANNOT alt-tab. If I do the game will eat up all my memory (Win10, GTX980, i5-3570K, 8GB RAM for those who are spec-obsessed). I believe I am well within range of running this game and this issue occurs on low-spec mode. So I can only conclude it is a coding issue on the developer's part.
[-]Fundamental Bugs
If I do a combo challenge, then exit to training mode and put in some inputs, this results in the game crashing from a memory violation. I figure its a coding issue as well since I can't see why this would be due to specs (still occurs when ran as admininistrator).",1505026903,1505041177,FALSE,4,0,0.523809552,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.66E+16,143,3,1721,0,1548,1572851919

21,Street Fighter V,34739221,english,"  TLDR: While it has the same classic gameplay as original Street Fighter titles, the lack of content is inexcusable.

  I played Street Fighter IV back when it first came out quite a bit and while I was never very good I still had fun playing it. The stylized graphics and soundtrack were both high points and it had very solid gameplay. Now comes Street Fighter V which has almost identical features so one should reason that its at least as good, right? Wrong.

  The game is a carbon copy of Street Fighter IV with a few exceptions. The storyline mode is a DLC which, if you have to wait to download instead of it just downloading with the rest of the game. This may not be that bad, generally just requiring some patience, but it is annoying. On the other hand, the lack of playable characters in the start is the heaviest weight attatched to this game. You get a few characters which come standard, but then there are a whole host of characters which you must purchase seperately. This wouldn't be too bad if it was a couple of special characters but this is used with almost half of the characters including some high-profile main characters like Guile, and Balrog. As if this wasn't bad enough there are also stages which must be purchased as well. There are a total of 22 stages and half of these are a DLC purchase.

  If you have the disposable income to spend to unlock half of a game which you must pay a full $40.00 (USD) for at the beginning anway and are a massive Street Fighter fan, then go for it.

Once you have learned these concepts, you will begin to understand how it is a give and take relationship. If you can use this information and do these things to your opponent, they can do them right back. If you have a situation where only one person in a match has knowledge of one or multiple of these things, the player that lacks the knowledge is at a severe disadvantage and will hinder their progress.

Besides the technical stuff, there is also fundamental gameplay strategies and mechanical execution that need to be constantly trained during matches and/or in training mode. A combination of all of this stuff will lead you to the progress you seek. Most importantly of all though is the sheer amount of games you need to play in order to learn the matchups and be exposed to all types of gameplay styles and strategies. 

The biggest issue with SFV is the netcode and matchmaking system. It's not crazy to expect ""5"" bar connections to be worse than 1 bar connections. Often you will get matched against people out of country or VERY far away from you and the game will claim that it is a ""5"" bar or ""4"" bar connection when it is obviously not. This is a problem with the matchmaking system and seems to have gotten worse since the NEW CFN was released. Also, the netcode could use some work. After watching a talk about GGPO and how they deal with rollback and ""The Rift"", it is clear SFV netcode does nothing about this Rift. This causes a lot of 1 sided rollback in most cases (where one player will have about 1-2 frames of rollback while the other has double or triple that amount). Capcom has even bought a license for GGPO in the past but is not using it or a similar structure for SFV's netcode at the moment. GGPO eliminates this one sidedness by evenly distributing the frames of rollback to each player.

TL;DR - Fun game if you find a character you really like playing. If you want to get good, then learn about frame traps, meaties, and frame data. On top of that make sure to practice fundamental strategies (like anti airs and footsies) and use training mode to practice your character's setups. Also # of games = improved ability over time due to experience with matchups and other people's strategies. Finally, Capcom needs to fix their matchmaking system and improve their netcode!",1503909813,1503909813,TRUE,26,0,0.611281514,1,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.66E+16,345,1,188200,0,78694,1597121328

My No recommendation comes from something else however, how shit the PC version is. On booting the game for the first time, you will be greeted with the ToS for SFV. There are no button prompts on the screen. After you finally guess the right key to move forward your dropped into a tutorial that shows Xbox button prompts even if no keyboard is connected. THERE ARE NO KEY PROMPTS IN THIS GAME AT ALL. All the menus and even rebinding show as Xbox buttons. Whats even worse is that you can't change where these buttons are located on your keyboard. Hope you like WASD/Arrows and GHJKBNM, for your binds. Yes I play with a keyboard because i love the feeling of it. But when I need to use a 3rd party program to EDIT my KEY BINDS you fucked up on all levels along with playing a guessing game of what does what in menus due to Xbox prompts.

And the worst part is, SFV Is an UNREAL ENGINE 4 GAME, which means NONE OF THE ISSUES SHOULD EVEN EXIST since the UE4 CAN EASILY SUPPORT REBINDING AND GOOD UI PROMPTS.

And to anyone who says ""Oh its okay cause autohotkey can fix it"". 1 I do use it, 2 it ruins the ability to search for people by name since I can no longer use UIOJKL due to them being rebound and 3 if AHK ever runs into an issue and crashes it means im fucked for the match.

Cons:
A good roster of characters are locked
Cannot unlock costumes through points
Switching characters to play online is bit annoying

Pros:
All locked, and future DLC characters you can get them with points instead of having to buy them
Really well balance into matching on rank games
Allow a 2/3 win system in rank
Diverse character playstyle

Comparison to SFIV:
This might turn some people off, I didn't like the V gauge, some character's Gauge power is very strong where it can change the tide of the game
There are a lot of new characters added  and removed and there are more to come. 
Some characters you know fight style have change and will have you play them differently, but not enough where the character seem like a stranger.
Combos for some characters can do a lot of damage and are easier to perform compare to SFIV
Some connection problem still happens but definitely a lot better than SFIV

Overall I think it still a SF game but also feel like it drifting to combo base fighting game but it no where near there yet. SFV it a solid fighting game now. I know most launch game including always have a lot of problem but now it all good!

[u]Accessibility-[/u]
Street Fighter V has many simple mechanics, allowing for newer players to be able to compete without being completely bulldozed by more experienced players. This can also harm the game, seeing as it allows less skillful players to come out as the victor in many matches, even at high level play. Core-A-Gaming offers an amazing analysis as to what this can mean for the game and it's health here: https://youtu.be/iSgA_nK_w3A

[u]Gameplay-[/u]
Street Fighter V does offer some exhilarating gameplay, with many exciting moments coming from reads, reactions, and various combo strings. There's a stigma in fighting games saying that they aren't much fun until you have memorized long strings of combos, but that doesn't have to be the deal in this installment of the Street Fighter series. There are some easier imput characters like Zangief and Ed to allow newer players to enjoy the game without having to constantly perform the numerous motions required to pull of a long combo. You can even perform guranteed strings of damage without having to consistanly perform ""1-frame-links"" or ""plinking"" making regular controllers competetively viable.

[u]Community-[/u]
There may be some rude individuals sprinkled here and there amoungst the Street Fighter V community, but that's a given with any online community nowadays. There are many places for new and experienced players to enjoy and discuss the game, my main recommendation being the [url=https://www.reddit.com/r/StreetFighter/] Street Fighter Subreddit [/url] . They offer lots of insight on gameplay, new techniques for various characters, jokes, and fanart. There are also many insightful guides all throughout Youtube for every character.

[u]Downsides-[/u]
While this game is, in my opinion, a great installment in the Street Fighter franchise, it does come with its own downsides. Capcom makes many mistakes when it comes to the balance to this game. For example, the fairly recent nerf to DPs (i.e.: Cammy's Cannon Spike, Ryu/Akuma/Ken's Shoryuken, etc.) made it so they no longer have initial invinsibility frames if you don't spend a EX meter on it. This came because newer players were having trouble countering this, thus Capcom nerfed it rather than have these players learn and adapt. The game also offers few defensive options, allowing for more aggressive ""button-mashers"" to win more games due to players being unable to defensively maneuver and weave through these attacks with V-reversals or specials. Street Fighter V can also drive away more competitive players. The lessened skill gap between top players and lower skill players takes away from the skill portion from the game and replaces it with some luck, giving some unfair advantages.

But all in all, I believe that Street Fighter V is an amazing game worth picking up if you are new to playing fighting games.

26,Street Fighter V,33644062,english,"After many hours, a great number of ranked matches and late night lobbies, and a couple local tournaments, I can finally say confidently that I do not recommend this game.

The singleplayer content is barebones and not at all worth playing. This is fine in a competitive fighting game, since the focus is more on competitive multiplayer. If you're not interested in that, take a hard pass on Street Fighter V and play a fighting game with worthwhile singleplayer content. Guilty Gear Xrd is a good one.

Mechanically, the game isn't bad at all. It's fairly simple, with a modest amount of easy to understand mechanics that lead to interesting gameplay. It's also popular, so you can always find people online to play with. It's not a difficult game to pick up, and it's more accessible and rewarding than most other fighting games. That said, I still have a few problems with the gameplay.

Namely:
* Defensive options are awful. This is why high level play is just watching people do meaty setups on eachother. It's also why throw loops are as prevalent as they are.
* Questionable design decisions, such as removing frame 1 invuln from all meterless DPs. This really skews the risk/reward of those moves, which is an odd choice from a game franchise that's so rooted in pure and simple fighting game fundamentals.
* Timing is sort of strange. It's a game with 3 frame normals, so things like blockstrings and meaty attacks need to be pretty airtight. If they're not (and it's hard for them to be with any sort of network stutter in the mix) then mashing light buttons will get you out of a lot of situations. This should be a bad habit, but it's rewarding in this game for some reason.
* The input delay/netcode makes it feel pretty unresponsive. If you're coming from other fighting games, expect to get hit by many fullscreen moves (Balrog's rush punches, Cammy's EX spiral arrow, Ken's EX tatsu) if you don't block preemptively.

In terms of everything aside from the gameplay, it's an inexcusable travesty. The netcode is terrible, and even on wired connections with people in my own hometown it feels jerky and frustrating. Other fighting games add input delay, or seem to run the game in slow motion. SFV just teleports you from one connected attack to the next so you can watch yourself die in a jerky mess of unreactable attacks. The netcode also seems to send all the lag to the person with better internet. I remember having a really good night on ranked with seemingly stable connections and slow witted opponents, only to later realize I had been torrenting and my sister had been watching Netflix, presumably sending all the lag to my opponents.

Unlocking characters, costumes, colors, and stages requires either making microtransactions with real world money, or spending ingame currency, which is extremely limited and for the most part non-renewable. You get 50 fight money for a win in a ranked match, zero for a loss. Characters cost 100,000 fight money each. You do the math. All the good cosmetics in this game are behind paywalls that you'd expect to see in free to play games. But it's a full price triple-A title, and the character season passes are also inexcusably expensive.

Capcom has been pretty terrible with supporting this game as well. Patches are frequently delayed by weeks if not months, and it's missing many quality of life changes that should have been included at time of release (eg. saving battle lounge settings when the game closes, or being able to skip the awful tutorial on a fresh install). They also straight up lied about a Linux release. That was supposed to happen concurrent with the Windows release, but there has been no word from Capcom on that front.

I could go on. There's been a very long train of disappointments with this game, and you shouldn't hop on it. Maybe they'll release Super Street Fighter V as the rumors say, and then I'll give this review another revision, but I don't see things changing for the better. The game is still going to be expensive, laggy, and unsatisfying. But it's got a lot of players, so it's got that going for it.

Crossplay is very nice though. I wish more fighting games had that.",1500437774,1500437774,FALSE,195,1,0.900487065,12,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.66E+16,430,7,9805,0,8009,1516514879
27,Street Fighter V,33641618,english,"A few months back i tried to get back into fighting games after being burnt out on the genre because of those 3d anime arena fighting games. After trying to play injustice some more and not really finding the passion to play it more I bought Mortal Kombat X, it felt like it was just more of injustice. I got this game as well as skullgirls during the summer sale. I didn't 100% like the feel of skullgirls, and at first I didn't like this one either. 

The opening tutorial was a little bland, but I fell in love with this game once I went into versus and played a few rounds with my brother.  The game is amazing in my personal opinion, its the first fighting game I've played since I first got soulcalibur 5 for the xbox that I've wanted to play all the time. I know this game has a bad rep because of launch issues and the fact that its not SF4 (which I personally disliked), but I'm hoping this game is suffering from the same thing that SF3 did, where people were mad that it was different but eventually loved it just like with how SF3 is seen now.

pros:
+ Gameplay is fun and easy to learn
+ Cool story mode
+ Fun to play with friends/siblings

1. Net code is still broken, and take forever to find a match.
2. People spamming game imbalances is just unreal. I expected for the game to take a lot of raw talent, but the game is so unbalanced, some people's move sets and switchups just cannot be beat (e.g. Zangiefs throw overiding everyone else in the games throws)
3. Story mode absolutely sucked. It took a long wait for it, and every single fight is so easy until you have to fight Bison, at which time the difficulty increases 10X of the other story mode fights.
4. Having to ""earn"" in game money to get characters that should be unlockied by playing through the story a few times, is a complete money and time grab. Capcom barely put any characters in this game. C'mon!!!
5. Tons of lag switchers making it impossible to win. You'll dominate a round, and tall of a sudden they junk out of you by teleporting everywhere.
6. Lag in general is bad.

First let's get the elephant in the room out of the way... 

[b]The business model is utterly atrocious.[/b] I understand fighting games have a hard time making bank, but this is not the way to treat the consumer. Additional characters, stages, skins, etc can either be bought with money or the in-game currency, Fight Money. For the average day working person you will not realistically purchase everything with Fight Money so you either deal with that or cave.... However, with that out of the way...

To slam the gameplay is completely unfair based on displeasure of how they deal with content unlocks.

I will not compare it to Tekken 7 because they are very different, and both great in there own right. SF5 is much more welcome to newcomers but very difficult to master.

-Some characters were changed for the worst, such as M. Bison losing his great walkspeed and psycho crusher as a normal move. Zangief lost his green hand, anti-air lariat, and his jump leaves you open to other anti airs.

SFV is one of the most expensive games I have ever seen, period, especially for a fighting game. Without any discounts, the full price of this game is 138 USD. Keep in mind that as of writing this (July 2017), the game has been out for over 1 year (realeased Feb 2016). Compare this to other fighting games in 2016 like Guilty Gear Xrd Rev.

The main issue with SFV is that Capcom has fallen for the familiar DLC con of making you pay for the slightest addition. Yes, you can earn in-game fight money to get around this, but unlike other Street Fighter games, it's nigh on impossible to unlock everything without paying cash. Also, certain costumes must be paid for, irrespective of how much fight money you earn.

The lack of an arcade mode is possibly the worst part about this game, and this is simply unacceptable for a product in this genre. Survival mode is a poor substitute that is, frankly, rather annoying.

When it comes to fighting VS another player, its great but making the game more simple than past entries of the franchaise does not help non FGC players get into it since the tutorial does not capture your atention as GGXRD, many fighthing games are guilty of this but as a game that went trough the truble of watering down the depth of combos and defensive options, the lack of a good tutorial makes this changes pointless to new comers to fighters in general.

But i would still recomend the game to new comers, not because of the game itself, but for the Fighting Game Community, the FGC often helps new players get into it!, and SFV is a good starting point if you are interested in the FGC in the sligthest, you may not like the game as much as others but it serves as a gateway to other fighters that you may enjoy more.

As a fighting game, it's fine, with a great selection of really diverse characters, interesting mechanics, really good character balance and more depth than people give it credit for. 

The problem is the overall package that said fighting game mechanics come in. While the combo trials and character tutorials are well above average for the genre, Street Fighter 5 on PC is laughably poorly optimized and still lacks many key of the key features that you would find in literally every other game in the genre - the complete lack of an arcade mode being the most noteable. The game also comes with disturbingly long load times, heavy emphasis on DLC-schemes  and it won't work well with a surprising amount of controllers.

The story mode is shallow, the survival mode manages to be both exceptionally repetitive and almost entirely luck-based, 
 and once you're done with them, all the game really has to offer is a variety of training modes and playing others online.

If you have a high-end computer, are primarily interested in playing online and you're fine with things like regular balance overhauls that can completely change the meta, using vanilla Xbox controllers or sticks and a heavy focus on DLC - this game might be for you.

99,Street Fighter V,32797639,english,"Street Fighter V was a massive disappointment on launch, and sadly has done very little to fix the still lingering problems that plagued its debut.

Street Fighter V is a very underwhelming package at its price. Included is your standard versus and training modes, an incredibly underwhelming and trivially easy cinematic story mode, a single-player ""survival"" mode, and online multiplayer.

If you are not a competitive player, there is nothing here for you. Survival is a boring distraction, and the cinematic story mode, in addition to being terribly written and absolutely no fun to experience, is trivivally easy (there is a video of an actual infant winning a match from the story mode by mashing buttons on a stick. No, that's not a joke.)

For those more like myself, for whom single player is a secondary concern, the multiplayer aspect, both online and off, leaves much to be desired. The online matchmaking is incredibly slow, and the netcode incredibly unstable, with frequent rollbacks which anecdotal evidence has suggested typcally only affects one player at a time, leaving for some incredibly frustrating matches. Local versus mode is functional (kind of hard to screw up), but has some baffling UI decisions, like the inability for player 2 to return to the character select screen, requiring player one to initiate it. This has been a problem for a year now, and there have been no attempts to fix it.

Now, the game itself. Be warned, a lot of this is going to be largely subjective, but I don't think I'm being too rash in saying some of my opinions are widely shared by the community at large.

Street Fighter V is a game that is focused on offense to a fault. For those fans of more aggressive fighting games like Guilty Gear, Marvel vs. Capcom. or older ground-based fighters like Street Fighter III: 3rd Strike and The King of Fighters, this might sound like a very good thing, indeed. The important thing to note, however, is all of the aforementioned games balance the offense-heavy meta with very potent defensive mechanics (I won't list them all lest this review become a senior thesis).

Street Fighter V has very few defensive mechanics, and those that are there are very underpowered, making many of the higher-tier characters extremely frustrating to deal with, as you have no recourse other than eat their pressure and mixups, and with normals being extremely short, stubby, and slow, footsies feel neutered and fighting to keep yourself out of those dangerous mixup situations is harder than it reasonably should be.

There is always the possibility that this could be fixed in the future, but the updates that have been released thus far suggest Capcom will make these problems worse, rather than better. The temporary damage received from blocking medium and heavy normals has been increased, invincible reversals have lost their invincibility, and V-reversals (a strike-invincible attack done out of block stun to escape pressure) have been slowed down, making them easier to bait with a throw. Not to mention, the individual character balance changes are simply baffling. The first balance update nerfed many low-tier characters, and nerfed others to the point of uselessness, while leaving the more problematic characters unchanged when further updates were released. 

I'm honestly amazed how badly Capcom screwed up with this game. I used to talk trash on the problems SFIV had, with its numerous option-selects, vortex mixups, and other goofy parts of the meta, but Street Fighter V makes those all appear incredibly minor in comparison. 

I cannot recommend this game. If you're a casual, there is nothing here to enjoy. If you play competitively, maybe this is your bag, but it's definitely not mine, and there are plenty of people who will agree with me on that.",1498445683,1498445683,FALSE,3,0,0.504506469,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.66E+16,652,49,5183,0,4492,1596770858

The offline mode has little to do, this game is mostly about the online play. That said, the online aspect is fairly good. Matches happen rather frequently even if waiting on 5* connections to play with. There isn't a lot of characters in game, but they are all well done and most feel balanced. One thing I cannot get behind is paying $30+ for 6 new characters every time they come out, or how about $40 for 16 costumes? The game itself at $50 is hard enough to choke down, let alone paying $90 for the rest of the roster. 

I do really enjoy the game though, the gameplay could be a little more defensive but it works for a noob like me. V trigger combos and critical arts are some of the things I don't like, as I prefer my PvP to be unadulterated with power-ups and amazing half-health dealing combos, but It dosen't ruin the experience.

The mechanics are so screwed up that you can control the entire round but still lose because your opponent got one crush counter and you guessed wrong on the one 50/50. Might as well just spam the same move over and over and hope for that crush counter.

24,Street Fighter V,25002798,english,"A good game with some problems

don't let the internet hate brigade fool you. this is a great fighting game. But it does have issues that need to be addressed

the good:

1) Crossplay with PS4. 
this is the single greatest advantage SF5 has over every other fighting game on steam. A fighting game lives and dies with it's player population. a fighting game with nobody to play with is not a fighting game at all. While SF4 had a decent player population throughout it's run it pales in comparison to the amount of people playing this game.

2) 3 frame input buffer. 
some people list this as a con; I could not disagree more. the 3 frame input buffer adds an extra 2 frames of input leniency meaning that a 1 frame link on paper becomes a 3 frame link in practice. this single change makes the game 10x more fun in an online setting because you can actually do combos. and learning combos comes much faster. with a lowered execution barrier the more stratigic elements (ie: the fun part) is availible to more people. some might bemoan the fact that more people can pull off flashier combos with less work. but I think the more people experiencing higher levels of play the better. being able to do combos encourages people to stick with the game and learn the more difficult mental aspects 

3) decent online
I won't lie, this game does not have the best online netcode. look towards Skull Girls or Killer Instict for that. But it is not the horror show some make it out to be. It is a definite improvement over SF4. I played that game for 6 years and it's old fashioned delayed input necode was poor on all but the best connections. the constantly changing input timings made attempting combos a useless effort. it stunted my advancement as a player. SF5 uses rollback netcode that preserves input timings at the expense of some visual stuttering. where as SF4 would actually slow the game down in laggy conditions, this game will snap the game back. both formats are unplayable in a bad connection but this one is much better in middling connections. Online is where you are going to be spending the majority of your time in SF5 and over the last year I have had a lot of fun. one thing worth mentioning, the matchmaking for ranked and casual matches does a good job of matching you with players either at your rank, one below, or one above. however it does take longer than it should to find a match.

4) DLC practices
yes, you read that right, this games DLC practices are a pro, not a con. esspecially compared to the way other fighting games handle DLC. first, you can earn characters for free. and yes, it *IS* possible to do. most fight money is earned in single player at first. but after that you will be getting it from the weekly challenges. most weeks offer between 6.6K and 10.6K per week in fight money. you also earn 1K every time you level up a character. it is also important to remember that when you get a new character they come with more single player content that you can earn FM in. new characters come out roughly every two months and in that time it is absolutely possible to earn the 100k neccesary with 3-4 hours a week of play time. 

now I should mention that while it is possible to keep up with the release schedule, if you are just now jumping in you will not be able to earn enough FM to get all the characters for free as much of the FM that others have used to do that were in the form of challenges that have expired. so if you are buying this game for the first time you need to ask yourself if you really care about getting every character, and if you do it is probably a good idea to get at least one of the character passes. after that you should be able to keep up with the DLC release schedule and not have to spend money on new characters.

compare that to other fighting games, Arc games hide all updatese behind paywalls and sometimes charge more for individual characters on top of that. NRS characters always cost money and ussually have to be bought in packs. it is easy to look at SF5 and say it has a lot of DLC characters, and it does. but compared to the way the competition handles things I think this is much better

5) Training mode
don't overlook this mode. the tools you will find in the menu's here will help you immensly. there is too much to talk about in a review but do yourself a favor and look up a training mode tutorial on you tube.

6) Capcom Fighters Network (CFN)
like training mode, this thing is a goldmine of information. you can look up the last 100 matches of any player on earth in Ranked, Casual, or Battle Lounge. if you want to learn a character, or want to learn how to beat a character this is the mode for you. you can sort replays by character, and player rank. 

also, make sure to watch your own replays, esspecially your losses. you can learn a lot by taking a second look 


now for the bad stuff

1) some janky visuals
this game has stylized visuals that on the whole looks very good (it looks better in motion than in screen shots) but there are areas where it falls short. even a year and a half after release there are still numorous clipping issues most noticebly Ken's default hair will often clip through his shoulder on the select screen. and speaking of Ken, his face really is as bad as everyone says. Ibuki's win pose has also been known to cause nightmares

2) server downtime
one of the downsides of crossplay is that Capcom have to run 3rd party servers to facilitate it. this ussually means there are one or two times a month where the servers are down for a few hours. it is not as big a deal as some make it out to be but it would be nice if they found a way for it to stop happening.

3) the story was poorly put together
the overall plot of the story wasn't so bad. but the execution left a lot to be desired. Capcom needs to hire a director and an editor with experience making movies. the writing was also quite poor. there were some good ideas, but they need to try harder next time

4) survival mode
this mode sucks, the easy version is worth playing for the FM with every character, normal mode can done reasonbly fast if you know how to play a character. hard and extreme should never be played for any reason. I really wish capcom would take another look at this mode.

The action feels weighty, which is a good thing--attacks that hit sound and look important, and blocks sound like they have weight as well. The game gives a solidity to fighting that many other games in the genre lack. There are issues with character balance, but eventually they will be sorted out or the game will fail.

The offline modes are hugely lacking. Head-to-head is the only mode that is any good, and it loads remarkably slowly, even on a solid state drive. You can get around this if you do enough searching, but Capcom should have realized early on that people like to spend their time playing the game rather than watching a load screen that has been deliberately slowed down (See Update; this is no longer the case.) The AI is either incredibly weak or godlike, there is no in-between. This is most visible on Survival mode, where between one round and the next the computer will go from not blocking overheads to blocking EVERY mix-up.

The online mode is where I have the most complaint, which is too bad because that's also the mode that I (and I would guess many others) want to play most often. 

Lag. Huge, unpredictable, awful amounts of lag. I play a lot of Dota2, and I experience game-affecting lag there about once every 50 games. Even in that situation there is the opportunity to pause and give the offender/server time to catch up. Here, though, there is no such opportunity--and unless it's hitting both players at once the player who is not affected is going to have a massive advantage. It's so bad and so frequent that when I win I don't even feel good about it because I don't know if my opponent was lagging out or not. When I lose due to lag I feel as though I've been robbed. Essentially, the lag makes it so that each game feels inconsequential and unfun.

Capcom has made a game that is not fun at this point unless you can play offline (most of my playtime is offline). Their bottom line should suffer. Do not purchase this game.

UPDATE: The patches applied in the spring of 2017 have improved my online experience significantly, though there are still many occasions where lag affects my play.

31,Street Fighter V,21264091,english,"EDITED: June 2017 (I keep this review up to date as the game evolves)

This game is definitely becoming a full fledged AAA title.

When this game first came out I wrote a review not recommending this game. It simply had too many flaws for its retail price. Later, as the game improved, I changed my review to a cautious recommendation. With the latest update fixing a number of my remaining issues with the game and the lowering price I now strongly recommend this game. The developers don't just sound committed to making changes for the better, they've actually gone and taken them and so I'm excited to see it continue improving.

THE PROS:
+ Very strong fighting game at its core, and it always has been. SFV looks and feels as intense to play as it does to watch. Matches are fast, momentum can easily shift, and victory is never a foregone conclusion.
+ The game is far easier to pick up than previous Street Fighter titles. The game is extremely lenient with inputs and even the most difficult combos in the game can be mastered with a few minutes in training mode. How well you do has less to do with grinding muscle memory and more to do with your knowledge of matchups and tactics.
+ The cast is varied and balanced. This is not a game with strong tier lists. The initial roster is packed with straight forward characters with familiar mechanics while many of the DLC characters have been quite experimental. The way it seems to work is that DLC characters are initially released but tweaked a little weaker than the rest of the cast and then in the next balance patch, once the developers see how people are using those characters, they tweak them up to be equal with the others.
+ The game comes with a semi-helpful tutorial for general play and for each character. It's not in the same league as the Skullgirls tutorial but it's not totally absent and can get a new player started with enough to not completely drown.
+ The Capcom Fighters Network feature now has full functionality. You can view a wide range of stats about your own play with and against each character, friend and blacklist other players, and searching for other players in your skill range is easier than before.
+ Now contains 20 trials for each character (except Ed and all future DLC, who only have 10, because they now appear to be releasing trials by season).

THE CONS:
- In local versus player 2's menus might not be all that you would expect.
- Battle Lounges now support up to 8 players but still feel like an incomplete mess. The ""chat box"" can only be filled with premade messages chosen from a list and it is impossible to sort through Battle Lounges by region, connection, characters, or give them any sort of useful titles to attract particular types of players.
- Survival is one of the most infuriating RNG-based shitshows ever attached to a video game. However, it is no longer required to obtain alternate colors.

I paid full price for Street Fighter V when it came out and only got 16 fighters 11 stages, trial mode(this is good), vs mode and online play...that’s it... no story mode(it was added later), arcade mode, and no secret bosses that you can unlock which has been part of the Street fighter formula since SSF2T. The fight money you use to buy characters and stages in the game is a joke. After you complete the story mode and level up fighters you find yourself hitting a wall trying to save 100000 fight money to unlock fighters, Capcom puts you in a position to buy the content, which for the most part sucks and is expensive.  Furthermore the bad net-code, dumb down gameplay, and input lag added to the game make this game mind-numbing to play and watch…. How many times can we watch Karin combo into her super combo off any of her basic combos? Worst Esport game ever.
Tekken 7 on the other hand gives you 37 fighters, an interesting story mode, arcade mode, treasure mode, over 20 stages, amazing amount of alternate costumes and content that you can unlock without having to spend cash! Unlike Street fighter V, Tekken’s fight money is easy to earn and you can earn it offline, all for $49.00!

45,Street Fighter V,32460896,english,"First is a guide for how to unlock DLC characters without spending real money and utilizing every character in the game. For my review please scroll ahead.

HOW TO UNLOCK ALL CHARACTERS WITHOUT REAL MONEY:

Step 1: Pick a character and start by viewing their demontrations. It teaches you the basics for that character. 

Step 2: Do that characters trials. Some require practice and patience but none are terribly difficult. Watch the demo's and pay attention to timing.

Step 3: Go to traning mode and practice what you have learned. (Does not reward Fight Money, but helps with completing next steps.)

Step 4: Do that characters story mode. They're one round fights with full meters against brain dead AI.

Step 5: Do survival mode with that character and complete Easy and Normal modes. Hard and Hell are there too, but require a mastery of the game to complete. This is where the game starts to get challening, so learning your character through trials and training is essential.

Step 6: Pick a new character and repeat.

*Completing the story campaign will also net you fight money and it can be done twice with the extra mode that unlocks after your first playthrough.

**You can also earn fight money by completing the daily and weekly missions and leveling up your characters in online matches.

Once you have done this with all the characters you should have enough fight money to unlock all DLC characters without having to spend real money. In the process you will familiarize yourself with every character and become much better at the game.  (Don't listen to those who say this  game is light on single player content. There is plenty to do.)
With this process I have bought all DLC characters, including the latest Ed, two alternate costumes and one stage, and still have enough Fight Money left over to unlock the next character as soon as they're released. So if you feel like Capcom is forcing you to buy stuff, you're playing it wrong.

REVIEW:

Pros:
Great fighting system. Diversify your strategy by mixing up cross-overs, overhead attacks, dash up throws, hit confirms and reversals to always keep your opponents guessing. Combos are performed with precise timing, button mashers are not rewarded in Street Fighter.

Great soundtrack. Retro character tracks have been remade with full intrumentals and give a great sense of nostalgia. They are recognizable but fresh. Brand new tracks are well composed too and add to the drama of the fighting.

Lots of single player content that is both challening and rewarding. See the above process.

Online experience is always subjective, but when I filter connection settings to 4-5 bars, most of the matches are lag free and don't take long to get into even during off peak hours.

Cons:
Little content for the base game. If you just bought the game and are eager to go head to head with your friends, the lack of characters and stages at first is dissapointing. To unlock content it will cost you money or you will have to take the time to complete the single player content.

Steep learning curve. The lack of an arcade mode does not cater to beginners or causals who like to practice against various AI bots in a difficulty of their choosing. There is the survival mode, but losing a single round means starting all over, a punishment that most people would consider too severe.

Story mode is lacking. Character stories are very short and simple to complete. The cutscenes for the most part don't add much of a story at all. The added story mode does have some nicely done in engine cutscenes and the dialouge is passable, but most of it doesnt make sense and only serves as a segway into the next fight.

Conclusion:
Considering that all DLC characters will be free to the dedicated players who earn Fight Money, I dont mind there being little content at first. It's a better deal than having more immediate content but then hitting a paywall for future characters.If you take the time to complete the single player content and practice with all the characters then you will be rewarded with enough Fight Money to unlock a substantial amount of content such as new characters, stages, costumes and colors. How you spend it is up to you. The game is challenging but the demo's and trials are there to help. The more you play, the better you get, the more you can unlock and the bigger the game becomes.

Content is being added but there is too much DLC, too much of a modern touch that sort of ruins the arcade experience of the past. I don't know if I'm happy or disappointed with that fact.

61,Street Fighter V,32025536,english,"I'm reuploading this review because I think I didn't do this game proper justice.

It's actually worse than I thought it was. I'm not exaggerating. The input lag, specially on singleplayer, is unreasonable and ENDORSED by Capcom to ""make the users adapt to online situations"". The updates installed malware to players' PCs that not only inpacted the game's performance, but added security breaches that wouldn't have been spotted if players hadn't datamined the game. No Arcade mode (which is replaced by a diet-coke Survival mode), 10 minute story mode for each character, versus mode with predictable AI, and an online mode that even on ""great status"" connection has trouble registering hits due to janky hitboxes.

The icing on the cake is that this game costed 60 dollars and I paid 10 dollars for the default game. 10 dollars for a game that has only versus mode, a 10-minute long story mode, online matches and slightly over 10 characters is already odd enough. Now they said they would allow the players to ""get extra characters for free"" by ranking up and getting credits. A Season 1 character is 100,000 credits and you get 1000 for leveling up a character via grinding and roughly 100 creds for winning fights. You *don't* want your competitive playerbase to ""unlock"" characters like this, specially due to its semi-competitive nature. This makes people unable to face certain adversaries when training, so you cannot be prepared to face online/competition matches. Now scroll-up, check the Season Pass 1 and SP2 prices. They offer 5-6 characters but rarely one of their extra costumes. 

This may sound biased but I can think of 10 fighting SERIES just on Steam that offer more base game content, better netcode and overall support, and better optimization: Skullgirls, Guilty Gear Xrd, BlazBlue Series (optimization got way better specially after the updates), TEKKEN 7 (aka the best of the bunch in my humble opinion), THE ENTIRE KOF SERIES (which is huge), Ultra Street Fighter 4 (and the Switch REMASTER of Street Fighter 2), Dragon Ball Xenoverse 1 and 2, Injustice, Mortal Kombat 9 (I have XL for the PS4 and it took a tad bit for them to update the PC version, so I have no input on that), Naruto Shippuden series, Marvel vs Capcom 3 (my opinion on Infinite is: I haven't played but it looks fairly different than other MvC).

Street fighter 3 had parries which were a deep and interesting mechanic at the cost of centralizing the game around the mechanic, with tiers being decided almost solely on who benefits from parrying the most (Q=Bad because he can't capitalize on a parry or really anything, Makoto=Good because she can stun combo you off of a parry confirm) and Street Fighter 4 has Focus attacks and Ultras, both of which are such dogshit mechanics that it would take an entirely different review to cover all of the things wrong with both of these mechanics

Street Fighter 5 introduces the V-System, a deceptively simple system of another meter that allows you to pull off character-specific reversals, character=specific skills, and characte-specific V-Triggers, all of which set out to diversify the cast more than it is by default.

Now I'm going to speak from a competitive perspective rather than a casual one, so if you're not a competitive player then my review might not help you, but if you're a casual then why are you bothering playing this game? Don't you kids still stick to the numerous rehashed versions of street fighter 2 because you can't actually tell how horribly they've aged?

Anyways, Street Fighter 5 is arguably the most balanced roster to date in street fighter history. Virtually every character can be played well enough to be viable at a competitive level, so there's no shortage of diverse, viable cast members. It's a fairly easy game to learn, but like all fighting games still difficult to master all of its mechanics, and the difficulty is most often decided by how good your opponent is rather than any real difficulty mechanics you'd find in a singleplayer game.

The game doesn't provide you a tremendous amount of learning materials, but it does give you trials which give the player an opportunity to refine their execution skills and learn their BnB combos. And as for learning, there are plenty of materials online worth checking out if you want to take the game seriously, as is the case for all fighting games.

Capcom's DLC formula seems expensive at first but in practice it's surprisingly generous. all game-changing DLC can be accquired with in-game fight money unlocked through playing matches and completing missions (which are generally very easy and can give up to 5000 FM). This gives the player the option to grind out the game and collect fight money, or shell out a few bucks from their wallet to get one of the DLC characters. Another important thing to note about fight money is that you get an extremely generous sum of FM from completing things like the character prologue stories and the ""Shadow Falls"" cinematic story and survival on every difficulty. Completing enough of these would give you enough FM for a new character and you can do that in an afternoon easily.

This formula is wildly opposed to the Street Fighter tradition of releasing numerous standalone versions of the game every year or two, each time costing 30 bucks with all its changes exclusive to that version, and tacking additional things like DLC costumes on top (which is not necessary of course), Street Fighter 5 lets you collect content at your own pace inviting you to spend money fro myour wallet but giving you the completely viable option of just scrounging up the fight money for it. Season Passes arent even dissimilar from additional versions excepting the fact that you can still play online with people who have the passes and you dont need to own one pass to purchase another, meaning you could have all the season 2 characters without the season 1 characters and there's no issue

And for everyone still whining over the rootkit fiasco; grow up. It was a shitty circumstance but it's long since been over, it was a mistake on Capcom's part and it's been gone for almost a year now, it's a nonissue and anyone still acting like it's some major scandal still thinks that GamerGate is relevant and important in media.

Anyways, SFV is a good game and you should seriously check it out if you want a fighting game that's fun and rewards you for learning its mechanics. Peace.",1496791181,1496791181,TRUE,2,0,0.47412017,2,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.66E+16,218,5,37735,0,17295,1581711110

67,Street Fighter V,29891323,english,"So, Capcom is attempting to follow the poor design of the MoBA market. It's completely unbecoming for this franchise to withhold characters behind the paywall. I couldn't imagine going to the Arcade paying the machine to play, and adding more tokens to just to pick a vanilla character like boxer. And speaking of fight money, the values need to be inflated in someway – I'm sure you could spam story mode to attain an adequate amount? I haven't actually tested that out if someone in the comments could confirm. My favorite part is most items require you to pay out of pocket, or rather through the steam wallet. This much I'm thankful for, I'll never add money to the steam wallet, its an extra step so its a deterrent to the purchase. 

	 I covered that fight money is difficult to accumulate, and characters are needless micro-transactions. How is Capcom going to maintain the competitive nature when most players who only purchase with fight money ( cause fuck you capcom ) going to practice against dlc characters? We can't even choose them in Training mode to learn against setups and develop theories, you know, the whole reason for playing the game. Nor can we play test the content to see if we like the feel or direction of these characters. Wouldn't it be nice to be able to select the dlc characters in training mode only at the very least? ( either way they shouldn't cost a thing ) Unless we are given a bone like Alex, who they've killed along with other needless nerfs for season 2.

	I'd be interested to see how much they've made on this marketing strategy, which only the pro circuit players feel the sting most needing to be on the edge of the character technology. We all play to learn and develop new skills, of course have a good time. We aren't playing this game to idle by and purchase a stage that had the Environment light dimmed to be a “night theme” stage. Legit less than 10 seconds worth of work to adjust the Point light in the Unreal 4 Engine. I hope that the majority of those who got -- got like myself purchasing this title aren't buying these vanity items. Although not buying these items probably wouldn't harm capcom... but it should make them look and feel foolish. 

	How can a community develop when most of the content is inaccessible? Whats the point of locking away all the hard work the put into the character designs? Why did they kill the already average or weaker characters? Let characters be strong, all characters should function like as Urien and Karin. Up the functionality for all toons to meet the juggle standards and meta game that Guile seems to be built around. Otherwise how [b]do[/b] you want the Fang/Charlie players to perform when you take the tools they thought you were acceptable from the season prior? Should we purchase better frame data with our steam wallet funds? I don't mean to be crass, but there isn't much for the development of a unique cast when they are simply lacking comparatively speaking. 

	It would seem that capcom lost their ability to design, for example: Enter training mode set up fight requests for ranked and player matches right? So, I invite a buddy who is in training mode, he needs to exit and go to the notification log to accept. That's hardly e-sports. How about getting the little request notification in the bottom left to meant something more, like holding start and select to toggle that window and accept from there? It's minor but all of these issues are minor and collectively ruins the experience of the street fighter franchise.

Edit: Can you play dlc characters when the servers are offline? I haven't spent enough time playing juri ( my only fight money purchase ) to have taken note on this matter.

Edit 2: Too my suprise you can actually use the character you purchased while the servers are offline.

- An indepth training mode where you can learn combo's and program the ai to perform specific moves.
- The game also has demonstrations explaining all the concepts of the game for newer players.
- Support from Capcom/Sony until at least 2019 (so more fighters, stages and modes coming your way)
- Crossplay connecting the PC and PS4 community.
- Netplay is good if you set the search options to 4-5 bars and ask before accepting the match.

74,Street Fighter V,32138691,english,"So Tekken 7 just came out and I am now really having to think about how I feel about this game. I enjoyed Ultra Street Fighter 4 for a very long time. However, Street Figher V released and it's what we got so here goes

     Street Fighter is a game that needs really no introduction. It's a fast paced fighting game with nuances and it's pretty great. It's been successful for a very long time, bringing together talented kids with tape mended glasses for years. However, this fifth entry is a bit divisive. The combat is pretty wonderful this time around. It feels just as responsive and fun as it ever did but with the port being poorly executed and the roster being much, much shorter this time around, it felt like Capcom had released an unfinished game. Down the line, we've gotten more characters but I think this game lost me. 
     This was not helped by the, at times, attrocious netcode. Fighting games need a clear, balanced playing field for competitive play. What they don't need is 1 full second of delay on competitive when said person is paying for high quality Fiber internet. This happened too often and it very much made me no longer want to even try. 
     This game did do one thing that I certainly commend it for, however, even if it was still a little smarmy. Street Fighter V has a good bit of ""dlc"" but these dlc's are the characters they didn't put in the game to start with and new arenas. The arenas don't bother me but my main, Juri, was locked behind a ""paywall."" This idea was obviously seen as trash by someone in the boardroom when they were finalizing the game because you /can/ earn currency in the game by winning online matches and you can use that currency to purchase characters and arenas. This is kind of cool, or would be if the other aspects of the game made me want to continue playing online. 
     
     To wrap this probably unfair fan review up, I wanted to like this game. But the glaring issues it had upon release and the glaring issues it has now and can't really fix just make me want to keep playing Tekken 7. I grew up a Tekken guy anyway.

After I felt somewhat comfy with my training, I felt I could put up some sort of fight, and I tried joining casual and ranked games.  I could not find any game, casual or otherwise -- maybe it's because I could only wait 20 minutes at a time, didn't have a lot of time to waste.

So I tried going into the lounge, and looking into the games there -- for virtually all the games I saw all the players were teleporting all over the place.  I realized while watching those games SF5 has some serious low latency requirements.

At last, I was able to get an invite from a player who is in the same country as I am.  I thought I was going to get into a decent game -- I was sorely mistaken.  There was so much lag in the game that at one point, all I did was just to stand there, take hits, just so the game would end.

This is a big disappointment for me.  I had high hopes since this is my first fighting game, I watched so many videos prior to playing the game, and even read Daigo's book, which was very inspirational.  Based on my experiences, I think the implementation of the Capcom FIght Network (CFN) in my country, the Philippines, really stinks.

Hell, if this game had a decent single-player experience, I would've kept the game.  However, since story-mode is stupid and actually has no story to speak of, I cannot recommend this game to anyone in my country for either its singleplayer or multiplayer modes.

P.S. Even though I don't like SF5, I still highly recommend ""The Will to Keep Winning"" by Daigo.  It is an interesting look at the life of a professional fighting game player and the fighting game community he belongs to.  If you are in a country where the CFN implementation is decent, you might enjoy playing this game and belonging to that community.",1495937409,1495937409,FALSE,2,0,0,8,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.66E+16,37,4,2164,0,1403,1499435130

99,Street Fighter V,21358247,english,"I bought this game intending to play versus people online. I have to say, even though there was a bit of a rocky start with the online servers, the game completely delivers on the multiplayer aspect of the game. The single player content is lacking.

The two main gripes I have with this game so far:

1. You are forced to play the tutorial. This was a really stupid decision, the tutorial is incredibly shallow and should be optional.
2. To unlock costume colors, you are forced to play the games survival mode. I would much rather unlock character items through multiplayer gameplay.

Gameplay is fun and easy to jump into. After several hours of playing, it really surpised me how different each character feels to each other. It doesn't feel like any character is a clone of another, even Ryu and Ken have very different playstyles. Even though some may say 16 characters aren't enough, I feel that each character feels complete and varied. I would much prefer a small roster of characters that are different, rather than a large roster of clones with minute differences.

As for the seemingly unanimous consensus that this game is a beta, I completely agree. I don't really feel that is a negative for this game however, it gives me hope that there will be fairly regular updates by Capcom, but we'll see how it plays out. They seem to have a number of general dates for character releases and content updates, but I am always skeptical of release schedules from gaming companies.

Now the mulitplayer. I love the fight request system and the ability to restrict fight request via connection type. The connections I have had to other players are generally very good. The net code seems drastically overhauled from USF4, but don't expect it to fix poor internet connectivity or poor attitudes (rage quitters).

Overall, I am quite happy with my purchase and would recommend that others do the same if they are looking for a solid multiplayer fighting experience. If you are looking for single player content, I would wait for some time or even recommend giving this game a pass.

Update:
1. Reliability of the netcode definitely didn't hold, I can only imagine what my opponents were dealing with if my connection seemed solid. (1-Sided rollback and lag spikes. It's a thing in this game.)
2. Constant server maintainence for no increase in CFN reliability. Disconnects are unpredictable and at times frequent. At least two days a week, the game is unavailable due to maintainance. If I hadn't ever worked in creating and designing network infrastructure I would say they are trying to fix it, but either Capcom is incompetent and hired a gerbil to find the reset button or they have seriously underfunded and underdeveloped the infrastructure they force everyone to use.
3. Always online required to use the DLC you have purchased (the previous issue doesn't help this). Definitely a software design issue, an incredibly very poor implementation for paid content.
4. Significant increase of microtransations and prices are definitely out of control.
5. Timed DLC releases for costume packs with ""no plans for rerelease"", a collector's nightmare.
6. No real way to gain fight money without grinding hours on ALL characters in single player modes and constantly playing ranked matches (for eternity).
7. Constant excuses for consistently missed delivery of pre-paid content.
8. Unwilling to listen to the community for the pre-paid content. (Purchase a season pass, find out months later that none of the upcoming or current content is what you wanted.)
9. Can easily be double charged for content bought (with money) on the CFN and then DLC containing the same content on Steam within less than a week timeframe (bought the CPT 2017 costumes before they were available as a DLC bundle pack on Steam). Steam holds Capcom responsible for refunding in-game purchases, Capcom support claims they don't know how to refund. I stopped buying from Ubisoft and EA because I didn't want to spend my time in the lab sorting through their DLC to figure out what I get. My time in the lab should be spent improving my game (It definitely needs it).

Definitely a drastic change in opinion of this game. I may have just been riding the high of having a fighting game released to Steam within the same timeframe of the console release and playing against a larger community due to cross platform gameplay. I was definitely being optimistic about their promises in hindsight, because I thought they had learned from their experience with Street Fighter X Tekken.

Capcom has proved they...
1) ...cannot create infrastructure to support paid online transactions with integrity.
2) ...are willing gouge their customers for EVERYTHING in the game like it's owed to them.
3) ...are unwilling to let their customers collect all the content within the game. (This isn't an MMO, why is anything a timed exclusive? Why not re-release the content every year for the same event with new content as well? No plans to re-release digital items is ridiculous this isn't a stock issue.)
4) ...are unable to learn from previous games they have created and re-introduce the same problems that have existed in their previous titles at the expense of their consumers.

I was very hopeful that the microtransactions from this game would lead to a regularly updated and improved experience. A year later and this has yet to be seen, tweaking balance changes aren't really what I am referring to (though many would argue that isn't being done either). I still enjoy the game, but I have realized how much I have spent with the hopes of funding better netcode, better optimization, better matchmaking, etc.

Unfortunately, I have already pre-purchased MvCi for Steam and if it is even slightly a similar experience, I will not purchase another game with a microtransaction model from them. They are not capable of integrity and supporting basic business practices. Capcom seems to want to be payed and treated like a AAA publisher at the consumer's expense, without investing into the creation of a AAA experience.

TLDR: Business model is anti-consumer, CFN is poorly designed, and the constant reliance on CFN is unavoidable. Don't buy or at least refuse microtransactions through CFN.",1456040501,1495809284,FALSE,0,0,0.476190478,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.66E+16,442,7,10976,0,7687,1579152057

I've been playing Street Fighter for years; since Third Strike, back in the arcades with my dad. I have very fond memories of the characters, comradery between players, and the fun play style the game has!

When I heard about all the awesome functionality of SFV, I was beyond stoked! I could finally play online! I wouldn't have to go to now non-existant arcades; I was ready.

And upon playing the game for around 8 hours, I'm not happy. That's probably an understatement.

I hopped into a casual match after some training mode. The game looks amazing! The graphics are wonderful, CAs look amazing; it looks great! There's no doubt about that. But I quickly forgot about this during the time I was waiting for a solid [b]15 minutes[/b] to play one casual match. I was a little shaken, and decided to cancel matchmaking. I figured I should set my connection quality to 4-5 bars instead of 5 only; and I found a match! 

Little did I know that match would have many amazing features! Such as teleporting, eaten inputs, frame stuttering, audio stuttering, and so many more features that make you want to break the fightstick over your knee. (What's wrong with GGPO, Capcom?)

And not only this! I left the match and proceeded to get caught in a loop of playing the same 5 people over and over again! Because, for some reason, that's how matchmaking works?

Why? Why Capcom? Don't even get me started on your hiding the strongest and most buffed characters behind DLC, or lack of controller support, or your lack of genuine customer support, or your banking the entire run of this game off the past successes of the better Street Fighter games, or your inability to balance characters.

Can't complain too much since Capcom seems to have fixed a lot of the original issues people had with the game, more content and story mode, etc. It's a competitive fighter first and foremost, so expect to be spending a lot of time in the training room getting difficult moves burned into muscle memory. That alone is a couple years of commitment right there I feel like. In a good way though.

Supposedly the PC version has less input lag than the PS4 version if you turn off vertical sync. This game on a 4K monitor with GSync and a good graphics card would be glorious. Tournaments will likely still be on PS4 though, but lately fighters have been given a new life on the PC.

This ""missing"" content that everyone is complaining about has been confirmed by Capcom to be rolling out every month FOR FREE (although a season pass can be bought for people without the time to earn in-game money). 

The whole point of this game was to release the core fighting game to people so they can become familiar with the mechanics and play against other people in ranked matches or offline in anticipation of Capcom Cup. Online and offline play against humans is honestly the only good part of ANY fighting game, and SFV delivers on this front. People complain about the price, but the constant flow of free content over the months should more than make up for it, as well as predictions that SFV will be the only new Street Fighter game for at LEAST 6 YEARS.

The game is overpriced for what you get and these character passes only add more layers for people to get into the game. If I recommend this game to a friend he/she has to buy the game (£35) get season one(£16) and season two (£25!). I bought Tekken 7 for £25 and that game has a crap ton more content and depth!!! People will say ""you don't have to buy the character passes."" and that you can get them with fight money blah blah blah. I believe each character costs 100,000 FM each which will take ages to get unless you grind that boring survival mode over and over again(which can waste a lot of your time if you lose near the end). On top of that you can't even try the dlc characters before you buy them. We will soon hit that point where half of the cast will be cut off when you buy the base game.

And also Capcom... making combos easier isn't going to get more people into your game...You want to know what does? Content... having a lot of single player content with replay value will bring more people into your game and if they like the game enough to go online then that's even better. Having solid tutorials to help players learn the basics of the game. The crappy one they have already barely teaches you anything to be ready for online. What about Spacing? pokes? frame advantage and disadvantages? frame traps? meaties?... I could go on and on. Heck evem Skullgirls has a better tutorial than this game...

In conclusion. If you were looking into buying this game try to get it at a significant price drop. The game is really over priced for what you get even as a Street Fighter fan.

If you still really want to learn then get ready to do a lot of research on the Internet.

Of course this is all my opinion. If you disagree that's perfectly fine (duh). Don't let my one review put you off the game.

28,Street Fighter V,31653839,english,"As someone who is essentially new to fighting games and looking for something to get into the genre I couldn't think of a better game. I've tried MKX online and played through the campaign of MK9. I've also been trying to get into games like Guilty Gear. While they're all good in their own ways I feel like SFV is the best out of what I've played so far to get into the fighting genre. Combos aren't as complicated and execution heavy as in MKX for example where I've ran into people who remove 60% of your bar if you make one wrong high/low guess. In that sense MKX was a rough start as a beginner. Much in the same way Guilty Gear felt quite execution heavy and very fast paced. 

SFV on the other hand provides a less steep learning curve allowing the player to get into basic concepts of the genre such as spacing, punishing and mixing up your offense. The game has issues as many people are pointing out in these reviews such as having the occasional laggy game. I still don't think this ruins the experience, and in my opinion the way SFV works a lot around the fighting game fundamentals makes it a preferable game for a beginner compared to the options available at the moment. Being able to finally have a decent way into the genre and finally getting the chance to learn fighting game fundamentals has got me hooked on this game as well, I love it. In conclusion as someone who was looking for a way into fighting games I highly recommend SFV for anyone else interested in picking up competitive fighting games.",1494361450,1494361450,TRUE,6,0,0.536415458,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.66E+16,123,2,11879,0,8751,1533241029
29,Street Fighter V,31652624,english,"Honestly not as bad as everyone makes it out to be. It released as little more than an online game at a $60 £45 price. Now Capcom have added the features that should have been present at launch (for free) it now has a story mode, it has daily challenges, and combo trials. There's plenty to keep the casual gamer busy - and I should know; I'm a casual gamer that wishes I was more competitive.

The combo system is much easy than other fighting games, and every character feels fair and balanced with respect to the others.

The online netcode is still abit rubbish as such you're going to have a bad time playing online matches with poor wifi or with others with poor wifi. A good way to help cut out lag is to grab a LAN cable and directly plug your laptop/PC into your router.

The game is costantly getting updates, new stages, characters, and costumes with support from Capcom until at least 2020. And if you dislike what Capcom are dishing out the game is also modable with a good community out there to give you your nostalgia costumes and (god forbid) undress your waifus.

For new comers wanting to get good at street fighter, or anyoine interested in street fighter but too intimidated by the community or skill cieling I would highly recommend r/streetfighter 's u/joe_munday 's wiki guide ""Gief's Gym"".

Street Fighter V is an early access game with hundreds of dollars in DLC and Capcom has done nothing to fix the playability of the game online or anything quality of life related. The only time they communicate is when they are trying to sell us more DLC. There has been no attempt to correct this game's launch issues over a year after its release.

The gameplay is like a 4/10 at best, and only because everything surrounding it sets the bar so pitifully low. In an alternate reality where the netcode is acceptable, the lobby systems are decent, and the loading screens don't take ages the game is still not that fun to play. This is the most bland fighting game I've ever played.

Tl;dr: Street Fighter V is the same garbage game it was on launch day except now its riddled with low effort, high priced DLC.",1455670475,1493272842,FALSE,0,1,0.487394989,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.66E+16,158,18,9268,0,9180,1483423154

55,Street Fighter V,31379792,english,"This game gets a lot of flack. I personally love it. 
If you love playing fighting games with your friends by your side, get this game. Its super fun.

Yeah it's kinda unbalanced, but what fighting game isn't? Third Strike is the best fighting game ever, and it's horribly unbalanced. This game isn't horribly unbalanced, it's just normal unbalanced, and the argument that ""X"" is ""OP"" is constantly changing, ""X"" character is different every week. Fortunately for me, I am far to awful for ""tiers"" to mean anything to me. Win or lose, it's because of me not the character I'm playing. 

People love to complain about the net-code which isn't as good as it should be yes, but even with my garbo internet, 90% of the online games I play are fine and smooth. I have a maximum DL speed of a whopping 2.8 megabytes per second on a good day. Making a battle lounge with my friends on the opposite coast, and the game is fine. Friend in Japan? No big deal I can play them fine. The net-code could be better, but is completely acceptable. 

Another thing people hate on is the Story mode and the lack of Arcade mode. When you get down to it, what is an arcade mode? It's you against like 6 to10 AI that raise in difficulty. Survival is literally that, where round 1 is against someone who can't even block, and the final dood is this cheating, input reading god. If they changed the word ""survival"" into ""arcade"" and kept all the difficulties the same, that entire complaint would disappear, and they would be complaining about  the input reading AI that is in every fighting game ever.

As for Story mode, I loved it. It's stupid, dumb, makes little to no sense, but is incredibly fun. Minor spoilers ahead. Zangief catches a sword with his pecks, THEN BREAKS IT WITH HIS PECKS. Rainbow Mika shakes off a concussion, because FIGHTING SPIRIT. RYU IS STILL FIGHTING WITH HIMSELF FOR SOME REASON. NECALLI SHOWS UP TO DO NOTHING, SPOILER WARNING, NASH PULLS A CHIAOTZU AND IT'S HILARIOUS. The story mode is great, and I disagree with those who say its bad. It's a fighting game, it's not exactly the medium we go to for in depth literary analysis. Embracing the stupid was a fun decision at the very least. 

As far as the fighting game gets a little more in-depth as far as fighting games goes. It's better in SF4 in my eyes. Why? Because SF4 became a fireball fest, a slow to watch, poking match full of Elena V Elena both taking Healing. Even when SF4 was vortex oriented and Yun dominated the game, it still felt clunky and coated in sticky molasses. That wasn't fun for me. I like that SFV is offence oriented.

Everyone says that footsies and spacing is gone, but that is not true. Spacing is an integral part of every fighting game, and footies is constantly happening. Shimmy grab loops are entirely spacing based, i mess up shimmies and meaties all the time, BECAUSE my spacing needs work. I lose the midscreen game, because my footsie game are not on point. On a high level, it all happens so quick that it can be hard to see, like with every high level fighting game, there are a ridiculous number of things happening and going through both players heads. It's still a fast paced chess game, of mind-battles and skill. That spacing and footsie game is still happening just faster and for a little less time. If skill didn't matter, I would have gotten out of silver and into gold rank long ago.

The graphic do need work though. Honestly, we live in age where video games can and should look better then this. SFV isn't going for a unique art style, it just looks bad. Every fighting game should look like Killer Instinct, or Guilty Gear Xrd, or Skullgirls. Those games are beautiful, KI is absolutely magnificent looking. Guilty Gear sets a new example of what 3D models and anime can do together. Skullgirls has some of the Best 2D animation I have ever seen. Honestly, go look up ""Skullgirls Eliza Animations"" so much work went into her I cannot put into words how beautiful it is. Go see it for yourself.

So for the biggest Fighting Game Franchise ever, to have these terrible clipping issues, and not even look decent, is down right sad. Go also look up ""SFV Supers without the dramatic camera"" the animations for those are even sadder (especially Zangief's) MKX is amazing looking, and there is really no reason for this game not to look great. There is a standard for how good fighting games can look, and this game falls very short of that.

Fortunately as an avid PC gamer, I have modded out all the imperfections I saw. My Ken is Maximilian Food. It's amazing. His face has been fixed.

TL:DR I love fighting games! I play a bunch of them, and adore them! It's popular to hate on this game right now, and that will fade. Yes, there are flaws. But when it comes down to it, This game is really fun, and even better with friends. I can play with my friends all over the world with my garbage internet and it runs perfectly fine. Yes, there are a lot of microtransactions, but that stuff is all cosmetics. You don't need all 47 Chun Li skins like you don't need 47 different hats in your closet, you get me?

If you want a game to play with friends for some fun fast paced slug abouts, this is a good choice. Anyone can pick up and play and do some cool stuff. If you are looking for a game to main so that you can make a name for yourself as a new member of the high level FGC scene, this game has a future, and is going real E-Sports and is also a good choice. If you like fighting games, this still a good choice. 

Have fun.
Learn from your mistakes.
Enjoy some fanservice. 
Feel free to mod in more fanservice.

This is a good, fun game with a long set of future updates ahead.

83,Street Fighter V,31073026,english,"As a long time fan of the Street Fighter series it pains me to write this review. I have played this game off and on since the beta over one year ago. I kept coming back to it because I was bound and determined to like this game, I really, really wanted to. I have uninstalled the game for the last time tonight and am writing what I knew deep down since I first played the game but was scared to admit. Street Fighter 5 as a whole is a terrible game.

It started with the horrid launch. It was completely devoid of the charm and personality of past entries in the series. Gone are the cool menu transitions and arcadish look as a whole which many people including myself loved about SF games in the past. No story mode essentially, no arcade mode, no trials, just online play and a training mode. I just didn't feel excited to play the game and felt like I was still playing the beta. Then there's the actual gameplay. Forget about everything you knew about Street Fighter in the past as pretty much none of that will help you here. Were you good at Street Fighter 4? Those 7 years of grinding will bring you little to no success in this game. This is a new fighting game experience and in my opinion it just isn't as fun. Basically it's a game of waiting until you have frame advantage and hoping for the best.  The game is ALL about offense, offense, offense and punishes you horribly if you even think about not charging at your opponent like a kamikaze. This in my opinion makes the game extremely shallow and one dimentional. The new mechanics are also pretty bland and unexciting. The V-trigger is not much more than a combo extender and recovery frame canceller. The V system is dull and uninspired and makes me yearn for the focus system from SF4. The graphics overall are a bit worse than SF4 in my opinion and the character models look weird and awkward most of the time(those hands and feet smh). Again this is my opinion and a lot of people might like the new look. 

And now the granddaddy reason why the game is so bad. The online play is absolutely terrible!! The thing about this that really bothers me is that there's absolutely nothing wroing with the netcode or whatever you want to call it. The problem is the matchmaking system. Capcom wants to make sure everyone in the world will play the game and have people to play against at all times. Sounds fair enough right? Well the problem is that Capcom lies to you and matches you up with people on the other side of the planet regardless of what you set your opponent connection requirements to. I would have mine set to 5 bars only and every other match is against someone from another continent and the whole match is a hot mess. The only way to get around this is to only play against friends in a player match lobby where the connection is always perfect. The problem for me is I like to play in ranked mode as do most other players.  

Despite the fact that I don't like the gameplay as much as SF4 I still find the game somewhat fun when I play against someone with a perfect connection in my region but that is very rare and not worth the frustrating experience that occurs most of the time. There's a reason this game has sold so poorly and I only hope Capcom learns from this failure and redeems themselves with SF6. Fingers crossed!",1491890429,1491890429,FALSE,3,0,0.506024122,1,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.66E+16,68,14,4280,0,4187,1500974056
84,Street Fighter V,30607184,english,"Having just recently taken a chance on this game despite some of the negativity, I am quite pleased.  I decided to give it a try as it has by far the largest active online population of any fighter on PC and on top of that has crossplatform with Playstation players.

I saw endless complaints of the game not having versus CPU or training modes, well it does now.  From my understanding the game was basically released as defacto early access and many of the early negative reviews stem from that.

Down to what matters - the game is fun.  The fighting feels more measured and less spastic than I remember SFIV being.  The V-moves are a nice addition and the charging of your V bar & EX bar all feel like they flow nicely with the gameplay and the moves.  The reversals are an interesting touch that remind me a bit of the combo breakers from Mortal Kombat.  All in all it feels like the skill floor is much lower than SFIV yet the ceiling is just as high.  Compared to SFIV the frame windows on moves are much more generous.  The end result is a more fun game where newbies can at least feel like they are doing something, but masters still reign.

The graphics are quite pleasing - things seem a bit more toned down and less over the top than SFIV as well.  Characters are more proportional feeling, animations seems to be a little more realistic and less cartoony, particle effects a bit less dramatic, the textures seem to be less high contrast and bright to give it a little less comic book feel.  This all may or may not be to your preferences.

The most important part of course is the online multiplayer.  After several hours of trying out casual matches I was satisfied with the system.  I played about 30 matches - only 2 had any lag and they were with people from another continent - and only 1 bad connection drop during handshake.  The rest of the matches played out as nicely as a local game.  I imagine I could tweak the settings to not have to deal with international players at the cost of potentially longer match wait times.  At default settings I was only waiting about 1-2 minutes on average for an opponent, not bad at all.  I noticed at least half of my opponents were Playstation players so the crossplatform gameplay is definitely helping out the population size.

So in the end I think it is a great fighting game.  I've been playing SF & other fighting games since the golden era of the arcades - now that they are pretty much extinct around me this is the next best thing.

EDIT 1 - So I've continued to play this game online for about a month now, matches are quick to find and only rarely laggy.

Great fighting game... Lots of depth (But I think it's not as good as Ultra SF IV)
Nice graphic...
Fun combat... It's different so much from SF IV so u are gonna feel like it's a new game
Crossplay...
It's a very good fighting games IMO and u will get addicted by it if u don't encounter the bad I'm gonna describe below

The Bad :
Horrible netcode or whatever they called this day... Its ""sometimes"" laggy even on full connection... The enemy will teleport around the room and hitting u lol
Matchmaking is LONG (It's 1 to 10 minutes to find a challenger)
The first time I installed it... It's unplayable because the patch can't even get downloaded at all... It's so frustrating... and then suddenly all of a sudden it finished...
And I still get a ""Failed to retrieve data (number of error code)"" from time to time after every match...
So many bug and glitch in the game (It's not the gameplay itself... but the other)
Character is still lacking IMO... Some of the unique character from SF IV didn't make it here... yet... or not...
The CFN is confusing... and to be honest I still don't understand what that thing actually does...
U can get disconnected from time to time...
U hav to pay for new character... Now this is the low... they shouldn't make us charge for new character for a fullprice game... I'm okay with them charging us for customization or skin or anything to make our favorite character looks cooler... but for the character itself is just plain greedy...

Now that's so many bad that I got just after 5 hours of gameplay...
Don't get me wrong the gameplay itself is addicting and fun as hell... but u need to brace yourself for the bug and glitches that u will encounter...
I myself didn't get so many lag at playing this game... it's 7 out of 10 i got perfect connection... 2 of em is lagging a little and the enemy makes ""small"" teleport thingy...

93,Street Fighter V,30969251,english,"So I've played the series since 09' like many with Street Fighter 4, I played that game competitively in Philadelphia at most of the Big E tournaments, and I play ST, 3S, SFxT, and other fighting games since I started back then, all pretty well.

This game is a good fighting game, but I don't recommend this game for everyone, here's why.

If you're playing strictly online and you're not living in a populated area, you're going to have a hard time playing. The game does allow you to filter online opponents up to 5 bar connections, but it doesn't allow you to region lock and the filtration system isn't as good as it looks, you will get people up to two bars lower than the setting you get. You might see 5 bars on the screen, but you'll enter the match and they will still lag like a 3 bar. Setting the game to 5 bars also reduces the uptime on matches by a decent amount, where you may wait up to 5 minutes per new opponent online.

Another thing to mention that unlike other fighting games, this one in particular is mechanically designed to reward offense rather than neutral game and defense. They implimented a 6.5 input delay for moves in the game, so even if you see many moves coming, when you react the game doesn't register until over a 10th of a second to your input to defend yourself, combine that with common online lag, and the most successful play style for a player to win with online at home is pressure, just constant pressure.

To really enjoy this game and fighting games in general you really need to find people to play with offline and sit side by side with them on the same screen. This is the last genre to really do that, unlike our old consoles of the past, maybe Nintendo will keep the side by side gaming style alive, but this is it. You won't enjoy this game unless you learn how to play it well, being able to execute combos given an opportunity is something that comes only from practice, and getting those opportunities only comes with experience.

This game had a terrible launch. Capcom did make a veritable root kit in one of the updates, even though it was fixed within days that was still a pretty big upset. It still has some UI issues. Depending on your luck, the netcode can be really bad as well although my personal experience tends to have my matches be 85% good/okay and 15% meh/awful.

6,Street Fighter V,30899806,english,"Please note: This review is based on my experience and is entirely my opinion slightly under the infulence of alcohol.

After a couple of years being a Steam user, I have decided to write my first review as I have noticed this game is highly misunderstood. I have been playing the Street Fighter series since Street Figher II first came out and I remember collecting trollies to get a dollar in return so I could go to the local arcade to play. Living in a very small town, there wasn't many players and I would usually end up playing against the AI through the story mode. I must admit, I wasn't all that good. 

Capcom have a noticable pattern with the series bringing out countless iterations of the franchise in what appears to be an attempt to perfect their baby. From amping up the speed, introducing new characters and bringing back some old favourites to adding new super moves or nerfing existing moves, fans of the series should be used to this .

When SFV was announced, I pre-ordered a CE on the PS4 and had high hopes for the game. Like many, I was dissappointed with how Capcom tackled solo play on the game because the only internet connection i had available to me at the time was via a telstra wifi hub which cost about $50 for 3gb of data that would not last long. This was all due to rennovating my home which is now complete and I have since upgraded to an affordable NBN plan. However; I quit SFV because of all the negative reviews it had recieved.

I have been eyeing SFV since and decided to give it another go (a couple of cans of Jack Daniels was also partially responsible). I got the base game on sale from steam and was anxious as I was not looking forward to being disappointed yet again. At first glance, nothing had changed from when i first purchased the game just over a year ago. Being a little under the influence opened my mind a little and i thought to myself, there is no real ""Arcade"" mode in this game but what does that really mean? What was Capcom thinking? It dawned on me that Capcom have stayed true to the series and are doing what they have been doing in the past with the series and what current are doing today also. 

The Street Fighter series has always been known to be a highly competitive game so why would Capcom focus primarily on a so called ""arcade"" story mode? Well they did in a way because most people don't go to an arcade and play any Street Fighter just to play against an AI. They made it so that the consumer can play in the comfort of their own home against the best rival there can be and that is a human controlled opponent with the story mode taking a back seat. Alot of users are complaining about the price of the DLC content. Well a majority of that content can be unlocked without using your real hard earned $$$. Admittedly I did purchase a couple of alternate costumes as i didn't like the default ones like Ken, Guile and Nashes but they were reasonably priced IMO. People are saying that the game is incomplete because of the Capcom are doing a money grab releasing characters via purchasable DLC. Once again, they can all be unlocked via in-game currency which is not a new concept as many fighting games in the past and present use this method. If you are too lazy to grind and/or get good to be able to unlock what you want, then spend your money but dont be hating on the Developers as without money, they wouldn't be able to bring you these games.

Like it hate it, buy it or not. At the end of the day, what you do with your money is up to you. The devs have produced a game for the fans and Street Fighter is all about Challenging other fighters out there and there's nothing sweeter or more satisfying then beating someone who is higher ranking then you in a nail biting battle. I mean they hold massive Street Fighter competitions for crying out loud. Any way, I think I've babbled on for far too long so here are my pro's and cons:

+Great graphics
+Highly Optimised
+Satisfying competition
+Rewarding

-Price on DLC
-Playing with PS4 opponents (seems to always be laggy)

10,Street Fighter V,30889299,english,"I have played every variation of sf so far, to the extent of including the EX series. Ive noticed along with a majority of people that take an open view of the franchise is that the game is simply repeating the process like 4 and even to the extent of 2 or 3, the game is originally frowned upon, people complaining about lack of characters, the lack of depth, well people dont realize is that 4 started with less depth, people should look at how balance was back when 4 started before complaining, second off the game was remade over with a different engine( the original and the second trailers show how much changed) but capcom had to rush it out since people were starting to get edgy and began complaining( what a surprise). So far, sf5 in my eyes is a great game, its focused more on having a well rounded footsies to not throwing out moves like how casuals in 4 used to use sweep when it was practically safe on block back then. We were told we would end up in more characters than ultra, and look at how many characters capcom starts with at every game, seems fair. The only reason is to hate on it now is because of the imbalance and overuse of top characters like laura and balrog( the most prime example because lets face it, theyre alot more easy to use than urien or guile since s2 came about, not stopping because of them but we should be bringing positive advice for them to change it). So far the CFN is being reworked, theres a limit of people you meet since ps4, besides the point, i love the game for the mechanics since it basically rewards you for baiting out people's ""scrub options"" like wake up dp/ a staple in the game but people would extort it since it was safe( ps. guile was always like that, they gave u the guile treatment so get used to it, but yeah i recommend it since its starting to improve and will only continue to if people actually gave reasons for hating it instead of always saying arcade mode( u have multiple survival/story mode/general mode/casual matchs/ what more do you need?) anyway i love the game for what it is and people who love sf as a whole should as well.",1491091978,1491091978,TRUE,6,1,0.548651814,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.66E+16,29,8,99709,243,26818,1601413147

Each new update is worse. Every new DLC character annoys me. I'm not paying all that money just to select the DLC characters I'll never use as my opponents in training mode to learn against them. 

I haven't put a ton of hours into this one yet, but I've put enough in to have an opinion on the netcode; it sucks. So often I'll be romping on some chump all through round one, then round 2 starts and suddenly my opponent is teleporting all the screen and I'm left totally helpless. It's like the connection must be fine on their end - because they're jukin' and jivin' all over the screen and I'm just standing there getting railed. 

Most of the complaints in the reviews have to do with the DLC. Yeah, it's a bummer that you have to pay for characters - but what REALLY sucks is that I have to pay to even have the COMPUTER use those characters. I have zero interest in playing as Urien, for example, but I want to learn how to play AGAINST him - but because I don't want to pay for a character I'll never use, I cannot practice against a CPU controlled Urien. 

Capcom wants to charge me to use him, that's fine, I get it - I want capcom to make mad cash on street fighter so they don't abandon it again - but this is too far. 

I thought the fighting itself was decent, but as I get more of a handle on it I realize it's intensely shallow. Everything is so easy to do there's no 'wow' for execution.

Hi just wanted to write a quick review about his game.. I am a bit biased with street fighter as i grew up playing this from street fighter 1 world champion edition to now, i remeber going to teh arcades and challengin people..  i have seen it evolve from being a 2d game to what it is today . that after liek 15 different titles that have come from those days... The CORE charactoers are still here and they never change!!! but i still like them as i guess being a child and playing the game when it first came out it kinda sticks with you, I have mortal kombat x as well but have to say i like this game a lot more.... The story in teh game is pretty good and i love going online and challenging people... the game is also well optimised for the pc port and that itself speaks volumes.. overall i would defnitely reccomend this game and the PAID dlcs isnt that bad as u can unlock all the charactors without paying from them as there is ingame fight money that u can earn and use to unlock the extra charactors... If you are really FANCY and want diff costumes then i guess you will have to pay for it as you will need about ingame 100k fight money per charactors and the constumes cost about the same so i chose to unlock charators and not get the costumes!!1 i would highly recocomend this game and hope the contecnt and extra charactors keep coming just liek ULTRA stree fighter 4

29,Street Fighter V,30717811,english,"Solid fighting game on the market. Unfortunately there are two major negative flaws destroying SF5 for me and many players out there. 
First of all there is a bunch of cool and flashy (and pretty strong) characters that is locked behind a soft paywall. And oh boy it will take you time to grind Fight Money (in-game currency) to unlock every single fighter. I think you can unlock 3 to 5 characters in a reasonable amount of time (easy FM for story mode walkthrought for example) but others will stay locked for you unless you are capable of grinding 100 CPU dummies in a row without any checkpoints. It might be just me but I find this process extremely tedious and not fun.
And theres is this sloppy netcode. And oh my god it is bad. Even if I am limiting my matchmaking to best possible connection available (EU) 30% of my matches have really REALLY bad preformance. Lags and framedrops are all over the place. And it is not fun at all.
I do like SF:V. If you are getting consistent smooth connection this game is good. But getting good connection is super inconsistent. There are plenty of laggy-as-hell matches even on 5-star connection. Again, it might be me, but I am kinda tired of this russian roulette. God knows I was trying.

41,Street Fighter V,21285812,english,"Completely revising my review on SFV, as the games been out for awhile now and my feelings on the game have heavily changed.

THINGS I WON'T BE MENTIONING IN THIS REVIEW. THE SHIT RELEASE THIS GAME HAD. I don't feel like that's relevant in todays market when talking about this game. Yes, it released way too early at a 60 dollar price tag. The content has changed since then, so let's not beat a dead horse. 

PROS
- Character roster is pretty diverse
- Cross play, so the community is never really dead
- The story mode is a thing
- Voice acting and music is solid. Not amazing, but decent enough.
- The fighting is fun if you're not playing in a competitive aspect.
- Netcode isn't... awful. This will be elaborated in the cons though.
- FGC will keep this  game alive until SF6 or some other odd circumstance
- Great modding scene. Some of these mods are top quality. Be warned for some NSFW mods though.
- DLC characters technically free if you earn the Fight money to buy them. I've bought 3-4 characters with fight money, so it's definitely possible to get the characters by doing character trials, the story mode/individual character stories, Fight money weeklies, and survival. 

CONS 
- STICK SUPPORT IS STILL NOT HERE! What the fuck Capcom?
- Competitively, this game is incredibly unbalanced. Season 1 was chun/nash/ryu/mika city. Now it's Guile/Urien/Rog/Laura city. It's a powercreep for weaker characters getting hella buffed, and stronger characters getting hella nerfed. It's a shit way of balancing the game. There's apparently going to be another balance update to address this, but hopefully it'll make things a bit more centered as opposed to just basically crapping on anything great and making shit into super gold. 
- Despite the story mode existing, it's not amazing. it's generic and nothing special. It's not unfun, just not fantastic. 
- As stated, the netcode for this game isn't awful. But it's not great either. Some matches may feel like they're basically local, while others are jittery and awful due to the rollback. This isn't GGPO, but it's GGPO lite. It's incredibly frustrating to play SFV knowing netcode can be so unreliable. 
- Rage quitting is still an issue. There was a patch released to try to punish rage quitters by basically putting them in purgatory, but was rolled back due to some issues. 
- Game feels casual friendly. Obviously you won't be amazing if you're just a casual player, but if you're looking for an incredibly heavy combo based fighter, go towards another fighting game. 
- IMO the character models are pretty odd. I'm not a fan of the asthetic. 
- Censored character intros/SA's in this game. You can mod them back in, but it's just stupid. 
- Servers can be shotty at times. Good lord this games servers  go down randomly or for maitanence frequently, and it can be pretty frustrating if you're looking to play online.
- Cash shop costumes and stages are a bit overpriced imo. 
- Survival mode is awful and is the only way to get colors for the default costumes unless you buy them. Fuck that. 

Overall, idk how to feel about SFV. I actually liked it more when SFV released, and now I just kinda only care about modding it. Everything about it screams ""meh"" in comparison to other fighting games I've played. If you are interested in it, I would recommend it for you if you enjoy mods and a competitive fighting game, but this game is almost a year old and is still suffering from issues that should be fixed by capcom. Hopefully this will happen soon, but I'm gonna stay skeptical until they actually make these changes.",1455754440,1489601215,FALSE,1,0,0.502164543,1,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.66E+16,77,18,16990,0,12464,1589604657

43,Street Fighter V,30519929,english,"My opinion of this game changes based on the people I fight and I’m sure that's how it is for most people but they just don't know it...

Let me explain...

I’ve played fighting games my whole life, I played the first mortal kombats, MK9, SF Alpha series, SF 3rd Strike, USF4 and now I’m tackling Street fighter 5. Now I’m not about to claim to be the best player in the world because I know I’m nowhere close. But I do have a decent understanding of street fighter in general and how it relates to other fighters out there.

The game plays and looks absolutely beautiful. It's easy to learn and has a difficult learning curve, the supers are great and there's a great character roster with lots of different archetypes. However, that's where the problem lies. 

Every character in the game has his strengths and weaknesses and now that the game has been out for a while players have learned their preferred characters strengths and exploited them. Unfortunately, the term ""strengths"" isn't things like damage output or how much life they have or their mobility. It's the game breaking cheese and tools that were implemented to help the new players out. 

There are only a few characters that have this so called ""strength""

Ryu: After Season 2, He was nerfed in my opinion but that doesn't excuse the fact that he's still a Shotokan character. Ryu is good at everything but excels at nothing. Players have seen this so they move on the other way to get wins: Throws... Capcom implemented some kind of system that allows players to constantly throw loop their opponents. All it takes is for them to corner their opponent, get a hard knockdown, mash out a couple of jabs and kicks and then throw again, unless your opponent sees it coming, you can get at least 3-4 throws in a row depending on the intelligence of your opponent. By that time, your opponent’s health just dropped about 50%

Ken: Probably my most hated character to play against. Ken’s heavy tatsu has been changed that it arcs and travels almost the entire screen, this allows an instant “get-in” and now has no need for “footsies.” That tatsu also beats out most normals, anti-airs, and special moves. Most kens will follow that up with an instant DP or…you guessed it, a throw loop…when he’s not spamming tatsus…Ken will probably do the same combo, ……………every time…………when he gets a chance its always: target combo -> DP or Tatsu. This simple combo does a surprisingly decent amount of damage and is very easy to set up. Ken also has a bigger potential for throw loops then Ryu does. Not to mention being another Shotokan character so anyone can pick him up day 1 and be an instant pro.

Chun Li: Am I about to get “poked” to death?? Chun Li, the queen of footsies. Chun Li’s standing Heavy punch reaches a long-ass distance and does good damage. Ok then, doesn’t sound too bad, ill just jump over it right? Wrong…Chun Li’s Anti-Air AND amazing setup option is…wait for it…STANDING LIGHT KICK…and that is bulls h i t enough for anyone…

Cammy: Another victim of using the same combo over and over until they win: Crouching Medium punch -> Crouching Medium punch -> Spiral Arrow…until they win.

Bison: You would think that without Bison’s trademark Psycho Crusher, He wouldn’t be as bad a threat. And you’re right to a degree. Bison isn’t too bad until you get an opponent who overly relies on throws…because of how amazing his dash is. Bison’s dash is him warping in and out of space to get in close. If timed right, it can go through projectiles. When, he’s playing footsies out of nowhere he’ll disappear and reappear in front of you and grab your unprepared a$$...when he activates his V-Trigger. It’ll get even worse because now, his dash is faster, AND it can now teleport him BEHIND YOU. Making grabs that much easier. Also, the Devil’s Reverse, or for those who don’t play Bison…the “Goddamn Flying hand attack thing that keeps hitting me” is powered up as well. In V-trigger, Ex Devils Reverse will make bison disappear in the air for a solid half second and then he will reappear on whichever side your opponent decides. This means that blocking it is a complete 50/50 guessing game on which side to block.

Laura: You probably won’t be able to tell a pro Laura player from a blind guy feeling for his keys on his fight stick. Almost every normal that Laura has is safe on block or a frame trap. Mix that up with a command throw or two and you have yourself a win.

Balrog: Every time you face Balrog you’re going to be saying one of the following sentences every time
1.	Wait wasn’t I just winning that round??
2.	Holy Sh it look at that damage
3.	Damnit he has V-Trigger
4.	It took me 60 seconds to do all that damage to him and he just evened up the round in 5.
Balrogs damage output especially in v-trigger is something out of science fiction. He can link every special move together in an obscurely long combo that will in some cases do almost 65%-70% damage and your be there thinking WTF.

Guile: Spamming sonic booms until your opponent jumps. Then just do flash kick. Win. And for some reason, Guile players have this uncanny ability to hit a throw on you every time they go for one. I don’t know what it is but for some reason they always get it on you.

You get the idea. What makes this so irritating is that you would never see players using this kind of play when playing Ultra Street Fighter 4 would you? Throw loops, immense damage combos, Cheese. However, I have accepted the fact that this isn’t USF4 and I’m glad that it isn’t, if it was I wouldn’t buy it because I already own USF4 and I don’t want a clone of a game I already have. 

This game does bring a few POSITIVES to the series that yours truly is happy to see:

Easier combos: 1 frame links in USF4 were ridiculous to execute especially in laggy online matches. SF5 widened that gap to 5 frame links.

New ranking system: I still don’t understand how the battle points and Player points in USF4 work. SF5 ranked system is easy to understand.

Easy troubleshooting: when watching your replays, it’s easy to see where you went wrong and what to fix in your own game play style. Learning matchups and taking advantage of it in an online match is very satisfying.

Overall: The game brings a lot to the table winning feels satisfying and it looks amazing. I would give this game a thumbs down if I had just gotten off a loss from a Ken or a Balrog and I would probably be complaining about NEEDED BALANCE PATCHES AND DEVS DON’T LISTEN and blah blah blah…but when I have a clear head and think about the experience as a whole that I have with the game, it’s definitely a positive one.

If you are not a fighting game fan and you are just looking for a fighter, Id say there are better alternatives.  
If you are a fighting game / SF fan this game is great.  I personally love it,  I feel it has taken some cues from the original world warrior era in the sense it feels like a throw back to the old game play.

[h1] Game play  [/h1] is super  tight.  They have laxed the timing requirements for combos/linkers making it very accessible for new comers say if you haven’t played for a while.  Maybe Alpha 3 was your last jam?  No problem you will pick this up quick!

No ridiculous super ultra moves,  No insane never ending combos.  This is pure tight fighting.  If you want big over the top fights go see Marvel Vs Capcom 3,  It just came out on Steam.  If you want tight competitive fighting then Street Fighter V is for you.

In regards to all the negative reviews - from what I can see of them on the main page. the majority of them have well over 100hrs gameplay.  I don’t get that.  How can you say the game is no good yet you subject your self to in some circumstances, 3 whole working weeks of playing the game.  That makes no sense to me.  You cant thumbs down due to one thing you don’t like.  You need to weigh the whole package. What are you?  A 

They key to enjoying and getting your monies worth in this game is to have friends that also play.  If you have a mate or two that are similar skill and you play at least 2 - 3 times a week you will git gud quick.  I cant explain how fun it gets when you are competitive at similar skill levels.  Its always “one more rematch” 

If you don’t have like minded friends to play with, it may be a different story.  Even though the gameplay is great,  seeing as the game has been out for a while the majority of online  players are pros.  If you are beginner you will get F’d up.  It can be really off putting getting smashed over and over again.  You need a real thick skin to hang in there and keep playing.

 [h1] tl/dr [/h1]-  If you have friends to play with – buy this.  If you don’t but you are confident player and or have the keenness to keep coming back until you git gud  - buy this.
If your just looking for a game to play but don’t fill  the above – look elsewhere.

70,Street Fighter V,30182305,english,"An excellent, and well polished fighting game that welcomes newbies and rewards HardCore gamers alike.

Street Fighter V is a 8-directional, 6 button fighting game that takes over 20 years of fighting game history and Utilizes its experiance to make an impressively deep, challenging, and fun 2 player fighter. At the time of reviewing this game, SFV now has a proper story mode, and vs AI setting in versus, a significant selection of fighters to choose from, and a great selection of costumes you can obtain (via fight money, or real money). also worth noting, that DLC characters and stages can be aquired either through saving up fight money in game, or by simply paying for them with real money.

Gameplay is exactally as you would expect from a Street Fighter game. fights are on a 2 dimentional plain, utilizing an 8-Directional input to move / duck / jump. There are three different punch and kick inputs to use (light, strong, heavy), each with different advantages and weaknesses depending on the character you use. This game can be enjoyed by casual players, and even more so by people who seek to learn the tricks and techniques of their character of their choice. With that said, It will start with you learning how to do the special and ultra moves, then learning how to preform complex combinations, then learning how to read your opponent. SFV also has new mechinics called the V-skill, which is a unique skill each character can use by pressing medium punch & medium kick together. and the V-Trigger (Hp & Hk), an activatable powerup that grants your character either a powerup, or a move that will give you an advantage over your opponent.

Compareing this to earlier street fighter titles, This one feels alot easier to play than the others. The characters are unique in their fighting styles (including ryu and ken. they now have their own move set.) and feel fresh and new, while staying true to how people knew them from previous enteries. Visually, the game looks great, and runs smoothly online and offline.

Overall, If you want to get into fighting games, or if you are a veteran getting back into, or looking for a new game to pick up. Street Fighter V is an excellent addition and recommendation for you.

I cannot believe that there is more content like the Capcom Pro Tour stage and new alternative costumes for both Chun Li and Cammy that we have to put more money into the game to get content that all of us should have had from the start. Besides that, the game needs super obvious fixes and Crapcom should have taken their time to make this game better and they chose not to. Instead, they expect us to pay more money and not even fix the game themselves; Too many frame traps, too many moves that are safe on block, and certain characters are way too derpy and overpowered while there are also some characters that need obvious buffs to stay relevant in the game. The campaign was free, but honestly, I think the extra characters and a few colors and costumes should have been free instead more than the campaign (the campaign should have already been in the game anyway). 


     Overall, still not satisfied with my purchase of this game. Oh man. I almost forgot to mention how these guys are trying to promote this ""Season Pass"" and it is a character pack instead. Careful, Crapcom. Don't falsely advertise products because you guys failed to meet expectations for your game....

This is the follow up to one of the greatest games ever made -  Ultra Street Fighter IV.

Street Fighter V fails to deliver on almost every level.

It is clearly a game made for the masses and just designed purely to make money. The more people play it the more money they make therefore they have totally simplified the gameplay to widen the player base and basically stuck two fingers up at the loyal fanbase who didn't mind investing time and effort into perfecting moves and combos and were prepared embark on a steep learning curve (or what i call a journey) to become technically proficent. Thats where the real reward is and where Ultra SFIV really excelled.

This is a game made for 4year old and upwards and all the bugbrains who couldn't do the moves or combos in the previous game.

This game is pathetic and is plagued by technical issues. 
This game is a joke and is an early Access game
This game is laughable and is ridiculously overpriced
This game is the worst unfinished game ever and has about 17 Characters
This game is the worst Street Fighter game ever
This game is cartoonish nonsense and is made for people who watch Nickolodeon/ CBeebies
This game is an insult to all real hardcore Street Fighter fans because the gameplay is just not there!

Capcom i'm sure have a truckload of DLC ready to be released bit by bit for this game and are planning to drag it out for as long as possible to keep the money roilling in for themselves but i will certainly not be wasting another penny on it.

So to sum up;

Ultra Street Fighter IV - The Greatest Fighting game ever made - nothing else even comes close

Street Fighter V - Most Disappointing Fighting game ever made - nothing else even comes close

Fighting games need to start realising how well they lend themselves to a F2P model. People would be happy to pay $5 per character I think if the game was free, and it would make the game so much more popular.

Simply put, because of the PS4 cross-play, there is enough low ranking players to fight against to have a reasonable climb up the ladder. Other fighting games on steam seam to have small dedicated groups of players who are all extremely good. In this game I can find quick matches against players of similar skill as me. This being the case, I do not have to go online and get crushed for one hundred hours before I get a chance at actually winning.

26,Street Fighter V,29631140,english,"I'm not very good at fighting games, but I usually enjoy playing them, and SFV is no exception. In fact, I'd say it's probably my favourite fighting game of all time.

So what's so good about the game? Well, for starters, the game mechanics are really fun (which is the most important bit, IMO), and it's pretty easy to learn the basics of each character thanks to the demonstrations mode. The singleplayer content is also more extensive than I'd anticipated: the story mode especially is better fleshed out than I would've expected from a Street Fighter game. Online works well too, and I haven't experienced too much lag online in spite of what some other people seem to be reporting here on Steam.

Of course Street Fighter V is not a perfect game. It lacks an arcade mode, the button prompts are all Xbox controller icons even if you're using a keyboard, and you are not allowed to rebind keyboard controls without third party programs. The game can also randomly crash if you have Wacom tablet drivers installed on your PC.

A lot of the game's content has been locked behind DLC, including new characters, stages and alternate character costumes and colours. Most of these things can be purchased with in-game currency called Fight Money, so you don't necessarily need to pay to get any of the characters. At some point you will likely need to either grind for Fight Money or buy them with real money, but I personally find that a fair price to pay since Capcom has promised there will not be a ""Super Street Fighter V"" or other game upgrades like that.

ii) For Online players only (lacks single player content)
iii) Nothing is free (including colors), trust me this is true nothing is free at all. Depending what version you bought you'll get characters & their specific single colors only. 
iv) Everything can only be bought by Fight money, though you can buy these off but way 2 expesive
v) Fight money gets earned only online.

41,Street Fighter V,29452967,english,"I'm recommending this, but only to people who play online and only to fairly hardcore fans of fighting games and even to those people I can't recommend the game in good conscience at full price.

I'm a big street fighter fan and have been since the first street fighter hit the arcade. Every iteration of the game since then has seen various improvements and an increase in the roster and the general amount of content all round, until this one.

I bought this on sale with both DLC packs for around £30. The base game was (and still is I think) £40-£50 and I couldn't recommend it at that price, simply because of the woeful amount of content. 

I'm not going to talk about the lack of arcade mode, that particular omission is well known, what I am going to talk about however is the roster. Given the price of the game, pitiful is the word I would use to describe it. In the original street fighter you could only play as Ryu in single player, or Ken if you were player two in a fight against somebody else. Street fighter II saw this roster of playable characters rise from one to eight. Super street fighter II included the boss characters as playable, bringing the roster to twelve. The previous game to this one, (ultra street fighter 4) gives us a roster of forty four playable characters. Yes, you read that right. Forty four. Street fighter V, including all it's DLC (so far) gives us a roster of twenty three characters, almost half that of the previous title. There are also less stages available and of the few there are, some are locked and must be purchased.

This brings us on to what I call ""free to play"" mechanics. What I mean by this is that while it's possible to unlock additional content and buy additional characters with in game currency, acquiring said currency has been made so mind numbingly tedious that anyone who enjoys the game and has a bit of spare cash lying around is likely going to throw that cash at the game in order to bypass this ""grind"". Capcom know this and this is why they have adopted this ""free to play"" mechanic. It was a mechanic made popular by free to play titles, mostly MMO's, where it's acceptable given that the game is free in the first place. Sadly, it has since been adopted by publishers of premium price titles. This is frankly disgusting. It's a cancer, eating the video games industry from within and shouldn't be encouraged. 

As for the actual game itself, the fighting mechanics are as crisp as ever although the pace is a tad slower than SFIV, making fights feel more tactical and less frenetic. The slower pace also makes it easier to bait your opponent then punish them on the counter and if you have the skills and timing required to master the combos, this punishment can be pretty severe. Ultra combos are gone and instead we have the V trigger and the V reversal. These are powered by the ""revenge meter"" as the ultra combos were in previous titles and if used appropriately, they can turn the tide of battle back to your favour or snatch victory from the jaws of defeat. Super combos have been renamed to ""critical arts"" but appear to function identically, being powered by the EX meter as in previous titles. EX moves are still around and are as useful as they've always been.

Sadly, the despicable business practices displayed by CapCom are why I'm only recommending this game if it's on sale and you can pick it up for £10 for the base game or £30 with all the DLC as I did. The content found in the base game and the two DLC packs together is worth £30, but no more than that.",1485220046,1485283659,TRUE,9,0,0.53513211,1,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.66E+16,226,13,1249,0,743,1580858513

The character diversity and design in general is really good, even if 7 of the 23 currently available ones are DLC characters, but they are decently farmable ingame. 
Game seems rushed by Capcom, clear downstep from Ultra Street Fighter IV. As known for the series, the game is hard to get into but can feel really rewarding once you get the hang of it and win your first matches. 

No recommendation though, it's just in such a bad spot that makes it almost unplayable. You can't just quickly step in and play a few online matches and in my opinion that is what fighting games are for despite playing offline against friends for fun or on a higher competetive level on a regular basis.

-If you read prior reviews or just skimmed through various sites for feedback, everyone knows (or most are in denial) that this game is just not a pure strategic/intense fighting game anymore. You'll notice many players, casual and pros, stating this game is just boring to watch, and it is. Absolutely.  Grand finals, ""mix-ups"" , ""vortex"" ""thought provoking setup whatever, yadda, it's blah. It's not there anymore.

After watching hours of ""Grand Finals :insert tournament here:"", you're almost more intuned with the commentator, hyping such a lame combo into CA, than the actual gameplay. They hype it up so well you almost lose focus on what's really going on, boring target combos and ""chains"" that anyone can do 5 mins into the game, on top of hte 6-8 frame input lag they installed for the ""offline/online similarity feel"".

Where are the 1 frame links and ""holy crap how'd you do that Sako/Momochi/Diago/Infiltration etc combo"". You can only watch light punch anti-air, or light punch-special into CA happen so many times. 

Every character has their own arsenal of offense and punishes across the board, but it's the same from each and every single character. There is no diversity. Rush in, do your thing, if you don't make well back out and try it again later. If that doesn't work hopefully LP hit confirms and well etc.

Defense, cool, block as much as you want, tech throw maybe. I guess V-reversal if you want. You're going to get hit, but regardless, upon wake up, wooo, pick your best option because they'll have a meaty/throw/light punch waiting for you (on top of Season 2 buffs/nerfs).

""Hey Derp, you missed me on whiff Shoryu or anything else, cool. Hit fierce, watch them crumble and let me dance on my arcade stick with the exact same setup into ""mix-up""-CA that every character has at a kindergarten level.

This game has no ""WOW!"" moments. No, ""holy crap I need to practice that in training mode so I can try that next time this happens."" You can pull EVERY single combo, EVERY single clutch moment from the pros as you would if you went into training mode for an hour or maybe do the horrible trial mode for your chosen character that CAPCOM deems is worthy of practice for a dedicated SF player. I remember when SF4/USF4 trials had me going for long periods of time only to finally understand the timing of each combo among each character. That in a sense, granted respect for players fighting at a higher level online/offline, pulling combos off that required ""actual"" practice. 

I still go back to SF3/SF4/USF4 vids and seeing pros/practioners pull something clutch that I never could without hours of practice, in that moment, thinking wow, they really earned that combo/punish, :hats off to you, you're nuts. Then I go to SFV videos and just fall asleep, waking up at the end, where the commentators are hyping up the winner. :yawn:

However, having spent nearly 500 hours & almost every day since Feburary 2016 playing the title, not including the beta a few months earlier, it's been some of the most fun & engaging time I've spent with any video game in the last 30 years.

Nearly a year later I'm still learning & improving with my main fighter, Zangief, after a brief dabble with both Laura & Claw. If I really wanted too, I could spend countless months getting to an equally proficient level with the other characters in the cast, many more who I presume are still to come in the years ahead with Season 2 trickling out another 5 over the next 12 months.

I've made some great friends in the fighting game community over at twitch & on discord channels thanks to this game & even started regularly tuning into the CPT tournament events to watch and learn from high level play. Something I never felt the desire too with games such as CS:GO & Hearthstone. I've become familiar enough with all the 'professional' players such as who they main, what their personal rivalries are etc to the point where if I was asked I'd claim that this was my 'sport' the same way others may follow more traditional games like football or hockey.

Despite the numerous negative posts you'll find about SFV's server woes - justified as they are still on-going, finding a game here online in the UK doesn't typically take longer than 20-30 seconds. Setting the match making options to 4-5 bars only & 'ASK' typically solves the laggy match issue 90% of the time but despite this the connection bar can still be misleading.
Due to the cross compatability with the Playstation 4, it also makes playing a fighting game on the PC more viable than ever in terms of player population which is the major problem with this type of game on steam and pc in general being a somewhat niche category in the world of MOBA's & team FPS's.

While it helped I had previous experience with both SFIV beforehand & the various incarnations of SFII back in the day, the amount of resource there is both in game with training & challenge modes along with unending online resource should mean anyone with a passing interest in fighting or competitive gaming should find it easy enough to get to a semi-competent level. The systems in game aren't as difficult to learn as KoF or a GG/BlazBlue & the removal of focus from IV makes the game far more beginner friendly.

Unlike other online competitive games your progression really is dictated by how much time you personally put into practising rather than having the quality of your team mates & RNG be a factor. While learning frame data, character specific MU's & optimal punishes will speed your ascent up the league ranking, it's still more than possible to have an enjoyable time just going by gut feeling and a basic knowledge of target combos and special moves.

Despite the positives there have been numerous & sizeable negatives since release.
The rootkit debacle which (thankfully) is now gone probably cut a sizeable chunk of the more casual player base away from the game along with the repeated & on-going failure for them to implement a proper rage quitting system. The single player story mode also took several months to be released and was frankly, quite rubbish. 

I would say though that the people still complaining about a lack of single player mode are oblivious to realise that this was a game mode designed to compensate for a lack of online play in consoles back in the 1990's-2000's & now completely redundant. You don't get the same amount of negative feedback about Counter Strike or Overwatch not having a single player campaign, it's quite frankly ridiculous.

Overall SFV is a fantastic product & compared to titles like which despite phenomenal sales were completely broken in terms of netcode & framerate & ultimately abandoned by their developer after less than a year (cough nethersoft cough) it's definitely worth a purchase & what is by now quite often a bargain price.",1474760636,1484815121,TRUE,1,1,0.484496146,4,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.66E+16,362,18,38964,0,28679,1535756072

The controls are very ill-conceived with almost no customization for keyboard or my PS3/PC compatible arcade stick that has worked on other games including USFIV. The graphics look grainy and blurred even on the highest settings. Do not buy this game even on sale, it is not worth it it on PC.

EDIT

After reading some more information about the game and buying it on sale, I have found some work arounds for the above issues that have greatly improved my enjoyment of it. While there is still limited native support at this time for different control schemes, most X-input controllers work fine, and I've seen it mentioned that direct input controllers will be supported in the future natively. Graphics wise, turning anti-aliasing to low, and ensuring the game is utilizing my GPU went a long ways in improving the look of the game. Overall, this game is a good buy when it's on sale, as the in game store makes use of numerous microtransactions making the 60$ full price a bit onerous for playing on a budget.

80,Street Fighter V,29159443,english,"I won't get into the laundry-list of items that need to be fixed because basic things such as netcode and a properly designed lobby system have been repeatedly mentioned by other reviewers.  

I bought the game for $20 during the winter sale, when the game had been out for a year.  I had hoped that all of the negatives would've been fixed by now.  It wasn't worth it.

By far the biggest problem is this:  it's BORING.  Once you get to gold tier, it becomes mind-numbingly repetitive because it is now a TURN-BASED GUESSING GAME.  That's right, you have to wait your turn in order to attack.  However, while doing so, you must continually guess whether it's best to block, try and tech a throw, block an overhead, or backdash from grapplers.  There is practically no reaction time to throws unless you detect a pattern in your opponent.  Footsies revolve around waiting for a counter-hit and getting lucky with a crush counter to follow up with a combo that puts you in the position I just described above.  It is absolute crap.

To be honest, it was enjoyable up to a point.  You may have fun in bronze and silver tiers because people still take chances there.  After that, it becomes very repetitive and frustrating.  To advance, you then need to grind out countless hours to memorize which moves are safe or not on block.  The recovery times on hits and misses for specials and ALL normals.  And not just for your character... FOR ALL CHARACTERS.  That is what the turn-based system requires.

If this sounds like fun to you, then so be it.  For me, life is too short to spend studying frame data for a boring game with horrible gameplay mechanics that is frustrating at best (after a point).

This is my first negative review for a game.  That alone should tell you something.

Oh, and I've been playing the SF series since SFII on the SNES.",1484044897,1484064577,FALSE,2,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.66E+16,83,1,15330,0,5102,1575655106
81,Street Fighter V,24347364,english,"I wanted to hold off on reviewing Street Fighter V until more content was released, since Capcom themselves admitted that the game was incomplete at launch.  Nonetheless, I immediately bought the game as soon as it came out because I wanted to jump straight into the online multiplayer mode.  Since then, I have been regularly playing it every now and then, and it still hasn't gotten old yet to this day.  Furthermore, there are still plans to release additional content in the future.  Now that the story mode has been released, I feel like I can give the game a fair review at this point.

The biggest attraction of Street Fighter V remains the online multiplayer mode.  The battle system has more depth to it than any previous iteration of Street Fighter, and there are plenty of opportunities to make a comeback against an opponent who is overwhelming you.  Your character's V-gauge will fill up as you take damage, allowing you to perform special techniques that could potentially reverse the direction the match is heading in.  At the same time, your character's special gauge will also be filling up both as you give and receive damage, so it is still rewarding to go on the offensive.  The developers also did a great job at ensuring that the characters in this game are all balanced (well, maybe except for Zangief), and that the play style for each character is a unique challenge to tackle and become accustomed to.  Personally, I was satisfied by this game's multiplayer mode alone, but I understand that this might not be the case for everyone else.

Thankfully, Capcom has added enough single player content to keep many players satisfied by this point.  Sure, they still haven't added Arcade Mode yet, but the amount of single-player content currently available was enough to satiate my needs of fighting against the game's AIs.  This is just my personal taste, but I found that I didn't need Arcade Mode considering everything else the game had to offer.  Survival Mode helped test any foolproof strategies I'd thought up against hordes of AI opponents, and Challenge Mode helped me practice vital combos for the characters I wanted to become familiar with.  The long-anticipated Story Mode was well worth the wait (in my opinion) and definitely has the most fully fleshed-out plot in any Street Fighter game to date.  It also pays homage to many of the earlier Street Fighter games in ways that might surprise some people.

The only real complaint I have about this game is that there still aren't too many characters  on the roster just yet, although I am aware that this will change in future updates.  Plus, the amount of variance between the playstyles of the different characters is enough to keep me entertained for now.  Despite a difficult launch, I still have very high hopes for Street Fighter V, and I believe the amount of depth the game possesses is enough to keep most hardcore players hooked - therefore, I would certainly recommend it to fans of the series.",1468646436,1484005415,TRUE,3,0,0.551592231,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.66E+16,374,20,2760,0,2689,1571509918

Yes this entry is easier to get into compared to past games but it still offers an engaging fun challenge.

V-trigger is an exciting addition that adds flair and cool factor to each character.  unlike SF4 giving you a free Super (Ultra bar) for getting beaten up..  V-trigger takes careful usage to reap the full benefits.

Art style is a great mix up between cartoonish and modern.  Long gone are the goofy disproportioned models of SF4.  I LOVE the soundtrack you can tell the composers put some real love into some of these themes.  Hearing Jazzy NYC again brings back wonderful memories.

Being able to unlock new content for free is very cool, although I don't mind paying the small price tags when I want something fast.

92,Street Fighter V,29080539,english,"*AS A DISCLAIMER I PURCHASED THIS GAME DURING THE WINTER SALE FOR $20*

TLDR; This game is a simple enjoyable experience if you have even a little fun with fighters. It's a cash grab, but there are ways to spend less money to get all the extra content. The simplicity is important to the growth of the Fighting Game Community.

Let's start with the obvious and huge faults of this game, before I get into my specific recommendation: THIS GAME IS A CASH GRAB. The content of this game is very lack luster for a $70 game (100 if you want all the characters up front). The single player mode is a joke, and Capcom is nickle and diming everyone for content that people expect from a AAA title.

Now here's what's good: The game is a very solid and simplistic fighter. Sure it's not doing anything big to 'innovate the fighting genre', but sometimes simplicity is what makes a game great. This game is great for first timers, and people who want to have a simpler fighting experience not unlike earlier entries in the series. The size of the cast of characters is always discussed as a negative with 16 characters in the base game. (Just to note, SF4 had 25 in the base game) In my opinion, smaller casts of characters mean better potential for balance. As a competitor, it's far easier to understand a variety of matchups when the cast is smaller, meaning less chance of that weird character nobody plays bodying you due to your lack of knowledge. (SF4 clocks in at 44 characters by the time it hit Ultra. That's a lot of intricacies to learn, and a lot harder for Capcom to balance.)

Now if you wish to have all the content the game offers, and you want to spend nothing beyond sale price... you're a little out of luck. You will have to play for HOURS to get every last character for free, but one thing that isn't talked about enough is the fact you can purchase characters individually. Remember how I said the single player is a joke? Beating all the single player modes gives you a hefty lot of in game currency for little effort. Use that money to buy the characters you REALLY want, and pay real money for the others. Not a perfect system, but if you're good at managing funds and prioritizing, you'll be fine.

I understand that a lot of what I'm claiming to be positives could be seen as negatives. People shouldn't have to worry about 'managing and prioritizing' actual money in a game they bought, and a lot of what I'm saying about roster sizes and matchup knowledge could be seen as laziness. The truth is, a lot of the reviews on here that are positive are people claiming the game is simpler than other games, but not enough people are explaining why and I think it's really important to do so.

For anyone who believes this mentality of simplicity is killing the genre, I wish to present you a counter point. If you don't allow accessibility into your community, you'll never grow as one. Fighting games as a whole don't bring in the eSports numbers like LoL and CS:GO do. This is a perfect time to get more people interested in these games, and not just young up-and-comers, but also the student who doesn't have time for gaming, or the family man/woman who's too busy working to play games. League does so well because it's accessible, but Fighting games don't have that accessibility.

Season 2 came and with that a lot o shit, some already strong characters buffed to the top and some nerfed to the ground for no reason, my main and second characters became useless and the third low tier in the best case. Thanks Crapcom for making me drop my favourite fighting game. 


EDIT 02/24: Online is good to go, is finding matches faster than before, battle lounges are working ok too.

First of all, i do not recommend this game now for casual players who don't want to play online, this release date focus is the competitive scene and the game still don't have all single player (and some MP) contents, if you want to play against CPU wait until june when the game will be complete and possibly costing less.

A lot of people is making negative reviews based on the lacking of some content that was already know for months, some complaining for don't have suport for their controllers (what was already know before release), some because are stupid enough to not find the ingame button remap, if you buy a full priced game at release without get informed about, you are the only one to blame.

For now, Xbox controllers works, another controllers can be used with XInput remapping tools and Capcom has announced that will implement suport for directInput-based controllers in a future update.

In the first day the servers had a lot of issues making online gaming impossible, everyone who buy it has the right to complain, but today works perfectly fine for me.


Why i recommend this game?

Amazing character redesign that make me want to play with all of then.

Amazing game system that remove all lazy stuff from SFIV resulting in a very fun and well balanced game.

Amazing netcode that make online play indistinguishable from local.

Excelent optimization that make an actual low end graphics card match PS4 graphics level.

In game currency that make possible acquire all future DLC characters without pay real money (i have reached the value for the first DLC on day one just playing single players modes).

97,Street Fighter V,29037167,english,"I am usually very cautios when buying fighting games on Steam. Their online multiplayer ends up deserted in a couple of weeks. I miss those old days when we had a bunch of friends at home and playing fighting games, taking turns in beating eachother to a pulp. But those days are gone. And all we have is the multiplayer online, or lobbying with friends. People got lazy...

So the second best choice if I want to have some fun with a good fighting game is buying it for the PS4 now. These games are much more crowded on consoles, so it's not all wasted. But street fighter has cross platform multiplayer between Playstation and PC. I can't praise it enogh when a dev is doing that. The worst thing always is a divided community, and I would LOVE to see this in more games.

Let's give it a numerical rating, for the sake of it (people usually love that)

Story: 5/10 (That's not necessarily a bad thing. It's the same kind of cute cheesy Street fighter story)
Graphics: 8/10 (shading, shadows, and many textures could be of a higher quality, but looks great)
Features: 6/10 (There are not many modes to play, and the existent ones are a bit clumsy. Overall solid multiplayer)
Balance: 7/10 (sometimes better than the competition, and we had balance fixes, but patches are coming very slowly)

I can't think up many things to say about a fighting game, since you already know what this is. The players concern here usually is the functionality, lags, stability, and finding players to play against. And in these departments Capcom did a good job. Actually the PC version this time is better than the PS4 version, where I personally noticed considerable input lag. And there is no sign of it on PC.

The business model.... selling cosmetic stuff, is a love or hate thing. I personally am good with it, since I know that servers must be maintained, bills paid, and so on. If Capcom would not sell it, the would have to abandon the game and bring out Street Fighter 6 to get some cash again.

I bought this game when it was $20 dollars during the steam christmas sale, and $20 is still too much when you take into account that just to get all of the characters, it will cost you $50 more.

With season 2 of the game well under way, I felt it was only fair to update my review. I still do not recommend this game to anybody who wants a functional game. This is not one. Look else where. Because a majority of what I have to complain is written below already, I will keep this brief.

PROS:
+Game now has better xinput controller support
+Season 2 removed some of the dumb aspects of the gameplay (game balance, slight improvement to frame delay)

CONS:
-No visual upgrades as of yet
-Online still unfunctional
-Frames still drop for no reason in majority of situations(screen transitions, leaving/entering a game, etc.)
-CAPCOM was willing to allow a rootkit to be installed in an update with the game(if you dont know what a rootkit is, it allows direct access to your computer essentially. Pretty much a virus you paid money to have on your computer)
-Load times are still abysmal

I really wanted to like this game, it's a shame that nobody at CAPCOM has a brain.

OLD REVIEW
The game is fun locally but online is a mess. Even with a fun local experience, the game has no way of detecting a handful of controllers and sticks without the help of outside programs. After months of waiting for Capcom to fix their online connection problems (glitchy roll back, false connection readings, unexplained slowdowns between rounds), we have far less in terms of a functional game than what we paid for. Asking 60$+ for a game as incomplete, non-functional, and just down right ugly as Street Fighter 5 is a scam. There are far more complete fighting games than this one for a much lower cost.
      It doesn't matter what the pros say about the game like ""Turn a blind eye to the 8 frames of delay,"" or ""Wait on future updates,"" because they are not the vast majority. It seems to me that them and Capcom would rather push an unpolished pile of rubish and make money off that than try and create a fun, PLAYABLE online experience for the rest of us that can't afford to make it out to big events.

TLDR; Money is better spent elsewhere. Game is ugly and online is non-functional.",1468863893,1483378056,FALSE,2,0,0.523809552,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.66E+16,221,3,12672,0,9940,1596997360

D-input is now compatible with this game for starters, and on top of that the balances and system changes, while some very unneccesary, are overall great and really add to the game. As a Ken player I feel like while he did get his fair share of nerfs, even my old main feels a bit more fun to play than in season 1. Now for the biggie being Akuma, he's awesome. He has a ton of options and loads of variety in playstyle compared to the rest of the cast in season 1, this makes me hopeful for season 2 onward. Wether or not you like shotos I think everyone will agree that Akuma would be a great example of what Capcom should bring out season 2 onward. And also... CAPCOM MAKE THAT ARCADE MODE ALREADY!!!!!

2. Multiple places (easy to do) to edit config files. Google is your friend (or friends that already did it.) 
3. Fight money is a bit slow to earn if you don't know how to do it. (yay google)
--somewhere in between: 1. iffy matchmaking. Not saying its perfect but this one tends to throw a bone more often than not against you. The fact the matchmaking uses a Relay server matching or P2P depending on the connection quality is also iffy. If you see two points connected to a square on loading, thats relay. Prepare for the apocalypse!
2. Content pricing: everything revolves around fight money unfortunately. even tags. its all pretty pricey for what it is, most expensive being the characters followed by stages (characters have strong single player content returns on fight money.)

Depsite all that bad its still very much a good game in its own right. I recommend it BUT WITH A WORD OF WARNING. Do not go in expecting it to be perfect, expect to toy with settings.

Capcom fails to address many well known issues, such as incompatibility with Wacom drivers, PC graphics unoptimized on launch, lack of keyboard mapping aside from rather awkwardly limited one, and last but not least, frustrating setting change for game resolution. I'd like to emphasize that most of these issues were posted on bug submission during beta test phase by numerous users, yet still went unaddressed in the supposed ""launch"". This truely illustrates Capcom's lack of quality control and neglect for it's customer base.

Some of the issues, some earlier than others, were addressed in the few month after the release.
Some of the issues left unsolved.

Pros
-The game runs smoothly and it does have a large variety of characters that can help people figure out who they want to play


Cons
-The combos are simplified, now this may sound good but it is not.
This creates problems were certain moves go into one another too easily and it can generally make certain matchups unfair because certain characters feel like they have larger reaches. 
-The net code can awful. There are times that you will experience people teleport jumping into a grab then an ex super in a single frame.
-Grabs also feel unfair. I know you can stop grabs but there are times when the attack animation shows those split seconds of hitting the body but then your grabbed. This is not fun especially whenv you're playing better then your opponent.

Pros:
1. Amazing graphics.
2. Gameplay is nice.
3. It's a nice starter for people who want to play fighting games.
4. Overall, a good release for the Street Fighter franchise.
5. A FREE DLC story mode.

Cons:
1. The game is expensive! Unless you buy it on sale like me, then I think it's not worth the purchase.
2. I don't understand why the story costumes and stuff need to be bought after unlocking it.
3. I've only played a few ranked matches but I got a couple of match where the skill level is complete different.
4. Lag. Now i'm not so sure if this is on their end or my end (probably mine lol), but I got a few games where characters suddenly jump out of nowhere.

Also, I don't understand why people are putting a thumbs down for this game due to season passes and dlc characters. I mean, seriously guys, thumb down the DLC not the core game! 

If you guys can't accept the fact that you need to purchase the characters then go play USFIV first. This game is new, which means they have to add them slowly. If you want a copy of Street Fighter V that has all the characters, might as well wait for a version that has it all (like USFIV or SSFIV compared to the first release SFIV) but you're definitely gonna have to wait for a few more years.

Only buy this on sale. I paid $20, totally worth it.

THE BAD:

People pay 60 for this game and are still incentivized to unlock some of the characters through point grind?

This is a bit of an odd choice Capcom.

Maybe give away the game for free then, and lock everything but 4 core characters, if you're going with that model. But if you charge full price and then nickle and dime people to get all stages/chars unlocked - its a bit sleazy. Also the reason I waited for a massive sale to buy this game. And I will again in the future.

I bought this on Holiday sale for $20. Totally worth it even with locked content. Not gonna spend a dime more - as its really not worth it and not the practice I would ever support from a publisher.

Menus take too much time, and are mostly in the way. Menu design is awful and disjointed, like different person did every single page at different time and then scrambled to make it all work together. Two different ""wait/load"" indicators is a dead giveaway of compartmentilized design team.

Less interface Capcom, more Street Fighter. Less wait time, more fight time. Less loading, more gameplay.

THE GOOD:

Excellent base mechanics. Love the new timings and balance on characters. Game feels even more skill based than last release of SF4, if thats possible to imagine. This is THE TECHNICAL fighting game.

I am using THQ 6 button controller - The Zangief Controller used by Snake Eyez - loving it.

Online features as of the date of this review - work pretty well. No problems so far.

Well it's been almost a year and I still can't recomend this heaping pile, my resons have changed but my opinion has not.

Capcom has some solid points with SFV, but for everything this game does right, it hoses itself in other areas. The servers are stable at this point and the net code is solid. As I said in the orginal review below, I like where they have moved mechanics, but SFV is a travisty on the franchise that focuses on the online content and tosses what made Street Fighter great to begin with, I still say the frachices hit it's apex with SFA3. SF4 wasn't a bad game, the net code was bad and the ultimate combos ruined the balance but everything else about it was on the money. Speaking of money, capcoms price gouging of thies game, the in game transactions or the over prriced season passes have just killed the franchise for me. If this is the direction Capcom wants to take my beloved franchise, stop the train, I am off for good, I know I don't speak for everyone here and I am not trying to, but if you feel the same way I do, I would recoment moving to Guilty Gear Xrd Revelator, it is a modern fighting game that honors it's roots.


-----Orifinal Review------
For starters, I have been a long time player of street fighter, 24 years or so. My review will change when they actually release the game, in it's current state its an early access and a shiny polished turd, is still a piece of crap. There is no reason this game should be advertised as a full release when it is not, I don't know if it was because of presure from investors like sony to have it out at this date, but Capcom you done screwed up.

That mess out of the way, I will say from the games engine, the fighting mechanics I do really like where they are taking it, it feels like a step back to older street fighter and playing more on skill rather then a well timed ultra-combo. Changes to the characters are refreshing, my 2 favorite characters Vega and Ken have changed in ways I actually like and when this game is fully up and running I feel it has great potential.

I am past the point for the steam refund policy and I probobly wouldn't because I do support some early access and I would just get it after it was fxed anyways, but I can't fault those who want to send capcom a message for this, if they had pushed back release date  and opened it for early access I would be less pissed, but this is not a full release quality game, and this isn't the 1st time Capcom has pulled BS with things like on disc DLC to site one example. Look Capcom, you are getting to a place where you can't screw up like this without taking your company down, for your sake I really hope this gets squared away. For the time being I am going to have to down vote, when the game meets the following I would say I could recommend it.

1. Fix your servers, while some issue on this front are understandable, what we have here is not.
2. Proper Controler bindings, I don't play with keyboard but I have heard a number of gripes and I have to say, the fact it dosen't recognize all my XBOX 360 controler inputs like L3 and R3, coincodently also available on PS$ controllers, should be mappable.
3. Display optimization, I have finally got it to a point where it is palletable with 60 frames and I am not the only one seeing this, now I don't have the worlds best video card, but I can run some serious games with out this much issue and I have seen a number of posts complaining about this so I know it's not just me.
4. Get a proper single player experience going, where the heck is the traditional arcade mode, with your servers dropping like crazy, this would at least satisfy some players, your story mode while nice so I can get the story is a cake walk. Not saying we need this to be difficult, it's nice getting the story especially for characters we are not good at but this is not a substitute for a real arcade mode, you know the thing that has been there since SF2 World Warrior. And you cant count survival, you loose one time and you have to start over with the sorry starting AI, you can't get a consitant challenge from the PC making it hard to improve your skills unless you are playing people, oh yea, the servers are still dropping like crazy.
5. Challenge mode, seriously, not available until march?

Capcom, get your heads out of your rear ends. You hold the rights to some of my favorite franchises and thats why this stuff pisses me off so much with you, I want to see you succeed, quit screwing up.",1455773275,1483123691,FALSE,104,7,0.709116757,1,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.66E+16,270,13,1158,0,959,1518055953

Season 2 came out a few days ago and adds some sweet balancing patches.  Online is stable and I am able to play opponent after opponent.  Still no arcade mode, but I would say it's worth it at this point.  With the inclusions of earning Fight Money through challenges you are easily able to get all the DLC characters.  Completing trails, story mode, and survival, plus dinking around in training or CPU vs mode offers a fair amount for the offline player.  STILL.  There needs to be an arcade mode.  


***UPDATED 02/17/2016 REVIEW***

Matchmaking now works!!  The game is good fun.  I know they will be adding more content later, but still it feels pretty bare bones.  Not everyone who likes street fighter follows Capcom and social media knows about this.  The mentality is still that if you pay 60 dollers for a game you get a substantial amount of content up front...not have to wait for it later.  I like how they will be updating the core game and let you get future dlc with money you can get in game.  That is a step in the right direction.  Turning off early adopters...we will see how that pans out in the long run.  I want Street Fighter 5 to do well....I don't like paying 60 bucks for a part of a game and have to wait for the rest  later to be the norm. I currently give this game 3 sad pandas and an ice cream float.

The Good
-Solid Fighting Mechanics
-Nice Visuals
-D-input(F**KING FINALLY)
-Highly modifiable settings*

The Bad
-Base Game is Overpriced (I got on sale for $20 which should be it's real price)
-Settings hide a lot of useful options like turning off shadows (can be remedied)*
-Netcode still sucks apparently (not that I know, I play local or with friends because I use a toaster)

The Ugly
-The balance patchs are garbage they broke like half the cast to shit tier for the sake of ""variety""
-Paywalls/shitty F2P elements.........Paywalls/shitty F2P elements Everywhere 
you want Akuma or any other fighter? 
You better be willing to either 
A.) Grind
or
B.) Cough up the cash
-Even ""unlockable"" skins/colors are behind a paywall it's disgusting

That is, if you find a way for the game not to run in slow-motion, even if your PC exceeds the hardware requirements. Updating drivers and an assortment of other shenanigans did not fix the problems, some of which appear to have been known for months.

I can't go into details about game balance or netplay, because I haven't had the chance to actually spend enough time with it, sorry.

If you are interested in the game, I suggest to keep checking the forums every now and then to see if Capcom managed to fix the problems and made it actually playable, then get it when it's on sale (again).

4,Street Fighter V,28604263,english,"So here's my angle on this game: I bought a PS4 just in time for me to go off to college, and my sophomore year saw me playing it some, but only first person shooters. I really hadn't bought a fighter since DBZ Budokai Tenkaichi 2, so I was like ""Hey SFV is coming out, it looks really good, only 5 days from my birthday, BET!"" So I got it Day 1. First mistake, I HATED the game. No content, lacking/simplistic mechanics, not many characters, no central plot, etc etc. I'd never hated a company as much as I did Capcom while I had it, even when more characters where added oh so slowly. I traded my PS4 back for an Xbox 1S. Now, I bought the game for my PC for $20, which was fair as there's more content now, a story, working servers. The fighting is great, and with season 2, I like damn near all the changes it brought to combos, frame datas, etc. I feel now there's alot more room for different, equally viable playstyles, similar to USF4. But these good changes are WAY too far out from release to really sweeten it to me. If you haven't bought this game, I'd say don't buy more than do, but $20 is a  fair price if you do. But ABSOLUTELY don't buy ANY DLC (w/ real money). FUCK CAPCOM for overpricing, undercooking, and underdelivering to their fans! There's still no arcade mode, the story was GARBAGE, there's no real single player content outside of the tedious survival mode and VS CPU (which didn't even come at launch). Nothing has real replay value, and there's no innovation. Just look to MKX for how much content and interesting takes on modes can enhance the experience. The DLC characters costumes and stages are ridiculously overpriced ($5-10 anyone?), and regular ass character colors too. And fanboys will say ""You can earn it all for free with fight money"" but fail to realize that the grind to get fight money after the initial playthroughs of story and survival is PAINFULLY slow, making it a chore to get stuff that in yesteryears would unlock from simple, fun gameplay, not an arbitrary currensy system.",1482602625,1482602625,FALSE,0,0,0.498474866,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.66E+16,16,2,36564,0,682,1575486850

10,Street Fighter V,28570720,english,"People will tell you that Street fighter V is a bad fighting game, and they're wrong.

What they mean to say is ""Street fighter V is not a GOOD fighting game"" and they are right.

SFV has the fewest technical aspects of a fighting game that I have seen since mortal combat 3. It has combos, Cancels, Specials, juggles, and a V skill system that lets you use a separate resource for getting out of pressure or saving up for one bursty skill. And that's it. Those are ALL the mechanics.

Is this a bad thing? No, not particularly, but it certainly isn't GOOD.

So why am I putting this as a positive review? Because SFV is great at being your entry into the fighting game genre. It's got enough technicality to let you understand the concept of special cancels, frame traps, priority, combos, spacing, footsies, etc. The game is so basic that you learn a framework fairly quickly and get a foundation for future fighting games.

I can attest to this, as I have never been good at fighting games, but I'm rather decent at SFV. I rank in the mid/high silver, which for someone who has a rather poor track record with this genre is an accomplishment at least in my eyes. In a fairly short amount of time with a particular character you can get a feeling for what they can do, what they're supposed to do, and how to do it. You'll learn to spot overheads, understand what a mixup is and how to punish.

If you're looking for a deep fighting game with long combos that test your dexterity and give you a ton of options at your disposal, you'll be pretty disappointed here, maybe check out BlazBlue or Skullgirls. But if you're looking for a game to dip your toes in the genre I have to recommend it.",1482528707,1482528707,TRUE,4,0,0.499845415,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.66E+16,175,4,20160,0,9428,1590302704
11,Street Fighter V,28569963,english,"Street fighter V has had an... interesting run over the past year.  the game was first released far to early, had various bugs and crashes come and go, as well as moving to the controversial ""Always online"" style of game. and if 8 months ago you asked me if i would recomend the game, i would say hell no. But now I believe the games advanced to a point where i could recomend it to others>

If you look at other reviews, you'll see a lot of varied opinions. But what is most aperent is there was a lot of anger with this game. and much of it for the time had grounds to stand by.  Allow me to put it out there that im new to the street fighter series. I only discovered it within the past 12 or so months, but i liked the look of this one. So when this game first came out, I bought it within its first week of release. and saw a lot that pissed me off. Right off the back the game had missing content. there were buttons that if you pressed them all that happened was a window would pop up with the words ""Coming soon!"" and it just pissed me off so much i refunded it for its predesessor (Ultra street fighter IV). 

I kept this grudge till maybe may or so, i dont actually remember when, but around when balrog/ibuki were intoduced to the game. It was on sale so i gave it a second chance. It was annoying i couldnt change my fighter ID after my previous perchace, but I kept with it. and i can now say that the game is actually pretty good.

The game is now at 100% completion with the exception of anual DLC characters/costumes/maps/whatever, and it plays pretty fantasticly. The gameplay moves fluidly, looks amazing, and feels the way (i think) Street fighter should. True there has been plenty of bumps on the way, but the final product to me is a good buy. Although if you are new to the street fighter series, i might recomend waiting for this game to be on sale. As of writing this review (12/23/16) Its on sale for about 20 dollars, which is more than a rational price.

To break it down to pros and cons:

Pros:
+The gameplay feels fantastic, and thats the main part of any fighting game
+Online play is pretty stable
+Cross platform play! that should be praised reguardless of a games quality
+Story mode, it may not be perfect but its still cool to see new and old characters in an actual story.

Mixxed:
~Not all the roster is availible at the start, you start with 16 of the (currently) 23 characters, and you have to purchase the others as dlc. However all characters can be attained though determination and enough gameplay, though its an uphill battle
~this game has had a plethora of bugs, though most were with menus, and eventually fixed. I dont recal there being any actual bugs with the combat at least.
~This game may give newcomers of the series a sour taste of street fighter. So while i enjoy the game, i feel this is a bad starting point for the series.

Cons:
-DLC costumes cost rediculous ammounts of money. Six dollars for one costume is pretty steep to me. and most costumes are only atainible with real world money. Thats really annoying.
-The game came out too early and im still bitter about that, it was a full price $60 early release game, and while its fixed now i hate when companys do this.
-Kens hair looks like bananas and juris theme is trash.
 

So TLDR, the game was released far to early, but is now a funtional and good game. Maybe buy it on sale, and its probably a bad idea to make this your first street fighter, start with USFIV and see if youd be willing to buy a version with crisper graphics and gameplay. Ive enjoyed the game even though i sort of suck (still bronze rank after ~200 hours) but i would be willing to say give the game a shot",1482527488,1482527488,TRUE,4,0,0.501525104,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.66E+16,264,3,66213,157,11950,1602039593

First, I have been a fighting game fan since 2005, when I first played King of Fighters XI, then came Capcom vs SNK 2, Marvel 2, the Alpha Series, Guilty Gear, and so on, so take my opinion as you will. Street Fighter V in of itself is not an inherently BAD fighting game there are solid mechanics in place, Capcom supporting its pro scene with Capcom Pro Tour and whatnot, it's pretty alright. Now I don't want to bring up controversy surrounding the pricing of games, because that topic is hugely subjective, but it must be brought up. especially with the release of Guilty Gear Xrd -Revelator-.

Let me preface this: Capcom's decision on making just one game, and then continously updating the game over time, releasing characters and balance changes over time, was a good business decision, it countered that old stigma of, ""Why would I buy Street Fighter X, they'll just release Street Fighter X Ultra Arcade Edition...""
This was a good move on the part of Capcom, however, this would bite them in the rear later on when they are stuck with a game that they can't change too much. Capcom was funded by Sony to develop Street Fighter V with features like the crossplay between PC and Console, and the Capcom Pro Tour in mind, they sought to make a very competitive game, which is not bad in of itself. However you are leaving an audience, particularly the casual audience, in the cold when it comes to content for them. Sure, you could say they could play Survival or Story mode, but the novelty of Survival quickly dies, and the gameplay in Story mode is incredibly easy. The community itself isn't exactly helping either, r/Kappa shuns casual players, individuals such as WinnerStaysOn are incredibly hostile to players that simply want to play the game casually. James Chen, a huge member of the Fighting Game Community (FGC), makes some comments on this: http://www.twitlonger.com/show/n_1spefp6
 

Now to pricing. I have seen in a multitude of situations that people complain that the release of that another fighting game, Guilty Gear Xrd -Revelator-, is too expensive, so let's break it down here real quick before I move on,, and I will exclude cosmetics in both games and the microtransactions present in Street Fighter V, because you can buy those with in-game currency and they are purely optional, I will also not compare the amount of content each of the games provide, as that would be pretty unfair:

Guilty Gear Xrd -Revelator- Standard Edition - $50
Guilty Gear Xrd -Revelator- Deluxe Edition (Comes with all of the DLC listed on the store page) - $65

DLC:
Dizzy - $5
Haehyun - $5
Raven - $2, can be unlocked with in-game currency

Street Fighter V - $60
Street Fighter V Deluxe Edition - approximately used to be $90, now $80(?). comes with Season 1 and 2 character passes
DLC:
Season Pass 1 - Used to be $30, now $20, comes with the 6 Season 1 characters, they can be purchased with in-game currency
Season Pass 2 - $30, comes with all of the 6 Season 2 characters, 5 of which are not present in the game yet, but they can be purchased with in-game currency

Clearly, Street Fighter V is the more expenisve game, if you want all the content without grinding out in-game currency to unlock all of the content.


Anyways, back to the actual review:

It's a Street Fighter game, so there is heavy emphasis on footsies and neutral, however this game feels way slower than its predecessors. Jumps feels a lot slower, moves, although they do feel very natural and have a lot of weight to them, feel incredibly slow, and the game speed and how matches play out are incredibly slower than previous titles to the series, coupled with an inherent 6-8 frame delay the game has, it makes the game feel super clunky. It also feels like they have toned down the game immensely to make it easier to play, which is not a bad thing, but it restricts the creative of play on a whole. The craziest combos you will get in this game will be: Big hit >Special (character dependent) > V-Trigger > Big hit > Special > Super, compare that to the first trailer shown of Street Fighter V, where Chun Li essentially does an air combo into OTG. Speaking of V-Trigger, let's address the V-System in general. It's not inherently bad, it had a lot of potential, V-Reversals were a fun callback to Alpha Counters, and the V-Trigger system can bring out the true potential of a character... somtimes. A lot of the V-Triggers are simply buffs, some more interesting than others, but there is a lack of creativity when it comes to the creation of these. The V-Triggers for Ibuki and Urien bring a lot of very neat ideas to the table, and I find them to be incredibly satisfying to watch and play. However on a whole, the V-System could use a bit more application. As for balancing, the game itself is very balanced, much more than previous iterations of the series, although there are still some glaring barriers to good characters, and top characters. F.A.N.G is a good example, his gameplay itself is very unorthodox, and so are his tools. He can shut you out very easily with his large hitboxes and strange traps, but once you get in, his hard work is immediatly erased, as most of his damage is reliant on his unique poison damage, and without proper defensive tools outside of V-Reversal, he can quickly die. Season 2 may bring some changes in terms of balancing, but so far, I'm not too optimistic.
As for online play, there are plenty of players to go around, Ranked constantly has players wanting to get better... or just ragequit. The lobby system in Street Fighter V leaves a lot to be desired, only 2 people can play at a single time, and when you have 8-people lobbies, waiting for your turn can quickly make you bored as hell. The netcode itself is not too bad, although I would've liked to see some rollback netcode features, which Mike Z offered to do multiple times... The main issue in the netcode comes into play when crossplay between PC and Console happens. PC players can essentially lag switch their opponents by Alt-Tabbing out of their game.


As a whole, Street Fighter V is simply a mediocre game, it does not have a lot to offer, even with Season 2 coming out.

39,Street Fighter V,28500089,english,"TL;DR - The core game is okay, but the price for everything so far as well as for the future is just not worth it to me.

I've spent $94.99 up to this point because I pre-ordered to take part in the beta testing (which was mostly a tease or a failure) and then bought the Season 1 pass ($30). I also bought the sky stage which was $4.99. If you want to have access to the characters and learn while everyone else is learning, you have to buy it when it's first out. If you wait for a sale, you'll be behind the majority and also there's really not much tech left to discover.

The Season 1 pass is not even a true Season pass. It's a character pass. At least they're calling the 2nd one a Character pass. The transactions for costumes and stages in this game just add up too much out of pocket. The CPT DLC was okay since it actually had a purpose besides just being DLC. But the CPT costumes were PS4 only.

""Season 1 pass"" is now $10 less than before, but anyone who buys it now missed out using them the last 10 months. The game hasn't even been out for a year and it's just transaction after transaction. Sure, you don't have to buy everything, but if you only want all the characters in the game, you'll now have to shell out $110 instead of $120.

There are some features that are okay.

-I did enjoy the Cinematic Story, at least. I have no preference for an arcade mode. Each character has their own mini story and you can just do VS CPU and manually choose who you want to fight next.
-""Daily"" challenges (new ones every 5 or so days) for fight money.

(back to the bad stuff, I guess)
-To deter modders, an update contained a .sys file in your Windows folder that made every PC owner subjective to being compromised. When they released an update that didn't need it anymore, you had to remove the file yourself (and you have to do it a certain way since Windows won't let you just plain delete it).

-6.4-ish frames of delay isn't too bad. We shouldn't really have to deal with all the factors of lag for it being 2016.

-They nerfed AA jabs to the point where it trades. I'm still 50/50 on this.

-Only version for console is PS4, but PS3/PS4 sticks didn't naturally work until Season 2. Only Xinput and the game's not even on XB1.

-At least they have badges now so you can see who's been branded as a rage quitter in Ranked.

-How many seasons are they planning? 2020? So that's at least 4 more seasons that'll be $30 each brand new. $180 over the course of 4 years just for the characters passes (if they only stick with one per season for every year until 2020)

I wish Capcom good luck with this game, but I'm just not going to shell out any more money for it. I'll put it on the back burner and stick with other games to be more serious with.

While this game feels nice and runs smooth, the launch for this title is absolute garbage. Worse than GTAV and Batman PC releases. In order to obtain any experience or fight money, you MUST be connected to the servers. Nevermind the fact that you of course must be connected to their servers to play online, there is a lack of singleplayer content as well. Story mode only gives you 2-3 fights per character, training does nothing, and survival is the only way you can actually fight AI opponents, but even then it's not the classic best 2 out of 3. But again, you get NOTHING from playing this singleplayer stuff, UNLESS you are connected to the SERVERS.

EDIT:

One season later: So the game had not a rocky release, a completely s h i t release. Issues that were in season 1 are still in season two (such as player 2 not being able to hit character select, regional lobbies, latency, No arcade modeetc.), though some problems have been addressed to some degree (rage quiters now get points deducted, marked publicly, and put in rage quiter groups; mika being nerfed, though shes still a cute       CUTE).

Despite problems and frequent misteps, I have to say the game is extremely fun. It's only saving grace is the fact that the gameplay is solid (as of t-minus 8 hours from season 2 patch). 

I'll be frank, if you are very casual (and I am not using the term in a demeaning way), this game will probably not be fun for you. They didn't make the game very friendly for the casual gamer who is looking for an in depth story mode, arcade mode, unlockables, etc. The newest guilty gear (which just released on PC) IS great for that stuff, along with being competitively fun.

However, if you are interested in the fgc, want to make relationships and rivalries, and really just care about gameplay mechanics, then this game IS for you. I still recommend it, and have not regretted my time playing it over the last season.

If you enjoy any sort of competitive game, I definitely recommend at least trying this game for an hour and refund it if it doesn't suit your fancy, given that fighting game just aren't some people's thing.
That being said, this is a great game with a perfect blend of competitive and casual nature attached to it. If you enjoyed a Street Fighter game long ago, you'll definitely be reminded of those times playing Street Fighter V. Even if you don't feel like you're improving, it doesn't have to make it any less fun to horse around with your friends doing random character matches.

I'm not gonna highlight the good points/technical aspects, since I'm sure there are plenty of reviews already written that have said them better than I can. I'll give a couple disclaimers though!

First off: you probably shouldn't pay any more than $40 tops on it. Imo, there isn't quite enough content to constitute the $60 price tag.
 
Second: The game is basically only for multiplayer, since the character stories and cinematic story don't really have any replay value. The other big single player mode, Survival, does have replay value, (i.e. completing it with each fighter over the multiple difficulty modes) but it can be god awful hard, even when you're very experienced with your fighter. And there is no continues (but you CAN purchase hp or other perks with your accumulated score from previous rounds), so if you lose in easy mode you have to restart a 10 fight battle, Normal mode 30, Hard mode 50, and Extreme mode 100. So basically just making a couple of innocent mistakes can undo an hour+ of gameplay. The multiplayer, though, is definitely done well enough to justify buying the game though, so don't be scared to buy it just because the single player isn't necessarily up to snuff.

there are a couple other things I could mention, but I have to go, so I'll finish with saying that if you love fighting games, or are new to them, SF5 is a great experience (though if you're new, I'd recomend playing with friends rather than online, since matchmaking can be extremely sketchy at times)",1480884438,1480884592,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.66E+16,238,2,12472,0,8322,1545016377

POOR MARKETING CHOICES FIGHTER 5

You get the idea. I love this game, I also fucking hate this game.
There is an issue on the PC version when playing PS4 players that, if you have a SIGNIFICANTLY faster PC than the PS4 console, you will load into games faster. That's a given. But what's not a given is that because you loaded in faster, even if only but a few fractions of a second or frames... you are now AHEAD in the netcode's eyes.
This means you will be rollbacking the entire damn match to ""adjust"" to the PS4 user's ""netcode build"" if that makes sense. Every game I play against a PS4 user is like this. Every single one. and no, it's not my internet. Or theirs. It's just Capcom being Capcom and not fixing their game.

Again I say, I love this game. The game itself, good stuff. Lots of fun. Especially vs friends cuz you can do some funky stuff in this game. But I just can't enjoy it as much as I want to.

Also, the fact that I got branded as a cheater and lost all of my fight money is kinda jank, considering I never actually cheated. It detected my official Mad Catz FightPad drivers (that force the fightpad to become X-input instead of D-input) as ""modifications"" and removed all of my Fight Money. I wouldn't be so upset if it weren't impossible to get the Fight Money back. When you finally manage to get through Hard AND Hell Survival modes to get the huge amount of FM, you'd be salty AF too. 
At the same time of this I got a free rootkit on my computer. That's always a nice bonus to the anaI boning you provided me, Capcom. Thanks man.

TL;DR I love this game. I hate it too. You will aswell.
Buy this if you like Capcom's 1v1 Fighting games, as it's probably the most fun you can have in one. 
Don't buy this if you're a casual who likes to play vs AI or something else like that. There's not much there on that front.

Sufice to say that the gameplay is great, but Crapcom made so many bad decisions concerning this game that its really hard to describe it.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]

First, the good: The game has been improved a lot since SFIV, now most chars are viable, with the return of fan loved chars like Karin and Mika and the add of good new ones, like Necalli and Rashid. Gameplay feels faster and more aggressive than SFIV and rewards you for putting pressure on the opponent.
Now the bad gameplay stuff: Anti air jabs are a complete bullcrap, there are far to much target combos, and some v-skills are completely useless.
Overal, the online gameplay is good and addictive.

[h1]Crapcoms Crappy decisions:[/h1]

There are just so many crappy decisions made by Crapcom when releasing this game that Im just gonna list them.
- Lack of single player content, hell, there is not even an arcade mode!
- Microtransactions all over the place. Buy this, buy that and so on...
- Basic game comes only with 16 chars, if you want the full roster you gotta buy the seasons pass.
- Game has an overall feeling of lacking something, and thats not just the Arcade Mode.

If you plan on getting a season pass, do not purchase anything included in said pass with fight money. you will not get the Fight money back.

I'll recommend it, only because its simple enough to get the fight money for every character unlock right now.
I still play it here and there, so I do feel I've got my money's worth..

It's just that there are better fighting games to play right now.
Thats not to say its Terrible, oh no, there are terrible fighting games on steam, but this one is completely mediocre.

The fun things to note would be V skills and V triggers, giving characters a little more individuality than just their special moves. That's it. I can't think of anything else.

The game is fun, balanced, simple in the execution of tecnique yet endlessly deep in interaction between players. Street Fighter has gotten more streamlined with every iteration and Street fighter 5 continues this trend. Whether your playing with friends or online theres always fun to be had, and something new to learn about your opponents.

I want to address 2 of the common criticisms of the game and how the game is actually comparitively robust in these 2 areas. The DLC model and the Single Player content. 

The game has pretty much adopted letter for letter the same model as League of Legends, all gameplay related content can be purchased with in game currency earned over time. Looking at League of Legends average match time of 37 minutes and 100 IP (its ingame currency) earned in that time it would take 2,886 minutes to earn enough currency for 1 Champion. In street fighter at an average of 45 seconds per round, 2 rounds per game, and 50 points per win it would take 3000 minutes. That doesnt account for the bonus xp earned from weekly quests ( land a throw 10 times or some such thing) for 500 - 1000 points a piece, bonus points for account and character rank ups, and the 100k+ to be earned per completion of each of the sigle player modes in each difficulty. Long story short its more than a fair time sink compared to other games that give you the option to purchase new content or unlock it.

Single Player compared to any PVP focused game gives you plenty to do theres 2 versions of story mode one of which has 2 difficulties and a survival which has 5 difficulties. Story took me about 2 days to complete, I havent run through survival yet but i wager that will take longer than the 2 story modes combined. That being said Not Paladins, not Overwatch, not League of Legends, Not Dota 2, or most other PvP based games have any single player of any sort and are judged solely on the depth and fun offered in their gameplay.

14,Street Fighter V,27893691,english,"It's starting to get good, now all they need is to keep this dedication for the upcoming years.

The first step is to implement the Arcade mode.
The framework is already there: Story mode has a good progression of difficulty but all opponents are predetermined, while the ""VS. CPU"" option in Versus mode works as expected but you need to manually change match settings and pick your next opponent.
All they need to do is take these two conditions into consideration when making Arcade mode and there you go: the game now offers everything the everyday casual gamer expects.

Another thing to address: please don't permanently delist DLC, specially if it's only purchasable with real money. Sure, part of the money earned is going for the CPT prize so it makes sense to use the content as a timed promotional push for the event, but don't make it missable FOREVER.

Bottom Line: 
Purchase this if you really like the mechanics of fighting games and want an ""honest"" take on competitive play. If you are a casual fighting game fan, I would caution to steer clear until Capcom releases an update with more casual/single-player content. 

What Works:
The moment to moment gameplay in a fighting game is why hardcore enthusiasts select certain games and stick with them. SFV has one of the most satisfying meta-systems in fighting games and has been fine-tuned by pro players through months of beta testing and QA. The game has a strong emphasis on fundamental play, spacing, and smart use of normal moves. 

Gameplay has been tweaked from SFIV to provide a more approachable system with the removal of many low-risk/high-reward link combos and the FOCUS attack system, however the V-Skill, V-Trigger, and V-Reversal systems create more individualized character strategy - and arguably more depth. Character trials are well designed and help to show players of any skill level how each character works and gives them ideas through the combos that the system presents to help the player to think of new ways to approach the skills they have learned. Training mode also deserve props for the amazing amount of options and recording features. Only Killer Instinct comes close to providing a training suite that is as robust as SFV.

What Doesn't Work:
SFV was made for, and still caters to the pro-player. Even 10 months post release, with 6 new characters for a total of 22, multiple new stages, and a few new game modes, there just isn't enough single player content to satisfy casual players. The individual character stories, overall story mode are FAR too easy even for the most novice player and provide very little actual gameplay. The Survival Mode has the worst difficulty spikes I've encountered in any fighting game - you can go from blowing through characters with relative ease and when you encounter a ""boss"" character they have the adept readability of a pro player who has been playing for years. Even the most seasoned players cannot best this mode. It's uneven and sloppy. There is no Arcade mode to sit through while waiting (AEONS) for online match play or to provide a robust single player experience. Basically, there is little reward structure built in to keep a casual player coming back for more. The only reward structure built in focuses on online ranked play. 

The Presentation:
Where SFIV has a wonderful, fun presentation that focuses on the series storied history with great artwork and tons of menu options, SFV takes a more minimalist approach to menu design and presents something that would feel more at home on a smartphone or tablet. It's boring, doesn't get you excited to play the game, and has little to offer the user in interesting content. 

Where the menu system fails though, the in game graphics are absolutely beautiful. If you can run this game in 4K/60, you will be treated with a visual feast of highly detailed and colorful characters that seemingly pop out of the screen. The post-process special effects really add a lot of character to an already stylized game as well. Even running in 1080p the game still shines. The background run at half the frame rate (30fps) to ensure that action between the two characters stays at a constant 60fps. While many backgrounds are great, there are a few that have colors or effects that distract from the fight. Kanzuki Beach, Airplane, and 4 Generals stages are the most notorious and have been banned from tournament play due to their distracting nature. 

Overall, I'll recommend this game to any fighting game enthusiast or for any player that is looking to get into fighting games because they are interested in the mechanics only. If you are a casual player looking to relive the glory days of the 90s playing SF with your friends, I'd highly recommend Ultra Street Fighter 4 instead.",1480095830,1480095960,TRUE,2,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.66E+16,267,16,16450,0,9522,1520635179

That's not to say there are no single player modes in the game but compared to other fighters available, it does seem a bit lacking. There is a story mode which is enjoyable enough as long as you don't take it too seriously and then there is Vs CPU and survival mode. There are rumours of an arcade mode possibly being added in the future but who knows if it will actually happen. I do think that Capcom will continue to add new characters, stages and costumes to the game each year similar to what they have done during 2016 and will do this for the lifespan of Street Fighter V.

81,Street Fighter V,23862380,english,"Street Fighter V is a game with a godawful launch. However, Capcom is finally getting their crap together, and releasing multiple things at once. Starting July 1, this game will be the complete package everyone has been waiting for. I also have faith that Capcom's community managers are finally understanding the importance of communication with their consumers. They say they are dedicated to long term support for this game, and I believe them there. Alright, for the review

The good: Balanced gameplay, all characters feel fun and unique enough to try. Combos are not super difficult, learning each characters quirks is fun. Battle lounges are finally working well (where I spend ALL my sfv time). Story mode and 2 characters are dropping July 1! 

The bad: Matchmaking has improved with a couple patches, but is still not perfect. Rollback netcode still needs a lot of work, matches can be almost unplayable with people less than a 5 bar connection, and even then nothing is guaranteed. Ranked is hard, because if you care about your points (I personally do not) you will get frustrated with rage quitters and dropped connections.  Another bummer is that you cannot search for matches by location, leading to some less than desirable connections. 

Verdict: If you care about your online rank, this game might not be for you, but if youre waiting for the complete package people have been wanting, get this on sale from the summer sale after July 1, you shouldnt be disappointed.

This game still has its issues: battle lounges still have no regional filtering and rarely show flags. Controller and key customization without third party apps is still abysmal. Ragequit penalties are still a joke.

However... It's good now, especially when it's on sale. Street Fighter V is worth your time. Out of all the pc fighting games, SFV is in my opinion tied with Killer Instinct when it comes to a mix of accessibility and healthy player numbers.

1) The lack of characters (including after giving us those extras).  Seems like there are a nice amount of characters here but personally iDon't wanna touched/learn any of them.  iUsed abel before...so if ABEL was your guy from previous street fighters, don't expect him NOR someone similar because its not happening. 
2) multiplayer communications.  the connection between pc and playstation players has zero issues from my experience (PC)...how ever, its stupid complicated to find/play friends, you can't send ANYONE messages (PC) and there doesn't seem to be a chat or voice or anything so yes, pc players can play playstation players but that is LITTERALLY THE ONLY thing you can do...
3) ...and most of all....QUITTERS.  People quitting on you is completely out of control and-IT-HAPPENS-OFTEN! i'm unaware of anykind of system in place if at all because people will BOUNCE in a heartbeat.  This nearly destroys the game for me...

SIDE NOTE:  The graphics and fluid 60fps looks amazing! ALSO, the fighting is on POINT and iHaven't noticed any of the cheezy dhalsim/zangeif-ish mechanics that people used to spam before...so theres that.  Feels great to fight again...only wish iHad better character to choose from.  Also, attached here a link of a video iMade of rage quitters all from within a few weeks of playing.

Review date: 8/22/2016  Purchased: 8/20/2016

Since my last update in October I've been playing with no issues. I bought this game when it was on sale and not for 60 bucks that some have purchased this for. There is a Versus mode, it's not Arcade mode by the way. Of course there are immature players online that rage quit so I'm thinking Capcom should run a script on the servers for accounts that rage quit often and delete their accounts! Make them start all over again. There is a knowledge base for certain problems mine was the 10 -15 minute interval quit or shutdown of the game, which has been resolved. I don't use an arcade stick, I use a Steam controller. I'm not quite comfortable with the touch D-pad so I use the analog stick. I do like playing online but I wish I could determine the region I play in (IE playing user's in Brazil or other countries frame rate drops is often). Since Capcom is working on improving the game the overall expericence has been okay for me. Buy it on sale!

I didn't play the first day, but as of the second day I had no problem connecting to matches. The fighting mechanics and system are solid. They are both easy to grasp for the newcomer, and deep for the experienced fighter. I fully expect them deliver the full fighting game experice with in a couple months. Until they fail to do that I'll give this a thumbs up.

<Edit>

After putting in some more time in this game. I apologize for the relatively positive review above. This game is horrible and my greatest hope is that all those pro or quasi pro people who still hold this game up as good and keep trying to prop this turd up will be running sf5 streams with 0 viewers.

I still hold that if the core game mechanics were good and they had online and training mode I would be still ok with the game, but it is not the case. I could give a rats ass about arcade mode. The core fight mechanics are atrocious and are not deep like I mentioned above. This game gives no liberties when it comes to methods of attack. you have one or two roads to major combo damage no variation what so ever. There is no individuality at all that can be applied to any of the cast. most of your combo options go through 2x medium punch, heavy punch, special/CA for alot of the cast. How is that a combo system? Why would you take away the abilty to do damage off of light punch or light kick? Why would you make jab the go to anti-air? Going from mvc3 or usf4 to this game feels like going from freedom to being put in a padded cell. Up to this title, fighting games only added combative variety, where SF5 took it away. Alot of normals do not cancel into anything. so what you end up with is people poking each other all day until they hit their 50% damage bnb combo that is the same everytime. I could go on all day. I have not even got into the technical issues.

The Good:
-Graphics are decent if you ignore clipping.
-Music
-Cross platform play (every fighting game needs do this! It helps keep a strong online community)

The Bad:
-Fighting mechanics have been too constrained. Limits creativity, fighting styles and variation.  
-An extra 3 frame buffer added to everything limits the ability to react.
-Attacks are clunky
-Normals have terrible range and do not match the animation. 
-Game Released in an alpha state at best for full price.
-No controller support.
-Slow load times for online matches.
-No options for online play. eg choose who play. Ability to select difficulty levels of opponents. select character.
-No microphone support.

As of 9/23/2016 the game will not even launch without disabling anti-virus programs AND adding both SFV and windows processes to Data Execution Protocol exception lists, further increasing the risk of virus infection and other malware. So here the game sits, unplayable in my library without any way to refund it because I accumulated a handful of hours in beta when it was playable.

As of 10/01/2016 the game launches without any of the above trouble (some still report having trouble even running the game with good specs.) However it crashes and gives you an error upon exit. It still doesn't detect any of my controllers either ( I need to use joy2key ) one of which being a quanba q4raf joystick. Additionally you still get server errors when trying to send or recieve match results.

10/13/2016 20% of all match results are lost and the matchmaking still pairs you with people who have horrible connections even if you specify to fight only players with 4-5 bar connections. Still a brainless button masher.

10/16/2016 Almost all first matches are lost to the ether, results not being sent to the capcom server. Battle lounges are such horrible mess that you can't filter anyone by region or latency. Many cosmetic items are not purchasable with in-game currency even though capcom had said specifically that all of it would be purchasable. Broken promises.

You can still disconnect from a RANKED MATCH and not recieve a penalty. And if someone disconnects on you, you do not get rewarded. This is something that's been a problem since the beta and it still isnt fixed.

For starters, the hitboxes for certain moves on PC still need to be worked on.
 The Frame rate issue that alot of people have had is the second and biggest issue for me. My pc is garbage, but decent garbage, not gonna lie. i3 intel, intel graphics card, 6gb ddr3, 750gb hd is what I'm working with currently. So we are talking bare minimum for the stats of this game to run but even with higher end pc's the lag for moves in local is trash unless I use just the Training Stage or somehow (I still have no fucking clue) when I play online it runs smooth for me. I can't find any answer to the online part as to why it works. Keep in mind, I can run Ultra SF4 at the highest graphic setting and it's smooth as butter. I've tried using every tutorial out to get my pc to just let me do the survival, trials, story mode but nothing happens. If they released an update for the Lo Spec mode to actually be Low Spec that would be hugely beneficial for those of us who have sub par laptops that enjoy the game for the game itself and aren't hung up too much on graphics. Sadly even with complete (well almost complete) pixelated edges, this game's fps for local is still hella choppy. I've been reading complaints about the rootkit thing which I haven't gotten through either luck or it's already been fixed and I didn't know it. I don't want a refund, or even a rerelease.

56,Street Fighter V,25418975,english,"Despite a rocky launch, this is a unique but solid entry to the SF franchise. However, keep in mind this is very, very different from its predecessors, so it is important to purchase with the right expectations. For those in doubt, I recommend waiting purchasing when on sale. 

PROS: 
1) Battle mechanics are simpler, which is not necessarily a bad thing, especially for those new to the franchise. Combos are WAY easier to execute than in USFIV. 
2) While slow to respond to fan feedback, CAMCOM has steadily addresssed issues that plagued the game at launch, such as: 
-adding a free, DLC, expanded Story Mode ""A Shadow Falls,"" which is equivalent to a two and a half hour animated movie interspersed with fights where you get to role play as every character (even the six season one characters you must purchase to play otherwise).   
-adding more way to win fight money via Daily Challenges.
-adding a ""versus CPU"" mode.
-adding the option to purchase additional character color packs via fight money rather than enduring the grueling Survival Mode.
3) Stronger rage quitting penalties have been introduced to level the playing field. 
4) Online matchmaking (for ranked and casual matches) is more objective because the system always matches you to an opponent so you do not constantly get matched to the same opponents. 
5) Unlike USFIV, which had several similar characters, every character feels unique and has their own V-Skill, V-Reveral and V-Trigger.
6) This game really rewards you for defensive skills, which enables you to turn the tide of battle quickly.  
7) You ""pre-select"" your favorite character and their attributes before you are even matched to an online fight, which reduces time needed to select a character each time you are paired with an opponent. Obviously, this is a disadvantage for players who switch characters frequently but a definite win for those players who stick with one favorite character. 
8) Priceless storylines, e.g. Ryu ponders the meaning of his fist (yes, really) while Zangief tutors R. Mika on ""Muscle Spirit"" (which is NOT a brand of cheap Russian vodka). 
9) Cross-platform support for PC and PS4 greatly increases the player pool for matches. 
10) Guile is cooler than ever, Cammy is hotter than ever and Birdie is uglier than ever (wait, I guess that last one's not really a plus!)   

OPPORTUNITIES (HINT: CAPCOM, here are ways you can transform SFV into a truly AMAZING game): 
1) 2x2 Online Tag Team matches: Two players face off against another pair of players with similar skills. Players can tag their partner to help them out during a match and the team with the last player standing wins. 
2) Faster Online Match Launch and Loading: It seems to take at least 60 seconds from the time you are paired with an opponent until the time a match actually starts. By comparison, USFIV takes under 30 seconds. 
3) ALL additional content should be purchasable with fight money. 
4) At least one new, free DLC story mode introduced every six months. 
5) Launch at least four new characters every six months (I want to see Fei Long, Akuma and Poison soon!) 
6) The current Critical Arts system (Critical Arts are akin to Ultra Combos in USFIV) is somewhat underwhelming because each player only has one Critical Art (and some do not look as flashy as they should - yes, I am looking at you, Zangief). CAPCOM needs to give players a choice of at least two Critical Arts (similar to USFIV where yopu could select your Ultra Combo). 
7) Vibration support for equipped controllers - this would be a great feature to increase game interactivity i.e. a player can actually ""feel"" the punches/kicks landed if they have a controller equipped with vibration support.
8) More taunt options and win quotes needed for each character, as in USFIV. Having just one taunt option per character seems woefully lacking!

63,Street Fighter V,21250187,english,"=> October/2016:
It's unbelievable that Capcom did a rootkit, potentially exposing everyone to massive security problems. They show no sense of responsibility. For me personally it's sad to be a fan of a franchise where its parent company and its employees seem irresponsible.
I confirmed myself that the 1-sided lag is real. While one player gets a smooth experience, the other get lots of rollbacks. This is really unfair. And most incompetent from the netcode creators. I don't see people stick playing a game with a bad online experience, which is unfortunate.
Let's cross fingers and hope that Capcom will fix the netcode, like the Mortal Kombat X creators did, where they improved their netcode.

=> September/2016:
This is probably my last update for a while. I tried to like this game, but I couldn't. The netcode is so garbage that ruins all the experience. The servers are garbage too. Also, this game favors mostly a extremely aggressive type of player, and this is not my kind of game. If you are a balanced or defensive player, this game is definitely not for you.
But this game is still in its infancy, perhaps it will get good someday. Probably I will be watching to see what happens.

=> August/2016:
Game has had some improvement, but still maintains flaws.
Improvements:
- Netcode has improved a bit, but still leaves to be desired. Only usable at 5 bar connections. Sometimes 5 bar connections give rollbacks and teleports, but they shouldn't happen (not all 5 bar connections are really 5 bar, the connection quality metering is not reliable).
- Matchmaking now do its job properly, matching with players close to your skill. But sometimes takes too much time to find players, and I don't think it's a lack of players problem.
- Game now has more content, enough to satisfy many people.
Flaws that persist:
- Unstable servers, often the battle results are not displayed properly. Although it seems the results are uploaded 90% of the time. Yes, that are times where results aren't computed. 
- Input lag is still high (8 frames).
- Rage quitting is not punished properly yet and is still a problem.
- Keyboard and some sticks still aren't supported. Come on Capcom... seriously?
- Game still doesn't remember the battle request and training mode settings.
- Graphics has lots of clipping. Come on Capcom... seriously, again?
As a final note, the season pass has shown itself a terrible deal. It's not a real season pass (that should've given all the DLC), it gives roughly half of the available DLC for the season.

=> May/2016:
Sad that the game didn't get what it deserved. My cons list is bigger than before.
- Servers are still unstable, sometimes data isn't loaded.
- After further experimenting, found that netcode is garbage, even with 4 or 5 bar connections. I hate the rollbacks and teleports, along with the sound cuts. It's common on 5 bar connections to have animation frame skipping, which mess up the moves timing.
- Input lag is high.
- Rage quitting is still not properly punished.
- Keyboard and some sticks still aren't supported. That's some extreme lazyness on the board.
- Game still doesn't remember the battle request and training mode settings.
- Graphics has lots of clipping. Super ugly.
- Matchmaking is unoptimized, keeps matching with the same person and matches tiers/leagues that are too far away, for example Ultra Gold vs Silver. Also, still gives 1 bar connection opponents even if you chose 5 bar.

=> Feb/2016:
I was always a SF fan, since SF2. It's sad that this game hadn't the launch it deserved:
- Unstable servers
- Unreliable matchmaking (1 bar connections regardless of chosen settings)
- No keyboard support
- No support for all fighting sticks
- Game doesn't remember some settings (battle request and training mode)
- Rage quitting is not punished (with points withdrawal, for example)
Some of these alone make the game unplayable for a lot of people.

Make no mistake, though: this game is good. But what are nice graphics, awesome sound, interesting mechanics good for if you can't play the game properly? As for the netcode, it could be better: it is good at 4 or 5 bar connections, but not good below that.

Fuck'd over everyone in japan who paid for the delux edition by completely scrapping the zeny system.

Most people on my friend list dont even play it anymore and if they do ill see them on for 30mins maybe.Same people i used to see playing USF4 for hours and hours. Even seen some people going back to sfxt over this failure of a game.

now with the negative out of the way some posistive.

70,Street Fighter V,25848430,english,"This game has its problems. especially on PC. Judging it as a game, a fighting game though, it essentially has everything it needs in my opinion. The Story Mode not being released on launch didn't bother me, because I play these games from a competitive standpoint, but it DID have a ""story"" type deal (it was just really short). It also had survival, which was basically arcade mode.

For me personally, costumes don't really matter so I don't really mind the prices on those (but I do feel they are a bit pricy) Capcom has a history of nickle and diming.

As a fighting game to be honest, this is one of the (easiest to pick up, hardest to master) games of the series. This game however, utilzies alot of situations that are entirely 50/50 driven. Even without grapplers, since this game is really bare bones Street Fighter and no real gimmicky things tied to it or (""flashy combo's"") to me that makes it alot more of an honest more straight up fighter.

With my connection being lanned, I don't have too many problems with connections, though occasionally I will. The characters themselves this time around are all more or less viable. Debateable ones are like Zangief, but still the roster from a competitive side is mostly usable.

But not ignoring this games problems, on PC atleast its really hard to reccomend this game to anyone from a casual standpoint. I don't feel like there is any advantages for a casual player besides the story. From a competitive standpoint the ranked punishment might be harsh (if you disconnect) but so far I haven't had anyone rage quit on me since that change took in effect.

To be honest, there are other fighters (""like Skullgirls"") that are a bit better on PC, but if your trying to get into fighters this game is a good game as well to start.

Honestly though, I'd only get this game on a sale.

I will still reccomend it, but just be warned on PC it does have its fair share of problems.",1475550578,1475550578,TRUE,2,0,0.520682335,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.66E+16,137,9,31107,0,4959,1595774385

Also it has huge problems with setting up controls. Without x360ce ur completly fucked. Keyboard is NOT EVEN CONFIGURABLE at ALL. 
Also i preordered the game because i believed capcom would update it to be  a good game.... but the fightmony system is a joke. Yes u will earn a good bunch at start (from the story and some other crap) but then u will die before u reach 10k for each charakter u want to unlock! Like whose fking idea is it to make a competivite game without all charakters selectable? Dont even mention u ll have to grind like crazy just for unlocking colours! I payed 60 bucks and i deserve a fking full game and not some pay to win mechanic. 
Now lastly the gameplay has some good aspekts. Hits give u a good feedback and the execution of the moves is working fine. The cost however is that the game is way easier then before. Only zangief has 360 and many other inputs changed for beeing easier. Combos are short and very easy to execute. The cast without dlc chars is small.

80,Street Fighter V,25814942,english,"I tried to like this game, but there's just too many issues at the moment to even remotely recommend this game.

The game does get better with each patch... mostly.... minus the Capcom.sys rootkit issue that plagued this game, even if it was only for a short time, I have since completely uninstalled the game because of this. Until they get the content sorted out and the bugs and security fixed as well I will not be reinstalling this game until all these issues are corrected.

The payment model for this game is disgusting. DLC costs are insane for no more than what you get; i.e. Capcom Pro Tour DLC and locking DLC to Steam Wallet purchase only (minus Season Pass and OST) reducing any chance to get this content on Steam sale or within a bundle. The fight money has gotten only slightly better and this was only after multiple complaints from fans happened. 

The 8 frames of input lag is down right horrendous. When you load up USFIV on PC it feels like a miles better game in comparison. The clipping with the character models is very distracting and wasn't really in or noticeable in other Street Fighter titles, but in this one it happens often. Still no Arcade Mode. Survival Mode does not have a continue/checkpoint system which it needs, because no one wants to play the game for x amount of time then get one or 2 fights from completing, only to lose and have to do the WHOLE THING OVER! Censorship, while it can be put back in with mods (until they patch mod support out of the game) is just insane. Look at past Capcom games, even Street Fighter games. Hardly any censorship if at all in the past games. This game is full of censorship which isn't even that bad and really did not need to be removed.

Prepare to have a half decent machine to run this otherwise the random lag will make the game unplayable. I believe this is an issue with the optimization with the Unreal Engine 4 because every other game I have I can run fine, but this runs fine for a bit then sudden lag spikes out of nowhere for a few seconds then the game is fine. GPU wise you might be fine but CPU wise, anything less than an AMD FX-6300 or i5 equivelant might as well just not play the game to avoid running into issues like this because it will happen.

Consider buying this game when it's on a Steam Sale and be sure to get it with the Season Pass bundled as well, for your own sake.

While unbalanced, SF4 was just fun to play and it was consistent to its fundamentals, this isnt.

Let me explain, this game is pretty much just 3 hit combo, counter hit, and v trigger, mix it with just plain odd characters like karin who is hard to master but once you go to a certain level she's hard to beat. 

The mix of making it easy for beginners and making execution easier just makes the game feel a bit too easy at times, that is control wise, game wise, it requires a lot of fundamentals, but unlike SF4, which rewarded you for 1 frame links , this doesnt have that, a fairly simple juggle combo from karin, necali and thats it, you've lost, while you try to play fang and do all sorts of stuff but get rewarded poorly. 

So this mix of easier to control but heavilly punished when making mistakes just makes me old folks feel like the new stuff like v-triggers the game is just inconsistent. Again I played long hours of this , but it was mostly me tring to see if I could do better, I tried really hard and it wasn't fun, when I look back at it.

I feel really bad, but I wont be playing this game anymore, things like no arcade mode and just the overall feel of it, it just isn't the way its been for a very long time.

8,Street Fighter V,21347104,english,"UPDATE 2:
It seems that there was a rollback update so the game would not require the rootkit. I'm leaving the rest of this review as it is though, CAPCOM simply cannot be trusted not to do this kind of thing anymore.

===================================================

UPDATE:
Most recent version installs software in the user's computer that works as a rootkit. It requires the user to allow the game to run with kernel level privileges on the computer. Problem is, it is so badly done that might allow world + dog to take over the user's PC. This rootkit is installed to the System32 folder on the PC, and the file is called capcom.sys. Uninstalling the game apparently does not remove the rootkit.

RECOMENDATION:
Do not update the game to its latest version. And Immediately uninstall it. To everyone that can still get a refund, I recommend to go get it.

=======================================================

Game's got really good graphics and sounds. Stages seem to be very detailed, even including the occasional destruction of background objects. Fighting seems to have a good flow to it.

Unfortunately, the game, as it is now, is pretty barebones in regards to content in the single player side. Story mode as it is now is comprised of three fights with one round each, which is, in my opinion, too little. There's not even a basic arcade mode with 8 to 10 3-round fights like before.

Capcom also seems to have done away with a lot of supers that were avalable for returning characters. Most characters have only one super in the command list, which may have some slightly different gameplay element if done under V-Trigger. Whereas in USFIV, each character could have 3 or even more supers/ultras.

Not to mention the occasional server trouble this game gets. Why oh why does this game need to log in to a server if we want to play story mode or survival with battle requests on OFF? And why does the game need to knock you out of the fight, into the menu if it loses its connection to servers during a Hard Mode survival run (on stage 34)? 

Buy it if you want the multiplayer. Or if you intend to get into eSports. 

Forget about this game for now if you want single player. Gamers are better off waiting until the full story mode is released in june.",1455995736,1474852242,FALSE,12,1,0.503126979,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.66E+16,1407,6,184,0,184,1455994734

Really Capcom? your answer to mods(which help the game with creative content) is to basically install malware?  Ugh  I'll wait for  roll back and hope they don't try it again.

Capcom...are you trying to become Konami?  There are plenty of other 1v1 fighters out there that deserve your money far more.

I'll start with the positive.

The graphics may not be everyones cup of tea, but they are crisp, colorful and the animations are some of the best I've seen in a 1v1 fighter since 3rd  strike.

Controls are responsive and I have no problem executing normals, special or combos.

One of the smaller positives is the fact that you can't be killed by chip damage!  Its such a nice feature that I hope other 1v1 fighters adopt.

Now the mixed bag:

The fighting itself is not very deep, but what there is still satisfying.  Impacts sound meaty and like they have weight behind them.  However, like I said in the begining the combat is not very deep, you will discover your characters bread and butter moves/combos and find very little reason to deviate from that.
I leave this as a mixed bag because even though it is simple it can be fun, and can be expanded in future updates.

Online is a very mixed bag, some matches are great some are laggy beyond belief.  

The Bad:

Capcom.  Its unfortunate that I can't reccomend a game based on the actions of its publisher.  They have had shady practices in the past ...cough...on disc DLC...cough.  That they tried to deny!

This game is no different in fact its a bit worse.  It launched with an anemic amount of content, and let me be clear, I don't mind that it launched with only 8 characters.  They were all very unique and with fewer characters it made it easier to learn matchups.
What I mean is that this game launched with a broken online ranked and casual system, and a single player survival mode....thats it, for full price!  At least KI didn't launch for $60.
They added very short character specific ""story"" fights, which at the end it unlocked the ABILITY to purchase an extra costume.  Yup, this costume was done when the game was done but your initial $60 was not enough.  Give Capcom more.
Do you want all the colors for your character?  Better get ready to pay up, or be ready to slog through 50! dull fights against the CPU which are mind numbingly boring.  The AI lulls you into a false sense of security, and when you are on the home stretch of these pointless fights the difficulty spikes causing you to have possible watsed a good amount of time for nothing.
I will grant that you can earn ""fight money"" through ranked matches and buy everything with the in game currency, but the ranked matches give you so little of this in game currency that its clear you are meant to throw down some extra real money.
Now, you'll notice my playtime isn't that high.  There was a overseas deployment and the fact that I was waiting for Urien to be released.
Well if he is out or not I'll never know.  Capcom added DRM.  Sorry Capcom, you can add any fancy title you want but a rose by any other name...
If it weren't bad enough that they added DRM, the DRM now just prevents the game from running at all, and when it does run its unstable and crashes with no error.
I said it at the begining but there are plenty of other 1v1 fighters out there that deserve your money far more.

UPDATE:
WIth recent additions and patches, Street Fighter V is now worth your money.

-Battle Lounges now act like lounges; supporting more than 2 players (8).

-The Rematch Option allows for Salty Run-backs

-The Store is now active You can buy colors (original costume only) with fight money along with costumes (story only as of this writing) and profile skins, among other things.

-Story Mode Ken saves you from having to look at his banana's or his impending Archie Andrews costume

-Chun Li's breasts no longer act like Jello mounds. (a tragedy to some, I suppose)

The game still lacks a proper Arcade Mode, but the additions to the game (which should have been working at launch but oh well) have caused me to change my review to a recommendation.

If you were interested in Street Fighter V but were holding off until things got better; Things got better, Go ahead and throw your wallet at the screen.








ORIGINAL REVIEW:
Street FIghter V was rushed to an early release to allow for pro players to practice in anticipation of Capcom Cup 2016 and EVO 2016.

Capcom has been dishonest about the price to value aspect of the game, with the information that the initial release would be lacking only available if you followed developer blogs or developer twitter accounts. The store page here on steam and the box art paint it in a more positive light advising that more features are coming in the future but failing to indicate how bare the game is.

That said, this release isn't as much of an atrocity as that of another prolific fighting game that actually dropped PC support but still has the audacity to sell it on steam.

-Character Balance is good.

=Playing online (which is all there really is) is fun, and for the most part, stable.
There are some glaringly obvious exploits that PC users can inflict upon PS4 users that were present and reported in the beta repeatedly, that capcom failed to fix and released anyway.

-There is no arcade mode, preventing new or intermediate players from learning new characters against a rotating roster. To learn your character against others you have to repeatedly rotate in and out training mode and manually 
change your opponent, and manually set them to CPU.

-The tutorial mode may as well not be present. You learn the basics of Ryu. What about Ken? What about Rashid? What about Cammy? What about everyone else? Killer Instinct and Skull Girls have amazing training modes that can have you go from novice to expert.


There are other games that currently offer a mountain more for the same price, or half the price.

If you are fine with just doing ranked or casual matches online; go ahead and buy it now, especially if you plan on competing in tournaments, you will need to get in and practice now. understand that there are no practice tools, You are going to be going in against heavyweights .

If you are interested in a fleshed out experience also known as the complete package. Wait until after the 'cinematic story' patch is released which is essentally when the game will be in a proper launch state.

2) Characters are evenly balanced for the most part, gameplay is fun, flashy stuff! Points!

3) Gameplay slightly simplified. That's kind of a shame, I loved grinding combos in Training. No points.

4) Too expensive! Come on, with or without the DLC it costs way too much. No points.

5) Game is still developing at a nice steady pace. Metagame is advancing, a year later. New characters being introduced excites me! Urien looks fun to fight. Points!

6) Netcode is alriiiiightish. I have a good connection, so I don't get issues on that front! However, a lot of people do. No points.

7) Character design and visual design is outstanding! I love the costumes. Points!

8) Much more demanding towards one's computer than its predecessor. MUCH more. No points.

9) Great ranking system design! People with dedication end up right where they belong. A step up from SFIV's stressful PP system. Points!

10) Great community, as always in the FGC. Points!

11) Tournaments are hype! Capcom is doing well in supporting the competitive events. Excited for CPT! Points!

Overall, I'm ready to stuff at least another thousand hours into the Street Fighter franchise, all thanks to this game! I'm really pleased with it. However, the cost and some of other people's complaints cause me to lower my rating a little bit.

2. Lag from connecting to other players

The downsides are okay if you are not easily frustrated by unfair losses. And some of the issues can be adressed with third party software (region blocking, graphic settings, etc.).

1,Street Fighter V,25293988,english,"When this game first came out I was blown away by the new systems and odd ball street fighter characters that are being put in, such as birdie and r. mika.  I really wanted to play as them and even karen to some extent. After trying out this fresh new game, I won with zangief to the point where people actually started figuring out the system and learning their ""frames"" to the point where every game was one sided and not fun anymore.  After the first few dlc characters came out I chose my main, who is the only person I found to be fun in the game.  Knowing my luck however, my character was mid to low tier and I find myself up against ryu/karen/cammy players who just abuse everything I can't learn to get good at. I Found myself playing less and less to the point now where every time I open the game, I fight one ryu who mashes medium punches into a basic combo then throws me after every meaty hit. I lose hard against everyone I fight and find that this game -for most characters- have an easy go to combo.  That being said, when I try out another character I start by saying, what's their easy combo and find it straight away. It's not fun if all you do is a two hit combo into a super move, then just do one more mix up and stun, THEN the rounds over because I got push into a corner and had no way out.  Winning a round is great, but for the most part, the next round I play in they figured out my play style and go balls deep into the mash basic combo to stun, then taunt. Even worse are people's favorite ibuki? I could never beat her in the older games but now she's just a jack rabbit full of mix ups.  If you don't know the many mix ups, she'll get you stunned and take the round easy.  How can you say that you enjoy a game if you spend around two minutes waiting for a game, just to sit around in the game not being able to do anything. I'm running away from most characters because I know if they get close the whole game is over.  Many would argue that I would just have to get good, but if I leave town for a month and come back with no experience of any games and pop in just to be insulted by some guy, why would anyone want to come back and play the game?  Ranked or even casual are in what I guess is most people's opinions busted.  I got to super silver by some luck and I find myself with someone who just got silver and they beat me like I just started playing street fighter.  I love most the characters that are in this game and want to see another street fighter come out in the next five years, but I just hate this game.  The story was fun and wacky, though I find karen being a major part of it to be out of place and rather bad taste.  A random alpha character is in charge of ""team street fighter"", to me that's a long boo.  Altogether the game is well put together, the intertnet connects are great, music sounds like recycled marvel vs capcom 3, models look good in basic angles, but don't look at them in say a model viewer.  Juri has huge spinal problems, like her butts sticks out like cancer and her torso is paper thin-inhuman. Plenty of colors and alt. costums for the playable characters, and for the most part, hitting feels good. I'm sure nobody will read my ramblings, much less the rage rants from street fighter four.  I reinstalled four and went online. I was triggered right in the first match, akuma with a mic. I was hosting and the guy came back and played as oni, still with a mic on. More importantly I couldn't really fight him because the connection felt like a slinky. One second I press the button, next thing I know, I'm on the other side of the screen. Was the connections on four really that bad? Quality really can spoil one's ideal of what's acceptable these days.  That's probably why I cannot stand this game because nothing works for me.

I avoided this game at launch as we all saw it suffer from lack of content and network support.

I remained on the fence about purchasing it up until this latest steam sale.

If you are living with a Street Fighter sized hole in your life maybe this will halp reassure your angst.

>> Cons >>
I'm still upset with Capcom. If this was the debut title release from Capcom they would have sunk. I'm mad that the game is sixty bucks, but to unlock all the characters they want another thirty. I remember back in the day when you unlocked characters just by playing the game alot. You can purchase the in game characters with in game currency, but after completing the story modes and survival modes you still wouldn't have enough I don't think. It is an option but it is heavily stilted.

The online matches I have played (about a dozen) at least half of them the connection was garbage, my opponent would teleport around and land hits while the game was buffering. I have great internet where I am so rule that out. It may be just that those opponents have crappy internet and not actually the netcode though. I'm not putting the blame solely on Capcom for that, however it did kill the mood a bit!

And still no arcade mode. I know I know survival, or play online. But I'm oldschool. I want to practice my combos on each character for a few rounds in increasing difficulty! You know, like arcade mode!

>> Pro's >>
Ok so if you're still with me first let me say that I am very happy I bought SFV. I would advise you to either wait for another steam sale, or maybe visit one of those shady key sites (only because I'm still mad at capcom) and pay 30 or 40 bucks rather than 60, that way you can buy the extra characters that should have been included in the damn game anyway.

There is something about this latest SF that really grabs me. Maybe its the art, or the character design, but I'm loving it. I love that they remixed alot of characters. Be warned though some charge characters have been converted to quarter circle inputs so that may put you off, but for me I'm happy. I like the new characters, I like the new outfits. I just can't stop playing this. Maybe because I went through a drought of no SF ha ha.

If you have a friend to play with its so much better. When you join a battle lounge (online matchmaking ""party"") you can't really type to message, you have to select prewritten text, so communication is clunky. Also its hard to display your intentions that way, but if you've got a friend to spar with, grab a voip and its a blast.

The Story mode is in game now and its splendid! 
Survival mode is a challenge, though the AI goes from numb to killer in the last few matches so watch out.

Training mode is outfitted with everything you can imagine. If you plan on really drilling combo's or specific actions you can do it. Also you can just turn your opponent into AI mode (which I've been doing and pretending its Arcade mode). The AI can be adjusted for difficulty too, so if you need to practice blocking, reversals etc you can do it here without giving up any League Points.

Finally there are some really good players scouring the ranked matches nightly. I have been beat down a bunch of times which gives me hope! Its not a game if you can never lose and its not a fun game if the challenge is easily overcome.

I'd say now is the time to jump into SFV if you've been holding out. This was a chance to start over for me, I switched my main character and alt, and have been loving just training with them. It also helps that I have a friend to play online against a few nights a week.

Offline, the game works fine. Max settings, 60 FPS, all good.

Online, however, is non-existent for a lot us. All I get from Capcom support are generic template responses that offer no advice at all.

I suggest you do NOT buy this game at the full price of £44.99. Wait for a big discount sale. 

Will amend my review when they actually give us the finished version of the game.

26/08/2016: UPDATE

I decided to come back and check if SFV had been fixed at all. Online seems fine, at last. This is welcome relief to MANY of us that were simply not finding any Ranked or Casual matches. The battle lounge, at the time of my old review, was plagued with laggy match-ups.

I've been playing a day and a night now, testing online stability, and everything seems fine off-the-bat. I have only had one laggy ranked match so far, and that was partially my fault for not having the ""Ask"" function enabled when switching on Fight Request - I urge everyone to use this feature, as it shows you the opponents connection before zoning in to fight them.

If you like online fighting games there is no way around SFV and Capcom did a great job in balancing this game. And as I like online play a lot this review is positive as the game is totally worth its money (btw there is DLC but as far as I can tell you can unlock nearly everything important easy with in game credits which you get from completing single player missions and leveling characters).

If you however don't like online play the content isn't very much for the money. So negative reviews are understandable imho regarding that matter.
And than you have the problem that there is still no DInput support (so you will have to work with things like x360_ce in case you have a DInput only stick), network connections indicators still don't work very well and connections sometimes are laggy (but sometimes when your opponent is from around the world this is somewhat understandable). So another point where I can understand people which give negative reviews.

The game feels like you're playing SF 4 on opiates with an gravitational force pushing back against your characters. There is no arcade mode. Fight money (the stuff you gain through playing to unlock content [stages/characters/costumes]) is a grind. In a practical sense you can only gain enough to unlock a few characters OR costumes. Some costumes/stages aren't even available to purchase with fight money, only real money.

The networking aspects are plagued with problems, server rollbacks that happen in real time. So on your screen you think you are hitting someone, but the game blinks and they're hitting you instead. 

SF5 marks Capcom's worst effort to date, and their business model is to keep your interest ""fresh"" by dripping new character releases ever few weeks/months.

The game tends to crash frequently if you tab out. And now you're penalized for crashing or rage quitting and lose 1,000 ranking points and get banned from online play for 24 hours at a time.

As a fighter it is a poor product, technical issues notwithstanding. This game looks and plays like an indie effort trying to emulate the Street Fighter brand. The mechanics are hollowed and boiled down. It lacks depth and there's not a lot of variance between how one Ryu plays and another because the game has taken a very systematic approach to gameplay. In the end, it's a very empty experience and it's not one that can necessarily be ""fixed.""

Capcom's efforts at technical fixes have come at a snail's pace and generally create more problems than they solve.

The rollbacks usually are onesided, and if you minimize and maximize the game, then you are fine but your opponent has rollbacks now, its like a new level of yomi and mixups where you should have the keyboard near the stick to do it.

Thats why most people disconnects, but CAPCOM, full of incompetence and ignorance thought that the best method to fix disconnects is punishing players with 24h bans... even in casual mode. Now I'm going to explain the online experience in this game with an example:

[u]wednesday 18:05[/u] Ok, I'm going to try some casual matches, because all my friends stopped to play this shit online months ago.

[u]wednesday 18:15[/u] I pushed the search button 10 minutes ago but the game is searching an opponent yet, I think it's broken, I'll try to restart the search

[u]wednesday 18:19[/u] Woooh, the game found an opponent!, ops, is searching again.

[u]wednesday 18:25[/u] Another opponent!, ok ok, this one is real!

[u]wednesday 18:45[/u] Yeah, this is the last transition screen of the game, I don't know why capcom wants to show 49 transition screens that last more than 30 seconds each, every fucking battle.

[u]wednesday 18:46[/u] My opponent is rashid, lets go! ehm... wait, he was standing and in the next frame he is recovering from a fliying kick that hit me... all in one frame, nice. Time to alt+f4, it's unplayable, because well, after a match there are a lot of transition screens again and I appreciate my time.

[u]wednesday 18:50[/u] I'm banned because I didn't want to play an unplayable match.

[u]wednesday 18:53[/u] I'm playing overwatch, a game that connect 12 players in less than 1 minute, without lag or teleports, well, like most online games that are not made by retarded monkeys.

Unfortunately it is not.

The single player content is sorely lacking, the character story mode is a joke when it comes to the actual fighting part. You get one round fights that my toddler can beat simply by button mashing. The biggest let down to me is no arcade mode like the previous games. Vs mode can only be played locally against another player.

The online part of this game is very good and addicting though. Playing with a stick the gameplay is amazing. I'm not a huge fan of the current roster of fighters, or how some of the orginal fighters have been changed, but I'm sure that will be improved in the coming years as this game grows.

- Beautiful animations.

- Super fun quick matches.
- No bullshit, honest gameplay (except R. Mika)
- Cool and very unqiue characters due to the V-trigger system.

- wishy-washy developer support.
- no daily interactions with player base. (look how blizzard interactions with its playerbase, capcom)
- Online is either very good or very bad. 
- lacks basic content that other fighting games have on Day 1 launch.

It's no secret that Capcom's overall quality has steadily been on the decline and, for me, this was the last nail in the coffin. SFV is my final purchase of a Capcom game and I whole heartidly regret it.

So what's wrong? Let me list it for you:

- It was knowingly released as an unfinished product. 
- Cinematic Story Mode is lackluster at best.
- PC vs. PS4 has a notable input difference. PS4 ver. has 8 frame input lag. Drastically impacting reactionary gameplay. 
- Delays in character releases/glitches upon updates.
- In game character models are low end and varied in looks due to outsourcing to 3rd party model designers. 
- Capcom's indifference to customer complaints and player concerns. 

I say this as someone who has been a dedicated fan of the franchise and as a player who created a Steam account just to purchase and play this game on their PC.

49,Street Fighter V,24833529,english,"Lets face it... if you're a fan of the series, you're gonna get this game. But for introducing people into the street fighter line... I can't recommend this broken game. Let me start with the good.

Good:
- Looks pretty decent.
- Plays well with fairly solid mechanics
- Characters are unlockable with in game currency
- Seems Like Street fighter alpha 4 to me in many ways
- Decent tutorials, and character introductions.
- useable sized roster with a distinct lack of clones
- signifigant changes between previous versions of characters.
- every character is interesting to me in some way,

There's some good here, and I can appreciate that immensely. But on the other side of the coin...

Bad:
- Loading
- graphical glitches in character models
- clothing bits and hair pieces do, literally, whatever the hell they want to do. For example, Cammy's pigtails literally spin on her head, Kens hair clips though his body on the character select screen. rashied's hat constnatly flutters about and gets stuck on his model.
- loading...
- short of playing online constantly, In game currency is pretty hard to come by, and things in the store are really expensive.
- background elements aren't even consistant with how many frames of animation they have. In brazil, one guy in the background moves smoothly (roughly 60 FPS), where another one across the screen chops around at 30 FPS. It's jarring, to say the least.
- LOADING!
- wait times for online matches are stupidly long
- there is so much popping around in online matches... holy crap. I swear I've hit with a move, but a fraction of a second later, they blink away, with no damage done.
- Character Story mode is lacking and is pretty weaksauce.
- No arcade mode. Somewhere you can just go beat up on 8-10 computer controlled opponents and earn fight money
- can only use xbox controllers! Yes, there are tools out there to help with that... but it shoudln't need external support for that.
-THIS GAME IS NOT A WHOLE GAME! Yes, there's free story DLC... but it should NOT have been DLC. This was rushed out for the competive scene, and it shows.

I can't really recommend this game... but I'm still gonna play it to see if I can get what I feel is $40 worth of my money out of it. Thanks for the occasional sale on this.

51,Street Fighter V,24787799,english,"After a shakey release in February to get the game on to shelfs and in time for EVO, it seemed Capcom was off to a ruff start with there oldest series to date. However with the multiple fixes and addition of new characters, game modes and even a free story mode campagin, in such a short amount of time. Things are turning around for Street Fighter 5 after all. The art style and graphics run smooth and can handle just about anything your computer can throw at it. however wait times for PC players are longer than normal and can sometimes drop in preformance in online play when pinned up against someone playing on the PS4 due to cross-play. (thought coss-play is optional) As for gameplay, this maybe the smoothist Street Fighter game to date and can be enjoyed by new players and veterans alike. The game supports Keyboard, Xbox One & 360 controllers and Fight-Sticks/Pads and PS3 Fight-Stick/Pads only, but no PS4 or PS3 controllers are ""YET"" to be surpported.

52,Street Fighter V,24746596,english,"If you are a die hard fan of Street Fighter, you will enjoy this game.  The new mechanics really diversify the characters, making even old stand by characters like Zangief feel fresh again with new tactics.  Each character feels like they have the set of tools they need to achieve victory, and I find the characters are very well balanced. 

That is the biggest positive this game has, however, you only can really appreciate the fighting mechanics by doing vs human multiplayer.  If you just arn't that interested in playing human opponents, then you won't really notice it.  Single player speaking, as of this review, you only have a few options to play:  Character story mode, which gives you a little comic story around literally 2 or 3 ROUNDS of gameplay vs very simple AI.  Survival Mode, which you have to face multiple AI opponents in sequence that get progressively more challenging until you complete the 'set.'  The sets of opponents are always the same, and the in-between round bonus you get (Defense increases, Health restoration) are random, which only preserves the frustration of randomness, yet keeps the experience predictable.   Have to beat 50 people in a row?  Well, when you fail the first time on opponent 35, you have to go back and fight the SAME people in the SAME order and they'll turn the AI back down to lull you back into complacency.  

The third single player option is the General Story mode, which is a series of cut scenes using the game engine with you taking control of certain characters at certain points and playing a round of combat.  This is very fun the first time through because, for the first time, a Street Fighter game has an actual cannon story with it, and it is filled with things referencing games of the past and future.  If you arn't a long time fan of the series, certain plot points will be lost on you, but overall it was fun.  Watching the cut-scenes I played through in a couple hours, and you end up playing against some interesting unplayable characters.  After you complete it, you can go through it again with advanced AI difficulty.  It was fun, BUT at the end of it all it just wasn't enough gameplay.  The combat is still single rounds, so even if you face an opponent that beats you, you only need to beat them that one round to progress, so while it is a great addition to the game, it doesn't really showcase the game itself.

It is missing a simple Aracade Mode.  The traditional ""play a series of opponents in 2 out of 3 rounds, then beat a boss, watch the credits"" mode.  A mode where you can adjust the difficulty of your opponent, and then face random ones.  Perhaps this was intentional, because right now your only option for casual play is vs humans, which perhaps will get more people playing online.

Again, the game mechanics itself, I think are the best yet.  Right now, the characters seem very balanced, and it is fun to play people online.  If you want to dive in the online multiplayer, or don't mind it, you'll like the game.  It's excellent, and I recommend it for fighting game fans.  But it does lack many single player features, which they may add on later or may not.  So this game, while fun, certainly isn't what I would call a casual experience.",1470507762,1470507762,TRUE,4,0,0.532019675,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.66E+16,278,1,6184,0,2021,1598660773
53,Street Fighter V,21263117,english,"Now that the game has been out for a while and we have most of this waves dlc I wanted to update my review. Street Fighter V is in my opinion the best Street Fighter since 3rd Strike. It has a variety of fun, viable charachters, each one with a unique V skill/trigger which provides an opprotunity for much deeper gameplay and charachter design than any of the SFIV series games. Gameplay wise this game has nearly no flaws, I could nitpick a few things I prefer from older SF entries but this game accomplishes what it set out to do very well. Graphically SFV is a mixed bag. Some charachters look better than ever while some make me wish that the game was still sprite based. I have to take a few points off for the graphical variance, and I wish Capcom had opted for a different graphical route (ala Guilty Gear shading, or Skullgirls animation). The story mode really added nothing for me, I enjoyed playing the dlc charachters early but thats about it. My main complaint for this game is the price of the dlc. Even with a season pass you have to throw more money at the game to unlock all of the content. Besides the ridiculous pricing and grind for fightmoney, the game has fixed most of its flaws with the netcode, and lack of single player content.

When are companies going to learn that not everyone has access to good internet? It's also on the developers to program their games to account for the fact that if it has the option to go online, the netcode should be able to support it?

Pokkén Tournament handles it perfectly. Tekken Tag Tournament 2 handles it perfectly. MKX on consoles also handles it perfectly. Why can't SFV be the same?

60,Street Fighter V,24643910,english,"HONEST REVIEW: I would only recommend this game for any person that remembers what it was like to truly win at something and not just be handed a participation trophy. Fighting games and particularly Street Fighter games require 100s of hours of practice to just get good. There are no short cuts, there are no easy level ups. You have to devote yourself to learning how to beat the other person with your character of choice. Playing street fighter is like playing chess and poker in 1/12 of a second increments. You have to make the right move or the right call FAST! There's no easy win here boys and girls. It's a game where it's just you and your opponent, no teams to bail you out or blame for their terrible plays. You have to hold that ""L"" all to yourself, so if you want to know what it's like to really be a winner then pick up this game and play it. Play it until you hate, then play it some more until you realize how amazing this game truly is. Once you finally reach that level where you can dominant your opponent. That's when you'll know what it feels like to truly be a winner. 

Pros: 
• Amazing multiplayer with a good list of characters and more to be added (well balanced as of 7-1-16)
• Awesome story mode (4 hours of content with some good humor and surprises)
• Training mode (with recorder) to practice numerous setups. Needs a few more tweaks and online mode to practice with a friend, but taht should be coming.
• Graphic Modding (don't like a skin. Change it)
• Capcom is fully backing this game with updates on a monthly basis so more content will be added all the time. Majority of the content can be earned for free by playing the game or paid for if you wish. Only cosmetic items like premium outifts will cost you.

Cons:
The game was released early as it was rushed to be ready for the 2016 tournament season. The multiplayer was finished, but everything else was not so the game has suffered in reviews. Since Feb. the game has seen a number of additions with more coming so I believe most of these will be addressed in up to a years time with that said as of 7-1-16 there are still a few things that need to be addressed but are not game breaking such as:

• Rage quitting in ranked (no true deterrent as of yet), but can be avoided in casuals or battle lounges
• 8 frames of input delay (this affects your ability to react to punish moves. It's currently under review by capcom to address it)
• Rather long load times between matches. 30 seconds to a minute feels like forever when you are staring at a blank screen.
• The in game recording of your stats is still not functional (It's sort of like a fitness tracker for your character)
• Model clipping that makes the game feel a little cheap and unpolished. (I have a feeling this will be addressed last as it's only noticeable on load screens).",1470010947,1470010947,TRUE,1,0,0.5,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.66E+16,267,71,9982,0,411,1578819553

76,Street Fighter V,24569472,english,"UPDATED REVIEW

very dissapointing game i'd have to say, the gameplay is nice, better than sf4, but fails compared to SF3 3rd strike, i see alot of people comparing the two game to eachother, i dont blame them, since the people working on this game also worked on third strike, but this game is an utter faliure.

mechanics:
one of the main mechanics in the gameplay is the crush counter, its annoying and barely puts any ""skill"" involved in the gameplay, since you'll likely be pressing meaty HP or HK for a crush counter combo. this game depends too much on combos, much like it's previous game. keep it simple and clean.
NO PARRYING
parrying is a mechanic that existed in the SF3 games and it was a great mechanic, why didnt capcom keep it and make it universal for all characters instead of just ryu? it makes the game more skilled based rather than pressing HP or HK (crush counter). it creates tense and hype moments, one of the main core elements SF3 has.

gameplay: to me i feel like this street fighter game is the most stressful game in the entire series, theres is barely any footsie battles, just spam safe moves and get you opponent in a block string, not to mention most of the combos are ""execute a move"" tap a button ""do another move"". 

rank mode
it is so terrible, i cannot believe how bad it is for lower ranked people (900 - 1500). its constant win 1 lose 1, and youll be stuck there. i have experiacned much better players in the ultra bronze area than people in super silver. the lp system is abolute trash, sf4's system is much better and fair. the matchmaking is one of the worst ive ever experianced. always gets matched with a player that is 2-4 leagues better than you. people argue that versing people better than you makes you better, no it doesnt, theres steps to improve yourself, and versing someone that is a few steps ahead of you will do you nothing. (just steal their techs, it works)

community: the streetfighter community is 50/50 for me, you got people who are willing to help and assist players with knowledge but also provide respect when versing another, then you got people that make fun of people that they're dominating, being trolls and aboslutely cancerous (sfv disscussion) and this is the streetfighter community as a whole. 

CASHCOM: for a game that is $60 and compare the content it provided IN THE FIRST PLACE it is terrible. atleast story mode is in right? after months without proper amount of content for a $60 game, it is pathetic on capcom's part, i heard it's because of the CPT they released it early but still, its a shame. the DLC capcom provides, i have no problems with it, but the issue is that the majority of the cosumes are only purchasable by money, not the ingame currency ""fight money"" i love how capcom is treating it's customers. 

final statement
the only thing that is making me comeback to this game is the fact that urien is going to be in it

78,Street Fighter V,24158638,english,"I was expecting so much from this game. I even waited until the July's 1.04 patch before writing this review, hoping that Capcom could get things fixed - but no, they did nothing more than add a Story Mode, more characters, a few levels, and called it a day. On PS4 things aren't so grim, but on the PC side the online play is horrendous.

For a fighting game that was supposedly meant to focus on online gaming, Street Fighter 5 has failed to reach this goal. Still, knowing it was only one person - ONE PERSON - who was responsible for coding the online gaming experience for this game, I'm honestly surprised it works even this well. That however is still no excuse for this garbage they've given us. Even after forwarding all the ports, deactivating my firewall and antivirus, I still get constantly disconnected from the servers. Sometimes it takes only 2 minutes, sometimes it takes 10 minutes. And the problem is not in my router - I rarely (once in 2 hours, if at all) get disconnected while playing on my PS4.

And don't even get me started on the online roll back netcode that gives you 8 frames of input lag - 8 FRAMES!!

I originally stopped playing SF5 within the first four days, tired of the bad connectivity and constant server disconnects. I had hoped they would have fixed these issues by now, but having been proven wrong - again, no surprise since this is Crapcom we're talking about here - I believe it has come time to uninstall this piece of crap once and for all.

This makes me sad because the offline game play mechanics are fine, no - more than that - they are great. The only problem with the offline mode is that you can't unlock anything while offline and there is no Player Vs. CPU mode in the game, other than the new Story Mode (which is ridiculously easy) and the retarded Survival Mode, that you have to complete if you wish to unlock all the character colours. And oh yeah, you have to complete them with each skin per character, since completing the survival mode with one skin will unlock a new colour only for that one skin.

The idea that you can earn fight money in the game that allows you to buy in-game content, such as characters, skins and levels was a neat idea. But even now I'm seeing DLC-skins that you have to buy with real money - skins that have had real effort put into them, unlike the ones you can buy with your Fight Money.

Crapcom is seemingly really eager to become the new KONAMI.

There are some few bright spots in this game, but they are by far overshadowed by the problems this game has, so I won't even bother listing them here aside the ones I've already have in this review. The bottom-line is this - don't buy this game. Not on the PC at least, not until - if ever - they decide to fix the problems it's suffering from. Oh, and I really, really hope they add an option where you can choose from which regions you are willing to accept challengers from. Even on the PS4 I'm getting real sick of playing against Italians, Portuguese and Greeks who have only 1 bar on their connection, even when I've set it up so that I'm supposed to get challengers with connection of 3 or better.

PS: Fuck KONAMI

<Edit 28.7.2016>

Ok, Capcom apparently does not care about the game's online component - which was supposed to be the center piece of the game right from the start. I've had it with the lack of response to the bad server connections, the constant lags whenever I do get a match make the fights seem like slideshows; this is officially the worst Street Fighter game EVER...well, right after the Street Fighter game that was based on that awful live-action movie I wish I had not seen.

The bottom line is, don't buy this game if you're on PC.

One thing i liked about this game over the others is that its alot more easier to chain combos. Where usually in previous SF games you only got 1 frame to link a combo, but in SF5 you got 3 frames which leaves more time to chain combos.

The graphics in this game are phenomenal! On PC at 1080p Max settings of course. Compared to the PS4 version, the PC has better anti aliasing, added motion blur and lastly better shadows where the PS4 version, shadows looked really blocky.

I had one complaint which is the content i know i know other people said the same thing a million times with lesser character roster and stages. But as of right now i think its much more justifiable now as it is when it first released.

I looked on the steam charts for this game and theres over a thousand playing this which is pretty decent not counting the PS4 players in crossplay. So why can't I find a match? The multiplayer needs work because I have to wait forever to find an oppenent, and almost half the time I find a match the oppenent is stuck in this weird glitch where he's stuck spamming the same move over and over again where he cant move, but that only occurs with the PS4 crossplay.

Which leads to my next issue. The crossplay between PS4 and PC is not good. It kinda works, but it's a glitchy and buggy mess. I like that they added it, but like the multiplayer it needs work badly.

That's just scratching the surface of the problems. There's no arcade mode and no player vs AI. And dont even get me started on the ""story"" mode, now to be fair there is a real story mode coming but at release they gave us a piss poor version of it.

So what about the good of the game? Well the gameplay is great and the fighting is excellent. BAM that's it. I guess it is allowing you to earn this fight money to unlock characters for free but that will take forever if you decide to do that.

Never on any planet should this cost $60. I dont recommend that at full price but pick it up on sale for at least $40 like what I got. It's still fun and I'm still playing it. I dont really feel ripped off because like I said before I got this on sale.

4,Street Fighter V,24193832,english,"[h1]General Overview[/h1]

After over 100 hours put into the game, I think I'm ready to review Street Fighter V. To preface this, I am a Street Fighter fan, and after the relative success they enjoyed from past iterations, I was ready and willing to spring for both the base game and the season pass at launch. During the game's initial forays, I found I was disappointed. The character story was lacking, battle lounges had no capacity for more than 2 players, as well as the lack of communication between players (you can only rely on pre-determined phrases you select from a menu). On top of this, there are issues with 8 frames of input lag, as well as the fact that you have to unlock colors via Survival Mode, which sounds simple on the surface, but it entails grinding through all difficulty levels (10 on easy, 30 on normal, and 50 on hard). If you lose, you have to start completely over. To further add to the grind, you have to do this for each costume you wish to unlock colors for. Fortunately, there have been some kind souls that have alleviated the process substantially.

As it stands now, more characters have been released (bringing the roster from the original 16 to 20), with two more on the way hopefully next month as of this writing. They have also released a statement saying they are considering other avenues for unlocking colors, and they've at least showed they've started listening. As for the gameplay itself, as I've stated before, it is well known that there are 8 frames of input lag, but the combat and controls are all comfortable and easier to learn. The training mode is adequate and the trials provide a decent jumping point for learning about a character. Of course, to get in-depth about a character, their frame data, and specific match-up knowledge, it's best to turn to shoryuken.com or other resources.

The addition of a fully fleshed-out story mode, titled ""A Shadow Falls"", is a entertaining 3-hour foray into the Street Fighter universe, even if it's a little canned and full of anime tropes. If nothing else, it's a good source of Fight Money. Unfortunately, in terms of garnering a new audience, I feel that was too little, too late. Had Capcom had released the story DLC on day one, they would've captured a new generation of Street Fighter enthusiasts. 

[h1]Pros:[/h1]
[list]
[*]All the Street Fighter combat you love and remember.
[*]Easy to learn mechanics, combos and depth.
[*]Good soundtrack, decent graphics.
[*]Local play is solid.
[*]Mods are supported. Unique and creative costumes are released by the community regularly!
[/list]
[h1]Cons:[/h1]
[list]
[*]Unlocking colors the honest way takes way too long, and is arduous at the higher difficulties.
[*]Rage-quitting is a prevalent issue. A player that reached number one on the online rankings through tool-assisted means only took 5 months to get punished.
[*]Rollback is a prevalent issue.
[*]No voice chat or true text chat.
[*]8 frame input lag.
[*]No D-input support.
[/list]
All in all, I recommend the game. Despite several issues, Capcom has gotten around to addressing some of the major issues the community has expressed, and things have started looking up. At it's core, Street Fighter V is a solid game that continues to retain the mechanics that swept the gaming world so many years ago. With its excellent soundtrack, solid mechanics, and easy to pick up gameplay (that is hard to master), it is sure to not disappoint.

I don't want to buy this game at a discount just to end up spending more money trying to get the rest of the content.  I feel like Capcom should have done more to make things right with regular consumers like myself.  I understand that the focus of this game was at ""tournament"" players from the onset - but Capcom never advertised it that way.  Almost a 1/2 year later, and I still feel like it makes more sense to just save your money and watch this on Twitch. 

For those of you who don't care about spending money, the game actually feels pretty damn good on PC despite the limited content.  I was able to pick up and use my Elite controller without issue and I even won a few matches before requesting the refund.   The netcode is pretty good - I didn't notice continous problems like I thought I would.  The cross play between PS4 and PC players is interesting and ensures you will be able to find a match online (or at least while EVO is being broadcast).   Turning this up to 1440p resolution is an absolute visual treat - the artwork in this game definitely deserves praise.  

In conclusion, buy this game if you are a fan of the series and want to kick someone's ass online after a long day of working in your cubicle for less money than you are worth.

OH BOY MY CONTROLLER STARTED WORKING AGAIN AFTER A 4+ GB UPDATE FOR ANOTHER 1.6 GB UPDATE TO FUCK IT UP. 

Disclaimer- There is a reason it's not reccomended.
I've put a few hours in the game now it decides it doesn't want to detect my controller even when the previous game in the same series and literally every other fighter I've bought off steam seems to work with it.
I'm pretty salty as the game pretty much because of this doesn't work for me as of this time because of it.

-Story
I don't know I can't get to the menu to view it.
I'll give it a 60/10

-Gameplay
It's changed quite a bit from 4, the Focus attack is gone and replaced with character speciffic actions called V skills, some are OK but some just feel like they're with the current roster situational to 3-4 out of 16 plus characters but that's sure to change as more and more characters come out while others seem to get much better utility from their V skills.

Also a new machanic added to the game which is a pretty cool feature is V trigger, it's a boosted mode / effective action for characters that the meter builds for over time and can offer advantage situations for them, it can be obtained early through use of using the V skill effectively and landing crush counters making it a reward for cool use of the characters tools.

I'll give it a 7/10

-Graphics 
Don't tell anyone this but I'm sure I personally made all of the character models out of clay when I was in primary school and capcom stole them, jokes aside I do have issues with how some of the characters look, they look like muddy clay models with no attempt to hide clipping which is eye catching and I can't look away from it on the character select screen when I see it like Birdies Chain or Kens hair, oh poor Ken, he got it the worst out the characters.

Back grounds though are pretty nice to look at and there isn't one I can personally say there isn't one in the game I dislike the the visual of EX moves and supers having some water like trail behind them is a cool style choice.

Eh it's a 4/10.

-Other things

Online takes forever sometimes, I could have been waiting for a good 20 minuets and other times it was instant, I know that there is more then enough people to connect to now the PS4 and PC online are the same.

I like the idea of earning fight money to earn characters in game and I think when I worked it out 1 character with the single player content pays for over half the next character if you get to doing it all so there is incentive to try other character to earn the money for other characters. 

The cast has a nice variety of styles of play to it, I like the current cast but I can't lie I wanted guile since day one and a reason for salt here is that when he came out other things kept me away from the game for me to come back to controller issues. 

Overall I think the game is a 6/10 but I'm pretty salty currently about the game not working for me correctly so maybe I really think it's a 7/10",1467376849,1468646299,FALSE,2,1,0.443271935,2,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.66E+16,356,26,8402,2,4860,1601472317

The result?

A watered-down fighting game that gets repetitive and dull.  The game is very linear with how strong offense is and how weak zoning is.  Many mixups are strictly between throw or shimmy, and playing risky is usually a lot more rewarding than playing solid.  Combos are very limited with variety.  Most v-triggers are recycled versions of each other, which is really disappointing.  All v-skills are literally just a special move that is bound to mp+mk but they think they invented something incredible by calling it v-skill.  If they had v-skills as a regular directional input like any other special move, no one would have thought anything different.  The combos are also ridiculously easy to do, as they got rid of tight links that you'd see in any other fighting game.  Some might say this is a good thing, but I always respected good execution, or going for different combos in certain high-pressure situations.  Instead, you now have high-level Zangief players who mash for their links to connect (and it works), which is embarrassing for a competitive fighting game like Street Fighter.  Speaking of Zangief, Capcom really went out of their way to make him so bad in this game.  It's certainly possible to win with him, but you have to work so much harder than anyone else.  (I'm not a Zangief main, but it's just an observation)

I feel bad for anyone who buys this game that doesn't take it remotely seriously (basically if they button mash and just wanna have some fun for a little).  The single player mode is dreadfully bad, though it's never really been that great with the other SF games.  Story mode just came out, so that'll give it a little more spice.  Getting more colors for your character requires you to play through survival mode on different difficulties, which is a boring grind.  Unless you play online against other people, this game really offers nothing interesting for anyone to care about for the offline content.

This game is a rushed, incomplete fighter that should have been much better.  If they let USF4 ride out one more year while they carefully worked on SF5, I'd say the result could be a lot different.  It's a shame, because I was really hyped up for this game, but after trying to give it a chance multiple times, it's not fun.  Capcom said they may add changes to the character balance or game mechanics at the end of every year, so maybe things will turn around at that point.  However, the character balance is mostly fine.  It's the game mechanics that really make the game boring and not hype. No matter how excited you get for the next DLC character coming out, you always need to remember that they will still be restricted to the game mechanics.",1467310804,1468607634,FALSE,7,1,0.56349206,1,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.66E+16,358,6,2485,0,1012,1534730364

They can claim all they want that everything can be unlocked for free, but the system in place makes that an impossibility without grinding for thousands of hours.

The actual fighting system is a major step backwards. Everyone can agree Focus Attack was a mistake (and a shoddy knockoff of GG's Roman Cancel), but now there is a grand total of two defensive options that have any amount of reliability whatsoever. What is to be done when there is no counterplay once put on the defense? Nothing, apparently.

The graphics are nothing special.

The balancing is sort of there, at least, in the same way that Smash can be sort of considered balanced.

I guess if you like spamming throws and having only maybe 3 to 4 useful moves per character, this is the game for you. It also heavily favors 50/50s, 33/33/33s, and even 25/25/25/25s, so even the most unskilled players can crush people as long as they make their opponents guess wrong.

To start off, for anyone who Loves the series and is a very into the Tournaments seen, It's perfect as is.
But when It comes to Single Player content It comes up a little short in my opinion.

First there is no Arcade mode :/ It makes since because they skipped the Arcade phase, but It just doesn't feel the same with out it. 
Second, the Keybinding for Key Boards is offal, basicly every key registers as an controller's key input because of this you can not most keys on you Keyboard for Binding :/
Also, there is no VS CPU, the only way todo this is to go into Training mode and change some Settings.
Finally, there is no voice chat for Online Multiplayer, like in Ultra Street Fighter IV.

However I feel that lately CAPCOM has been working as hard as they ""can"" to fix and add much needed features into the Game. I'm pretty sure all/most of these Problems will be fixed soon (or that may just be my wishful thinking) Either way It's a good game at the moment, I just feel that It hasn't reached it's ""Full Potential"" yet.

Outside of that i really like the game and you should get it.

44,Street Fighter V,24300424,english,"A little background first:

The first fighting game I ever played was Tekken 2. That game kinda made me dislike fighting games in general for giving me the impression that fighting games in general are just chaotic button-masher games. Anyway, long after that I somehow ended up playing Street Fighter Alpha 3, which I immediately fell in love with for I was convinced that random button mashing was not a valid strategy in all fighting games and everything else was solid. After that completely outside the fighting game genre I got an interest in competitive multiplayer games, though I was slightly disgruntled that most of them were team-based and most one-on-one competitive games (like most RTS games) are just mind blowingly over-complicated for me. That's when my attention shifted back to fighting games.

Coincidentally me already being a Street Fighter fan I already had Street Fighter IV on steam, although I hadn't touched the online multiplayer yet in fear of me getting my ass handed to myself. Eventually I got bored of the singleplayer experience and logged online and getting my ass kicked was exactly what happened. Of course I knew I just had to get better in the game, but nonetheless over time I started to dislike certain properties of the game. Most noticeable ones being that the gameplay was way too fast-paced for my taste, grapple being somewhat overpowered and focus attack in general. In addition the difficulty curve was almost a straight wall and there was no skill-based matchmaking. Basically it was nearly impossible for new players to get into.


Then Street Fighter V came out...

I had a chance to play it over at a friend's house. Initial reaction was: ""It's like Street Fighter IV... but with none of the bad things. IT'S THE PERFECT FIGHTING GAME!""

There is simply very few things NOT worth praising. The gameplay is tight, mechanics are easy to learn, there's cross-platform compatibility IN ADDITION to skill-based matchmaking... and there's so much more.

Seriously, in case you're not that particularly interested in fighting games even if you are into competitive games this is a great game. It's straightforward, it has impeccable balance, it has no RNG and every mistake you make is ALWAYS your fault. Leaving this game without recommendation would simply be outrageous.

As a small heads up though, I did experience some performance difficulties with this game which essentially made it unplayable when I first started this game, although thankfully I got it fixed. Just make sure your graphics and ethernet drivers are up to date and you have a decent PC. I've heard talk you may run into issues nonetheless, but I won't speak for or against it on that matter.


TL;DR: Street Fighter V is the best fighting game and the best competitive game I've ever played.",1468433739,1468433739,TRUE,1,0,0.499575227,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.66E+16,245,9,27199,0,1025,1584821369
45,Street Fighter V,24291330,english,"So I Played Street Fighter V.

I always had a huge likeness for fighting games, starting way back when with Mortal Kombat 4 for ps1. As years went by I finally managed to get a Xbox360 for christmas, and with it came a copy of Street Fighter 4. I played the shit out of that game, 100% completing the single player stuff. I was a stupid little kid back then, so of course I mained Dan Hibki, but I still had a blast playing it. I was very excited for when they annouced Street Fighter V, as I had a history with the series. And hey, maybe now that I am older and stuff, maybe I'll be better at the game. Was I satisfied? I would definetely say so...but there is a lot of problems that I need to address. In order to say what I truly feel about this game, I will talk about every aspect of it, so thats a lot of reading, sorry about that. ALSO SPOLIERS FOR THE PLOT OF SSV BECAUSE I DONT WANT PEOPLE TO GET TRIGGERED.

The Gameplay
---------------
I think the gameplay is freaking awesome. I never played a fighting game that felt so tight with it's controls. When I lost a fight, I didn't blame lag or faulty inputs, cause I couldn't. The game controls very smoothly, with that classic Street Fighter gameplay that we all are used to. I still can't get the hang of charge characters, but that's more a problem with me sucking then the game. There is a play style for everybody, the average shoto, the tanky grappler, the agile annoyence, and charge characters-for people who like to hold the stick back and start wagglin like you were playing Resident Evil 4 while hopped up on cocaine. No characters feel under or overpowered, with each having their own unique fighting styles and weaknesses. Learning every character is vital to getting good at the game, but the game provides great tools for learning. Everything from a tutorial mode, command lists for every character avalible on the fly, and even a combo trial mode. The game mostly focuses on the multiplayer competitive aspect, and thus it gives you the proper tools to do so. I say the gameplay is spot on, and I can't find problems with it.

Online
-------
I honestly didn't play much of the online mode. I was too busy learning to play the characters, and doing the story bits. From what I have played, I do like it. People do complain about the bad netcode, but I didn't have that many problems with lag or desync. Granted, I didn't play many matches, so that could be the reason why. I do like the counters telling you how every person plays. It helps you devolp strategies and make for more competitive games. It also means you can't always use the same tatics, as it will show on your grid. From what I played, eh, it's alright.

Character Stories
------------------
As what was orginally the only story the game had, it was pretty lame. Every character only got like, 2-3 fights, and their stories were really bland. Oh, R.Mika is obsessed with Zangeif, cool. Oh, Ryu is trying to surpress that Satsui No Hado still, cool. Oh, Ken has a family, cool. Oh, Alex is dumb, cool. Oh, Sakura is here, coo....WAIT WHAT. Yea, this game has a huge fetish for rubbing characters you don't get to play as in your face. Karin fights Sakura as her ending, except you don't get to play that fight, cause Sakura isn't in the game. Alex fights holographs of E.Honda and that Oil guy from Super Street Fighter 4, except you don't get to play that fight. AND DECAPRE, DON'T EVEN GET ME STARTED ON DECAPRE! Yet at least. The game was released with these as the only story bits, which sucked, but as a way to try out every character, well, they could have done it a hell of a lot worse.

Season Pass
-------------
Fuck you Capcom. Fuck you. You lock Guile, Alex, Ibuki, Balrog, Juri, and Urien behind a fucking paywall, and don't expect me to get pissy about it. I hate when fighting game franchises take iconic characters out of a game, and make them paid DLC. I would get if these were characters nobody gave a shit about, BUT GUILE, ALEX, IBUKI, BALROG, JURI, AND URIEN.
HEY GUYS, LETS RELEASE A GAME THAT HAS A WAY LOWER ROSTER THAN RELEASE STREET FIGHTER 4, HELL EVEN STREET FIGHTER X TEKKEN, YA KNOW THE GAME THAT FIGHTING GAME FANS IGNORED, AND MAKE SOME KEY CHARACTERS LOCKED BEHIND A PAYWALL. GREAT IDEA! I MEAN, EVOLVE WAS DOING IT, AND LOOK WHERE THEY ARE NOW. YOU MEAN ABANDONED AND LEFT TO FUCKING DIE, BEFORE THEY MADE IT FREE TO PLAY AND SAID FUCK YOU TO THE PEOPLE WHO SUNK 95 BUCKS INTO IT AND IT'S SEASON PASSES? YEA! WHAT DO YOU SAY GUYS! HOOORAH! HOOORAH!......Ahem....sorry I needed to get that out of my sys....AND THEN LETS LEAVE THE CODE TO THE UNRELEASED CHARACTERS IN THE GAME SO THAT WE CAN MAKE A 1.8 GB PATCH SO PEOPLE WOULD STOP HACKING THE CHARACTERS INTO ONLINE FOR FREE.....sorry, I don't know what is happenin....BUT WHAT ABOUT STAGES AND COSTUMES? SHOULDN'T WE RELEASE THESE FOR FREE TO PEOPLE WHO OWN THE SEASON PASS? FUCK NO! WHO WOULD EVER DO THAT? KILLER INSTINCT? PAH! THEY DON'T KNOW HOW TO REALLY SCRAPE IN THE BUCKS!.....help me....please let it stop...

General Story: A Shadow Falls
--------------------------------
So after people bitched about how there wasn't any substantial single player content, Capcom caved in and released a true story mode. Behind a 7 GB Addon. That isn't much of a problem, I just hate waiting for an 8 GB update to download so I can start downloading my 7 GB update. That's just me though. Anyway, the story takes off after a lot of the character's personal stories, so you'll want to complete those before playing this. Rashid breaks into the Shadaloo Base to find his programmer friend mention in his story. He then beats up some guards, and slowly walks over to where she is, as she is literally melting due to poison. He gets beat up by F.A.N.G., and it cuts to Ryu asking Dhalsim to fight. The only reason I mentioned this part of the story is to show how to story bounces from one thing to another. So much is happening, and the game never can figure out what it wants to focus on. It makes following the story confusing, especially when random plot shit happens with no explaination. Oh, Ryu is at the Kanzuki Estate because he knew Necalli was gonna be there, and he knows this because he does, and he wants to fight Necalli so that he can fight the Satsui No Hado I guess. What. There are also a lot of scenes that don't make sense, or don't follow the rules that the game itself made. Karin gets a list of people who have the pieces to make the moons explode, she is then told by Guile that Shadaloo  also has this list and wants to find the people listed on it, even though the pieces have been stolen numerous times, and is constantly switching hands with people. The list is super unrelable, but by fucking luck shadaloo finds the two people who haven't gotten their pieces taken. The little hacker girl is being held against her will in a chair in the heart of Shadaloo's base, constantly being monitered by F.A.N.G. and M.Bison, yet still somehow gets a secret code to foil their plans to Rashid, without Bison or F.A.N.G. knowing. And it isn't a text, it's a full on voicemail. How did she even get Helen's or Rashid's number? At the end of the stroy, Rashid get's a call from his programmer friend congratulating him for saving the world, yet this person has been dead for a while now, and it is literally impossible for that call to have been made, as everything in the Shadaloo base FUCKING EXPLODED. These are a little bit of the huge amount of plot holes in the story. However, playing Street Fighter for the plot is like watching Saw for the plot. It makes no sense, constantly has luck based shit happen, and is very funny if not taken seriously. However, I like Saw in an ironic sort of way, so the story was right up my alley.

48,Street Fighter V,23077062,english,"So here's the deal. The game is getting better. The netcode is a million times better than it was at launch and right now far exceeds anything the sf4 netcode was ever capable of. As has been said a thousand times before, the competitive portion of the game itself is incredibly solid. There is a very good reason why this game is shattering attendance records at tournaments and events. The game is good, period.

So.... should you buy it?

If you like street fighter already, yes. If you want to get into competitive fighting games, also yes. However, outside of those two demographs there really isn't that much reason to pay the entry fee. Unlike blizzard games, or most mobas, street fighter is missing a compelling universe. If your into fantasy, story, characters, collecting stuff, or just about anything outside of winning there really isn't much here. People might say that sf4 is better in this respect, but they are wrong. Arcade mode is really the only thing that seperates the two in terms content beyond competition, and sfv just decided to split all the arcade mode content into two (significantly less interesting) forms. 

So the main weakness in street fighter v is the same weakness in the entire series. If you like street fighter you will love this game, if you don't like street fighter then this game will not change your mind: at least for now. Capcom has a reputation for long term support and multiple re-releases. So when the game is inevitably re released under a new name (as a free content update, that’s a promise the community would never forgive if broken), maybe then it will be worth a second look.",1463641152,1468386942,TRUE,1,1,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.66E+16,337,1,25571,0,10675,1598244042

Visuals, sound, tight controls, good fighting system, all things you expect from Street Fighter. But the lack of single player options from something as simple as an Arcade mode is inexplicable?

    The Story mode they added is a step in the right direction, but fights are 1 round and I feel like I am watching load screens and cut scenes much more than actual fighting. Also the AI here isn't very good. The character Story mode is even worse since its like 3 or 4 fights of 1 round fights? You get to watch art stills and load screens more than actual fighting?

1. More stable game (more fluid, faster loading & matchmaking)

3. Ok story mode
4. Majority online games is now playable (less teleporting etc)

However, still no keyboard rebinding (I'm using a fighstick now) and character/stages would require significant grinding with the games to obtain them (I personally get Ibuki and Balrog and Kanzuki beach with simple grinding). Get this if your machine could support it (my laptop barely able to run it) and get the proper skin/texture mod for the ladies : )

---- OLD REVIEW ----

Was tempted to buy pre-release with Chun Li battle costume; This was a mistake.

Do not buy this game yet until Capcom fix the all the problems.

1. No keyboard binding, I need to use AutoHotkey to rebind the default key to play/enjoy this game.
2. Online is unplayable.
3. All DLC are suppose to be using in game currency, not sure how this would translate cost per character. You do not want to grind through ways if it's not enjoyable; online sucks and survival mode is hard on normal and above.

The only thing I like about this game is that it reminds me of Street Fighter 2; simple and revolve more on normal attack (V trigger & V Skill). For me, USF4 is a bit hard to play with keyboard than this.

-------REVIEW STARTS HERE------

Previously to a casual audience I would have said no. And I have said no to several friends in buying street fighter 5. However that was in it's pre-June update state. As of the June update it has become a fully fledged fighting game with all the functions it lacked on release: A fully animated cinematic story mode, fully functioning store and trials for each individual character. However that's not to say it has finished in its improvements and street fighter still has to build atop what it already has to truly become where it should have been in it's glory on release day.

--Pros--

-A fully animated story mode
-A cast of very diverse characters (Design wise)
-A set of characters that have very different playstyles (All very fun to play)
-A well flushed out lab (training mode) 
-Possibly the easiest to get into iteration of street fighter yet (I think this is a good thing)
-Beautiful animations
-Dlc characters can be unlocked via in-game points (Fight money)
-Fight money is pretty much hand-fed to begin with via the character storys and general story
-The core of the game (mechanics) are incredibly well done smooth and work very well
-Capcom released character specific tutorial videos (On youtube)
-More DLC characters to come (I'm waiting for you Juri)

--Cons--

-No arcade mode
-Cannot do a single seperate match against a CPU
-Questionable way to give out colours via the survival mode
-Fight money is hard to come by past the previously mentioned story modes (Forces you to pick and choose and spend wisely or you will be grinding for a long time)
-Lack of punishment for ragequitters as far as I'm aware (However they are supposedly cracking down and banning them)
-Connection (For the most part my matches are quite nice when I say this I mean if I set the connection to 4-5 only why is it still occasionally giving me someone with a 2 bar connection to me?)
-Location (This is more of a personal one which has improved lately but for whatver reason I rarely play people from the UK or even Europe. I've probably played more Americans and Asians than I have people from Europe this can lead to connection issues but again has been improving)

--Anything I missed--

-Tutorial (Pretty generic stuff some conversation between Ken and Ryu that's about it)
-Stats (I'm not sure if it's just me I feel like it's not implemented properly as of yet)
-Access to replays of anyone you like (Pretty neat) 
-Misguiding names (I mean a small thing IMO but something like your favourite character being designated as your ""use for matches"" character)

--Final words--

So if your wondering why I used an anecdote to start off my review it was because I wanted to capture something and share what every game should be striving to do. Be fun. In the end what were games made to be? Fun. Fun for me is being able to tryhard and have a good match. I mean I lose all the time and I've been on tilt way more than once being serious about this game. But in tanking all those losses I've become better at the game and when I hit the sweet sensation of victory BANG it's all there. The rush that makes me love this game :) 

In the end it's up to you if you still want to play and buy the game. From my perspective Street FIghter 5 is an awesome game with a lot to offer (Now with the update) to both casuals and tryhards like myself. You can do whatever. You want to just play the game for the cutscenes and storymode? Sure play it and skip all the matches that come with the storymode. You want to become an elitist pro in the top 100 players? Sure hit up ranked and become an online warrior. You just like learning combos and making your character look awesome? Go for it training mode is for you. What I'm trying to say is despite all the crap it's been given (which it deserved) on release day I feel like it's redeemed itself (albeit roughly 4-5 months later) and missing out just because of those reviews is a waste. I still do reccomend waiting for a sale or something though :) Money is sparse nowadays.

PS. Sorry for how long this was 

TLDR: Pre-June update not worth, Now June update is here more worth

Knowing how Street Fighter works, once we get Super or Ultra this might improve:

The Good:

- Added cutscenes and an engaging storymode.
- Gameplay is far more smoother than SFIV.

The Bad:
- Extremely limited roster.
- I have to buy the new characters with in-game cash. Seriously? I bought the game give it to me already.
- Alternate Outfits are overpriced.

The Ugly:
- Had to install additional software to get my fightstick to be recognized in the game.

Original review: 

The game currently offers terrible value. 

They delayed the story mode of the game to summer and the character-stories that are in the game last 5 minutes each with ca. 3 fights and a few still-images. Seriously. There is currently no arcade mode. Or challenges. The tutorial is nothing but a button-check and explains nothing about the mechanics of the game. The movelists do not list any framedata and do not mention all properties of a move (such as armor or projectile invincibility).

The game also lacks polish. You can see glaring clipping problems with almost every model. Hair and chainst go through their own body. The game is not well optimized and you need to edit .ini files to tweak the game properly. There are no advanced graphics options. NO REBINDABLE KEYS! The game also does not support all peripherals that it should and even for PC fightsticks, you may need to install a work-around. The main menu is also a joke. There is tons of dead space and 20% of the actual menu is taken up by an image. If you are using a controller, you have to make your way around that image to get to the option you want. You cannot spontanuously decide which character to pick, you have to pick it beroe even starting the match-search. 

If you can see past all of that and only care for online, the game has some terrible disconnection problems currently. The worst part of that is that you can't even waste your time with the story mode because you won't be able to earn fightmoney, the in-game currency while offline. So you lose out on currency which you could later spend on characters. Oh, the online store is also still unavailable. 

IF you can connect to the server, you won't be happy with the lobby system which currently only supports 2 players, making a lobby almost pointless. 

The downtime between matches is way too long. When it finds a game, you will be taken through SEVERAL loading screens, from the overly long ""Match Found"" to black to the character select (where won't selevt your fighter, you need to do that in the menu beforehand lol) to white and THEN to the match. After the match, you have to watch an animation and then wait for every point to be added to each profile. Then black, then back to the menu. It is insane.

Now, for those who keep bringing up the argument that we should ignore offline content and not expect a story from a fighting game, please check the other games of the genre released within the last few years. 
MKX may have been a disappointment in many respects but it still has tons of content. Hours of cinematic story, daily/weekly/monthly towers with unique modifiers, the crypt, arcade, challenges like Test Your Might and party modes like Test Your Luck.It even had more online modes like King of the Hill. 
Guilty Gear Xrd has an expansive tutorial which does not only explain buttons and the basics of fighting games but teaches you every mechanic in the game. It even introduces option selects in the tutorial. That game also has tons of offline content such as a story for every character AND a story-mode. It also has Trials etc. 

Fanboys will say ""But SFV will build up on this!""
Killer Instinct which will also come to PC with crossplatform play released with little content initially BUT it didn't ask for full price, it was only 20 bucks! And that game fullfilled that promise later on with a MUCH lower investment on the consumer side. 


At this stage of the game's lifespan, I CANNOT recommend it. At all. If offers virtually nothing for the full pricetag and it is obvious Capcop rushed this game out so it will be present for Capcom Cup. 

They shipped an incomplete game and want to make you believe that we should be thankful the rest will be free. We already payed for all that content, they simply delayed it and shipped an Early Access version of the full game.",1455650150,1467909683,FALSE,3,0,0.516129076,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.66E+16,254,22,6272,0,3723,1584397647

73,Street Fighter V,24117496,english,"SF5 is my first street fighter i ever bought and to be honest, its allright.
As a regular player of Killer instinct on pc, a few things are missing in SF5.
First, in training mode no way to see the hitboxes. Why? That would help to see which attack that can make overhead, cross up and to see the extent of your attacks.
Second of all, no arcade mode. Like....really? there is a survival mode wich is allright but you don't have your typical 3 rounds match in survival. When you loose in survival, you go to the bottom and depending on the difficulty choosen it can get to 50 rounds and more.
Thirdly, there is not a lot of character or stage when you buy the game.Only 16 character and 8 stages.You can unlock additionnal character via Fight money wich is in game currency that you can win by winning online matches. All get to that later.
Finally the tutorial is reaaaalllllly basic stuff. If you whant the advanced stuff or how combo works, you'll have to go online wich is a little bit stupid. Fifth game in the itteration and they can't have that in there game. A bit dissapointing but hey, thats fighting game for you.

But, there is good stuff in the game. What i found really awesome is that you can search a match online while doing something else like, doing survival mode, training,etc. Really cool stuff. You also have character tutorials wich teaches you the basic combo from each character wich was ,for me as a SF noob, really neat. The game is responsive, fluid and well optimize. Landing a combo is satisfaying as F**** and really addiciting. The core of the gameplay is extremely solid and have absolutly no complain there.

You can also get every realased and future character with in game money that you win by doing online matches and the training/survival. However, a character cost 100 000 Fight money and winning a ranked match gives you 50. You need to win 2000 MATCH TO GET A CHARACTER!!!!! A bit overhelming if you ask me.

My advise, wait for it to drop price to like 40 $ and use 20 $ to get every character/stage/costume you whant. Thats what i did and i got the value of a full price game. If its 60$ or more , it ain't worth the money.

79,Street Fighter V,24106270,english,"To preface this, the game has legitimate concerns. Dinput, and questionable on again off again netcode. But on the other hand, you have kinda dumb complaints that kinda throw this game iillegitimately into the mixed category, the two big proponents of this being:

1. Muh story mode. It doesent matter which way people put it, the story mode is always going to be the after thought of a fighting game, the clues in the genre, its simply not in the core design philosphy. So while criticism for its exclusion is obv valid, its very overstated,

2. B-but why did I pay full price for a Beta! Yes, yes, I get it, the lack of content is a bad thing. But heres the thing, half of the things people complain are missing they were told about. If people are going to pay full price there and then when its clearly missing the features they want instead of waiting, the buck stops with you, you were told. YOU made the decision.

so now that I've got why you should take reviews with a grain of salt out the way. Heres the good things about the game, the fighting game core design, is very good, Gameplay, Graphics, character variation, depth in mechanics, the V system is really good and unlocks a new layer to every character. 

Game is simple enough to pick up, but isnt a bad thing as people make out to be, good players will still be good and little jimmy down the road wont body Daigo because the game gives him some sort of imaginary hand out.

The netcode while in a bad state and a VERY legitimate complaint, isnt as bad as stated, as I said, it is on again off again, if you have a good connection and set the right settings (use the network fight request in the menu or training mode, 5 only, ask for confirmation so you can see the bars, and/or limit hardware to PC) you're going to more often than not find a decent match, but you ARE however inevitably going to come across a bad one which needs to be fixed, and thats ok, do your best, dont go for the rematch, and move on. Its at least consietent enough you can climb steadily up the leagues.

TL:DR: game is overall good, it will get better hopefully, somke compaints are looking at the wrong things so while it does deserve criticism the game does seem to ve getting more than it actually deserves, SFV is the game you should pick up if you are new, its got the tools to teach you and the streamlined mechanics and gameplay design that makes it easier to enter than the past games.",1467715477,1467715925,TRUE,8,2,0.588952482,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.66E+16,303,1,30354,0,13105,1597513057

81,Street Fighter V,24103381,english,"Now that all the crucial components promised are already out, this is the HONEST review.

GRAPHICS
+1 light rendering, as is expected from Unreal Engine 4, currently the best techniques in the industry
+1 character models
+1 high quality textures
+1 interface is easy to use
-1 hair and clothes meshes often clip
-1 some stages have low texture quality
-1  some background NPCs animate in lower FPS than 

SOUND
+1 less focus on electronic/synthesized music and more actual instruments used
+1 more variety and uniqueness while still staying true to character(ie. Guile's prog-rock/jazz arrange)
+1 music pumps people up, from intro, to menu, to character themes
+1 Japanese dub has more hits than misses
-1 certain stage-specific themes are trash tier
-1 English dub has more misses than hits. Too much improv by VAs when compared to Japanese

BASE GAMEPLAY SYSTEM
+1 quite balanced for a game that skipped arcade release
+1 each character has more distinct playstyles to one another, compared to previous games(Ryu and Ken is now truly night and day)
+1 more lenient execution frametime and focus on footsies allow for fights on a more fundamental level while reducing physical restraints, although mastering the system is still not easy.
+1 FADC system has been replaced by V-trigger system, making excessive offense less safe. 
-1 game has seemingly dev-implemented minus-8 frames of lag, which makes certain characters frustrating to use(ie. Zangief)

NETWORK PLAY
*needs mentioning* game deals with lag not by increasing time between input and on-screen execution(SFIV), but by warping the situation back to when it was executed. Some prefer it, some are indifferent, others hated it. If your connection is good, chances are you won't see it. Too neutral to be given or deduced points for.

+1 it works, to an extent
+1 Ranking system starts easy, but requires more points to reach higher leagues, and losing as higher league against lower league makes you lose a lot of point. Keeping rankings legit with less frauds and one-trick ponies while giving less room for boosters to breeze their way up... if there isn't another way to cheat it.
-1 overall server functions are still flawed as of this writing. Errors often occur after matches end; most of the time, your points will be correctly added or deducted later, but sometimes it doesn't register. 

even basic connectivity is still compromised during long survival modes, as many people still struggle to finish Survival mode without disconnecting and having to restart(this is important because Survival mode needs to be played while online to obtain in-game money for unlocks)

lastly, the statistics only half works. You need to depend on external sites like vleague.pro for extra data crunching, which is a shame.

-1 match filtering options are too small, and some of them do not even work. 5 bar connections may sometimes feel like 3, depending on your location and ISP.

-1 Rage Quitting, or the act of quitting the game/disconnecting/unplugging the Ethernet cable shortly after 'KO' is announced to prevent the game from properly registering your loss and deducting your points, is still rampant. The current punishment system implemented failed to prevent this trend as it is still too lenient and certain regions are filled with people who do this on instinct.

OTHERS
+1 essential game components such as characters and stages are all unlockable by in-game money alone, which can be obtained by finishing the single-player contents or fulfilling certain requirements. The only content locked with real money so far are 'premium' costumes for each character. Just be careful not to spend your Fight Money too much on colors and titles

+1 Training mode is the most in-depth it has ever been in a Street Fighter game. Plenty of options to customize your training setup needs and one-button position resets. You can tell that the professional players had a lot of input in this one. 

+2 arcade mode doesn't exist, but they are now streamlined into 'Survival mode', 'Character Story' and 'General Story'. You will fight a bunch of CPU characters in all of these modes, although Survival focuses solely on fighting, and the story modes only give 1-round matches while unveiling the drama. These in themselves are good things, however...

-1 Survival mode is very grind heavy. While common CPU difficulty spikes are usual stuff for fighting games, they get ridiculously cheap in later stages on Normal and above. You will not learn anything useful for fighting human opponents as defeating them requires you to be cheap as well.

And while completing Survival mode unlocks new alternate colors for free, you will have to do this for EVERY costume set(DEFAULT, STORY and PREMIUM), including the costumes you paid with real money.

-1 character stories and general story are poorly written. The Shadow Falls story had its moments, but it clashed with too many plotlines established by previous games. Some things also do not make sense, even considering SF's comical nature. Expect upsets if you want to see longtime characters getting their shining moment here.

-1 stage transitions; which shows your characters transitioning from one stage to another, or crushing into background objects after a round defeat, is still limited to the China stage. They promised us this, yet fail to deliver them all despite development screenshots and data minings showed they had all this set up for other stages too, yet still nothing after over 4 months.

TECHNICALITIES
+1 game is optimized well enough to be played either with a cheap laptop sporting modern integrated Intel GPU to the big boys using high end stuff
-1 high amount of animation and richer movements demand more CPU power. You may need CPUs that are better than 2-core/4-thread low-end CPUs for Network play.
-1 certain issues with resolution may cause minimal stutter and lag at resolutions lower than 1080p on certain systems.
-1 after more than 4 months, still no Direct Input support, requiring you to use third party software to use anything other than the X Box controller
-1 keyboard controls are still not fully customizable

SCORE SUM = 18/34 (>50%, RECOMMENDED, with caution)

Summary: The game has good stuff, and some of its bad stuff can be fixed using external means, but those coming from SFIV series and wanted more of THAT, those expecting deeper storylines, or people that have very low patience for online play issues may want to avoid this.

Game is really good, my favourite fighting game was SF3rd strike but i learned to love this one. 
It has it's problems though

Pros:
-Game is very fun, i feel it a little more aggressive-wise than the previous one. I can't go very deeply but i feel every character feels - plays quite different.
-Characters are great. They're all fun to play and their designs look great. It's the first time i have the problem that i like everyone (because i can't decide which one to learn)
-Art style is great, they ditched the overly exaggerated cartoony style for a more realistic one (while mantaining it's fantasy style). Women look great (aside from being overly sexualized), just compare the body between sf4 and sfv's cammy.
-Story mode. Wait, don't punch me!. I think that having a story mode helps you love the characters. While not being even good, it helps to like them.
-Fightmoney is an incentive to keep playing, you don't earn almost nothing, but it's like studying 10 minutes and eating a candy, it helps.
-I live in Argentina, and usually my connection sucks (in sfiv i had problems with players from NA or EU, here i still have them but very very very reduced). To me, at least, netcoe is way better than what i expected

Cons
-Story mode (even with the update). It sucks, the cinematics are good but it doesn't make sense at all and it made me dislike characters i previously liked (and like others). 
-Long lodaing times
-No arcade mode : Ok, half of the players think that it's worthless because the game is supposed to be Multiplayer. But to me it's a must. If you have bad internet connection because reasons you can't enjoy the game. You can go to story mode (the old one you can go perfect without even looking at the screen, the new one doesn't allow you to choose characters) or survival that can be a pain if you want constant dificulty. To me this one is the most important con, the one that keeps me from LOVING the game.
-Dlc is overpriced to the point that it's insulting (while you don't really need to buy it)
-Slowmo-crashes depending on your pc (if you have wacom drivers or virtual keyboard you might want to turn them off or it'll crash randomnly), i can't even play on training stage because it goes slowmo 90% of the times.


I love this game, keep in mind that it has been released as a work in progress. i didn't mind because we all knew we were buying it and that it's getting patched. If you want to enjoy a fighting game online, this is the one i'd go. It's fresh, it's nice, it's easy to pick, tears to master.

Wait scratch that, I would, depending on what you want. Because man do I find the gameplay fun, and the visuals attractive. 

The game is pretty, plays well online and offline, and is really fun to learn and play. It might be a bit incomplete at face value in terms of single-player content, but if you take the time to explore the diverse cast of 16 characters, you'll see that you'll have a lot of time to do solo stuff. But let's face it, playing with other people is where this game shines, and that experience is amazing with friends, or against people online. Plus, free content is planned to be release regularly during the game's lifetime which the developers say will be quite a number of years from now.

At launch, a few days ago, it would have been harder to recommend, but ""Crapcom"" is actively listening and responding to fans both on PC and PS4, so I trust that their support in the coming days, months, and years will help make the roughly 60$ purchase justified. They've already fixed a lot of the initial connection issues and finding a match online is quick, and playing online is a joy. It's not a bad buy. If you're willing to put your faith in Capcom, as hard as it may sound, you might just end up with one of the finest fighting game experiences ever made, as well as help build the community for even more fun.

UPDATE: After 87+hours into the game, 4 characters, some stages, story mode, trials etc... 

I think this game is now most definitely worth it for people.

Even in the single player aspect. For people who like challenges, Survival mode is actually good (NO IT IS NOT CHEAP AND IMPOSSIBLE TO WIN). Yes it can be frustrating at times, but look at Dark Souls, Darkest Dungeon, and those kinds of games. You lose and learn from your mistakes. Then try and try again to unlock all that fight money for characters and costumes. For story-driven people, the story mode here is... okay. It's entertaining enough to go through, and nets you a ton of Fight Money. 

If you think this game doesn't have value, you're wrong. Capcom is not cheating you out of the money you'll spend on it. 

I put my faith into this game even before launch, and so far I'm satisfied with their service, despite a few hiccups here and there.

Season pass + game ($80 retail, $60 with steam discount) grants you the extra characters that they will ""eventually"" release (so far they have announced ~8 and released 4 to the initial roster of 16) and that's it. Without season pass the amount of grind you have to do to buy the characters is considerable.

They now added the cinematic story mode which is about 2-3 hours of entertainment. it is fun. Worth $10-15 of the price (it is free). It is a step in the good direction for Capcom.

You will have to buy costumes with fight money or real money. You cannot buy ALL costumes with fight money (some are premium and currently only purchasable with real money -- and this is bad!). Very few stages, (8 maybe) and they have released a couple more -- one of them a daylight version of an existing one -- that you will need to spend currency on to get.

And all their 3D models clip :( but that's a minor annoyance.

22,Street Fighter V,24023919,english,"Street Fighter V has kept my attention for the past 2 or 3 months with ease.. and that was just the bare bones fighting system with some characters.  Now there is a story mode that is actually well put together and entertaining and the ladder matches me with similarly ranked opponents?

This was my first serious fighting game and the community really did a good job at pulling me in.  It really has this friendly atmosphere where players are taking jabs at each other one second and then cheering the next.  Wednesday Night Fights weekly makes me cheer for russian dudes in their underwear 69ing in the air before getting pounded hard right into the ground.

What I love about the game is it is challenging.  You have to think about what your opponent is doing and you have to counter it.  You may even play mindgames with your opponent to get them to open up.  You have to practice your combos, learn your characters normals, and work your way around problems that other games seem to solve for you.  Each fight is exciting.. and the fight after that fight is more exciting because they just figured out what you were doing and you have to change it up or lose the entire set.

Even the fact that my friend beats my ass 70 times a night in a private battle lounge is a good thing because we're both getting better.  Sometimes I double down on losses and say if I win, it counts as more.. and then I have 140 losses.  This game tears us apart and then glues us together.. and the glue is made of pure hatred.   It doesn't matter that during the fight a fire is burning in my chest.  It wells up inside of me for hours.  I try to sleep and I dream about it.  It doesn't matter if I go to work and all I can see is blinding flashes of light as Chun-Li kicks me in the face with her big ass legs.  All that matters is that I kill my friend.  And I can't kill him while he's sleeping or while his back is turned.  It wouldn't be satisfying.  I have to crush him from the front, repeatedly.  I want to destroy him physically, emotionally, and spiritually.  And for that, I need to practice and learn and adapt.

--

Do you like competitive fighting games? If yes, stop reading and buy Street Fighter V.

If you play fighting games sparringly (heh), consider waiting. This game is not worth it for anyone who isn't going to pour in a lot of hours of practice to play competitively. The single player content is boring and lacking. There's two story modes which are nothing more than lore with 1 round fights between two random characters you may or may not know how to use. 

The new story mode is a joke. It's essentially a short film made using the in-game engine which looks passable. What is not however is the completely nonsensical story with equally bad writing with some seriously cringeworthy moments.    

There's an awful survival mode which should be avoided. 

There's no single player way to unlock all the content. If you're a completionist, this game will require hours of winning in online play in order to aquire all the content. 

With all that being said, if you play a fighting game to battle against a human opponent, SFV is a masterpeice. The gameplay is tight and the characters are varied and balanced. Fights are filled with intense moments, layered between theories of combat from various mindsets of your opponent. 

Capcom is done with releasing new iterations now, no more Super, Turbo, Championship editions. All new content is delivered to the base game.

Balrog and Ibuki added to the rooster, nice. But is it enough for any fan of the series? No, because of the price and in game purchases. The latest story mode, personally I would have it as a VN than to play 1 round and see cutscene, loading see cutscene, fight 1 round, loading...
I really hate this story mode, it's not making want to play the game, but avoiding it. As for the shop added some new skins and some stages. It makes those whom bought the season pass like complete fools. You can buy the new characters/stages/skins with the in-game fight money.
What the season do is just unlock the new characters with 1 set of skin each. The cost of the season pass? You could buy something better or stay away from the game. This is totally the worst game from Capcom telling you I want your cash!

31,Street Fighter V,24019338,english,"This game had a lot of problems at launch which I would say make it not worth the $60 price tag. Over the last few months Capcom has done an amazing job fixing a lot of these issues. Now that the netcode has been greatly improved and there is now more content in the game beyond online multiplayer I would say it is worth $60 if you want to get into fighting games. I myself never was into fighting games but SFV has changed that. This game is much more approachable than almost any other fighting game. This is largely because the combos are easier to pull off than they were in SF4. 

They have a Challenge mode in the game now where you can learn some basic combos for each character, but you still will have to go online to find some more advanced techniques. If you are new to fighting games or Street Fighter I would recommend looking at Gief's Gym on the SF subreddit. It will teach to a lot of basics and some advanced stuff that will definitely get you past the novice stage.

If you have a fightstick or are considering getting one to play this game (though you do not in any way need a fightstick to be good) you may have to use a third party program (Joy2Key or x360ce) to make it work properly. Its pretty easy to set up but it can be a minor annoyance. 

One of the worst parts about the game is Survival Mode where you face off against AI in a bunch of matches in order to get Fight Money (to unlock characters, stages, colors, etc) as well as the first 10 colors for a character. The AI is extremely frustrating to play against and it takes a lot of time to get through it even if you don't lose on one of the later rounds. Luckily for us PC players, there are mods that will make this mode very easy and fast so should you decide to use that mod it will make getting the colors a piece of cake plus lots of Fight Money. Capcom has stated that they support PC players using mods and as such nobody has or will be banned for using this mod (or any other mod). 

Overall, this game is worth a buy now. $60 is still a bit steep but this game will continue to be supported for years to come so over time it will only get better. If you are looking to give fighting games a try, this is definitely the one that will have you hooked. While there are still some issues with the game, Capcom recently has been fixing a lot of stuff so I would expect to see most of the current issues disappear as time goes on. As I write this review the game is on sale for $40. At this price point or any lower it is 100% a good purchase. The season's pass is worth it but I would recommend not buying it until it goes on sale or if you really are interested in the DLC characters/ the premium costumes that they include in the season's pass.

Even though I loved the game on its release and up until this point, I would not have recommended it to someone who is new to fighting games.

However, the crux of the game remains its multiplayer aspect. This is mostly a game for people who want to improve their skills in a competitive environment, but compared to other fighting games it does have a lower technical barrier of entry, allowing you to focus more on your strategies and less on advanced combos and other forms of difficult execution.

44,Street Fighter V,22974639,english,"Once again, Capcom comes out with great core gameplay, a game you really want to play because of how well it plays only to botch literally everything else about it.

Do we even need to talk about singleplayer content? Probably not, for 60 dollars it has literally nothing in terms of singleplayer content. I highly doubt much will change with the cinematic free dlc coming in June. Absolutely unacceptable for a 60 dollar game, especially for people who don't play fighting games for the competative aspects.

Now the crux and the biggest complaint with this game.
This game has some of the worst programming I've ever witnessed. In a game that really requires stable connections and good netcode to even function (like most twitch games), they really dropped the ball. In a world were they easily could have licensed a version of GGPO3 (which works really good with Rising Thunder another 2½D fighting game) but instead opted for their very own netcode. Huge mistake. 
We left the old delay based netcode and finally entered the rollback based netcode, but in return we get some half assed product that have some of the dumbest decision making ever. They went out of their way to literally let the lag in a game be burdened by the person with the best computer/connection creating what most people by now know as one sided rollback. I dont know what they were thinking but they thought wrong.
The netcode suffers from other kinks, like extreme rollback from people that are just the street over which makes literally no sense. This type of rollback has also made it fairly impossible to play with people/friends across continents as you can not set a specific delay and it will just rollback really hard.
Its not good.

The matchmaking is pretty much not working. Capcom (geniuses that they are) decided to mimic League of Legends more rank based matchmaking, because everyone knows you should always just copy whatever is most popular/makes most money currently. It just doesnt work. The rank is useless as the game will still put you up with whoever is most available.
There doesnt seem to be much hidden MMR (or ELO) and LP (the in-game point system) doesnt matter at all, just like the ranks dont.

There is three different ways to play online. Ranked, Casual and Battlelounge. Ranked and Casual are just matchmaked (ie just sitting in que waiting for the game to pair you with someone to play with), but battlelounge is a game the player creates and people can join. This works the same as endless lobbies in SF4. At times it makes sense to play lounges because you might want to learn a new character but not play people who are ""really trying"", well lounges isnt the answer. For some reason Capcom have gone out of their way to make sure you cant play them. 
When searching for lounges it will pop up a list of available games, the problem? The ping bars (which indicates how good of a connection you have to said person) load forever and 95% of them will never show up. 
No worries one might think because you can also see what country the lounge starter is from and in that sense be able to pick and play a lobby via that to ensure less lag. No, because flags simply wont show up and will just show the usual ""SFV"" flag. The only thing that shows up properly is the rank of the player who made the lounge, but what good is this when I have no idea if he is from China, the US, Brazil or whatever else I know for certain I cant play with? It's basically a crap shoot of joining a lobby, then leaving because they're from a continent you cant play with and then trying again, but as salt in your eyes Capcom have done such a poor work at the programming that you will get stuck on black screens of loading and other error messages leaving out of lounges which makes this whole procedure extremely annoying and not worth the time.

Now for the social aspects. What is there to say? For a game that thrives on community interaction they've made sure you can't communicate with anyone. This time around there is no friends list, only a ""rival list"". It's sort of like a friendslist but you cant talk to them, only send them invites. This means if you want to interact with other players you have use external sources to make that happen. I guess they were scared people would use a messaging system to talk shit to people, but thats honestly a dumb decision considering if you make a decent friends list with decent features (only friends cant messages me) it wouldnt be a problem. There is literally no steam integration into that game as Capcom decided to use their own platform so you can not invite friends over steam like pretty much any other game. 

Capcom has once again went out of their way to make a barebone experience that while the core game is fantastic, the surrounding parts are complete garbage. This game needs some serious Quality of Life changes to be sure to survive in the future. The only sad part is that games that really do well in the core gameplay AND in the features department cant hold no candle because it simply isnt Street Fighter. I think it's time the Street Fighter name and Capcom take a hit to their credibility if only to show this isnt acceptable for a 60 dollar game.

All of this culminates in what I can only explain as frustrations with the developer. They havent acknowledged almost any of the things pointed out above. Instead, just silence, with the monthly update on how hype we should be about the newest character coming. I'd rather have no more characters and a functioning game instead. Capcom is a developer with a bunch of great IPs but are a bunch of greedy suits trying to put out the least amount of effort in return for the max amount of money. 

I dont recommend this game, but I'll continue playing it because it is Street Fighter, which is quite sad.

EDIT July 2nd:
While the new content patch should satisfy a lot of the more casual players of this game (this game actually has singleplayer content now), the game is still plagued with underlying basic problems. The battlelounge searching is still not working (wont show flags/ping/bars/anything) and the one sided rollback netcode fubble is still in effect and still hasnt even been acknowledged by Capcom.

I appriciate the new characters, they're fun and all but at the same time it's more important for me that the game works.

Pros
- The core gameplay is rather fun
- combos are easier making it more inviting to the casual player to get invested
- The roster size is decent and all the characters are pretty dam cool
- the story mode is off decent length and gives some nice single player content
- all dlc characters can be earned with in game money
- all updates are free so no super sfv etc.
- the game looks quite nice

Cons
- No Direct input controller support still (need to use a work around like x360ce)
- no keyboard remapping
- matchmaking takes too long
- rage quitting from online matches is not punished well enough
- from a competitive stand point there is 8 frames of delay which affect many aspects of the game at high level
- servers do play up quite a bit
- rather long maintenence times when the servers go down

-- Even with the ""Season Pass"", you're not eligible to all of the DLC released this ""season."" 
-- You can buy ""Premium"" costumes for $4 USD a pop (ya'know, things that used to be free to unlock through playing the game?)

- The Story Mode writing is Ultra-Cringeworthy. Maybe it was the localisation? Whatever the case, the dialogue was attrocious and there are scenarios that actually made me laugh out loud:
-- Cammy fights ""Peter"" the cop.
-- Cammy pulls a giant, wrapped package out of her arse...literally.

- There is still no Arcade Mode - that's a basic component of EVERY fighting game since the original Street Fighter (Capcom dropped the ball) 

- Online matchmaking is attrocious.
-- Not only do matches take several minutes to find, there's a high likelhood of getting dropped when the game finally finds someone (forcing it to start again).
-- Ping/Connection doesn't seem to be a component of the matchmaking criteria. Get used to lagfests.

Thankfully, due to the recent update, Street Fighter V has a little more to offer in the form of the cinematic story mode, new characters, costumes and stages.

Unfortunately it's still lacking an arcade mode and a way to fight against an AI opponent of choice. But hopefully capcom will provide those in future updates. So if you are looking for a casual single player experience you might only want to pick this up on sale. 

But if you are willing to take the plunge into the more competitive side of things you're in for one of the best fighting games  to date.

[list]
[*]The game is very well balanced.
[*]The online netcode is great 85% of the time in my experience but if it does go bad it can get ugly real quick.
[*]The characters are fun and easy to learn yet hard to master.
[*]A very robust training mode
[*]Good matchmaking. It takes about a minute for me to find a match.
[*]Cross play form play between PC and PS4 so there is only one online community.
[*]Best out of three on online games. Making a comeback from the fourth round feels hella good.
[*]Yearly balance updates. Yes, just yearly. Because in the long run things that seem broken now may end up not so broken when people figure out how to deal with it.
[*]Free balance updates. Yes kids, until recently, if you wanted an updated version of a fighting game, you had to buy the entire thing again. Praise be.
[/list]

There are a few drawbacks though.

[list]
[*]It's still lacking single player content. This will hopefully get better.
[*]Ragequitters are still an issue but has been acknowledged by capcom.
[*]8 frames of input lag. In comparison sf4 had only 5 frames of input lag. (Which means it's a tiny bit more sluggish)
[*]Capcom not communicating very well with their fans. Although they are doing much better nowadays.
[*]No native support for arcade sticks which don't use XInput
[*]Training mode options don't save.

This game will only get better in time. They have promised to support this game for the coming 5 years with new characters, stages, cosumes, game modes, balancing and more.

97,Street Fighter V,23963206,english,"To begin this review, I would like to start off by saying that I am a tad biased as I have been a huge fan of the Steet Fighter games before this new iteration and am an avid supporter of the Fighting Game Community (FGC). I love fighting games and I have played most modern fighters (Street Fighter, Tekken, Smash 4, etc) in an effort to become well-trained and to, as the community so eloquently puts it, ""git gud."" 

All of this being said, I cannot, just [b]cannot[/b] recommend this game to anyone who is a casual player. 

Street Fighter V, upon its initial release, lacked little to no content for roping in a new casual playerbase. That's strange considering that that was one of their main goals with SFV. Capcom wanted to bring in new players, competitive or not, to produce mass sales for the game and also perhaps expose the general public to fighting game tournaments as well. Those who weren't really interested in the competitive scene could slowly be introduced to Capcom Pro Tour (CPT) and perhaps even be molded to be competitive players. Capcom failed to do this, however, by not even giving the simplest of features such as CPU versus or even the classic arcade mode. 

Every other aspect that recognizes the competitiveness of the game is completely fine and actually very well-made. The netplay can be a little wonky here and there, but other than that returning cast members have been reimagined in unique and exciting ways while some stayed pretty much the same. New original characters are fun and not too overbearing. And with future DLC characters, the roster is ever-expanding for at least the next few years.

All of this being said, I can't bring my heart to recommend this game to anyone who isn't looking to be competitive no matter how much time I put into it. The release was a mess and Capcom, almost 5 months later, are just now getting around to adding some solo modes to the game, including the story mode. There's also the lack of communication on their end (and in their defense they have gotten better at it), but I don't really blame them for that. That's more of a part of Japanese culture when it comes to video games, it seems. 

Overall, for competitive players, the game is probably a solid 8/10. For casual players, I can't even really give it a score. All I can say is to stay away and give it a proper year or so to develop, maybe even just look for it when there's a price drop or a sale.

I recommend this game highly... because I don't care about things like ""story mode"" or ""arcade mode."" If you DO care about those things, there are other fighting games available to you.

The main problem was that it was lacking in A LOT of content, and honestly even I (who is a huge fan of the franchise) could not stomach the AAA price point when it was released. And to make matters worse, MOST people didn't even know that the game was going to be so bare bones at launch, only for content to be regularly patched in over the next coming months. Thusly creating a whirling dervish of negative reviews and passionate fans that felt cheated by the very thing they loved most... Street Fighter.

But that was then... and this is today. The current state of the game is amazing and only getting better. Match making isn't perfect... but it's MUCH better than it used to be, and the roster is solid as hell and only growing month by month...

I can not stress this enough... this is THE BEST. THE TOP TIER FIGHTING GAME OUT THERE. PERIOD. The amount of depth to the game is mindblowing... and I have completely lost any spare time to constantly thinking about moves, techniques and tactics every single day... and I'm only practicing with ONE character.

The game is in a GREAT state right now, and only getting better, and the community surrounding the game and professional scene is sensational.

Don't get me wrong... there IS stuff to complain about still, I understand this. BUT, there is no way that this game's current few short comings over shadow how fantastic and deep a fighting game this is.

If you're looking for a competitive fighting game with good multiplayer (online), this is it. Just make sure when you search for an opponent you select level 5 connection only, as frames drop exponentially if the connection falters for even a little bit. You should be good as long as you have a good connection and search for an opponent that is 5 bars, there are plenty for me as I live in Southern California.

If you want to start getting into fighting games but you're intimidated by the competition, this would be a good game to test out if fighting games are for you. This iteration is definitely more beginner friendly as far as comboing goes, and they made links more forgiving as well. From the perspective of someone that bought this game looking to play competitive multiplayer it definitely met all of my expectations. 

The only downside to the competitive play is that there are quite a few people that ragequit before they lose to preserve their LP (league points), which seems like it would be easily fixed. Low priority matchmaking or loss of LP could easily be implemented, but I'm not sure what Capcom's stance on this is, as SF4 never had anything in place to prevent people from ragequitting.

First of all, knowing that SFV will continue to get attention, polish, and content in the future makes me feel like this was a great investment. The characters are all different and interesting to play, the music is awesome, and the game looks absolutley gorgeous at max settings. On the topic of input lag, it's true that it plays a little differently from USF4 but if I could adapt in a matter of ten minutes, then anyone else can; not to mention once you get a feel for the game, it controls like a dream. The V-System is great and the combat feels the best it has for a long time. I could care less about Arcade because Survival is better; the supplement system is pretty neat and this mode allows you to practice against moving, attacking targets (pretty much what everyone used Arcade for anyways). The stories kinda blow, I know, but some previews for the cinematic are out now and it looks goddamn spectacular so get hype for that. The netcode is fine, as long as you have a reliable internet source.

     First off, if you're playing this for a single player experience you're in for a huge disappointment.  The current story mode allows you to pick one of the cast and play a few mindless battles puntucated by boring cutscenes that offer little in the way of depth or even clarity.  Purportedly an updated Story mode is to be released soon but new cast members were supposed to be added every month and we saw how that hasn't quite worked out. Ergo don't hold your breath.
      Next if you're primarily intersted in the multiplayer experience like myself you will probably be frustrated as well.  As of the most recent patch the match making system seems to have been reblanced quite nicely for Ranked Play from the previous iteration of having to fight against players of vastly disparate rankings from your own.  This seems to have been done however a the cost of stable connections.  If you've read much about SFV you are probably aware that the net code for the game is attrocious and this recent patch does not seem to have done much in the way of fixing this.   Add on top of this the meager penalty that is currently in place to prevent rage quitting from matches does little to nothing to deter players from abandoning games even after a loss to negate both point loss to them and point gain to you.  The combination of the two can and does create a highly frustrating state of play that only seems to escalate at higher ranked play.
     Lastly, it's impossible to communicate with the player base on any social level other than prefabricated text lines in Battle Lounges.  Nothing substantive can be expressed as the lines are simply ""GG"" or ""Potato!"".  
     The bottom line is the game is enjoyable but it certainly seems like this is a case of a pay to play version of extensive beta testing for a product to be released at a later date.

23,Street Fighter V,21582462,english,"On first inspection it seems as though something is missing from this game. There is no arcade mode, an emphasis on choosing one character and a story mode that does not challenge you or enhance the gaming experience in the slightest.

However, once you get a taste of the game play and see how the fighting system is balanced you will feel like you are not only playing the best Street Fighter yet but an entirely new take on the game. Getting into ranked matches and graduating from rookie to bronze and so on, brings a reward of it's own as you get to fight fighters that are at the same level as you and the survival mode provides it's own brand of challenge (always starts really easy but on the hard and hell levels spikes in difficulty providing a challenge that is very addictive).

53 hrs of played time, as opposed to 30,2 during original time of writing. The ranked waiting times are stupid long as ever. Also the rage quitting problem has become more problem than what it was before. Which brings us to interesting point where I have tougher fights with bronze league Ryus, as opposed to some gold rank Ryus who maintain their rank by ragequitting. 

/End of edit/

At the time of writing: 

Singleplayer:
Content doesn't practically exist. So let's move on to the multiplayer.

Multiplayer:
Having a television or book close by is a must have, for you'll be spending much time on waiting. By the time of writing this I've played the game 30,2 hrs, and I must have spend atleast 20 hrs of that time on waiting only. It can take anything from 5 to 20 minutes to get a match, if not longer. 
Someone might argue that there are not enough new players, So ofcourse there is much waiting, and that it get's easier on higher ranks. By the time of writing this I've reached silver rank ingame, and waiting is still essential part of the multiplayer experience.

Also it would seem to me, that atleast 20% of the ranked game players are lag switchers and / or those people who ragequit to save their league points. Ofcourse that can hardly be blamed on Capcom. 

In general:

The fighting mechanics and graphics & music in this game are the only ones that are up to the standard. Unfortunately it does not redeem the other flaws of the game mentioned earlier. 

In short:

38,Street Fighter V,23564940,english,"Street Fighter V is an interesting beast. On one hand, the game is really fun to play. It eschews the tight links and high execution of the previous titles in the series, and instead focuses on the meta game. As a new player, you're probably going to like that. As a veteran to fighting games, it can be overly simple for you. From my point of view, I'll still play it, but I also think the game needs something else to make the game crazier to play and watch. It's a very vanilla fighter, with not a lot of the flash and flair of games like Marvel VS Capcom, or Guilty Gear Xrd.

Another thing is the lack of single player content. Quite noticably, the game is lacking a simple arcade mode, or a way to fight CPU opponents outside of Survival Mode. Much of the content is focused on multiplayer, which is fine for me; I play fighting games to play people, not computers. If you're looking for a fighting game to play solo, this may not be for you. Capcom is adding in a Story Mode to the game in this June 2016, so it'll get a boost to it's single player content.

As for the actual fighting mechanics, it's a little bare bones for my tastes, but still gets the job done. I do enjoy the focus shifting away from the execution (a high barrier to entry for beginners) and more towards playing the opponent, reading his/her habits, and adapting accordingly. Likely, this is a good starting off point for new players and newcomers to fighting games, but the game does not include a good tutorial to teach you the basics. Instead, you'll have to rely on the community for guides and tutorials on how to play. Luckily, there's no shortage of that content, but it's amazing that Capcom hasn't added in anything to teach.

Now, in the case that you're choosing a fighting game on which to focus on playing, should you make Street Fighter V that game? The competition is stiff; BlazBlue, Killer Instinct, Guilty Gear Xrd Revelator (a PS3/4 title, but rumored PC release), Mortal Kombat X are also games that could be on your list. Street Fighter V can definitely be played for a long time, and probably will last into the far future, as much as Street Fighter IV has. If this is your first fighting game, I would say decide between the aesthetics of Guilty Gear Xrd Revelator or Street Fighter V - whatever looks or character you'd rather play I'd choose. For veteran fighters, have a look at the fighting mechanics. If the meta game interests you (the shimmy, the crush counters) go for it.

STREET FIGHTER V IS AN EXCELLENT BETA EXPERIENCE:

I don't want to be too hard on Capcom and the game because they are trying.  But, there are glaring mistakes and oversights that hamstring the game, and by extension its community. Just about every review that is critical of the game has mentioned that the fighting in the game is fun.  I agree with this wholeheartely.  Going from this game back to Street Fighter IV the controls feel slow and unresponsive by comparison.   The flaws need to be called out though, especially since this game is still ""very much in development"".  Problems wont be fixed unless they are voiced.

MATCHES TAKE TOO LONG TO FIRE:

This one is obvious and not really up for debate.  You can find a match in Street fighter IV much quicker, even with its player base on life support. 

Searching for ranked matches from the main menu leaves you with nothing to really do until the match fires, which can include several failed attemps which is mildy irritating.  As an alternative you can search while in training mode.  This allows you to get some practice in while you wait, but the loading screen each time you enter training mode is too long.  You end up spending a healthy chunk of your playing time not playing the game.

Player lobby listings sometimes show invalid lobbies that you can not join when you search.

If a player disconnects for whatever reason mid-match, you get kicked out of the battle mode that you were in and have to reset (more on rage quits later).

RANKED PLAY DOESN'T DO ITS JOB

I will give Capcom credit for adding ""best of three"" functionality to the game.  They need to go one step further and make all ranked matches ""best of three"".  Why?  A multitude of reasons.  First of all, it will allow you to spend more playing the game and less time waiting for loading screens.  Secondly, best of three is pretty much standard in tournament play.  If you do what Capcom wants you to do, and participate in tournaments and try to make the Pro Tour, you need to be able to beat your opponent in a best of three match.  Lastly, I'll point out that simply giving players an option at the end of the first game, just creates an awkward meta-game where player can choose based on ""what will give me the best chance to earn points"" rather than, ""we are going to have a real match"".

Speaking of earning points, the number you lose when facing an opponent of a lower rank and losing is very taxing.  Don't get me wrong, it makes sense that you should lose more, however when you win, you shouldn't be earning a pittance.  The risk/reward for fighting lower ranked players incentivizes skilled players to dodge and/or rage quit, which isn't healthy for this game if it is to succeed.  We are seeing the best players create secondary accounts to avoid this dilemma.  There's nothing inhernently wrong with having more than one account though, it's just unfortunate when players feel forced to do so to preserve their rank when they wish to play a different character. The PP/BP system from Street Fighter IV wasn't the best, but it was easier to understand, and avoided *some* of the present issues.

Rage Quitters are going to rage quit.  I have quit before.  I will quit in the first round if the connection is horrible.  I've had to do that about a dozen times since the game launched.  The game has also crashed about a dozen times mid-match.  Capcom told players that they were working on the issue, but that in the meantime, players should submit recordings to RQ matches to them.  That was a horrible solution in my opinion, if you can call it a solution at all.  RQing essentially steals points from players who would have otherwise won, and creates this meta-game if the player you are beating is ranked higher than you.  Without a real solution/penalty for quitting, ranked really doesn't mean anything.  Asking the player base to police themselves by sumbitting video is obnoxious.  I've got tons of video footage of my matches that I look at to try to get better, and people RQ in many of them.  I'm not going to put people on blast on youtube just to *attempt* to back at them.  You don't get the points back for that W anyway.   I honeslty don't know why Capcom allowed this to be such a big deal in this game when Street Fighter IV handled it adequately.  Show a player's disconnect percentage.  Even if accidental disconnects were included the real rage quitters would be obvious to everyone.  Then just allow us to opt out of matches with people who have a certain disconnect threshold.  Problem solved.

CAPCOM SPENT RESOURCES ON FEATURES THAT DON'T MATTER

Survival Mode would have been a nice feature to have in the game provided the game was already feature complete.  As it stands it leaves a lot of people scratching their heads as it's not particularly enjoyable.  Most players only play the mode when trying to unlock colors, which really could have been unlocked through achieving more worthwile milestones.

Immediately after arriving at the main menu, you are reminded of how poor the user interface is. The heatmap is fine as a backdrop, but it doesn't hold any information that players care about.  What we might care about instead is information about the game, such as the next character release date, patch notes, etc.  Or if Capcom wants to really be ambitious, information about the next Capcom sponsored tournament/results from the previous tournament.  I don't think these are necessary, but I'm listing them as examples that would be far more useful than what is there.  I'm sure others could figure out better usage of that space as well.

Player profiles serve almost zero fucntion at present, other than a way to look at other players past matches.  Attack data isn't tracked at the moment, and though it looks like it will be in the future, I'm not sure how much that will improve the game experience if at all.

The Shop, by Capcom's own admission is a work in progress.  The timetable for in-game purchases with ""Zeny"" had to be pushed back.  While purchasing items with ""fight money"" is a cool idea, the implementation falls short.  I don't know how much time/resources Capcom is sinking into getting the ""Zeny"" store to work, but it's not worth it as it's not an insignificant amout.  The in-game store isn't something that is going to add value to the game, and as it stands it's holding other improvements up. 

THE GAME LACKS FEATURES THAT SHOULD BE STANDARD

Traning Mode is significantly improved when compared to Street Fighter IV.  It's easier to test out situations; wakeup, mixups, etc.  However, features such as frame data, and hitboxes should be in the game.  There's really no excuse for this.  And while you can find all of this information online, it sort of flys in the face of the whole ""self contained platform"" that Capcom had been promising.  They could still eventually make good on these features, don't get me wrong, but it's hard to be confident that they will given how far behind they are on so many other things.

There are a number of features that were present is Street Fighter IV that are just missing here.  Though Tournament mode wasn't something I used too often in SFIV it would have been nice to see it return and be improved in this game.  Ways to communicate with other players would have been a real boon for the game; even if the messages were pre-defined. ""Hey good matches"", or ""Wake up DP much"".  Voice Chat, where art thou?

I CAN'T RECOMMEND THE GAME NOW, EVEN THOUGH I ENJOY THE FIGHTING.  I'LL RECOMMEND IT DOWN THE ROAD

Once the character and game content gets closer to what Street Fighter IV offered, I will be able to recommend it to others.

However, the reviews that were negative were given by the community, but companies like IGN were still giving this game good reviews. So if anyone is thinking of buying this game I will break down the pros and cons of this game at its current state. 

First off, I have had this game for a while now and it is one of my faveorite games. Street fighter 5, in its current state, shows few signs of an unfinished game. The training mode is better than ever before in a fighting game, and the online play is smooth and in my experience has not taken over 3 minutes to find a match. (when searching for good-the best connections) Survival on hard and hell mode are both very hard, but that isn't a bad thing in my perspective.  The colors that are unlocked by beating hard mode should be seen as a prestigious reward, which you can show off in online mode.

The main complaint from the community is that the game lacks a classic arcade mode. Capcom decided to direct the game towards a more competitive audience, and decided to leave out an arcade mode to be able to release the game earlier. However, the upcoming update which will include a character and additional story content is coming soon, which will add more depth to the current story mode and give the casual players something more their style. All of the core components of an arcade mode are there, capcom just decided to leave it out. This means that it is possible for them to release a classic arcade mode in the future. The amount of characters is also something that is commonly complained about. Because capcom designed the game to be competitive, a low character roster is ideal so that the characters are all balanced, and there is no clear top tier character. That being said, the characters are all unique and fun to play, while keeping all matchups fairly balanced so that the better player will always come out on top.

It has no real arcade mode, and I don't really know about the ""story"" mode, but I've heard it's very barebones. What's more, there's supposed to be a story mode patch coming in the future (when??), so there's that too. 
The online multiplayer matchmaking can only be described as frustrating. Huge differences in BP (SFV MMR) is common every game, and you'll often experience stuttering and lag, even with the highest connection quality search criteria on. 
Couple it with the abnormally high input latency, and you've got a frustrating experience if you try to have some competitive fun. 
One other thing: The game does not value the player's time. The transition/loading screens are obnoxiously long and just adds to the frustration.
Capcom shot themselves in the foot by releasing SFV too early, and who even knows if they're scrambling to set things right; They hardly communicate with the player community.

61,Street Fighter V,23299420,english,"This game has so many positives that go overlooked due to bad PR and bandwagon hate.

1. The V system is a much improved system, way better than SF4's Focus Attacks which was a broad move across all characters which was bland and non-specific to each character. Focus Attacks were essentially the same move for every character, some benefitted more than others. It was not character or playstyle specific in any way.

2. Balance, the characters are better balanced because of the V-System which allows for more character specific tools which can be balanced in many ways through the the number of Bars, Damage Numbers, Effects and how fast V-Gauge builds and Drains.

3. Condensing SF4's Ultra animations into SFV's Supers aka Critical Arts and removal of Ultras. With the removal of Ultras from SF4 the game has better pacing and balance, in SF4 barely anyone used Supers because you had Ultra. Which meant conserving EX meter wasn't something players had to think about. SFV Critical Arts are the only form or Super/Ultras which share the EX meter so becareful spamming EX Moves. The use of Meter is much greater impact in SFV.

4. One Copy! You only will ever need One Copy of SFV, no more Super Street Fighter V or Ultra Street Fighter V Turbo. This means the community will never shrink due to a new edition or force consumers to buy another copy if they wanna stay up to date. All balance changes are free updates and DLC characters can be earned through gameplay.

5. The Fighting mechanics are top notch, the game still has a high skill ceiling but they removed some of the more technical aspects from SF4 like FADC and crouch teching. The game is more casual friendly at entry levels than it ever has been before with high skill at the top.

Tons of DLC some of which can be earned through gameplay. Cosmetics will cost you but they don't affect gameplay, the DLC isn't forced on you.

The characters, the music and the world Capcom had built all those years ago at arcades captured my attention and hasn't let go. It's always been fun finding out how best to utilize your character and kick the butts of Ken players around the world. 

On a serious note, I'm put off by the business model of Street Fighter 5 and how Capcom handled its launch. It's a 60$ retail game with microtransations on the way next month. That may not seem bad as currently there are 2 DLC characters available for free, sounds good right? Well in June Alex and Guile will be gated off by a paywall along with 4 other characters for an as of yet undetermined price. Now, you could acquire these characters with in game money but that requires you to spend hours grinding through survival mode which is always a blast /s.

73,Street Fighter V,23151314,english,"Alright lets face it.. Street Fighter V.. A Good game or Bad? Thats honestly how you find it.. 

The Good of the game- 
- Its easy to pick up and learn
- Characters you remember from past games, along with some new
- Classic feel at BASE level of other street fighter games
- Music is actually good
-Stages look nice, and have a good feel to them
- Classic 1v1 Street Fighter
-Decent tutorials for the game itself, and each character


The Inbetweens
-Cross play while nice, causes problems as well
- Both good and bad that you dont have an easy way to talk to someone. Really good so you dont hear stuff you dont want, but really bad when trying to find people, or ask questions.
- Its not USFIV (I personally loved Super SFIV.. and AE and ultra kinda were eh to me..) 
- ""Free DLC Characters"" Not really free... but you can get with in game currency.. Wouldn't be too bad, but it seems to become hard to get more Fight money once you beat the few things you can do offline.. So.. have fun trying to play online to get them 
 

The Bads of the game
-Very Bare bone fighting game, especially for the price. I know DLC is coming to add story mode and such but still
- No Arcade mode?
- This is personal but.. I feel the game is wayyy to offensive of a fighter.. Even characters like Dhalsim, and Guile who are known as your defensive characters from games past, seem to have better skills suited for offensive gameplay style. 
- No true vs CPU mode- Granted you can do this in training mode
- Automatic picking of your character in ranked matches.. Come on really? What if my favorite character is Chun Li, but I was trying out guile and wanted to play him in ranked.. I have to make sure to switch my favorite character? Why? 
- Friends list is pretty bad, along with trying to find games with them, I know this isnt steam or capcoms  fault at all, but SFIV felt so much better at this.. 
- Roll back... DEAR GOD ROLL BACK.. Ive had this problem since the betas.. Again.. you have a fine example of how to do it, with Skullgirls.. and let us set network delays and show us pings.. but no.. Capcom loves its bar system.
- Rematch in ranked? Seems nice right.. Well.. it auto gives you the same character again.. And its not an automatic best 2/3.. If you give someone a rematch in rank after beating them.. and they win.. They dont have to play the tie breaker if they dont want to. 
- This might just be me but visual looks of attacks.. I know everyone is on and on about ""frame data"" now, but some of these moves.. look unsafe as hell but are not, while others look safe and are not.. Chun Lis EX Legs being -2 (Mostly safe in the way this game works) is fine and all, but my god does it look like the move is punishable as hell


Look, if you love Street Fighter you most likely already bought this game. For what its worth, sure its an ok fighter, if you already enjoy other Street Fighters.. Overall though I would not recommend this game.. I may love Street Fighter, but I honestly can say I do not find SFV fun..

74,Street Fighter V,23147141,english,"i was wanting to have a fighting game that would replace the street fighter iv series as my most played since street fighter ii. sad to say, street fighter v is not it. 

for starters, the mechanics have been, shall we say, streamlined. i understand their intention here, to ease more players into the game, to have beginners have a much better fighting chance against veteran players. downside is that it makes a lot of the characters, for the bread-and-butter combos at least, handle similarly. i can say that there's more than a handful characters where you can use the medium punch > medium punch > special move string very often and effectively. 

but the thing is, they have indirectly drove players away from getting this. why? you've heard it - the lack of content.

i've been a long-time fighting game fan. i may not be as good as the pros, but i can say i'm an average to an above average player who can still rack up a decent win streak any time of day. i never thought this lack of content would affect me as much, because i only care about playing with human opponents. but then again, you can have the tightest gameplay and prettiest graphics (which this game both has), but if you can't bring in people to play your intentions for the game are moot. 

the game is not a total wreck. it's netcode is better than ultra sf iv and the patches have made noticeable improvements (i can get opponents faster now). but i think it has suffered enough setbacks for it to not succeed. it did not make the splash it was supposed to do, and it was overshadowed by its well-documented issues. you also have to figure in the other current and upcoming fighting games (guilty gear xrd, kof xiv) that get a huge chunk of the attention pie. at this point, even if they manage to cram in more characters and an arcade or a proper story mode in there, it wouldn't do much. people may have already moved on. and we probably will be stuck by the same people that we get to play with online. 

it's a game that is letdown by it's publisher's strategy rather than it's quality.

-Character models still clip with themselves
-Still no arcade mode
-Real story mode (not a crappy random 5 minutes of bad art and BO1s) still a far ways off. Supposedly one or two months if it isn't delayed.
-No stage transitions except the one they paraded around before release
-Alex's legs are on backwards half the time?
-What's with this 8f of input lag anyways?
Basically anyone who isn't wholly devoted to the multiplayer experience will be disappointed as all they have to play would be a boring short storymode, a horribly stupid survival mode, and training mode. Even if you like the multiplayer you're probably going to be disappointed.

Personally I have issues with lag online in quite a few matches and even offline oddly enough.

Besides these issues we also have a variety of annoyances.
Ken still looks pretty terrible.
Fight money accumulates extremely slowly past the first chunk so if this game lasts a while it's going to be a pain buying characters.
Controller support is not anywhere near as good as USF4 was.
2P has to politely ask 1P to go back to character select.
10 trials per character ain't much compared to SF4 again.
Game does a poor job of explaining itself to new players.
Frame data not readily available in game, probably due to the $$ you can get by selling a guide book with that.
Release schedule for DLC characters seems to be ""Oh god it's almost the end of the month just release whatever we have""
Guile looks like a mall cop.
It's seriously a full price game? I have played flash games with more content than this.
Not very graphically impressive despite how poorly it runs.
Feet are huge.
Guile can't put on and take off his sunglasses.

If you are all about watching the tournaments and mostly just care about the multiplayer and such sure maybe it's cool for you. But for everyone else, remember that you can refund stuff on steam.

89,Street Fighter V,22229682,english,"Honestly I think this is a great game. Gameplay wise, its fantastic. I personally haven't had much of a problem with online, matches flow well 80% of the time, usually only when I get matched with a player from another region is there stuttering. I have a mid-tier PC, and I haven't noticed any major fps drops. Ocassionally I have experienced crashing, but only rarely. Each character has such depth and feels very different from another, therefore the roster isn't  something I'd complain about, as mastering all these characters will take a very long time. The game was incomplete to start with but content is coming, slowly but surely. Therefore, if your on the fence, just wait a month or two. Once summer hits, I'm sure this will be the definitive fighting game.

Pros: Great fighting mechanics, balanced and unique characters, cross platform play (works suprisingly well), decent online, replays, 8 player lobbies, trials, good training with plenty of options, decent performance (mid-tier pc, mix of high and medium settings)

Cons: Ocassional stuttering (online), crashing, lighting issues (with ken when i do a heavy dp it sometimes changes the lighting of the screen, at one point making it pure white), dearth of content, ragequitting, and clipping during character select

Edit: Ok. I went online again today. Like every match I played disconnected after the first round. Also every match that didn't disconnect seemed laggy.

Normally a review should be witty or in-depth, preferaby both but you cant connect to a friend because lobbies don't work was the straw that made me give up on even reviewing this game!

I want to be funny and make jokes about this all but I was hyped for this game and its just...
I mean what is single player? Thats not even me being sarcastic. Story mode is 3 fights, there is no arcade mode/ladder and survival is both broken AI and if you lose connection to capcom's server, your survival run [b]immediately[/b] ends and its back to the beginning for you.

So that leaves online which is just atrocious! People with ants in their pants jumping around the screen all day. Okay, beat them, whats next? Fucking turtle players? Okay whats after that? Footsies into massive combos, its like I'm not playing street fighter I'm playing farmville and just grinding out match after match in a slugfest! I don't fight dynamic, interesting players who beat me or who i beat in ways that give me that one more round appeal that we have come to love in other fighting games.

Instead there is no difference between Pablojumpallmatch161 and Sanchezjumpupgetdown. I know the cast is small but jesus christ do you people even want to win or just hold up on an arcade stick all day? Anti-air exists you know and I am going to use it against you, often.

Then again I should stop complaining and enjoy the free wins because it only gets worse.

If you absolutely must play this game then wait a week, a month, a year! Until you hear some news about a patch that sprinkles the magic dust that makes this good.

This is as bad as MKX but at least that game launched feature complete.

First of all, let's talk about the thing that ruin it all, the online mode; yeah, you heard me, capcom, the infamous company that made the gratest fighting games of all time screwed up the most important thing in a fighting game.
What do i have to say about this?
-You can have the best internet in the world, you will get random disconects in the midle of a match

-More that HALF of the player you will face have a POTATO for modem, wich makes the game lagy and you will have to be either nostradamous to predict their mooves or have god like reflexes

-Sometimes the games just diced to disconect at round 2

-You had a bad day all you want to do is kick some international asses and then YOU CAN'T FUCING CONECT TO THE SEVERS WTF!? WE ARE IN 2016 HOW COME CAN THIS BE ALOWED

-99% of players apears to be playing Ryu/Ken wich is annoying  since they all do nothing but spam shoryuken

-The matchmaking in ranked is even worst than everything i've said before, for exemple i a Ultra Sivler, close to gold, now i hadly win 10 points a match because i either face Bronzes or Super Bronzes, and that's a pain to win 10 points by 10 points when a Silver randomly aprears and make you loose 100 points because he LAGS AS HELL WTF.

Adaptive Vsync, FPS locked to 60fps in RivaTuner. Feel like I've tried everything else. Wish I hadn't sprung for that season pass, by the time this game runs properly it will probly be old enough to be in the summer/holiday sales for half off.

If you are interested in single player game modes then I would suggest holding off on purchasing this game until that content arrives, but if you are mostly interested in online then you would find a lot of enjoyment with this game. With that said, there are still some things to consider.

The biggest issue in my opinion is that this game (A PC and PS4 exclusive) lacks Direct input support on PC. This means that all of your PS4 arcade sticks won't work on this version of the game, you will need a stick that has X input (360 stick) or use third party software to get your direct input stick to work. Doesn't sound like a huge issue, but I have experienced noticeable input lag with using anything but Joytokey. Maybe your system will work better with the some software over others, I don't know, there are several of these sofwares but Direct input support has been promised on launch day by a Capcom representative and they haven't mentioned it since. For all the players who like to play 2D Fighters on keyboard, there is no key mapping, so you're stuck with the default mapping.

The next issue I'd like to mention is Ragequitting. Capcom's solution to ragequitting is laughable at best. These types of games will always have ragequitters and many games have implemented very capable systems to handle the issue, but Capcom's solution has taken too long to be implemented and has the posibility of locking out people who genuinely disconnect from the servers for up to two hours.

Unless you're a long time fan of street fighter, consider this a thumbs down review. 

[b]However, if you're a fan like me, I'll go into why it's actually really good and (maybe) worth the money.[/b] 

[list]
[*] V trigger & Super out performs the old Ultra & Super combos. Over all this is a strong balance. V trigger replaces Ultra combos as the new ""revenge"" move, but unlike Ultras from SF4, V trigger is more utility and life saving, rather than a second version of Supers. For some characters v trigger is a ""get out of jail"" ability that lets you punish an overly aggressive opponent, and for other characters it boosts your standard attacks to allow you to push back harder and come back from a loss. The downside is they are really only available when losing and still need to be timed perfectly because they can be punished very easily. 
[*]Online play has improved quite a bit over SF4 (but it is still below standard to typical multiplayer games, regardless this is still an improvement) and you can connect to opponents fairly fast and play quick best-of-three games. By removing games for windows live, the whole service runs smoother. 
[*]Similar characters have been diversified more like we had in SF3 and then some. I'll use Ryu & Ken as an example. In the older titles these guys were essentially identical with just some damage numbers moved around. Ken's kick abilities were better while Ryu's punch abilities were better. In SF4 these two characters became more alike ... similar to how we had in SF2 and over all the diversity felt really cosmetic alone. Ultras and Supers were really the main thing to pull them apart. In SF5 though we have these two with CLEAR differences. Ryu now has a standard attack nullifier while Ken has a forward sprint (which is faster than the double forward dash). Ken also sacrifices some over all damage for extreme mobility. Ryu gives up reach and mobility for hitting much harder. For characters who are almost exactly the same, in SF5 they feel the MOST different than anything we've had yet.
[*]Aside from a few glaring balance problems (looking at you Nash), the current line up is fairly well balanced against itself. I can say this even though popular opinion says my favorite character needs a buff, so that should say a thing or two. It's hard to go into more detail on this than to just say... for the most part it feels fair when you win or lose. 
[*]The new art style is also a big win for me. I really didn't care for the black ink look in SF4 and really REALLY missed the slick (high quality) anime from SF3. In SF5 they didn't let go of the ""ink"" thing, but they'd added more color. It looks and feels better as watercolor paint now and less like an ""ancient japanese samurai scroll"" or whatnot. It's asthetic, but it makes a difference I think

Ok, if you've gotten this far and you're thinking of maybe buying, I do need to lay out the really horrible shit just so you know what you're getting into. Lets be honest: [b]This game is an unfinished product being sold as a complete one.[/b] Here is why...

[list]
[*]There is no arcade mode. This is as basic and core to this title as health bars. It existed in Street Fighter 1 in 1987. There is NO reason for it not to exist now. It's lazy and Capcom should be ashamed. The only way you can fight against a new hero now is a pathetic story mode or vs another player who will whoop you hard. it's frustrating. Arcade mode served one HUGE purpose and that was to teach you the game so you'd be ready for a vs match. It's pathetic it doesn't exist at this point. The game has been out for 2 months and...
[*]There is almost no one playing the damn thing. If I load up rocket league I get into a game within 20seconds or less. I can wait up to 5 minutes for a match in SF5. The only way to speed this up is to include higher ping players. If I want to play a slideshow fight vs someone from China I can expect to be in game in a 10 seconds and be frustrated beyond repair at the 11th second. There are no players because it is an overproced and unfinished product. It's lazy and lame. 
[*]The in-game currency (fight money) is extremely slow to earn and forces you to buy DLC if you want to unlock new characters. If you lose a match you earn ZERO fight money and if you win you earn 50. It costs 100,000 to unlike Guile, for example. That is extremely bad and/or predatory by design. 
[*]Extras like alternative costumes barely exist right now. Alternative COLORS are also barely existent. Doing a color swap on a texture is just a few lines of code. Really, you should be able to buy an infinite array or colors but instead you get vomit yellow with snot green instead of the standard colors. Come on.
[*]The current line up is EXCEPTIONALLY small. It seems Capcom wants to cash in on ever single aspect of their game on top of pricing it at 60 USD. Once all is said and done you'll probably pay 200+ to get ""the whole thing"" and that's just extremely bad business planning. Better to make the product Free to Play with this small array of fighters and then let us buy new ones at the current price. That would be fair AND it would mean more people would actually be playing. 
[/list]

[h1]In conclusion...[/h1]
Look... Street Fighter is a childhood love affair for me like Sonic the hedgehog. I spent over 400USD on SF3 at the arcades, and the main reason I did so was because of the arcade mode and playing my friends. One of my best friends and I play this a lot and I even went as far as to buy a 300USD arcade stick to play. I'm a dedicated fan. I'm a frustrated one, but still a dedicated one. For me the time I spend with my buddy playing this on his PS4 when I'm at his place or on my PC when he's here is pretty much the only reason I bought this. We both decided that Capcom vs Tekken was dumb and didn't bother. That game got trash reviews too, but what it came down to for me was the experience I would have with my friend sitting next to me. This game is stupidly priced but we have fun playing it together. The shit part is our favorite characters (Akuma & Sagat) aren't even in the line up and who knows if/when they will be added. Anyhow..

This all comes down to how much you already love street fighter. If you're the kind of guy to already have an arcade stick or play with friends then lets not kid ourselves... you're already going to buy this, you're just not happy about it. For LITERALLY EVERYONE ELSE: Don't buy it. Go buy Skullgirls and play something where you can tell the Devs have TRUE PASSION for their creation. SF5 was not created out of love, it was created for executives and stock holders.

37,Street Fighter V,22593451,english,"I'm a big Street Fighter fan and I really wanted to be able to recommend this game but.. I can't. I don't do reviews so this is probably poorly done but as it's a game I know about I felt I could put down some informed opinions. If you want a brief summary, scroll down to the conclusion. 

Capcoms attempt to open the game to everyone has neglected the people who want depth in a game. If you're a die hard fan of the classic street fighter where basic is basic then sure this might be the game for you but if you want a game that's evolved and developed depth, you're better off waiting to see where they take this game or look somewhere else.

First off, the game is multiplayer. That's it, if you enjoy playing randoms or have other friends playing this then you won't mind. If you enjoy a nice little single player mode to waste some time like me, then you'll be disappointed. The single player is rushed and poorly done. Clearly a last minute thought.

Then saying that... It really feels like the netcode was a last minute idea (I'm not a pro in anyway about this subject). I would enjoy a more smooth online game play but whoever thought the netcode they've used was a good idea needs to rethink what gamers want in online quality. 
If I had to choose between the small input delay of the USF4 online and the teleporting in SFV online play. I would choose a more polished USF4 online. Maybe I wouldn't care so much if it happened to both players and if it was temporary but its not. It mostly happens to the player who's defending... I don't need to explain why that's bad. Then once it starts, it doesn't stop it's there the entire match switching between whoever is defending. 

Onto the characters, these have good and bad points. I do love some of the character designs and I love the new characters that have been introduced. I thought it was a great idea to have characters that have clearly aged or changed in appearance and they've tested the water with a few but left the default Ryu and a few others the same as they were back when SF started, hopefully this can be changed with new outfits or better yet, mods.

The characters playstyles are also a good idea (there is also a bad point to this in a moment), each character has their own unique way to fight, despite aggressive playstyles being rewarded more than others you do feel a difference and I like this.
The problem I have with the characters is their move/combo sets.. There is no depth, when I go to play Bison who's been my main, I already know it's going to be HK spam until I've broken the defence because that is literally his safest and only worthwhile move. Yes, against higher level players I can't just spam it I have to adapt but at the core it is just HK and that's the feeling I get with all the characters, they have one good option and one good combo.. That's it, nothing else is worth doing because it doesn't reward you for playing any different. 

I do play other characters like Laura or Karin, I get bored just playing one character I like to learn all their basics then learn their more damaging/tight combos but their combos are either lacking or don't do as much damage as more simple combos I do with Bison. Which is actually a good idea and something I thought they would do. If you want to accommodate newcomers without losing the technical players. then just reward the basic combos and keep the more difficult combos. It doesn't need massively long combos but give it more than 3 parts to every combo (without the use of Vtrigger, even then that just becomes 4 parts of the combo).

The stages are also nicely made, the only downside to the stages which isn't a huge problem I'm probably just nitpicking but they're not all interactive. You have the one stage where you'll be knocked into another area of the stage or possibly knocked into a bus or get noodles on your head but that's it. It gives the impression that they spent 75% of their time on that one stage and then rushed the others. 
Another issue with this is the restaurant that you can be knocked into (The other half of the stage) Is so nicely made, it gives a different atmosphere than when you're in the streets but you rarely get to see it unless you're always being pressured in the corner which anybody will know that's not where you want to be. It would be a great idea to have it switch between starting the game in the restaurant or in the streets. 

To cover some points I'm seeing a lot of people make; 

1: SFV has had an insane amount of people register at Evo - This should be obvious and expected, if you've stripped your game down so much to accommodate people who aren't the most skilled at fighters then why wouldn't they all want to compete for that big prize? Having depth to a game up to this point never stopped new people competing and breaking into the spotlight, Capcom shouldn't have felt the need to take such a different direction at the least they could have incorporated a way to accommodate newcomers into the evolved Street Fighter we've become so used to.

2: SFV still has depth with the Vtrigger/Vskill - You would think so but for an example, look at Biffotasty/Desks videos. Watch his SF4 videos and his newer ones for SFV. The SFV videos are plain in comparison, so much so that he's got creative by editing older SF games into the videos (Which he does so well). This isn't a dig at Desk in anyway, I love his channel and his videos you can always see the amount of effort he's put into every video. His quote in a video description of his sums it up: 

""It's disappointing that it doesn't but since Capcom have tried with all their might to remove absolutely anything that's even slightly situational or anything that might be considered difficult to perform, it's not at all surprising.""

And I'm not saying we need 100 hit combos we never did and with scaling, the longer combos in SF4 became a bit pointless. Only there to satisfy those who enjoyed the timing/technical aspect. I could give plenty of examples as to why these new simplified mechanics are a bad choice, including being able to mash combos.. Literally mash combos, I saw people in an arcade full on smacking the arcade machine and doing big combos. Then while I was practicing combos, I found that as Ryu I could do a combo, mash DP before the combo animation even comes close to ending and he would throw out the DP, seconds later. This causes problems with the whole negative edge (Will need to google it, hard to explain) aspect to inputs.  

3: The games still new - Ok, I can't really argue this considering SFV to date has been a glorified early access. They do still have time to fix where they went wrong but the big problem a lot of people/critics have pointed out is that this was the games ""full"" release.. The majority of reviewers and gamers might not bother coming back to the game in a years time to do another review. It would of been a smarter decision to do an open beta/early access so people (the pros) could play the game in prep for the big tournaments without the expectations of having a fully fleshed out game.



Overall I really wanted to like SFV but I don't, I still have hope that they will change it's direction and because I am a big Street Fighter fan I don't regret buying the game. The characters, while really well designed (Seriously, Chun has never looked more beautiful), lack any depth to make each fight different from the last. The stages, while nicely done at first quickly fall apart (background FPS lower than the foreground FPS, only one stage being interactive). The new mechanics lack any depth for players to get creative. Then finally, the biggest problem right now.

51,Street Fighter V,21990258,english,"Alright, I'm just gonna start off by saying that I really enjoy the [b]core gameplay[/b] in SFV. It's very fun, the cast feels pretty balanced even though Capcom has only released one DLC char (Alex) so far, the mechanics such as V-Skill and V-Trigger make the game more interesting, and overall when things are working, they work really well in my opinion. I'm actually having a character crisis right now because [b]I personally haven't found a single character that I don't enjoy playing[/b]. All that aside: 

Since this game was being rushed out for tournaments (under Capcom Pro Tour, to be specific), there were going to be things missing from the game at release.  This is what I and plenty of others expected while playing in the beta, but what we got at release was a mess that turned people away from the game and gave SFV a lot of bad press. And unfortunately, a lot of the bad press is still justified.

[h1]Some examples SFV's issues:[/h1]
[list]
[*]No D-Input support and no way to  configure keybinds without using third party programs (which makes no sense, since this game is ONLY released on PC and PS4. Why is there little PS4 controller support & no keybind configuration in the game from the jump??)

[*]Arcade mode no longer present, and has been replaced (?) with ""story mode"" and Survival

[*]Story mode is just 4 or 5 easy, 1 round fights against the CPU tied together with some short illustrated cutscenes. Once you beat each chars story mode you are then able to buy their story mode costume from the ingame shop and you are also given Fight Money (which is the in game currency you'd use to buy costumes, characters, etc.). Overall it's not terrible, but besides getting Fight Money its a pretty forgettable mode.

[*]Survival mode is another mode where you fight against the CPU, and was added as a way to get colors for each characters costumes and to gain even more Fight Money. However, on the higher difficulties (Normal & above) the AI goes from ridiculous easy to ridiculously difficult without warning. Also, if you lose (which you probably will, since they are all 1 round fights and later on the AI starts reading your inputs), you won't get anything at all for your efforts. Instead you just have to start all over again, which is frustrating to say the least. Also, there's a lot of stages you have to fight through, from 30 on Normal, 50 on Hard and 100 on Extreme difficulty. (However, Extreme doesn't grant you colors, only a Title and tons of Fight Money) So God forbid the servers go down or your internet cuts out. And to top that off? The colors you gain in Survival mode are [b] per costume, not per character[/b]. Meaning, say you have one alt costume for Ryu, but you somehow beat all the survival modes using his default costume? To get the all new colors for his alt, [b]you have to do each survival mode, from Easy to Hard all over again.[/b]

[*]I personally haven't had a lot of bad experiences with the netcode, BUT when lag is present, the game turns into a practically unplayable slideshow with the characters teleporting around during the match. Your mileage may vary, however; some don't have a lot of issues, others have a LOT.

[*]Compared to USF4 (and other fighting games in general) it can take quite a while  to find a match. And when you do find a match, you then have to load in, which per fight takes about a minute on average. After the fight it takes about another minute to go back to training mode/main menu. This process ends up taking way too long. This isn't a hardware issue, but rather an issue with the game communicating with Capcom's servers.

[*]Speaking of hardware, the hardware requirements in this game are way higher than USF4's. This honestly isn't a huge deal, but if you have a toaster hoping to easily run this game akin to USF4, prepare to downscale your game into oblivion in hopes of reaching 60 fps.  

[*]Ragequitting is an issue, since there isn't any real penalty for it in the game (which makes no sense, since USF4 just took points away from whoever quit...)

[*]Training mode doesn't save your preferences after you quit the game/go to the main menu (Sounds kinda nitpicky, but this is another feature that USF4 has that SFV does not.)
[/list]

These are just the things that are off the top of my head, but I'm pretty sure there's more.

[h1]My opinion in a nutshell:[/h1]
This game is basically in Early Access. There's a bunch of features that are missing from the game along with a lot of weird design choices that are REALLY holding back it's potential, and because of this I'd have to recommend skipping or at the very least waiting on buying the game until much later, possibly June. Although to be fair, with a AAA game being released in a state like this, in retrospect I probably wouldn't recommend buying a game released like this at all.

SF5 is one of the most one dimensional fighting game I played. So few things works, so few things are allowed. It becomes an eternal mid-range poking game of boredom of the worst kinds.

3,Street Fighter V,22151580,english,"[h1][b][u]Introduction[/u][/b][/h1]

With a new update, [b]many[/b] adjustments to the servers and a new character, is Street Fighter V finally worth the asking price? Capcoms latest shiny fighter has a lot to prove after over a month of painstaking server problems, a staggering lack of singleplayer content, and a very limited lobby system.

[h1][u]What's New?[/u][/h1]

[b][u]Modes[/u][/b]

With the new update players now have access to a robust [i]'Demonstrations'[/i] mode, which teaches you the ins and outs of basic, intermediate and advanced play, as well as how to play individual character. Beyond that, there is a [i]'Trials'[/i] mode, which teaches you some bread and butter combos, as well as some general tricks for each characters moveset. This is not only a good way to get a feel for how combos work, but also for intermediate players to work on refining their inputs to be more precise.

[b][u]Online[/u][/b]

The update also FINALLY brings us 8 player lobbies, allowing players to duke it outwit up to 7 friends, with a spectator mode as would be expected. Sadly Capcom has not added more options to lobbies, limiting you to a king of the hill style lobbie. At the very least I expected there to be a free for all, but that option is strangely absent. This isn't exactly a deal breaker, as the king of the hill can choose to go back to the queue, but it is a disapointment none the less. For the future, I hope for even larger lobbies with not only a free for all, but the possibility of having multiple simultanious battles, the ability to choose what fight to spectate, and a tournament mode. That would elevate the battle lounge from a passable online lobby to a great one.

[b][u]Content[/u][/b]

With the patch now out, the long greyed out ""Shop"" button on the menu is greyed out no longer! Here we can finally reap the seeds we sowed back at launch when, with a lack of anything better to do, we mashed our way through the games underwhelming—yet vaguely charming—story mode. Finally we can use all that fight money we earned to buy story costumes, profile titles, palet swaps and characters, which brings us to...

[h1][b][u]Alex![/u][/b][/h1]

Alex joins the roster as the 17th character in Street Fighter V, armed with powerful command grabs, lots of aproach options and the meatiest heavy kick we've seen this side of Hugo. He is a welcome addition to the roster, being a very beloved character from the Street Fighter III series, where he served to role as the protagonist of the story. Here he appears younger, though inexplicably burlier, than in those games.

[h1][b][u]What Still Works?[/u][/b][/h1]

[b][u]The Fight System[/u][/b]

The fight system is still tremendous. Animations look great, the game is very fluid, and the increased window for landing combos makes practice more rewarding for new players, while providing veterans something much flashier than Street Fighter IV

[b][u]The Roster[/u][/b]

The roster is as colourful as ever, providing a fighting style for every taste, with lots of unique play styles. While the roster is smaller than most recent outings, it has never had so much individuality. Like Skullgirls, Street Fighter V provides you with a wide variety between the characters, rather than a large quantity. The gap between Ryu and Ken has never been greater, offering a lot of fun new opportunities for players of both characters, especially the latter.

[h1][b][u]What Still Doesn't Work?[/u][/b][/h1]

[b][u]Survival Mode[/u][/b]

Survival mode sucks. It's difficulty spikes [b]very[/b] suddenly, and even then, playing well won't be what saves you. The mode forces you to play in a way that many have argued could actually make you a worse player. This is no place to polish your skills, as instead of using frame traps, hit comfirms and cool combos, you'll be hard at work trying to cheap out your enemy at every step, only to then be rewarded with a low health regeneration before the final battle, so you can suffer a crushing defeat beneath their boot. Arcade mode this is not. Which transitions nicely into...

[b][u]The Strangely Absent Arcade Mode[/u][/b]

Seriously? Capcom, seriously? Really? Are you really being serious? Arcade mode? It's been around since Street Fighter I, how could you possibly justify its absence? Why not just take the story modes, sprinkle the story battles out, add random battles in-between, and call it a day? You have the resources, so why not do that?!

[b][u]The Bugs[/u][/b]

There is this nasty bug where if you have a drawing tablet, like a Wacom, plugged in, the game will randomly shut down without warning. As an artist myself, it is very annoying to go underneath the desk and unplug it every time I want to crack some skulls using the power of butt-slapping. I'm also experiencing random disconnects from the servers, which seems to have come back after some times absence with the release of Alex. Be warned, these disconnects will take you out of survival mode, wasting all that time you spent on finally getting to the end.

[b][u]PS3/PS4 Controller and Fightstick Support[/u][/b]

Hurry up!

[h1][b][u]Conclusion[/u][/b][/h1]

Street Fighter V is not perfect. It still isn't what most of us was hoping for. But it is worth buying. With the addition of the new content, it has finally taken the step over the ""worth it"" line. It has a great fighting system, great graphics, butter smooth animations and a roster diverse in play styles. While it is still a bit thin on singleplayer content, and the improved battle lounge still leaves much to be desired, it has fixed enough of its flaws to earn itself my recommendation.
Capcom is hard at work trying to make it up to players, and rightfully so, but this does shine a bright light towards the future of this fighter, which I truly hope is enough to spark some interest, as it has the potential to be one of the greatest fighting games on the market!",1459380810,1459381623,TRUE,10,2,0.508096218,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.66E+16,1081,15,4977,0,2327,1593176447

15,Street Fighter V,22113840,english,"The fighting engine is one of the better ones for 2d fighting games in a long time. Single player modes aside, it was clear from all the previews and promos before the game was launched that this was going to be a multiplayer focused title, as a fighting game should be.

There's in-game tools to let anybody #riseup to competitive levels. 

The training mode is great, letting you set up post-grounded and blocking responses from the dummy, and lets you queue up for matches (with the option to set in rank, casual, connection settings) while you practice, so there's never any real down time.

The biggest tool the game provides though, is the replay mode. The CFN system tracks -every- recent batch of replay for every player online. That means you can download and watch all the top-ranking players and learn from them, as well as watching your own wins and losses to see what part of your game you need to work on. This is a very under utilized feature that beginners tend to ignore, but when used properly will let any beginner see what the next step of progression would be.

That and the continual free updates for modes, characters, and balance changes will continue to add value to this title.
Casuals beware, this isn't worth full sticker price for someone who don't want to invest time and effort to enjoy gameplay, but for anybody else that wants to challenge themselves against others I would suggest this title to anybody who wants to get into the vast and deep world of competitive fighting games.

I seem to be one of those who is satisfied with the game without any doubt.

It plays very good. I do not even want to return to SF4. I don't understand people, saying 16 chars are too low for a fighting game... Try to master one at least before requesting 40+ fighters. All the characters available are absolutely unique and interesting, so anyone could find his or her fighter.

Lack of single player content does not bother me at all, maybe because I don't have enough time to squeese through the modes and just enjoy online.

What I do love is the music here. A separate THANK YOU to the composer. 

I am not sure how the future DLCs will change my mind - there are thoughts that FM only will not be enough to get everything for free in an adequate period of time. We'll see...

The percieved problem as of now is the single player content. At the moment, there is very little single player content, so if you are a offline type of person, I wouldn't recommend that much. 

Multiplayer servers for me, are great. I am getting a solid stream of battles at regular intervals. 

I think Capcom is doing great at communicating with the community and trying their hardest to make the game better. Though I would admit, the launch was not as well as it was anticipated.

Overall Pros:
-Solid Gameplay
-Characters are unique from each other (EG Ken and Ryu plays as different sort of shotos)
-A schedule for season pass, creating a sense of reliability unlike other developers who have season passes often have no schedule for their content.
-Delivering their promises (refer to cons)
-Anything core game related are purchasable with in game currency (EG Characters and balance patches)

Overall Cons:
-Sloppy launch
-Promised content is not as much as expected (refer to pros)
-Little offline content

Overall Neutral Points:
-Slowly, yet improving game
-Single game for future improvements (No Super, Ultra, Alpha editions of games)

I love fighting games; I love their competative nature, and the deeper the fighting game the better. My favorite fighting game was Street Fighter III 3rd Strike, and KoF XIII.

With that being said SFV is one of the best fighting games I have ever played. Out of the new fighting games that just came out it is IMO the best one. Yes' SFV is lacking in content such as arcade mode, a decent story mode, and challenges; but if you want to play a good challenging game with great online I highly recommend this game. Capcom well release a free DLC for the modes that the game is lacking such as the challenge mode.

The game, on the surface looks simple, but on the conterary it is a deep game which needs a high skill level; it is easy to get into but hard to master. The easy part is with the simplified execution, the hard part is how the game actually is played. The game is a high risk high reward game that depends on reads and pressuring your opponent. There are no safe dragon punches anymore if you have to do a move you have to commit. The game demands from you to learn fundementals and neutral game; as scrubs and mashers get punished hard. Every character playes really differently from one another and that adds to the depth of the game. The V system is unique as it adds a different prespective to the game and how it is played because it changes how the characters are played.

80,Street Fighter V,21872023,english,"It's hard to recommend this game, but it's harder not to recommend it.

Street Fighter 5 is a skeletal game in its current state. There's very little single player content, and what is included is pretty terrible. 

You don't play Street Fighter for the story... but if you're going to include a story mode it should be something more than 2-3 fight arcs with terrible anime-style slideshows in between. And the voice acting in the story mode? Heinous. Survival mode is a better way to waste time playing alone, but it works more as a distraction while waiting for an online match than as something you'd want to play for its own merits.

There are other things worth complaining about as well... even though a number of free additions are promised, you can already feel Capcom latching on to milk people with DLC. There's an in-game currency which will be usable in a forthcoming shop, but you it's already obvious that the game uses an initial dump of easy currency to get players excited, and then radically cuts down the earning pace so that people will feel incentive to spend real money on the ingame currency. It's not like Capcom is the only developer injecting ""free to play"" monetization into full priced products, but still... yuck.

All of that said - you should still play this game. The core fighting engine is the best of any Street Fighter game, and probably the best of *any* fighting game ever. It's crazy how fluid the game is, how inviting the controls are, and how intuitive each of the fighters feels. 

Optimization on the PC is terrific - I'm running a graphics card which is just below the minimum recommended specs, and the game has no problem turning out 60FPS @ 720P/medium settings. The game looks terrific even at those curtailed settings - characters are huge and detailed, and animation is natural and smooth. I've seen some complaining about support/configurability for controllers, but i've experienced no problems; the game instantly recognized my old Madcatz xbox 360 fight pad and configured itself appropriately. Cross-play with people on Playstation also works without a hitch.

If you'll never play this game online, you should probably stay away - there just isn't much there for single player junkies.

Crush counters, v-reversals/v-skill/v-trigger are new addition to the gameplay.

Crush counters will cause the opponent to dizzy for a second if the player is able to counter his attack with one of his own, thus rewarding a good neutral game and read.

V-reversal is a defensive tool that will put the pressure off the defending player at the cost of one v-gauge bar. 

V-skill is a particular special move performed by pressing mid-punch and mid-kick, an unique tool for each character.

V-trigger is a special state in which the player is put upon activation, the effect of the trigger are unique for each character but they can deeply change the pace and the outcome of the match.

It has something to do with the internet speed, and that is something I need to solve. ISP here sucks, only up to 42Mbps for mobile users, it says ""up to"" therefore not guaranteed. There are better home installed services but I live in an apartment that I might leave it someday, not practical. I will recommend this if you have great internet connection for those who want online multiplayer, because I think most of the issues like disconnection, no rank match found, and teleporting, the internet connection might be also a contributing factor. So if you don't want to be accused as a rage quitter or lag switch user, better have a great internet connection first before playing multiplayer or else stuck on singleplayer like me. so frustrating. Also, maybe you can wait until all bugs, complains and issues were already addressed.

EDIT: I just found out that in the Menu - Steam>Settings>In-game>In-Game Server Browser: Max pings / minute you can lower the value. I just recently had a ranked match quickly, but the lag/teleport/choppy/rollback issues are still there. I lost but there was failure in giving points. Still recommend that people must have good internet, might solve some issues, mine sucks. I love the game, just don't recommend it with similar situation like mine.

When are you finishing it?"" to which the contractor responds by giving a fatigued sigh and taking his hardhat off his head before going ""WE'RE WORKING ON IT!”


That is Street Fighter V currently.


I'm brand new to fighting games but have been having a blast with Street Fighter V currently despite getting my crap rekt almost every match I've played so far. You can mash buttons sure, but Street Fighter is most enjoyed as a tactical thinking game. Learning the moves, discovering what characters you like and dislike, predicting what your opponent is going to do next. It's all very rewarding and engaging once you get the basics down.



Of course one of the biggest cons that you will see with Street Fighter V is its current lack of content. There is very little single player to speak of at the moment and most of the game is obviously focused on the competitive scene and online play but Capcom has promised to expand upon the single player in the future. While it can be annoying at the moment I don't count this as a big con because I ultimately think Street Fighter V is an online game and what’s there is already very good. If a lack of single player doesn't sound that bad to you and you are looking for a challenging and competitive atmosphere I would heavily consider picking Street Fighter V. If not I would wait until a sale or until they add more content to make it a juicer game.

[H1] PROS [/H1]

- Core fighting mechanics are rock solid, and what's there is already very good


- The game is gorgeous to look at, the art direction and style is spot on


- If you take time to invest in and learn the gameplay it is some of the most rich and rewarding feeling out there


- While small at the moment, the characters are extremely polished and each feel unique. You should have no trouble finding someone you will like.

[h1] CONS [/h1]

- Feels unfinished


- While I haven't run into many of the problems which others claim to run into online it could use some polishing.


- Season Pass is probably going to be a must unless you have time or feel like grinding out for characters.

Street Fighter V is an excellent game that doesn't feel quite finished yet.

39,Street Fighter V,21699296,english,"Are there worse disappointments in grown-up life than Street Fighter V?  Of course, but it's so maxed out on the scale of video game disappointments I can only liken it to real life disappointments.  You know that old adage that sex is like pizza, even when it's bad its good?  Street Fighter V is like the sex that isn't like pizza.  The kind you immediately regret and are pretty sure is gonna make you sick.

If there isn't going to be an offline tournament mode, then the servers need to be vaguely functional.  Am I too old?  Is this an age thing?  The offline tournament mode to me has always been ""the game.""  Sure I enjoy playing online against other players, but after I beat the ""the game.""  So that part being omitted feels like I spent $80 on the preorder and season pass to actually not even get what I consider to be the core game itself.  I've tried to keep an open mind though, because maybe this is an age thing.  Maybe I'm wrong here.  So I really tried to dive deep into the online mode, but the servers are just terrible. It takes 5-10 minutes on average to find a match.  I have to play something else while I wait and by the time it queues up, I'm not really in the moment anymore.  Another big disappointment is that I love the big cast of characters, but they cut way back.  Street Fighter IV added so many classic characters to what I thought was going to be the permanent lexicon of SF.  

This game feels really thin and flimsy.  I'm not even addressing the ragequit exploit, because Capcom promises severe punishment.  If you're putting all your eggs in one basket, doubling down on online tournament play only, then doesn't that seem like a really basic, careless, obvious misstep?  That's the kind of lack of attention to detail and quality that permeates every aspect of this game.

I'm pretty sure this only gets read by my friends.  If that is the case and you're reading this, then please come over and play this game any time you want before actually spending money on it.

57,Street Fighter V,21652031,english,"I have to say over all, I'm disappointed in Street Fighter V.  It's mainly because of the lack of content. Despite the fact there are suppose to be updates soon. That shouldn't be a excuse for releasing what clearly is a half baked game.  Back before the age where DLC or releasing game updates were common for console games. Releasing a game that is clearly only about 90% finished would of been unacceptable. Why people give a free pass to developers who do this, because the  game will eventually be better*maybe*. I just can't understand.  A game like Street Fighter should come with all the features that the fans of that series come to expect. Why is there no arcade mode? That story mode it extermly lacking and doesn't really have much going for it as of now.  You better be really into just fighting people online, because there just about zero single player content.

The same thing has happen with a few other mordern fighting games like the new KI where when it first came out it was basically a beta verison. No where near what the content should be for a full retail priced game. The same here is true of Street Fighter V. Point being if you're going to charge me $60.00 for a game I didn't even purchase a physical copy of. You better be able to deliver enough content from day one to justfie charging that much for your game.  Even the first edition for Street Fighter IV had more content and was more fun then V cunnerently is.  Which is why I can't really  reccomend buying it. Wait off on getting this one for now at least. Until either it goes on sale or a better edition comes out. If I was rating on a scale of  1 to 10 I'd have to give it a 7.5 out of 10.

Though the game runs fine, I do wish it had more features.  The capcom release schedule is going to be awful slow considering how few characters there are, and how few actual moves each character contains.  I wish they had added 3rd strike style parries to all the characters to maybe add a little more depth to the gameplay.  There's not much new here, but like always it's street fighter remake so I will get it and play it.  Some slightly more complex gameplay or a radically new mechanic might have been welcome. I hope the content charges ahead, as it does feel incomplete, but it's certainly fun in the current state.  It will be real fun in a couple years I suspect.  I doubt they will but I really hope for voice chat implementation when they add actual battle lobbies with multiple person support and spectate.  It would be great to get in a lobby with several friends and socialize while you switch off battling, but it doesn't really seem like they will add voice chat.

88,Street Fighter V,21565637,english,"Tl;Dr = Great game, capcom focused mainly on making a good fighting game. Every character is good and fun to play, each character is balanced by having weaknesses [basically nobody is over powered like 3s Chun], and it looks amazing.

Personally, I love this game and I know I'm going to play it for a long, long time. However, this game seems to have completely focused on a few things:

1) Solid and fun gameplay
2) Balanced, yet unique characters
3) Online Muiltiplayer
4) Amazing music
5) Insanely good training mode

If you have internet, it's a great videogame. 

The only downside people complain about is the lack of offline, single player content. In my opinion, that doesn't really matter to me at all. I think most people get a fighting game for online multiplayer regardless. It seems capcom put single player on the backburner to make sure that the gameplay itself was amazing. If you really are only looking to play offline versus bots, then I'm sorry but you won't like this game. However, if you prefer to play online against the world, you will love this game for a very long time in my honest opinion.

89,Street Fighter V,21564078,english," While not perfect and at the moment lacking content, it is worth more than Mortal Kombat X will ever be worth. Why? My worst online fight performance wise ran better than my best mkx one. No joke. Also, cross platform with ps4 is a blessing. 

Pros: 
+ Great graphiqs, colorful and beautiful art.
+ Great music.
+ Great performance and game is well optimised ( Unless you play on a piece of **** ).
+ Cross platform with ps4.
+ Online performance is awesome ( Despite launch server problems ).
+ My sf4 fightpad works with no problems.
+ Nice system to follow players, view replays, add friends etc.
+ Years of promised support for the game.

Negatives.
- Lack of options at launch, like, no arcade modes challenge modes etc, meaning if you want to play solo you literaly have zero good modes.
- Story mode available at launch is a total joke.
- Survival mode is the worst mode ever in fighting games, and this one hides colors for costume behind stupid requirements.
- Game decided to minimize charge characters ( for whatever reason Vega is no longer a charge character, **** you Capcom )
- Micro transaction scheme that could go both ways once more modes are released in march, stay tuned.

 All in all, i keep the game and have no regrets, i recomend it. It is really our only awesome fighting game. Don't trust the negative steam reviews.

98,Street Fighter V,21543199,english,"In my opinion, they've been doing a great job.
Yes this game has no arcade mode, yes there is no trial mode, yes survival mode is boring...
But that's not the core of the game, those are superficial things. 
The netcode is amazing, the game mechanics are great, the characters are fun to play, the new ones fit perfectly the street fighter universe, they improved the ranking system, they improved the lobby system (even if it's still ongoing) ...
They did an excellent job delivering a core game that would be able to live for a long time (depending on the popularity of course...).

The thing people tend to forget is that Capcom tries to copy the economic system and community system of mobas , mmo, all the games from the new generation.
And when those games were released, they had huge problems as well, server wise, in-game bugs, ...
And I think they're trying to adapt it to their franchise to give the opportunity for the community to grow ! Of course more money for them, but also more players for you to play against, more people to learn from,more possibilities in the games ...

So, that being said, SF5 has still a lot of room for improvement, specially to get new/casual players on their side.
- Arcade mode,
- Trial mode,
- other modes (I remember a final fight like mode in a tekken game if my memory is correct)
- More costumes,
- Cinematics,
- More characters,
- More character customisation
- More levels
- More customisation for everything (Life bar, super bar, vtrigger, levels, ...)
- access to account from your browser and phone
- spectator mode : being able to move camera (orbit control like)

And for experimented players too : 
- 8 persons lobbies 
- Online tournament creation
- Hitboxes visualisation in training mode (that would be awesome)
- training room with a friend online (I didn't look for it in the game, so I don't know if they already added it)
- Browser statistics tracking (get online replays, check ranking from your browser/phone)
- In-game notes
- send replay on youtube, or save replay in mp4 (I didn't look for it in the game, so I don't know if they already added it)
- Rage quitter in ranked should have their LP reduced... and the LP of their opponent increased for the ""waste of time"" 

etc... etc... 

So yes there are room for improvement but :
- The game is easy to get a hold on
- The netcode is great
- The game mechanics are incredible
- The game is gonna keep evolving (frequent patches)
- The training room has been much improved (record dummy)
- The core game is almost flawless

Capcom, you're totally on the right track, so thank you for what you're doing !


TL;DR

For casual gamers and non-patient people : Wait for July (The full story mode release date)
For people who want to pick up fighting games : Go for it, go online, make some friends, and make your way to the top, I'll be on the same path
For sf4 players : 
- if you played for flashy combos with your friends : Go play tekken because you won't be happy with this game. (Maybe Ken or Nash though, I think I've seen some flashy stuff with them, and I'm sure some more flashy characters will come)

Capcom was open in telling people that the single player content would not be ready in time, but a lot of people missed that because it didn't say anything on the Steam page, and most people don't take the time to watch all the trailers.

Cons: (My opinions) Rollback is the worst, Ps4 to PC fights always seem to bring lag to the table even if it says 5 bars, the ragequits are very potent, lacking in the single player content, NO arcade mode (weird), getting colors in this game is very boring with survival mode being the most grindy feeling thing ever since the AI randomly goes from braindead to input reading monsters

Pros:
- Cross platform play. PS4 and PC can challenge each other in Network Mode.
- New battle mechanic. V-Gauge, EX Gauge.

Cons:
- You pretty much need a new computer or graphics card to play this. And even after that, the graphics are quite ordinary compared to what Tekken has been dishing out over the past 10 years.
- The lack of controller support. I had to use a 3rd party application to map the keyboard inputs to my joystick.
- People are rage quitting without penalty to protect their ranking in Online Ranked mode. 
- No rematch. Once a match is over, you're put back into the queue and waiting for another game.
- Challenge mode isn't ready.

GamesRadar, Escapist and IGN are duds. The rankings they gave suggest the people who work there are casual gamers at most and only get paid to give good ratings. Thanks for letting us know Steam.

27,Street Fighter V,21490165,english,"I have 46 hours and bought the game on release day, so I think that it's time for a review.

Before we begin, my review makes it seem like the recommendation doesn't match up, but it should be explained near the end. 

To start things, off:

The rollback is AWFUL. I can't stand losing because i land a hit confirm on my side, but get hit by a CA on my opponents side and lose the match. Straight crap.

Also, no reprecussions for rage quits. I've lost out on a lot of points from people with 3.8k points because they rage quit so they get to keep their fake online e-peen. No one respects players with bad skills and a high rank.

That said though, it's kind of hard to punish rage quitters when the netcode for this game can be so awful at times, that it isn't even playable.

For the competitive local players however,

This game has very strong mechanics and has excellent gameplay. The only real problem i've had is it is the stubby normals that all of the characters have, but that's not even really a gameplay issue. If you're looking to play this game locally with the versus mode, or if you're a competitive player, then sure, this game is downright amazing. 

However, for the Casual market:

Before I go too far into this, I know that capcom has been telling us that this game will have featues accessible down the line, and that the release copy will most definitely feel incomplete. However, with poor marketing decisions, I'm afraid for this game's PC support, as fighting games rarely get revisited for reviews, so a lot of major gaming news outlets already have mixed reviews for this game, which is very scary. Now, sorry for going off topic for a second there, but for the casual market - as it sands February 2016 - the game is very, very lacking. You get what's essentially a neutered story mode, and a survival mode that has some of the worst difficulty spikes of all time. Not very healthy, but that being said, Capcom did release this game early for the competitve market, and Capcom Pro League.

Overall, it's not a bad game. The mechanics are strong, The fighting is crisp; but it feels like what we got is a neutered version of the game, that's basically almost a beta at this point. As mentioned, I feel really scared for the PC support when the updates roll out, as I feel like we'll get another Diablo 3 situation, or another MKX. It's genuinely a good game, I really like it, but there are a lot of issues with this that make it really frustrating to play.

The only other available games are SF4, GGXRD and a bunch of trash like abandonware MKX. SFV is 100% better than other games of the genre even in its current state. And it has a metacritic score lower than that of SF X Tekken. The gamers crowd is sure full of.. very interesting people.

I understand that it was released in beta state, this is a mistake by Capcom, because only the serious fighting players needed early access to prepare for tournaments. The correct way would've been to sell it as an early access (however I don't know if early access sales are possible on PS4, and they needed simultaneous launch obviously).

Right now the issues with the game are:

 -the online ranked takes forever to find match and ragequitting is not punished (as of today)
 -some people find the lack of single player modes disappointing, but those modes will come soon

If they fix online, then the game will be super good.

35,Street Fighter V,21281975,english,"Why would anyone recommend a full-price early access game where devs spent more time thinking about its DLC plans than finishing the actual game is beyond me.

I'll just list some of my biggest problems with the game right now:
- Game is missing most of its content.
- Servers are constantly down since launch (despite four beta tests).
- Most of the solo content requires an online connection.
- Story mode is a joke at best.
- The game does not support anything that is not an Xbox controller (where SFIV did).
- Minimal effort was put in the PC port.
- Planned DLC costumes are ridiculously overpriced.

Is it gonna get better with time where content is added to the game ? Probably.
Should we pay full price for this right now ? Absolutely not.
Will Capcom compensate us in any way for this disastrous launch ? Doubt it.

Update 1 :

A week and a half after release, first patch is nowhere to be seen.

But there are more problems that were discovered so this game is only becoming less and less recommendable :
- The netcode is deeply flawed:  one player can be the target of all the rollbacks making the game unplayable for him but not for the other player. Worse, this can be exploited by player with low moral standards (to be polite).
- No punishement whatsoever is in the game against rage quitters. Worse, you can rage quit after the KO screen and still not lose your points, depriving the winner of his at the same time.

CAPCOM STATED THIS GAME WAS GOING TO BE BAREBONES WHEN THEY LAUNCHED IT.

It was launched early for the competitive scene. For those people who are upset that there isn't a lot in the game, Capcom forewarned it. They specifically stated the rest of the game was going to be patched in. The main reason it was launched early was for competitive multiplayer. (EVO, etc)

Overall if you are a fan of fighting games, I would suggest picking this game up. This game is pretty resource heavy with graphics, so ensure you have a decent GPU.  My R7 240 could barely run the game, upgraded to a R7 370 and can run the game at max settings.

67,Street Fighter V,21442857,english,"I can describe Street Fighter V with one word: laziness.

I been playing Street Fighter 2,3 and 4 quite a lot. Especially 4 was a long time favorite for about 5 years, and
i had great experiences with that brilliant game. Unlike Street Fighter V, it was a complete game for me. 

Crapcom wanted to bring ""THE"" Fighting Game, which was considered to be a long timer like Street Fighter IV was. 
By its current state, I think that even a game like Shaq Fu would do better.

Lets start off by mentioning the ""Story"" mode. 
The story mode is one of the perfect examples of crampcom being lazy as fuck. 
There are 3 enemys for each character, and some pictures related to their story. I mean Capcom,
I know you focused on the Game itself and not on the Story, but atleast show that you tried. 
For anyone who enjoyed playing Arcade in SFIV, you wont be enjoying this.

The worst of the game is the ""Survival"" mode.
I mean, this mode is just pure cancer. You have to put a ton of time into playing against the AI
opponent you can crush easily, and get colours for each character that depend on the difficulty you play.
If you want to know more about this crazy fun mode read some other reviews, I am not in the mood to describe
this mode. Its just a punch to the face to any Street Fighter Fan. 

Instead of allowing the Ranked Match Lobbys like in SFIV, you now have to configure your ""Battle Settings""
with your favorite Character, Stage and so on. I mean Capcom wtf. Who of you guys came up with this great idea
of leaving the Lobbys behind us and replace them for this shit system? 

Gotta say i had no laggs though. BUT about 5 times of playing 15 games, the Server wont send any results of my matches and I didnt get any points whatsoever.. 

Lets go on with the bad things, for me personally I think the combos are way to flat and boring.
Comparing it to the Combo System in SFIV is a joke, I mean i understand that it was made to get new players
to play the game better but seriously, I feel like every character has like 2-3 Combos. The V-Trigger combos 
aren't interesting for me at all. You arent even able to link a cr. lp to a cr. mp, which has been completely normal
in SFIV but in SFV you can't. I dont see the logic here. FADC Combos in SFIV really showed off your skill, and made
the Game quite interesting. That is not the case here.

All in all, dont buy this game at its current state

68,Street Fighter V,21442302,english,"Got exactly what I wanted, great core gameplay that is expected of the next Street Fighter.

I'd say the game was rushed out if I hadn't paid any attention to the prerelease information, sure it's light on content now, but with all the free content coming in the next few months(and years) that won't be much of a problem, even if it was rushed out, the game at it's core is not effected.

Some people may see this as a negative, but in this case it is a positive, I personally will end up sinking more time into online modes than I will the Singleplayer content, so I prefer playing now instead of waiting until June for them to finish the Story Mode which I wasn't expecting and will be getting for free anyway.

The DLC plan for this game is pretty stellar too, anything 'gameplay related' being free with in game currency, which between the singleplayer content that is there now, and will be added later, it essentially makes the first three DLC characters of your choosing next to effortless to earn.

Only complaint is the survival mode, it needs some tweaking considering it is currently the only way to unlock colors, the sharp and sudden increase in difficulty during later rounds will frustrate some players, when trying to go fifty rounds.

People may complain about content, but even when that's added it wont change how the game itself plays, and it plays really damn well, and at this point most if not all of the server issues have been taken care of.

The reason there are so many bad reviews is because the online service was more or less offline at the time of launch, and there is currently very little single-player content to enjoy. However, even prior to this game's release, CAPCOM stated that there was more content on the way in just 2-3 weeks, so there will be more single-player content soon, and there will be more characters as well, which can either be earned for free by collecting in-game currency, or by purchasing them like the old, simple days.

Instead of going out for a walk, or at least taking a deep breath, everybody came to this review-section with a sledgehammer, wanting to get blood on it.

Despite the rocky start for this game, I appreciate the fact that CAPCOM has made a very well-balanced game that will be fiercely competitive, and that they opted to release what they could as early as possible, for the community of hardcore fans who know no better gaming-situation than a brand new STREET FIGHTER game, prioritizing the competitive community, and simply adding more content which has been so sorely missed by the casual players at a slightly later time --- only 2-3 weeks after release, as earlier mentioned.

I recommend this to anyone, because the game has a smart mix of simplicity in its controls, and depth with strategies and more at the core. The characters' playstyles and visual designs each cater to pretty much all preferences of the general public.

[b]The Bad:[/b]
- A letdown in the quality of PC considerations

SFV was heavily sponsored by Sony... and arguably PlayStation. It's almost safe to say that the PS4 is the native platform for the game. If you want to know more about the game, read about the PlayStation reviews because this PC release is practically a half assed port.

For people following the scene and the Capcom press, it was pretty public that quite a bit of the features promised in the full game would not be available upon release. But hey people want to play it so let's just keep the release date instead of doing an extended beta so that people would have to test it with a purchase. 5/7 Great decision by Capcom.

It took approximately two days for Capcom to resolve most online network issues which prevented peer-online-play. Matchmaking works though-- so at least we have that going which is good. Give Capcom a break they're just going out of Beta.

Controller or external device input detection seems pretty on par with most other games released within the past 5 years. Nothing new, nothing praiseworthy, but nothing new to really complain about either.

Much like the other inconsiderate and lazy PC-ported fighters... there is an absence of key remapping on launch. Sadly this is the par for many games today.. So although no real bonus points for Crapcom, no real penalty either. However, if you consider Street Fighter 4, Super Street Fighter 4 AE, and Ultra Street Fighter 4 and the considerations they have for PC, this is leaps and bounds apart. UI does not acknowledge the presence of a PC platform and considers everything as a derivative input of a PlayStation port. You want to do something? Press Circle Cross Triangle or Square or R1/R2 or L1/L2. Where is it on they keyboard? You'll figure it out... or use AutoHotkey to rebind everything anyway so let Capcom use their money to make this game look real good for PlayStation instead of doing keyboard considerations from the get go... mkay? :D

Online play in its height, perhaps from a large influx of new players with good connections -- seems better than any of the PC iterations of SF4. Playstation Cross-platform compatibility should also allow for greater playability for players. Ridiculous rollback and visual stuttering plagues matches arbitrarily, much like its predecessor though.

Borderless fullscreen seems to work by activating steam overlay and the game still in the foreground of its respective monitor... so switching to windows in another monitor seem to work. Nowhere close to SG's implementation of Borderless Windowed yet.

[u][b]TLDR;[/b] Overall a much better release than any Koei Tecmo game, but it falls short of the considerations Arksys provides for its games -- at least for PC.

Punching and kicking people in the face has never been more satisfying. Street Fighter V feels like an expansion to the Alpha series. Alpha counter is back, powerful level 3 supers are as potent as ever, EX moves feel like Level 1 supers, big counter hit juggles and combos are a core part of the gameplay, and much of the cast got their start in Street Fighter Alpha. 

The V gauge system is a welcome change and adds nice variety. This bar governs your ability to alpha counter (aka V Reversal) and V Trigger. You must choose which to use your bar for, which adds a nice layer to the game. Activating V Trigger will spend your whole bar and you cannot V Reversal. Alternatively V Reversal costs 1 chunk of V bar so you cannot activate V Trigger. Offence or Defense, it's your choice. 

Many things are just like you'd expect in a street fighter game. The low/overhead/throw mixup game is present, along with things like Trip Guard, Negative Edge, pianoing, frame traps, etc. However, a few key changes were made that players will need to be aware of. Super Grabs can combo. That's right, Zangief can headbutt you and hit confirm into grab super. You cannot die from block damage (except supers!), you take white recoverable damage from blocking medium or hard attacks, and alpha counters can be baited and grabbed with fast recovering attacks. 

Currently you can play training mode ( which has lots of tools for creating situations you would want to reproduce), VS mode, story, survival, and a few online modes. The game has cross platform matchmaking PC to PS4 which hasn't been done before. Capcom is still making improvements on the infrastructure of the online platform, and they are being very transparent about that via @SFVServer which is great. My overall experience so far has been positive. Many online matches feel very smooth, and things are only getting better. 

A couple of things I'd personally like are to make ranked matches 2/3 and allow player 2 to rematch between matches. Overall those are small complaints though, and this game is a lot of fun.

So, it pains me to say that from the limited amount I saw before uninstalling the game, this game is the worst train wreck I've ever seen. To be fair I don't even know what the actual game is like, because the game wouldn't recognize ANY of my three arcade fight sticks that I spent $150 each on, that all work with SF IV. Supposedly it only supports xinput and I would have to install some middleware and risk lag in order to maybe be able to use the $450 investment in specifically streetfighter branded fight sticks.

 REALLY? NO SUPPORT FOR STREET FIGHTER FIGHTSTICKS THAT SAY 'STREET FIGHTER IV' ON THEM????!!!

The menus were ugly, I was forced to go through a turotial (god I hate mandatory tutorials) using an xbox360 dpad (the only controller that works). I tried watching some of the live game broadcast videos built into the game, lol that most of them didnt work either. From what I saw in the videos, the games graphics look uglier/worse than SFIV. As soon as I tried everything I could and restarted the game, etc. etc. and failed to get my hori arcade r3 sticks working, I uninstalled the game and got a refund from steam. So I dont know or care what the game is like because Im not going to play on a xbox 360 dpad or fork out another $150 for an approved controller of some kind. This is the first time in a library for 177 games that I have gotten a refund fyi, but I felt so ripped off and betrayed that my fight sticks dont work on the game they were specifically marketed for (ok well it was SFIV but you expect they will work with future SF versions as well), I just had to get a refund and post this review.

Edit: Here's some more info from someone who's played 30+ hours. 
Capcom has been nuts about fixing the server issues. They're doing the absoulte best they can. 

This game is the most balanced, most playable, most competitive, and most fun street fighter there ever was. This game has been made for the fans, and capcom didn't realize how much that would resonate with people. 

The reason for the signifcant number of bad reviews has nothing to do with the game itself, and everything to do with an inability to play online and day 1 whiners having nothing to do becuase they're unwilling to go into training mode to get good. 

I look at it this way: Capcom expected only the hardcore competitive people to pick the game up on day 1. They were wrong, it's been hugely popular, and EVO 2016 has more competitors for a single game then has ever happened in the history of the tournament, the game is BRAND NEW, and registration has been up for 4 days! WOW!

This game is good. Git Gud scrubs and stop complaining. Capcom has done us a solid.

I highly reccomend the street fighter 5  intro guide by glhftv.

- Street Fighter 4 is still more complex and FAR more exciting for the competative scene.
- Casual gamers will hate this game as it stands now.

Look. Capcom tried to appeal to casual gamers while appeasing the 3rd strike crowd by removing 1-frame links and making the game entirely based around footsies. The problem is that competative players like me still dominate online matches, and because everything is so basic, matches are boring to watch and stale as a result of most match-ups consisting of close quarters guessing games. If you analyze even Tokido vs Daigo matches, most hits are actually random and not based on skill.

A HUGE PROBLEM WITH THE GAME IS THAT IT'S BORING TO WATCH.

I want you to really think about this for a second. Every match boils down to two players standing next to each other, pressing a slow normal, and one players normal randomly connects, leading to a frame advantage. You can call this reads, footsies, whatever. It's extremely boing to watch compared to melee or USF4. Capcom really screwed up here, and I think Combofiend (developer) was so busy making it a great way to measure skill between two players, that he forgot the magic ingredient that a fighting game needs. He did accomplish perhaps the best way to measure the skill of two players ever - the better player always wins, but somehow too many other ingredients were sacrificed in the process.

The main problem for Capcom with SF5 since launch day, is that the game just doesn't appeal to casual gamers. It had a terrible launch, and MKX and other recent fighting games makes SF5 look like an early alpha. They could have easily averted this, and I think it will be their downfall. I predict a massive shrinking of the fighting community and a slow decline in tournament participants and viewers. I will continue to enjoy this game, and I love playing it as a competative player, but I'm sorry Combofiend, those aren't the most important aspects of a fighting game.

Though there are quite a few missing or not-fully-fleshed-out features, such as Challenge mode, the Shop, etc., this is because the fans of the beta and what not begged capcom to release it early, which they did. Not to mention, these features are not absent completely, but are merely coming as an update in March. The game will also have a great many roster updates as well, with 6 characters being added in just the first update. The online functionality has it's flaws, but I've not encountered anything that warrants a negative review of this title. The worst it gets is taking a long time to find an online opponent, but even this is circumvented by a feature that allows you to search for online fights as a background process while you do other things or play other modes like Survival or the Story previews.

Key settings: it is abit akward  as you can only binds the the punchs and kicks to HJKL and NM<> instead of UIOP and JKL:

****MIXED REVIEW****

Feels like half a game really. I know they've really focused upon the PvP aspect of this game as the story or arcade modes are barely there.

I think this is the first fighting game I've played where there isnt the classic single player arcade format.

In addition to this the challenge mode, shop and a few other things aren't currently available. All in all I'd hold off purchasing until these are implemented.

That aside I'll probably still end up playing it a fair bit.

I just wish they're spent more time with the story mode",1455585882,1456177597,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.66E+16,164,4,18040,0,760,1526660285
26,Street Fighter V,21259813,english,"After the initial rocky start, Capcom has managed to stablize the servers and also a fix to the graphic card has been found (disable Vsync). 

The game play has been great, with most links now being 3 frames making it much easier for people to combo. Matches are also quick and hardly ever go to time outs. 

In terms of offline play, it is expected that content of the game is limited right now but as Capcom will be adding in the cinematic story mode and other functions soon, I believe that the game will realize its full potential in the future.

That being said, if you are not interested in online versus mode, it might be better to wait till further content is released before you purchase the game. 

*Updated Review

As a huge SF fan this is an extreme disappointment. I can understand it being barebones and not having much options as I much prefer the VS aspect of it but the servers are horrendous with massive DCs. Not to mention theres also a huge graphic issue. 

Even with a gaming laptop, on the lowest settings, I get graphic lag to about 15 frames per second OFFLINE. This is odd as the previous day I plaed it on high settings and it ran silky smooth at 60 FPS. Capcom needs to patch this issue ASAP.

Pros:
- Much better net-code and online play compared to Street Fighter 4, despite the initial server issues on launch
- Basic combos are far more damaging in general, which makes scoring damage a lot easier for a newer player 
- No more ""1 frame links"", making the top damaging combos far more accessible for newer players
- A nice graphical upgrade from Street Fighter 4
- Ability to buy DLC with in game currency you earn for completing various tasks. (Once the store is fully released) 

Cons:
- The story mode and other key modes are being released in March as free DLC. This has caused a lot of outrage in the community, and is the reason for many of the negative reviews you will read
- No tutorial mode to help new players figure out combos. This can be solved with a quick Google search, but it would've been nice to have it already in the game. 
- Server issues. As mentioned, Street Fighter 5 has had some server issues on launch which are still being ironed out. It is still very playable online, but expect it to be more polished by next week. 

To conclude, Street Fighter continues to raise the bar in terms of it's core mechanics. It's an absolute blast when it's all working, and I see it being a very entertaining iteration long term.  If you are new to the series, I would highly recommend doing a quick Google search for your character's basic combos to help get you started, and stick to the 'Survival' and 'Training' modes for now.

If you are familiar with the series and are having trouble finding good games online, try searching for 'your system' only, and make sure to set 'Network Settings' to 5 only.

40,Street Fighter V,21383745,english,"This game has some of the most satisfying feeling combat. The animations and sound effects are just right, making it feel extremely meaty. Very satisfying to land hits in this game. The Characters are all pretty different thanks to the v skill and v trigger system. Ken and Ryu are not just simple copy and paste jobs this time around.

Lack of single player content be damned - this is some of the most intense fun online experiences i've had in a while and i'm someone who is relatively new to fighting games (started with usf4 in august last year). The more lenient combo system really helps to get down the basics and bnb's (bread and butter) of a character really fast, while the game still offers plenty of depth with footsies and general mindgames.


One thing though - for players who are starting out with sf v as their first fighting game:

The tutorial will not really be helpful for you, at all. You will have to search online and in the steam guide section to get you started. You will also need a lot of frustration resistence, because being a beginner means you will get blown up a lot at the start. It will take a time for you to get a feel for the flow of the game and when to press buttons and when not etc. Don't get discouraged, it will get better if you put in the time :). Also, now that the game is new, it's probably one of the best times to enter because there are other new people as well. When i started out with us4 it was 8 years or something into it's lifecycle, so people with 1000hrs playtime were much more common then people with low playtime or even beginners who just started out, too.


Capcom is in it for the long run with this game. Content WILL come and this game will be played for years to come.

If you aren't flustered by the lack of sp content right now on launch and only care about the online (which admittedly does have some server probles at the moment,let's hope todays maintenance fixes some of them) this game is imo well worth the money - considering you'll get thousands of hours out of it. Or you could always join at a later date,when more content has been added. In the end it is up to what you value the most i guess, but this is a fine game at it's core that was a bit rushed but feels just so good to play.

I would definitely recommend this to every fan of fighting games and newcomers, because now is the best time to join and learn. Later on people will already be pretty good and have figured everything out, making it harder for you to start.



If you are looking for sparring partners you can also just add me - i'm always on the look out for more people to play lobbies with.



Technical Stuff:

I have a pretty powerful rig, so running this game with max settings in windowed borderless mode (with borderless gaming app 8.4) in 60 fps is not a problem. I do play without AA though, because i think the one that the game offers is WAY to aggressive and introduces some weird ghosting/smearing artifacts or something. Game looks much cleaner with AA set on low and because of the constant 60 fps jaggies really aren't noticeable in motion.


I also did this to get rid of the motion blur while still having the other effects from the post processing apply: 

https://www.reddit.com/r/StreetFighter/comments/462cch/how_to_adjust_the_individual_postprocess_options/


Character models in this game are ace. Looking at them in the char select screen is just a treat - which makes the obvious clipping in some animations all the more disappointing. Backgrounds are pretty hit and miss. There are some cool ones, but generally they have pretty low res textures, 30 fps animations which stick out and super low poly models.

Soundtrack is in my opinion pretty good.

45,Street Fighter V,21354780,english,"Fighting games are about mechanics mastery. Street Fighter has always been about mastering the fight system of each iteration and using your mastery to compete with other humans. The reason that people buy fighting games is the same reason people play MOBAs, to 'git gud' at them and become able to beat other players. I bought Street Fighter V for this reason. 

Many are concerned about the lack of singleplayer modes. I can sympathize with this, but I must mention that if your goal is to gain mastery of the fight system in order to beat better and better players, your time is better spent fighting other humans rather than AIs. As it stands, if your goal is mechanics mastery, the game has what you need it to have in it right now. If you're choosing not to buy this game because it lacks singleplayer content, you probably weren't going to play it for more than a month. I presume that those who are declining purchasing the game because it lacks singleplayer content are those who already don't see the value, don't see the depth in what the game already has to offer in its multiplayer mode. If you don't see the value in that, then I assume you want to play Street Fighter V because it's the Next Big Game coming out. It's something to occupy your time for a short while before the Next Big Game after it comes out. This is a mistake. Fighting games, like MOBAs, are not about occupying you for a short amount of time. If you want to get any meaning out of this game, it is not such a game that you play for two hours after work before you go to sleep for the next day, forgetting about it once Dark Souls 3 comes out. It is a game that you must not forget about if you wish to gain the fullest amount of value from it. It is a game that will take many hundreds of hours to gain a respectable level of skill for. It is a game that requires a time commitment that is daunting compared to many other video game genres. If you do not have the patience to put the time in to get good, I do not think this game will be worth 60 dollars to you. And assuming you are waiting on the game already until it has its singleplayer modes patched in, you will get about 8 hours or so of playtime out of that. Then you might try online and get absolutely wrecked. You might spend two or so weeks trying to get good at online play, and then you'll quit because you're unwilling to put in the amount of time you will realize is necessary to beat these players. This is not meant to be a put down, or to be dismissive. This is just the experience of a vast majority of people when they first play fighting games. It was my experience. It will likely be yours as well. Most Steam users are at least familiar with DoTA, so I'll use it as a similar case. Street Fighter is a game that asks even more time of the player than DoTA does in order to get the most out of it. Please consider this fact before you make your purchase.

In summary:
This game is not for you if you're not interested in player versus player and are unwilling to put in the time required to harden muscle memory/gain general knowledge of the fighting system. I am, so that's why I'm recommending this game. This game is likely not for you if you only want to play singleplayer modes. I may be wrong on this point. You may find 60 dollars of enjoyment in the singleplayer modes the game will patch in within a few months that will likely only last 6-8 hours. If you feel that's the case, of course spend 60 dollars on the game, but if you find yourself wanting, don't say I didn't tell you so. ;)",1456023831,1456129985,TRUE,2,0,0.497925341,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.66E+16,161,7,8204,57,2131,1601597742

If you enjoyed the ranked system from USF4 you will be very dissapointed, ranked lobbies are no longer there and have been replaced with match making likened to 'quick search' in USF4, you know, the search option nobody used because it was shit. So basically instead of finding a lobby, joining and playing, you have to wait for 5 minutes for a match against a random that may or may not be laggy as hell because the bars indicating connection are not very helpful. 

You can't even play sets with your friends, there are no 8 man lobbies yet. And the as of right now the promised 2 man battle lobby doesn't even work.

Even though it is bare-bones right now, the fighting is a ton of fun. If you like to play people online like I do, I think you will have a good time. 

Combos are easier than in SF4 and it works out nicely because you are able to get into the mind games of one on one fights much quicker without that technique barrier holding you back. The gameplay feels great. Everything about the ACTUAL game seems to be great.

The features that are missing will be added someday.

Cons:

The features will be added someday, meaning they are not here now.

The game feels unfinished already and with survival mode being the only viable 1 player option right now, it's even worse because survival mode sucks.

If they fix the complete waste of time that is survival mode I would reccomend this game. It being hard is not my complaint. It is that it wastes your time. 

Example: In normal survival mode, fights 1-25 are easy, but you hit 25-30 and the difficulty ramps up hugely. So fights 1-25 just feel like a waste of time. If you lose on fight 29, you have to start all over again because its survival. Seriously, balance out the difficulty. I shouldn't be able to win fights 1-25 with crouching heavy kick. Then lose in some fight between 25-30 because the computer suddenly blocks, counters, punishes, and combos. It is the most jarring and frustrating part of survival mode. 

Not to mention the fact that you have to be connected to the server while playing it or it doesn't count. Imagine getting to level 48 in hard survival mode, and disconnecting from the server.

So yeah. Street Fighter V. This is a game that excels in many ways and is extremely disappointing in many others. The fighting is fast, fluid, and powerful. The input buffer makes combos manageable (no combo requires inputs faster than 1/10 of a second. Believe me, this is quite doable with a little practice). The characters are well balanced, and I actually like that there are only 16 fighters as it means each character had tons of time put into them and they all feel very distinct. Even Ryu and Ken are the most different of any SF I've played. 

However, this is a major failure on the part of Capcom. Why? Because they desperately wanted to get new players into the series but chose to omit any features new players would find useful. The in game tutorial is a joke, the AI modes are dumb, and there's very little to unlock in game and unlocking what is there is a pain. It's a real shame, too, since SFV has some of the most accessible fighting mechanics I've ever seen. 

If you didn't know, Capcom released the game as early as they did so the game would be ready for their eSports season. This is a good idea as the actual fighting is finished and polished, so competetive/hardcore fans can enjoy getting their hands on it and watching a compelling year of tournaments ending in the Capcom Cup. However, since the team put almost all of their efforts into getting the characters done on time, there is a severe lack of modes to ease new players into the experience. When a scrub goes online and gets bodied button mashing, they're not going to want to keep playing. You have to introduce them to the higher level strategy of fighting games so they can analyze their mistakes and stay motivated. Like, look at the Skullgirls tutorial. There's a part where they tell you what a mixup is and then you have to successfully guard against an AI throwing out some blockstrings. That's amazing! Now that player knows about how he or she should be throwing out their own moves. Plus the tutorials go into BnBs for each character. Actual, useful, helpful information instead of ""Every character has a unique V-System! Figure it out yourself! Okay bye."" 

I think Capcom, in chasing that MOBA money, could have done better with actually learning from Dota 2's release. Essentially, the version they released now should have been a ""Beta"" or ""Early Access"" or whatever catchy name they decided to use that you would have to buy. That way hardcore players can immediately play and the tournaments can still go on. Then, in a few months once they finished up the single player, newbie focused stuff, release the game for real. Either fully free-to-play (those costumes are going to make so much money anyway) or just on the cheap.

People have been expressing concern with many things from online gameplay, to controller issues, and lack of content.  I totally agree with the rage quitting and controller issues, and it's good that people are voicing their concerns so Capcom notices (although to be fair, my Qanba Q4 works just fine).  What frustrates me though is seeing how many people are annoyed by the lack of content.

If you look at SFV from a game design standpoint, it's VERY well thought out and removed a lot of the things people didn't like in SFIV (vortex, 1 frame links, powerful option selects, etc).  Yes there is a lack of one player content, but that's not what we should be complaining about and it doesn't mean they need to offer it less than full price.

What Capcom has done is like League of Legends or DOTA. They sell are selling you an expanding platform, and this was expressed many times by Capcom representatives.  They never said this game will be decked out with features at the start, neither did Riot, and neither did Valve. The only difference is how these companies are selling the product.

Riot and Valve give it for free and make you pay for what you want on the way. Capcom makes you pay for the platform and receive everything free. Same business model, different method of receiving money.  Considering the backlash Capcom has received for paid DLC before and the eSports route they're looking to take, this makes a lot of sense.  Also keep in mind the majority of features people are begging for will be here in a few weeks (arcade, trials, more characters, etc).

Yes, they need this shit to be out before Capcom Pro-tour and EVO, but for fuck sakes, make it stable at least.

Until they fix the netcode, training and practicing will be boring as shit/unplayable, and until they add in the full story mode and a good fleshed out challenege mode, this game won't offer anything to anyone, Online Warriors or Single Player Casuals.

Online matches are hard to find and even the so called ""5 bar"" connections aren't always a guarentee.

Even the goddamn Survival mode, a single player experience, doesn't fuckin' work. I've been kicked back to menu screen bunch of times half way through the mode because I've been disconnected from the server. 
WIth all the load time and time it takes to clear a stage, if a stage takes 1 min to clear means I gotta blow at least 30 mins to finish just the normal mode and I'll be fucked if I have to do that shit again if I get disconnected at stage 28.

Not to mention the brain dead AI in the ""Story Mode"" with it's all 2~4 fights of glory.

So, either wait till they fix this mess of a game and start late, or reward Capcom for this shitty practice by buying an unfinished game.

1,Street Fighter V,21259794,english,"=====Major Issue======
 Players are intentionally DCing from matches to fabricate their Online Rank and Winstreaks - otherwise known as ""Ragequitting"".
Ragequitting has been far too popularized over the past 2 days and is running rampant as there is no punishment system in place to even attempt to enforce honest play. As of the last 2 days 1/3 of my ranked wins were ragequitted out having nothing to show for the matches other than a few screenshots. Thanks to the absurd amount of server issues and rage quits I have 40+ hours in this game and next to nothing tho show for it to no fault of my own.
Leaving this Review as negative until Capcom addresses this.

===================

Less than 24 hours post (early) launch and the server issues have been heavily mitigated and are functioning just fine. The game lacks a serious story mode and pure arcade ladder but survival and early story modes should suffice as Capcom did state that the full story mode would not release along side the game.

In the current state the game caters to players who want to play online. If you are looking for a solid single player experience you can easily clear though all the basic solo content in a few sessions. Survival and training could easily net you a ton of solo play time if you are interested in getting gud. So be warned single players.

The ""main issue"" (so to speak) is controller support - but if you are the kind of person so splurge on a fightstick then you should be willing to spend 5mins implementing a temporary work around. Should Capcom have had implanted D-Input support at launch? Of course. But its far from a deal breaker.

The game is fun, the mechanics are solid, and there is a lot to do if you are looking to hone your skills and climb the online ladder or just play with friends. Netplay works very well albeit it can be difficult to find a match at times. There is a guaranteed years worth of updates planned for this game (both free and paid) and there is likely many more years of support to come. If you are looking for a solid fighter and your key interests focus on learning mechanics and playing online then look no further.

Pros: The game play is very new and interesting and imo is a great addition to the series. Free dlc incoming. New and returning characters on the roster. Playing the story/survival rewards you with colors + skins + titles.

Cons: The games online is a bit buggy but will be fixed. AI is really dumb but again its a fighting game so you shouldn't care. Too may ryus. 


But overall imo the games pros overwite the cons so I highly recommend this game if you liked the previous titles.",1455992394,1455992394,TRUE,3,0,0.545454562,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.66E+16,285,5,27283,183,1454,1601583427

Gameplay wise, it's fun, and much faster then previous SF's. I didn't really have any issues technically with launching or playing the game. That's about all that's positive. Oh, it also looks pretty.

The story mode is incredibly thin. It doesn't really offer anything in terms of cutscenes or a compelling story. You'll find yourself skipping over all the text just to get to the next match. From there, you'll probably head to training. 

Training is also weak on features. The command list is paper thin as well, and only offers the absolute basic inputs for moves. Nothing to be found for possible combos, or links, or how properties change in V-Skill, or what counters do, crush counters etc. etc. So you're left being pretty uneducated after training mode. Which is strange, because Capcom has changed a lot of things in this version of SF, and you're going to want to spend some time in training to learn it all before you go online. Speaking of online....

It doesn't work. I routinely experienced log in errors, which completely handicaps the ENTIRE game. There's almost nothing to do offline, and even when you're offline, you're required to log in to the server. So the server shuts down, and occasionally takes your game with it. Your match is dead, sometimes the game freezes, and you're forced to shut down. It's a complete mess right now and isn't worth your time.

  I remember when one could pick up a copy of the next generation Street Fighter and it would have more content than the last game, this game does not have any where near as much content as SFIV. On top of it's lack of content, it's matchmaking is slow. These are things that should have improved from one SF generation to the next. By not having more content than the previous generation or equal to, and not having a competent and quick matchmaking systems, that surpasses the last generation or is atleast equal to, makes the game feel like a let down.

  The game is great though. It's a lot of fun, learning combos and kicking peoples butt. I like that the matchmaking matches me with lower ranked people a lot, so I feel like I'm good. Also it's strangely enticing to get good at this game, the more you improve the more rewarrding the experience becomes. But this quality has been true to all Street Fighter games and this game hardly builds apon that, if anything it makes it more simpler to achieve that sense of gain.

41,Street Fighter V,21335183,english,"Including a TL;DR because i wrote a book; wait until March.

first off, street fighter 5 is actually in early access to push it's e sports scene so if you're the type who likes trials, and other single player content you are best off waiting until March. There's apparently a short cinematic story mode being later in June, so if you want the full experience you can wait until then if you're so inclined. This review is going to be aimed greenhorns of the series or people on the fence seeking additional information. This was written about 2/20/16 when most of these problems were still in circulation.

With that out of the way, this release of Street fighter 5 is more or less in line with the other games of the series. Gameplay is tight, simple but remarkably complex and most of the game information's will be found by trial and error or via word of mouth. Characters are extremely diverse, and delightful to play. Balance is currently quite stable with no real standouts in excellence or mediocrity. If you've never played a fighting game before you'll probably struggle to follow whats happening tthough. If you're the type to get easily frustrated, or not do homework on how to play outside the game, you will more than likely not have a very fun time.

Truthfully it's a game meant to be played with friends, locally or online. Most of the fun comes from it's competitive nature, and in the regard the game delivers very well. The first day or so, the online component was broken but that seems to have sorted itself out so you can enjoy either to your heart's content. There's still some definite server issues but for the most part it functions normally now. At the moment, lobbies, where you fight specific people 1 on 1 over and over again, currently only has slots for 2 people. If you have a big group of friends, the march content update will allow up to 8 players to play and watch, with the winner of every match staying on ala like an arcade system. The actual online service isn't just steam, by the way but rather Capcom's own system because the game supports crossplay. If you were hoping for communication via text or voice, then sadly you'll have none of that outside of lobbies. Lobbies only support pre-made messages via text, and has no support for voice. Online, ranked and casual has neither. I'm unsure if they have any plans to add such support but at the moment the answer is currently no.

Netcode is solid, though it uses a rollback system so when it is bad characters will literally teleport around, and makes for rather comedic matches where you literally cannot follow what is going on. The current problem, which i will touch on later, is frame skipping from people who aren't meeting 60 fps normally. This can create problems where a good connection can still have teleporting because the game is trying to force 60 when one player can't reach it anyway. There is no fix for this, and because this release does not include a benchmark tool, nor a PC rating filter any match can have this teleporting. Crossplay works great though so that's not a problem at all.

following up from the last point, the current release are noticably more gpu intensive than the betas, so if you say tried the cracked beta to get an idea of how the game will run for you, then decide to buy this you might find you will need to lower the settings than you previously did. Also something to note is the game does not appear to run any better if you try to lower settings beyond automatic, so if you cant run it well under automatic, you can't run it period at the moment. If you're a toaster anon, you'd best just save your money for a better computer, or look to less intensive fighting games on steam like Guilty Gear.

A special warning to Nvidia card users, Nvidia new drivers forces the game to run at 30 fps on some cards, like the gx960, and while Nvidia has confirmed this a bug they have not made it unclear when it will be fixed. I don't believe the beta had this particular issue so I don't believe there is anyway for you to actually check to see if you are effected at the moment beyond buying it. It does appear to effect any newer cards so if you have a titan x or the like you should be fine.

That said if you can run it, it runs great and looks nice. The music is nice, and the general presentation is very strong. Characters are all very clearly different and immediately apparent which is which. Even on lower settings it still looks very nice, so you can still enjoy the visuals if you can't run max on everything. The loading times are kind of shit but not too bad in comparison to ps4. 

There's a couple things you should know about controller support. Currently legacy support on a lot of fight sticks is currently spotty, and if you're a keyboard user you have to edit an .ini file to change your keybinding. Capcom has confirmed both these features are going to be improved however, so this could be fixed eventually.

As it stands my advice is to beginners is to wait, unless you're really hungry to play and don't mind/aren't affected by any of this. Everyone else should probably wait until march when presumbably these issues will be ironed out more.

I do look forward to the delayed release features and DLC, as it will give me things to come back to in a little while. If SFIV is any indication, we can expect many new characters and outfits.  Hopefully we will also get some more stages.  The characters and animations are simply gorgeous.  With Street Fightrer pedigree, the moves are repsonsive and balanced.  I do wish that it had an Injustice Style story mode that took you through different characters and had some cutscenes.

52,Street Fighter V,21331516,english,"I'm a big Street Fighter fan from the original SF days.
This game is a step backwards. No canceling moves, you can only play with a certain style which is catch people with connected combos. 
Characters are not the legendary SF characters. Sagat, Balrog, Sakura....all missing.

I dont know whats wrong with the connection either? it takes so long to find an opponent, I can cook a ramen and finish it and you'd still be waiting.

The art direction for the story mode is utterly rubbish. It looks like it was drawn by primary school kids. It looks like it was done in flash or microsoft paint. 

Overall, I enjoyed Street Fighter 4 more than 5. 5 is utterly crap. It feel unfinished, it feels like Capcom launched the crappiest version of SF in history.

64,Street Fighter V,21327637,english,"So I've seen a lot of Negativity over Street Fighter V, namely about the woes of online play (how quick we are to forget that MK X didn't work properly for 2 weeks eh?), the short story mode and survival being the only solo modes on offer.

That said however, I think of a lot the hateful reviews are being taken from a Rose-Tinted Glasses perspective.

Firstly, Online modes being the main focus? That's not exactly new and many of those same reviewers that have bemoaned SF V have had nothing but praise for every Call of Duty ever. Not exactly something I'd call Reputable and Trustworthy since Call of Duty has been nothing but a stripped down version of CoD 4: Modern Warfare for the past few years, with the stripped out parts being packaged off and sold to us as DLC.

The solo modes? How often does anyone actually WANT to play a fighting game solo for more than an hour honestly? You play the story, you forget about it, you move on to training mode, lobbies and online matches or offline versus your friends for the rest of it. While SFV has an unforgivably short story mode (it really is a ""Is that all?"" and can be finished in one 30 minute session) Survival mode is plenty long enough to get your solo fix, Hell Mode boasting 100 consecutive matches.

As for online, the problems are pretty much solved or being solved, DLC will be obtainable with ingame free currency (except premium costumes) lobbies are up and running and any and all content that adds new features or modes will be completely free.

All in all, SFV is actually a pretty solid fighter, with a Back to Basics theme that makes it more ""Street Fighter"" but with enough depth and new mechanics to keep it interesting at the higher end of gameplay.

Now I press start and the game tabs you out a few times till it manages to work it's way to the main menu. I mind you it's going at 10fps. Once at the main menu you try to turn the settings down and... oh wait! You're already set to 240x100 with everything at the lowest and you're now getting 60 in the menus but only 10-20 in game. You can be running 980ti in SLIx2 but that won't help you here cause you're going to lag. I have a 960m and an i7 4720MQ. This system was far more than capable of running the game at max settings 1920x1080 and achieving 60fps at the same time. Buy the game around late march if you really want it. That is the real release date.

Edit 1: I loaded up my desktop and I can play the game now. It has a GPU with roughly the same power as a 960m although it is still better. And it's AMD. The problem so far seems to be Nvidia's drivers that have caused the slow down in SFV. Currently running a Radeon 7870 and an i7 5820k @3.8Ghz. Though after putting some time into the game I see that the connection is terrible to everyone. I have 6Mb/s upload and 60Mb/s download. My ping is usually 20ms near me and across the country it is 50-60ms. (1 frame is roughly 16 ms in a 60fps game). The netcode for SFV (GGPO) uses rollbacks to give a smooth or seemingly lagless environment online. The problem with that is capcom totally has it messed up. So you're Ryu and you throw an EX fireball from full screen and the other player is hit by your hadouken. Then in a fraction of a second the player teleports from in the hit stun of the fireball to in your face. Their health literally goes back up, you lose the EX bar and they do a full punish. I am not kidding... this is how online is. Now USFIV has been out for a long time and the netcode, as bad as it was, was polished to a degree so this comparrison is a little unfair. I could, in USFIV, play someone from Japan with a 3 frame lag online connection (which is really good) and it would be impeccably stable. I can't play my friend in the same room online without lag in SFV.

Here is some more info.
My friend has dual 860ms in sli and an I7 4720MQ. Both of our laptops supprt wireless AC and so does my router. The connection over wifi from my router to either of our laptops is sub 1ms. So stop complaining that wireless creates lag. It might on wireless B but wireless N and AC are pretty safe bets on not being the cause of a bad connection. And my desktop is wired directly to my modem. I've tested it and the connection problems are not on my end and usually not on another persons end either. The game is simply laggy and nearly unplayable online. Even the best connections will have teleporting.

now for some positivity. I love the new combat system it is a really fun change from 4 which was starting to become very much a chore to play after the almost decade of playing it. that being. v triggers and v skills are a welcome change from the focus system and add a lot to fights for the most part. 

the online seems to have been patched up since its abysmal launch and I have a pretty good idea about the netcode. Its an improvement from 4 even though I still have games from time to time where characters will basically warp from corner to corner of the screen. prepare to lose, the matchmaking can be brutal and people better than you will beat you. fighting games are about learning from loss.

77,Street Fighter V,21320223,english,"Let me start off by saying I highly recommend this game if you're a fan of fighting games. If you're still on the fence I believe I can elaborate as to why this game is getting mixed reviews. People are expecting day 1 amazing netplay, and considering the scale that Street Fighter V is going for, its simply not reasonable to set your hopes so high with it being only 2 or 3 days after release. This game is doing cross-platform play (which VERY few games attempt) with global matchmaking (this cant be simple as other games opt for a region-based service). I recall playing World of Warcraft on opening day... Diablo III on opening day... didn't these Triple-A, 60$ games have problems? or am I trippin? Capcom has been diligently working on the online portions of the game as people provide feedback. They are also working on non-network related issues as well (you can always check with @SFVServer on twitter to see for yourself). As of this writing their last update was 1hr ago (from 9am EST). In any case, I have the utmost confidence that these issues will be resolved with urgency.

Currently, we have :
- Survival - (easy : 10 fights , normal : 30 fights , hard : 50 fights , hell : 100 fights)
these are used to unlock color palette swaps and 2 titles. They are done on a per character basis, and using the points you earn per 1 round fight, you can purchase boosters such as health up , attack up, etc to carry you through the ranks

- Training - you go here to 'git gud'.. there are multiple recording slots, the usual attack data read-outs and gauge set-ups. I haven't personally utilized all that training has to offer, but it is more than adequate.

- Story - For each character you can do a prologue of sorts, which lets you earn an alternate outfit (however at this time, the outfits are not readily available.. I heard they will be next month due to them still testing their Fight Money).

Net-play modes : 

- Battle Lounge - You make a lobby, invite someone and have at it without points or rank involved (Currently 1v1 only, as I imagine they are still doing testing)

- Ranked Match - You battle opponents via matchmaking to gain rank and Fight Money

- Casual Match - Like Ranked, this uses matchmaking but rank is not on the line here

Speaking of Fight Money, capcom has stated that all up-coming content will be unlockable with Fight Money~
*angelic music playing* Poverty, rejoice!

and finally, the Capcom Fighters Network.. CFN tracks a bunch of stats, and its also where you'll go to view replays, add a fighter to favorites (so you can invite them to your lobby), or possibly plot revenge as you study their weaknesses? lol? :steamsalty:

Sure the launch has been rough, but what online server hosted game hasn't had issues? And for the most part they have all been fixed. 

The lack of content? I mean sure, there isn't a super deep single player story to lose yourself into for multiple hours. But its Street Fighter, there never has been a super amazing story mode.  This game is about looking for a fight.  Wether it be online or offline, agaisnt a friend, or some random stranger arcoss you country or the world.

i already greatly like street fighter, but i won't be an apologist - the game was pushed out a little too early in the context of -- if you are a new player, you won't be getting much in the way of things helping you out, at least, during the launch - the story mode is going to be added at a later date, battle lobbys can only hold 2 people at the moment, -- along with a bunch of other features that weren't ready to be pushed out at the same time as the official game launch date

capcom is pushing this game to the e-sport level. i had a lot of competitive and casual friends buy it with various opinions on it. most of the competitive friends say its great, feels good, all the characters are vibrant and grandoise compared to their earlier counterparts - the more casual friends i have playing it don't have the past games for reference to make the comparisons on what has changed so they focus less on that and more on what they are currently getting instead of digesting the changes - which at launch, isn't overly much

anyways - it comes with pros and cons.

PRO:
- it is insanely fun, once you break the barrier of being able to think more on your opponent then how to do a fireball and uppercut at the right times
- it's built to last, given the slew of characters they are unlocking, once per couple months was the most recent rumour
- it is much more beginner friendly in regards to combos

CON:
- beginner friendly combos doesn't mean much if you don't know how to play the neutral - you have to go to 3rd party sources to understand that
- fighting games at their core are their maximum level of fun and engaging when your execution reaches a level where you can start concetrating on the match and situations, rather than what button does what and how to fireball - this is /no/ different

89,Street Fighter V,21313173,english,"Street Fighter 5 is a game which dispenses with the complex without sacrificing depth; all this while remaining the most accessible game in the franchise to new players that I am ever aware of.

Gone are the focus attacks and ""come-back"" ultras of Street Fighter 4; replacing them is the V-system: essentially a way to make every fighter play a little more uniquely and add another meter to manage. This increases tactical depth in a way in which new players can quickly access without complicated focus cancel combos. Simply pressing two buttons activates a vskill, while another two buttons activates the v-trigger and its associated effects. 

This is huge for people who don't benefit from years of fighting game muscle memory (usually the highest bar to entry in any title). 

Speaking of things that are good for people who don't have amazing muscle memory, Capcom has seen fit to give us combos of lesser complexity (most are three inputs!) and extended frame buffers with which to input our various commands. 

Lesser complexity combos means the barrier to entry is lower than ever and even a new player can enjoy the feeling of mastery that comes with mastering a simple ""bread and butter"" combo of a character without much grief, but it is the extended frame buffer which truly helps.

In offline play, this is huge as it allows players more leniency in inputting the complicated movements required of a fighting game. Other great fighting games such as BlazBlue and Persona Arena already utilized a similar system to great effect, but to my knowledge this is the first time it has shown up in a Capcom game.

Whether you're a highly skilled player or a complete ""scrub"" (new/casual player), you will appreciate the extra leniency in inputting your commands, but where this really shines is in online netplay. Netplay often has lag which can't be helped, often messing up a player in the middle of inputting a complicated input. Frame buffers provide that extra ""cushion"" which help guard the player from dropping commands due to lag. This creates an incredibly solid online experience.

And speaking of the netplay, the game has some of the best I've ever seen in a Capcom title (a lot of firsts going on here). I have been playing people I know to live on the other side of the continent from me (southwest to northeast america) and have very little lag at all, even crossplatform...

And ah, that is the real draw here. Most fighting games are relegated to their respective ""boxes"" of PC, PS4, and XboxOne. Since the communities are fragmented across games, the online lobbies quickly become a ghost town and ranked becomes something of an impossibility; this is especially true for PC fighting games who often suffer from smaller populations than consoles.

Street Fighter 5, on the other hand, can play crossplatform against Playstation 4 players with no problems. This is huge for keeping the community alive and vibrant and it means that, at least in North America, you will never suffer for a lack of opponents at all hours of the day.

So, I've touched on the actual gameplay being excellent, the netplay being solid, and the crossplatform play ensuring a long competitive lifespan.

Doubtless you want to know what the problems are.

This depends on what kind of player you are.

There is a class of player which expects a certain amount of singleplayer content in a fighting game. These players are very unhappy that, at the time of this writing, the game's singleplayer modes include training, survival, and story. These modes are not very fleshed out at the moment; survival has the dubious distinction of being the only way to unlock additional colors for a character and many of the competitive crowd don't want to touch it.

Even though it's designed for the singleplayer crowd, they are not happy with it and are stating that the game should have released with more singleplayer content.

If you are one of these players who plays a fighting game for singleplayer content, I agree; do not buy this game yet. Capcom has promised additional modes, but they released the game early for the competitive crowd so that we could enjoy the tournament season.

If, however, you are at all interested in the competitive aspect of this game (that means both competing and watching people compete!), then you should absolutely purchase this game. Don't think for a second that ""competitive"" means soul-crushing competition or a grind; I've been playing fighting games casually for nearly two decades and I enjoy it now more than ever. This is absolutely a game to play with friends, both old and those you make in the scene. The feeling of ""mastery,"" that is to say of getting better, is incredible and you might very well never stop learning new aspects of the hobby.

And that's what this is ultimately: a very cool, very accessible entry point to a great hobby.

Again, this is by far the most accessible street fighter ever; there is nothing quite like watching a tournament via stream and then replicating on someone else something you saw a pro player do. 

The feeling is euphoric and makes the hobby truly shine; if you are at all interested in the competitive or multiplayer aspect of fighting games, this is the best game yet to get into and you should buy it post haste.",1455869050,1455869224,TRUE,6,0,0.497942358,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.66E+16,2370,12,1837,0,876,1535837243

It takes me at the very LEAST 10 tries to get a SINGLE lobby game going.

The input buffer makes combos much easier so there is less of an artificial barrier between players.

In general, the higher damage combos start with heavier moves than in SF4 so more risk = more reward. V-skill is much more fun and varied than focus attack. V-trigger is more interesting and less of a revenge mechanic than ultra combos. Only supers can kill with chip damage in this game. Backdashes are no longer invincible. No more crouch tech and many option selects in general.

The roster is very fun and diverse, no clones, no terrible joke characters, and only two shotos (Ryu and Ken). And six more characters coming this year.

The matchmaking is very quick, with ranked points and leagues. You can join matches automatically in the background, in the main menu or in training mode or anywhere basically which makes it very easy to get games.

Some issues might be fixed at later date, this review won't be updated.

Pros
-Decent optimizaion/port for Capcom game.
-Simple, quick to learn, difficult to master game mechanics.
-Multi-play IS VERY FUN, provided that you can find a match within 5 to 10 mins, and play decent amount of game without disconnection.
-Cross server play!

Cons
-Personally find the game to have too little character.
-Server issues (Can't find match, frequent disconnetion).
-Needs 3rd party software for reconizaion of some external devices.
-Lacks off-line content (coupled with server issues, a ciritical at the moment).
-Personally don't think the game has 70 dollors worth of content, 110 dollors if you pre purchased season pass.


Personal conclusion.
If you are an absolute fan of street fighter and MUST play the game right at this moment, get it.  The game has a huge potential.

If you are not an absolute fan of the street fighter, but is looking for a good fighting game to play, hold off this game for now and get ""Guilty Gear xrd"" ""Mortal Combat"", these games are alot more ""Complete"" and you can pick them up with half of the price of Street fighter 5

I personally have refuned my pre-order copy of this game.
There is other good fighting games out there that is still fun, and at the moment Street Fighter 5 just isn't delivering what I want from the game,  
Instead of getting stressed over getting a match, and inconsistant server, I will just continue playing other fighting games which I don't have to worry about such issues, and will come back to this game, when it gets cheaper or contents that is worth the price are added.  By that time price will be droped a bit.",1455762973,1455838059,FALSE,67,3,0.567743719,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.66E+16,914,2,76,0,76,1455652750
10,Street Fighter V,21307214,english,I have been playing this all day. I'm not the greatest but I love the gameplay and the art style. Now that the servers are up online plays very smooth. Some things need to be fixed. It takes too long to load into a match or even find one.

11,Street Fighter V,21306064,english,"Functionally a great game. Though its release will sadly give it a bad image.

There are features that are usually staple that are being released for free in March (Challenges and longer Story Mode.) and the only play takes awhile to set up games, with 1-2/5 bar connections being teleport shit fests, although in my personal experience 3+/5 and it plays fine.

The new systems introduced are great, and make the game feel fresh and deserving of being the the next instalment and not another turbo remix. The V-Gauge replaces the ultra bar that was in SFIV. V-Skills (everything is V-something) are also introduced, giving each character another unique move for example Ryu is given a parry which is a returning mechanic from SFIII and Cammy is given a projectile-dodging spin attack. I haven't had a chance to mess with every fighter yet.

I was gonna type more but since the game isn't loading for me atm, I'm playing League. Great game, even without the few extra features.

12,Street Fighter V,21306964,english,"First things first: This game is easily in contention with Third Strike for best SF game ever made/ I've ever played. 
The gameplay is fantastic and it has never been easier for those with less experience to enjoy the mechanic-rich fighting system Capcom has been using and altering for years. 

Gameplay-wise, this is the greatest Street Fighter. But as of right now with the lack of content which was actually a thing Capcom did nothing to hide. I purchased the game knowing it was going to lack a few things which were promised later (for free) , but I have also been playing SF since I can remember touching a controller.

 In short, (terrible Launch aside) buy it if you love fighting games or SF and feel confident enough to do most of your fighting against real people online. If you care about single player functionality, now is not the time. In 3 months when everyone forgets what happened at launch and you never have to question whether or not you will be able to connect after getting home, SFV will be the undisputed king of 2D Fighters.",1455836888,1455836888,TRUE,20,2,0.575834394,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.66E+16,299,36,8780,0,1238,1585376271

However, anything that requires online mode is pretty much broken right now...constant disconnects, and extremely slow server response time if you can actually stay connected.  There's also a general lack of polish.  The store and arcade mode 3-round AI fights are missing.  Configuration options are minimal. (no benchmark to make sure your settings allow a full 60 fps, no option in versus mode to hold start for pause, only player 1 can choose to return to character select in versus mode, etc.)  Training mode options are unintuitive, and the shortcuts using RS are sluggish in taking effect.  The tutorial is terrible.

I'll be happy to change my rating when Capcom irons out all the wrinkles, but in its current state, it still feels like a beta.

17,Street Fighter V,21303913,english,"I don't want to have to not recommend this game but in it's current state, unless you really love fighting games, it's really not even close to worth full price.

Pros:
-One of the most solid fighting games in terms of mechanics on the market.  It's a bit of a departure from 4 but depending on what you want from the game that can be a good or a bad thing.
-Decent character roster.  With the exception of F.A.N.G. who seems to have a really shitty moveset (demonstrated by the fact that in 6 hours I have not fought one single person using him online) the rest of the characters old and new are fun and varied.
-The optimisation on my PC at least seems excellent.  The game can hold 60fps with no noticable dips with all settings maxed on my i5 and GTX670.
-Being able to unlock future characters which would otherwise be DLC through in game currency.

Cons:
-Fight Money is not called Bison Dollars.
-There is no store currently available for me to spend my 200,000 Fight Moneys in.
-The story modes available for each character are frankly pathetic.  When it was anounced to be a mode comparable to MK9/10's story modes which were a good few hours long each with nice in-engine cutscenes and all the fancy trimmings I got excited. What you actually get when you begin a ""Story"" is a well drawn still image for a minute or so while one of the voice actors says a few lines, then another still image for another minute or two with some more lines, then another, repeat ad nauseum for every single ""cutscene"" for every character.  I got bored after the first two and just skipped them all for every single character which left me with 2-3 fights for each character taking me a total of 48 minutes to complete the story mode.  Before you say that doesn't count because I skipped cutscenes, I say a collection of 30 still images is not what was advertised.
-The netcode while better, is still not great.  Even having restricted my search options to only the most compatible connections available I still get matches with opponents teleporting around me, random slowdown mid-match and depending on the time of day wait times up to several minutes to even find a game.
-The servers flat out were not working on launch.  This is unacceptable for a AAA game and even though it is the norm it leaves a bitter taste.  
-PC version is not compatible with any PS3/4/non-xbox sticks. This was a huge disappointment when I plugged in my Qanba Q1 and it simply didn't function.  There are programs you can use to fix it such as x360ce but with probably the biggest and most historic fighting game franchise in the world you simply shouldn't have to!
-The game is generally lacking in other game modes.  While to my knowledge SF games generally have at least a few different options for minigames and different things to do, in SFV there is no challenge mode, no minigames, you are limited to versus, story and a 30 match endurance/time attack mode.

Basically the whole game feels like they put time into the actual fighting, but everything else is pretty terrible and feels very cheap.",1455826495,1455826773,FALSE,2,0,0.474053293,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.66E+16,1600,37,2694,0,444,1569607677
18,Street Fighter V,21303609,english,"I personally find this game fun to play on but I come out of playing this game feeling that I Enjoy sf4 way more then 5. This is due to multiple reasons in which i will list Pros and Cons.
Pros:
-(When working well) Online is amazing to play on at a 5 bar connection
-New cast of characters breath some fresh air to play
-Easier to play for the scrubs to do 1 button combos
-Not Set play orientated like MKX 
Cons: 
- unless you set Connectivity on 5 only you'll have laggy matches
-Story mode is non existant
-There is No vs AI outside of training mode and Survival 
-Survival is a Joke, nobody wants to go through 190 damn boring AI fights to get all the colours of a character and a title FOR EACH CHARACTER!!! SO THAT'S 3040 BULLCRAP FIGHTS TO GO THROUGH!!! AANNNNDDDD colours don't unlock for a character they unlock for the costume, so if you want all chun li's colours play her through 180 fights just for the colours. 
-Lack of Combos is highly boring i don't see why having a lack of flashy combos benefits anyone under the idea of ""better for the scrubs""
-Locked off content (As of launch)
-OH AND A LACK OF FUCKINGLOBBYS FOR RANKED!!! WANT A REMATCH TO DAMN BAD!!!!!

I was unable to play on-line in the first day, some disconnects and unable to create a lobby to call friends to play made it impossible. Since on-line is not up to par, it would be better if the AI was a challenge, that way people can at least prepare to go on-line, when it gets better eventually.

20,Street Fighter V,21303229,english,"where do i even begin.

Lets just start from the beginning, I boot the game up and excited to watch the character montage movie like I do with every street fighter game, nope there isn't one.  The game jams you into a very pointless and stupid training mode (press x to punch, Pull back to block yippee)  but its running a slide show the frame rate is so bad.  The game starts up with max. settings and theres no auto detect, you actually have to go in and tweak the graphics then launch the game to see if your settings are good then if they are no you have to quit and go tweak, what the hell?  Next i thought i would plug in my fight stick and start playing nope, doesn't work.  Tried downloading some crap off the net to get it to work but it still doesn't.  At least my 360 controller works but that kind of sucks.  I jump into story mode good god, 2 one round matches and its completed.  The artwork inbetween rounds looks like it was made on the wii u gamepad, its just pathetic.  

I think the worst part of this game is and you might want to sit down to hear this, I'm not kidding here, you cant select your fighter for online matches, you read that right to change your fighter and stage you have to go into the options and select him/her there and if you want a different fighter and stage you have to go back into options, im dead serious.

mortal kombat x just wipes the floor with this game as far as content, modes and graphics go and even that had some issues with too much dlc.

34,Street Fighter V,21296558,english,"Disclaimer: Ive been playing street fighter games since i was a wee baby.

Early reviews for the game on steam mostly talk about a few thing.
[list]
    [*]Lack of Single Player Content
    [*]Legacy controller support and keyboard binding issues
    [*]Short Roster
[/list]
While this may be for the most part true i must state that the idea that you may be looking for a deep engrossing single player experience you will be deeply saddened and dissapointed. This isnt ""The Witcher"" or ""Fallout"". there is no vast open world to explore, and there definetly are no skill trees here. 

However you will find something within this title that you wont find in those titles, and that is a game that works both on a casual level in your living rooms with friends, as well as a competive game you can spend thousands of hours learning the nuances to playing specific characters, matchups, 

While the roster currently is nothing to brag about in size (although an additional 6 characters will be added in this year alone with promises to continue to support this product), its worth stating that each character in the roster is very unique in playstyle, appearance, and overall usage, Character designs that were used in previous games are completely new and different, with no copies of play style in the roster. where as if you were to compare it to other similar games or previous games you would find that most characters on the roster fit one of a few designs or archetypes and thus would be clones of each other with slight differences.

As for Controller issues and binding issues there are work around and while it seems silly will be a non-issue in a month's time, its worth noting that it is inexcusable that you are not even able to use a Playstation 4 fight stick for this title without 3rd party software, concidering the playstation 4 fightstick is branded for Street fighter V. The fact that you cant change the keyboard binding is another wierd thing that would seem like a no brainer.

I was lucky to suffer less from the server outages, probably because I delayed my playtime a few hours. Aside from that, it's pretty good, I already have a good amount of fight money from farming Survival mode, I hope this is enough to buy my honey Juri I loved in SF4. 

I'd say, only buy this game now if you intend to get competitive. There is also a normal versus mode if you're buying it for funsies with friends at a party, but that's for when the game is abour ten bucks. Buy Skullgirls or MK Komplete Edition or even any Tekker for that kind of family fun.",1455802531,1455802531,TRUE,1,0,0,1,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.66E+16,186,17,2080,0,404,1478382294
38,Street Fighter V,21295467,english,"I'll go ahead and start with the cons.

1. If you play fighting games for the single player experience, you're better off waiting until the June update to pick this game up.  The single player experience in this game is severely lacking as it currently stands.

2. If you want comprehensive lobbies of up to 8 players with spectating features, you're better off waiting until next month when these features will be added.

3. While the servers have now mostly stabilized, there is still an occasional downtime, so if that's something that you just can't bare, I'd suggest riding it out for another week or so until they get everything figured out.

Now the pros.

1. This game is extremely comprehensive with characters.  Even with the currently ""limited"" cast of 16 characters, I guarantee you're likely to find at least 1 to your liking.  New player or veteran alike, every character is extremely diverse, with more to come monthly over the next 6 months.

2. I have had zero graphical problems, and this game seems to be extremely well optimized.  To be fair, my PC is relatively powerful, with an R9390 and a 6600k under the hood, but this game ran like a charm right out of install at 60 frames constant.  No frame drops or graphical lag in sight.

3. When the servers are up, my connections with other players are solid, and the netcode is actually very good.  One in ten matches or so I run into a rollback or two, but it's something you grow to accept playing fighting games online.  I play many fighting games, and this games netcode is probably the best I've encountered.

4. The training mode, where most players new and old alike should be spending the lions share of their time in a new fighting game is extremely comprehensive.  5 recording slots for dummy actions.  Wake up actions.  Great input and attack data displays.  All the data you need to learn a new character, practice your links or anti-airs, or even just commit special moves to muscle memory if you're new.  It's all here and better than ever.

To summarize, should you buy this game?  Well it depends.  If you're a single player warrior, I'd hold out for a bit longer, but if you're the type of player that loves to get their hands dirty learning a new game and playing other humans there is plenty here to sink your teeth into until more features come out down the line.  I've already gotten quite a few hours of fun out of this title, and I feel like I'm only beginning to sink my teeth into this one.

My experience:

After downloading the game, I ran into the first encounter, being that the game didn't start up after clicking it. Aided by the mighty ally google-san, i found the solution! Keep hitting the start game button until the code eventually submits and cooperates.

Game launched! Stage 1 complete!

Unfortunatly after the game launched, nothing happened. Despite repeating my strategy from the previous stage, smacking the launch button over and over, no improvement was seen. Once again I called upon google to aid me, soon after I was granted the answer ""disable your anti-virus"". After disabling the malicious anti-virus installed on my system, I hit the launch game button a good dozen times, and ..

Game launched and ingame! Stage 2 complete!

I found myself in a part of the game which i did not activate or select, which was unappealing since I wanted to go straight to multiplayer. After completing this trivial yet tedious task, I found myself in the main game. I guess the tutorial just starts after the intro screen, and warnings are for the weak!

Currently I am on stage 3.5, which is me trying to get onto the server so i can do multiplayer, preferably against people on the same continent.

Had a good number of matches in a short span of time through Fight Requests while in Training Mode.

-There may not be a lot there but what is there is amazing. 
That being said it follows the history of Capcom Street Fighter releases so here is a short summary of what you are going to get.

The Good

- The Fighting: No seriously this is easily one of the best Street fighters released. The actual fighting is fast and fun and extremely well-polished. If you are a fan of the SF series you will feel right at home and if you’re new it one of the easiest and cleanest Street Fighters to start with. 

-The Characters: Every character is unique, interesting and pretty well balanced. They have a great and unique cast this time around bringing a lot of veterans back, some fresh faces, and some fun surprises.  The small cast is also great for learning match ups, and experimenting with playstyles, and learning the game. 

-How it Runs: 60FPS, 0 Sound glitches, Beautiful graphics. This one is simple, it runs and it runs damn well.  Can't ask for much more there.

-Training Mode: In short, it’s what you've always wanted in training mode. Lab time has never been more rewarding. 

The Bad

- There isn't much there: This is many peoples biggest complaint right now for good reason. 12 characters, 4 Modes, and a lack of costumes and colors is all you are really getting with your money. Treat it like early access, 60 bucks for more stuff down the road. Story mode is short, a few easy fights and some voice acted cutscenes. No Alts or colors for really anyone. It really is bare bones. 

- Controller Support: There is no native controller or fightistick support. You cannot customize your controller settings either. That being said there are 3rd party apps that are very easily to download and use in order to connect with your fightstick. After using one I can now launch the game and have no problems using my stick. 

The Ugly

-Server Issues: Servers are unstable at the time of writing this. Online matches are hard to connect to and can be very laggy and unusable. On top of that fight money to unlock the characters coming in the coming months are un-earnable right now due to the online connection problems. Hopefully this will get fixed soon.

I was well informed about the state of content when purchasing this game. I have, of course, been following the game's development in the media. So I'm not surprised/disappointed in that. 
 
What Has got me down is the main slice of the cake (online play) is pretty damn terrible at the moment. Lounges (similar to endless game mode) is practically broken. My friend (PS4 user) and I cannot join each others lounges due to it breaking after invite. Joining stranger's lounges is big gamble too. Should we be able to join a match, regardless of mode (casual, ranked, lounge) it's another big gamble on the lag.  
 
8/10 matches have been infested with lag mites where my opponent and I are literally shooting in the dark till one of us wins. With false hit confirms, teleporting and all the other delicious aspects we've come to expect from a bad netcode. Not only that... but there's a chance one might DC from the server entirely after each match. 
 
I'm really routing for this game... I really am. But to leave such a bad impression on day one and accumulate so many negative reviews is just bad for business. It perhaps would have been a better strategy to pitch this game as ""Early Access"" while gaining customer feedback, given them the opportunity to correct all this before official release. 
 
Anyway... my aforementioned mate will be coming round to duke it out 90s style. I'm sure that can't possibly go wrong.. right?! o_O

EDIT: SO our fouth game in last night and I'm disconnected from the server... which decided to INTERUPT our OFFLINE match.

Capcom has been upfront about this release: they pushed out the barebone game in order to get it in the hands of the players and have the CPT focused on SF5, with regular content updates planned.

People complaining about no story is hilarious; it's a fighter, almost no one ever plays arcade/story mode, and if they do it's just for unlocks and achievements. People complaining about the number of characters just shows how ignorant and unfamiliar with the series they are, SF always launches with around this many characters. Servers always have problems at launch, it sucks, but it will pass.

The only legitimate complaints I will grant people is the lack of keyboard binding and d-input (which in part is due to Unreal Engine), but it's easy to work around if you have half a brain, and will likely be fixed soon. Also Survival mode is absolutely retarded.

 - New characters.
 - On par animation.

+ CONS:
 - Random disconnect
 - fragmented contents.
 - No keyboard mapping.
 - Confused game setting option.
 - Bug can drop off all controlling device.
 - No 2nd costumes usable.
 - Splitted preorder bonus
 - Annoying survival mode, especially with rabdom disconnection.
 - De facto a BETA version and premature release.

I love FTG just because it is amusing to play character with various costumes with friend.
Hence, I have very low stardard of a FTG, even if it is utterly unbalanced.
However, SFV has broken the lower limit on every aspect.

The problem is, CAPCOM twisted the game content.
Yes, Genuine SF IV sported with only 16 characters, but all of them have 2nd costumes.
Story modes, and everything a TYPICAL FTG should have.
But, we have to wait until June to have a SF V roughly equal to the beginning of SF IV.

Current SF V only have a broken network functionality.
Offline contents are terribly scarce.
Worse, the preorder content are splitted meaninglessly into mutiple platform.
How many of you think you will get beard ryu because it appeared everywhere before the launch?

There is only ONE true reason everyone discard this title:
INTENTIONAL CHEAT.

CAPCOM splitted already scanty preorder or release content to pieces.

The story mode takes a grand total of 2 hrs MAXIMUM if you sit through all of th cut scenes, otherwise each character gets like 2-3 fights and then they are done and the fights are super easy. The servers are constantly iffy. First day I had no problem getting on the servers then today (Which is 2/17/2016) I logged in, got on the server, did a little training mode, got booted from the server, spent 5 minutes getting back on, got on again, then promptly got booted. 

Gameplay-wise its up there with the best of the franchise. Each character is unique and has their own feel to them. Series staples like Ken, Ryu, and Chun-Li feel new because of the V-Trigger system. New characters kind of fit in, but overall I was not pleased with some of their designs and stories.

Basically:

Gameplay-wise 8/10: Its solid, runs fine, no major issues. Characters are fun. Its a solid street fighter game.
Gamemode-wise 5/10: Online is buggy, story mode won't keep you on the game long (See my game time which includes some training mode time). No way to spend your fight money earned in story mode yet, so you'll be sitting till March to use it.

Bottom line: If you really like the series, get it and pray the servers get fixed. If you are somewhat of a fan or you want to get into the series but aren't sure, come back in march and check how stuff is.

4,Street Fighter V,21283452,english,"A bad mess...

And that's coming from a Street Fighter fan. Everything from connecting to the servers, to even the fights in ""Story"" mode aren't working. And what's worse, you can't play any online matches at launch! I don't know about you all, but that is unacceptable, and something that you wouldn't see on old games. It's a trend that has been going on more and more recently, and even if it's from a game I love it has to be stood up against.

The actual gameplay mechanics of Street Fighter are present. The new, and returning characters feel fresh and a welcome to the veterans and newcomers alike. This gives the game a sense of refreshment. 

I was really excited for the ""Story"" mode -- and I put that in quotes because I'm not sure if it certifies for that-- and it feels lazy. Each character has their own story, however each shortly lived with not much lore added to the overall Street Fighter canon.

One thing to note: I love that the future DLC releases will be optional to pay, and can be purchased with in-game currency (fight money). And for THAT, I tip my hats at Capcom, as it isn't very common I see this from a company notorious for frequent new releases like the Super, Turbo, and Ultra releases, each with their own updates and new characters. You can expect to buy this version of the game and not have to worry about future releases of newer versions now! Moving in the right direction, Capcom!

Would I recommend this game? Well, that depends. If you're a person looking for a solid fighting game, then look no further, but let it be known that in the current state, it's a bare-bone games with the core elements the only thing that feels complete. With future updates and more integration of modes like a real Story mode, Arcade mode, and trials, I think this can very well become a game that everyone can enjoy, much like Street Fighter IV. 

Until then, I really don't recommend this game in its current state for the person that has no love for this franchise. Maybe wait a few months, and see how it goes from there to ""Rise Up.""",1455745567,1455745567,FALSE,3,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.66E+16,40,1,9298,0,586,1542180457

The tutorial itself is even more barebone than Mortal Kombat X and the Training is lackluster in terms of options. Acquiring colors from Solo Modes is almost impossible because if you get disconnected, you lose your entire progression and you can't earn any form of currency offline which means that this game is always-online! There's no Player vs. CPU, the Prologue Mode (the Story as of yet) is lacking in every respect (and I thought Killer Instinct was a bit disappointing).

7,Street Fighter V,21282960,english,"There is so much wrong with how this game was delivered.

- Pathetic excuse for a story mode
- No CPU Versus option or arcade mode
- Must be online in order to earn experience, even in the offline game modes
- Kind of a big deal, considering the servers still don't work and drop you within minutes
- Losing connection to the spotty servers returns you to the main menu, including if you were in the middle of training mode, story mode, survival mode, or any other offline mode.
- Lobbies don't work, and only allow for two players tops, despite the icons implying we'd have up to 6 people in a lobby.
- No way to play with a friend without a lobby
- No way to quickly rematch in a lobby, have to go through the entire proccess of loading into the main menu again, and load back into a match again.
- Zero options to aquire alternate costumes post launch
- Direct Input controllers are not supported. Only Xinput controllers work (For anyone who doesn't know, this means that only Xbox 360 controllers will work. PC controllers, PS4 Controllers, or any other kind of gamepad are not supported. This isn't an issue for me, but it's absolutley unbelievable).
- Keyboard controls can't be rebound.
- Keyboard is permenantly registered as ""Player 1"", meaning that you can't play locally together with one person on keyboard and one person on controller.
- The game runs BEST at your screen's native resolution. Anything less and the game lags (what???).
- The game lags in windowed mode for seemingly no reason (I've got a R9 390, this is NOT a hardware issue).
- Alt-Tab breaks the game view when you return and puts bars all over your screen.
- The above three issues mean you can't do anything else on your system EXCEPT play the game.

40,Street Fighter V,21276357,english,"I'm glad I purchased this on Steam vs PS4, so I was able to request a refund. I was very excited about this game and have been looking forward to getting back in to fighting games for a while. I have an iPAC2 and a bunch of arcade parts at home and was looking forward to building a fight stick and getting back in to fighting games after 10 years of being not that in to them. After seeing how Mortal Kombat X developers completely screwed PC users by just dropping support for MKX with the MKXL announcement, it seemed like Capcom was taking the high road. One SKU to buy that would get all future updates, rewarding players for actually playing the game by supplying them with in-game currency that could actually be used to buy future DLC packs... I was excited for all of this.

Instead, what I got, for a full-priced AAA title that's been in development and in active beta for quite a long time, was a game that's worth at most $30. I understand the day-one server issues. Dumping an unknown day-one load on to a server farm has never yielded a positive experience for any online game that I've ever played. There are always issues... I get that. Unlike some others, I was also fine with the number of characters - 16 at launch. I'm a Ryu/Ken player, so those two are all I'd use anyway. The rest of the 16 are diverse enough to be fun, and I'd rather have 16 polished and balanced characters vs a 40 character roster where half of them suck.

Where I was disappointed was the lack of arcade mode, which I didn't know wasn't there until after I bought the game. I probably could have found this out through reading reviews, complaints, etc. but I generally try to stay away from that stuff day-one, since it's all negative. Typically anyone who disagrees with any part of the game is online complaining about it, while the vast majority of people are playing the game and loving it. I usually never let the vocal majority influence my decision in purchasing. HOWEVER, arcade mode has been a staple in fighting games since... well, forever. Would it have been that hard to implement? I don't think so. PLUS, it would give us something to do on day 1 / 2 while the servers were all down and/or being rebooted several times a day. There is a ""story mode"" for each character, but it's slapped together and seems really half-assed.

Another thing that I've seen a lot of people complain about - the people that have been able to actually play online mind you - is the fact that Capcom doesn't punish anyone in any way when they disconnect from a match when they're losing. This really sucks, because you have all of these idiots who don't want to show how much they suck with the win/loss ratio that they deserve. I hope they fix this. A disconnect should be a loss.

To sum it up:

Pros
+ The game is PRETTY with settings maxed
+ Character animations are great
+ The game, from what little I've been able to play, seems balanced
+ Could be a great game if they would fix it
+ Trying to do the right thing with in-game currency and DLC

Cons
- No arcade mode
- Basically no offline play at all 
- Story mode seems slapped together and unpolished
- People have complained about Direct Input. If SFIV had it, this should too
- Capcom doesn't punish disconnect-whores
- Unfinished game

I'll probably pick this up again when most of the bugs are fixed, but for now I'd rather spend my $60 on something that I can actually play and enjoy. It sucks that Capcom dropped the ball on this.

46,Street Fighter V,21275950,english,"While I have never wrote a bad review for a game, this will be my first. I am looking back at street fighter 4. A game that had lots of Offline content you could play by yourself and an excellent online environment.

THE GOOD


So lets start with the good in this game.
Fighting wise everything seems really tight and refined. There is quite a bit of depth and a long road to mastery  for the characters. I like all of them, they all look absolutely awesome. Basically at it's foundation it's a rock solid fighting game. Visual effects are very nice, Hit boxes seem to be fair. Inputs are precise, although take getting used to from other fighting games.
Moves in them selves are easy to do. It gets much harder when you string them together, which is part of where the depth comes from.

The characters seem quite varied and so far balanced. I really have no complaints for the actual ""fighting"" in the game.


THE BAD


The servers are just horrible. They have crashed quite a bit. Which you may say, that's fine, I'll just play offline instead. Well here is where things begin to suck.
So first off any offline activity that rewards Exp/fight money ie Story/Survival. Will no longer help you progress your account as all rewards gains of such nature are disabled. Considering what I've heard that some costumes (story mode ones) cost 40,000 fight money and new characters cost 100,000 each. I'd say you are missing out on a lot.

It gets EVEN better. Say you are playing survival mode right? You are just killin it and you are just about to beat it. Well lol guess what the servers just went down. So that means it will rip you out of that mode and made everything you just did all for not.  I found that to be extremely frustrating especially as a relatively new player. I never got into street fighter 4 simply because I had that soul calibur addiction. That said the abysmall amount of single player content just sucks.

I  like to be competitive but at the same time I'd like more bang for my buck. Most games have story mode.
Street fighter's story mode is a joke.  2-4 rounds at max. By that I mean say you pick ryu. You fight chun li ONE round, you win, then you fight ken or something 1 round. You win, end of story. It's that stupid. Why even add it? 

The tutorial is garbage. If you haven't ever played street fighter it is going to give you part of the basics. It doesn't tell you how to use EX version of moves, there is no explanation for the effects of certain moves, nothing. So it's not very beginner friendly. I get that it's street fighter 5 (or whatever number in the series) That said there are still new comers and it's quite nice to have a good tutorial or guide somewhere within the game. Even if it is all written with some screen caps. It'd be nice. 

The shop is close until march meaning you can't buy anything. No skins, no titles, nothing. That would be cool and all if maybe we got something other than some alternative colors or were allowed to buy the skins from the story mode which already exist and can be seen in the game.

If you don't have a friend in the physical realm who comes over and plays games with you/ a solid internet connection. Don't even bother with this game. There is barely anything for offline play. You can't even play versus against a bot. You are only limited to another person or by playing bots in survival mode. Survival mode is fun... but it's not going to be 2 weeks fun let alone a month. Challenge mode is also not available til march


So let's get to the online portion

Matchmaking takes forever. I mean a long long long time.
Battle lounge.... seems like why is there an option to join when every option is either FULL, No longer exists, Disconnected
It'd be so much nicer if you could have casual match ups just feed you matches with the option for another round if you want to. That way you are out there experiencing many different playstyles and getting more matches. 

As it is now. I'd call this game unfinished. I'd give it a 20$ value for what it is now. I'll change my review if/when it improves in the future. Til now I'm quite salty over my 60$ purchase for what I see as an incomplete game.

If I were to look at games I enjoyed playing  (fighters) It'd of been the soul calibur series, blazblue, and tekken. At least I could get a lot of matches quickly and the online was good enough I had fun (blazblue having flawless online in my experience)",1455722744,1455722744,FALSE,2,0,0.502762437,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.66E+16,127,5,548,0,420,1456358933

49,Street Fighter V,21270191,english,"[h1] ""Street Fighter V: same game edition, or a brand new experience?"" [/h1]

Ever since I received a beta invite, I sort of disliked how different Street Fighter V was to the other games before it, but I never thought it was a terribly bad decision overall.
Now that the full game has been released, I've found all the worries I had were addressed over the beta periods.
Soon after realising the game was a blast to play compared to the previous Ultra Street Fighter IV, I quickly fell for Street Fighter V's renewed focus on fundamental skills and measured play.
I'd go as far as to say that this may turn out to be the best Street Fighter for both casuals and veterans alike.

[h1] More strategy! [/h1]
There are no universal safety nets like Street Fighter IV's focus attack. Instead, each character has unique methods for dealing with threats, resulting in varied and tense fights. In the hands of a casual player Street Fighter V's new mechanics are satisfying with low execution demands. 
At tournament levels, however, they're technical and strategic tools that demand a great degree of understanding and mastery. I can already tell that Street Fighter V is making me think about the fights and type matchups, while being less reliant on easy counters.

[h1] An unstable matchmaking system (CFN) [/h1]
Crucially, I don't feel like I've had enough experience playing online. With a small player base and both the beta and launch servers in flux, it's too early to properly judge the net code and, as a result, deliver a solid verdict. 
When I have been able to fight online, my connection has been very sporadic with the majority of my matches ending in a disconnect half way through the match, but not all of my online battles had this problem occur. 

[h1] Missing single-player content... [/h1]

Street Fighter V has so little single-player content at launch that the efficacy of its online components is paramount.
The lack of extra-curricular activities is a huge problem, especially for casual Street Fighter players. 
The ""Challenge Mode"" activities intended to help you build skill and earn in-game cash was not ready for launch. 
There is a short story campaign for each character, and by ""short,"" I mean that they last anywhere from two to five minutes, spanning two to four fights from beginning to end. 
In the case of Fang, one of the four newcomers on the roster, he has only two fights against one opponent (M. Bison), and that's it. 
Every battle in story mode is also incredibly easy; you can win by simply spamming projectiles.


[h1] Disappointing cut scene art... [/h1]
You may have heard that Bengus, the artist responsible for some of Capcom's most iconic artwork, has created visuals for the character stories, but don't get too excited: the quality of work here is a far cry from the beautifully rendered art he produced in the '90s and early '2000's...
The storyboard-like images here are inconsistent in quality, with noticeable disparities in detail from one to the next.
While it's disappointing, the cut scene audio that accompanies the badly drawn artwork is phenomenal. Each actor gives a great performance for each character.

[h1] Broken online progression system [/h1]

The upside to finishing the character story mode is that it nets you 100,000 Fight Money, but only once. Based on Capcom's plans for the near future, that sum is just the right amount to purchase a new character. 
You also unlock a new costume in story mode, but you unlock it for purchase from the in-game shop, not for immediate use. I expect this sort of thing from free to play titles like Tekken Revolution for PS3, but not from a full release fighting game. 
The fact that the game ties every significant unlockable to one form of currency or another is frustrating, but you can't put your earnings to use yet because the in-game store isn't ready. 
Furthermore, the valuation of Fight Money, relative to what it takes to acquire it, is weird. 
A hard fought victory online nets 50 Fight Money, which seems like peanuts when compared to the 100,000 fight money received from the crudely drawn story sequences.

Otherwise, you're left with Survival mode; and that's it. It's serviceable, offering four tiers of consecutive fights where you can unlock new colours for each character's default costume, but by allowing you to trade in points earned during rounds for health and power boosts, survival turns into an easy snooze fest...

[h1] Verdict: [/h1]

Street Fighter V is a clean slate, for better and for worse. It's got new and returning mechanics, characters, move sets, and peculiarities that change the flow of combat in exciting ways, but it doesn't have much to entertain anyone who isn't a competitor. 
Despite its mainstream appeal, Street Fighter is known for having esoteric systems beneath the surface that most people miss. That is as true as ever with Street Fighter V.
It means there is depth to explore for those who want it. With the right tutorials and activities at their disposal, new players should be able to understand these over time, but I'm not certain when these tools will arrive or what they will offer.
When I'm playing Street Fighter V with friends, I'm completely lost in the heat of the moment. Win or lose, I'm attracted to the thrill of its action-oriented combat system, which discourages overcautious behaviour and keeps fights moving along. There's an excellent foundation here, and for now, I am going to keep playing until I've got a more structured opinion on this game. 

For now, this review is only based on my beta participation and the 3 or so hours I've spent in the full release.
When the time comes, I'll update the review with a more fleshed out review.

 It feels like you're supposed to pay the developpers so that they can complete the developpement of the game (whereas usually they make the game THEN sell it to ppl as a the complete product). 

The so-called story mode is a series of 2d drawings (3 drawings with a total of 6 dialogues at most) followed by a 1 round match, repeat this 3 times and you get 100% completion for one of the fighters. WOW. Really? Worst story mode i've ever played... People should be warned about this.

And no VS computer battles.. and no arcade mode...seriously I have nothing more to say..

Complete rip-off.. and a total waste of a good franchise... DO NOT BUY.. not until the devs come to their senses and make a complete overhaul of the game. (as opposed to those who bought the game early and got screwed over).

+Gameplay is better than Ultra Street Fighter 4. Combos are easier to pull off.

+Training Mode works well.

The Bad:
-Story mode that's released right now is a joke. It is the WORST single player content in fighting game history. After the release of Mortal Kombat X, this one as of released is abysmal in terms of single player content. We're not asking for Naruto Ultimate Ninja Storm 2 level of story or single player content... even Skull Girls have more story than this game.

-No challenge mode. You're clueless in trying to figure out what combos might work for your character. You'd have to go on YouTube to look for guides.

-The guy who made the tutorial should be ashamed on what he made here. The ingame cutscenes are doodles (some of them atrociously made) with voice overs. SHAME. 

-Hair pulling in getting my custom fight stick to work.

Personally, I think $60 is a bit steep for the game in current state. Many months of free content is promised to be released, so use your own judgment to determine whether or not it's worth it. This game will continue to improve over the months and potentially years to come. Although the release was weak, I believe it overall deserves strong community support to continue improvement and success for a new generation of Street Fighter.

95,Street Fighter V,21267917,english,"Hate to do this...but for now, don't buy this game. I'm honestly regretting it right now. You can read it in a plethora of reviews here, but I'll say my piece, and like many others, will update once things have settled down.

Servers:
Wow. This is...just wow. I got in loads of play time, and I mean LOADS while in the beta for this game. Everything worked wonderfully, not a lot of lag regardless of platform or location. Now, on ""release"" I can't even log in. When I do finally log in (and stay logged in long enough to try anything) nothing works. I spent a solid ten minutes sitting waiting for it to find a ranked match. So I tried to make a private room to invite a friend...nope. Always fails. There, essentially, is no online functionality right now. None at all.

Side note, no online prevents you from getting rewards in...

Story Mode:
Wow. Just. Wow. This is truly a terrible thing to behold. I'm pretty sure I've seen six-year-olds draw more detailed pictures of SF characters. I mean, seriously Capcom, what the actual heck? This is the laziest excuse for a story mode I've ever seen. Titan Fall has a more fleshed out story mode in it. Why not just give us an arcade mode instead? I know, I read that story mode wouldn't come with the games ""release"" but still...dang.

Control:
Well, I mean, if you want to mess with Joy2Key, yeah. If you like playing on an XBone controller, sure. Controls great. For real though, why would you ""release"" a game that you can't even re-bind things. That's some BASIC funtionality right there. Ouch, Capcom...ouch.

Sound is great, I like the in-battle visuals. But, that won't make up for everything else.

Overall:
You might note I always say ""release"", and that's because you are paying full price for a broken beta of a game right now. Capcom put out Street Fighter V: Early Access, and I am not okay with it.

1,Street Fighter V,21267604,english,"Overall, I like it.  

It feels more forgiving than Street Fighter 4 (so far, I haven't played for a long time yet).  

Graphically I'd be hard pressed to say it's much differerent really, not so much of a step up but SF4 already looked extremely good.

It is missing a few features but it ran fine when I played story mode for a while.  When I exited there was an error box that popped up but otherwise there were no obvious bugs aside from the lack of network support (to be added soon they say).  No lag or frame drops at 1080p but I'm running on an Nvidia Titan so that's no surprise.

I'd say this is a strong runner up as a contender for the best fighting game in the world when you factor in having modern graphics and gameplay that isn't frustrating.  Mortal Kombat X is extremely good looking, maybe better than this, but isn't much fun to play-it feels sort of stiff and lifeless by comparison.

GUILTY GEAR Xrd -SIGN- is the absolute best fighting game in the world currently, bar none.  Try it and you'll see why.

3,Street Fighter V,21267396,english,"So I wrote out a long review and Steam lost it so heres a short one.

I like the game. If you want to know the features it has please read the store page, I want to specifically address peoples concerns here.

Issues people have....

Limited fightstick support - Can be fixed with JoyToKey. Not ideal, but they plan on fixing it in the future.

Missing features - This was announced, and if you dont like it pretend the game comes out in March, if you preordered the game before this was announced you would have paid anyway, I like having 2 weeks to earn some FP before the stores open.

Art style/Graphics - There has been footage and screenshots for ages, I dont understand peoples sudden problem with it.

Server issues - Games with online features more often than not have issues on launch. This is not a problem exclusive to SFV.

The store model - It works for League of Legends and if its what they need to not release DLC or a SFVI in a years time I support it. Plus free content for playing the game, which im going to do anyway.

Keyboard mapping - This sucks and from what I have seen it wasnt common knowledge before the game came out, this can be fixed through a 3rd party program and from what I have read they are going to fix this in the future.

Long story short the fighting feels fantastic and what more do you want from a fighting game? Would you rather have an  early story mode that feels gross?

They gave us a little taste of whats to come and I want more, sure the game Is a little bare right now but what I have seen I love (other than the server issues which they are quite actively talking about on twitter) and this is more than enough for me to toy around on till the free March update which will probably feel like a new game.",1455683906,1455684353,TRUE,6,0,0.523809552,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.66E+16,280,1,4153,0,1277,1478292000
4,Street Fighter V,21257099,english,"I'm writing this review as a short review but also as a response to ZoSo, who was defending the release of this game. So let's get down to the nitty gritty of this: 

This game is an unfinished product with incredible server issues on launch day. Yes, day one game releases are known for problems on release, but not being able to actually play the game is dumbfounding. Why does the server connection need to be such a priority? 16 characters is quite low for a fighting game of this caliber. Sure it means more focus on each character but if we look at what Mortal Kombat has managed to do with their roster (including X with three fighting styles per), then this is inexcusable. 

The gameplay is fine, it's fun, it's the Street Fighter we know. Focus attacks are gone, and the EX meter is now a V-Skill meter, which makes for some interesting options during a fight. It reminds me of MvC3's short X-Factor boost. The prologues for the characters are what I'm currently focusing on, since I'm anticipating the intricate story mode similar to MK, and the style is quite appealing thus far. The soundtrack is nice, rock-style, and the graphics are decent, very in-tune to SFIV. 

My issues with this game stretch far and beyond. To ZoSo - You're kidding yourself if you think Capcom won't re-release this game. They said that Super Street Fighter IV was the definitive version, it was the only one they'd do as far as an updated release was concerned. Then what happened? Ultra, that's what. MvC3, and within a few months what happens? UMvC3. Are we noticing a pattern here? Capcom can -say- they won't re-release but then as their current trend of business practice goes, they are the KINGS of rereleases. Resident Evil, Street Fighter, Devil May Cry, collections galore. Anyone who knows their release history can attest to this. Once all characters are released, we're getting a new version. With more stages, costumes, etc.. 

On the remark that Capcom released this early because of fans wanting to gear up for a tournament: This should not be $60 then. Put it out there for $30 max, and if we want the other content later on we can opt to pay the other. Keep the beta up and running, actually, that would have been much smarter, or making this early access. Fair is fair. Also, why adhere to the fans in releasing a game early? When does that ever work out? Take a look at say, Spider-Man 3. Raimi gave into the fans and squeezed in Venom, and what a mess that film became. It's fine to take suggestions but it's better to go with your guts at the end of the day. If they knew this release would be too hectic then they should have held off, tournament or not. Some fans would be disappointed but there's always next year for the tournament, and the overall consensus would have been better for this title. 

Having to wait for the characters and story and other modes is pathetic. Other fighters have a core version where you have limitations but can still play the game. For free, mind you. Capcom has to be aware of this by now...yet their greedy corporation just can't wait to charge full price. The point is - they had options. There were better conditions to bring this game to the public eye, better ways to adhere to the community...they took none of these routes.

I have this game on PS4 and PC and have played more on the PS4.  The PC version runs flawlessly though with some minor online hiccups which Capcom has stated they are working hard on fixing.

17,Street Fighter V,21266670,english,I'm going to be blunt with this. Street Fighter V is difficult to recommend to every fighting game fan in its current state. While the gameplay and mechanics are really good there are alot of things that need to be addressed. (obviously the sever problem) As such if you thinking of buying SFV right now pause for a minute and ask yourself what is it you're looking for in a fighter? If all you want is strictly online muiltplayer features this might be for you once the servers are fixed (You're most likely going to have to wait for some time). If you're like me that likes a balance of both local content and online multiplayer this may not be your fighter so therefore it would advisable to wait until this game has more to offer in local content. Plus the story mode was a let down and doesn't make up for the lack of an arcade mode which really rubbed me the wrong way. I will update this review when time comes to see if this game improves because as of right now I can't in good conscience justify paying 60 bucks for this.,1455680288,1455680288,FALSE,5,0,0.523809552,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.66E+16,743,3,129,0,111,1595297803
18,Street Fighter V,21266652,english,"I'm going to be real fair here, and tell you what's up.

The single player only has basic story mode, survival mode, and training mode for now. There is some tutorial content under the story mode, but it is fairly light, and just introduces the new systems. 

Online seems to have an OK way to track player progress, but it means that your whole game is either in ""online mode"" or ""offline mode"". Online mode allows you to earn XP and Fight Money, but if the server connection gets cut, your game resets back to the main menu. Offline mode avoids the disconnection issue, but will not hold your progress in XP or Fight Money...a troubling catch-22 of sorts. 

There are also some issues with lobbies right now online, so that also doesn't help.

Right now, the servers cannot handle the load, but this is literally day 1, and they are as wired in Online Mode as an MMO is, so it's going to get rocked quite a lot for some time. If you're looking to play online, go ahead and get it now, use this time to train up, and go online next week. You'll feel a lot better.

But, this review isn't for this week, or today. This review is about Street Fighter V as it goes into the future, and it has what it needs to be a great game. The game itself and mechanics are solid, the engine is solid, and it's easy to grasp. Should they have released the game as Early Access? I don't think so, although there are some obvious bugs that could have been caught in an open beta of the full title and all modes, these bugs are mainly related to online mode functionality, controller support, or alt-tab bugs from some screens. The gameplay itself is solid, and these bugs aren't frustrating or in your face, other than the controller support issue (tip: use x360ce for now).

If you're on the fence, wait a year. But, I'll warn you, you're only wasting valuable training time. This game is not just a update, it is a platform for future Street Fighter development, with a great initial set of characters. This won't be behind the consoles like MKX, its not released on a date far after the console release like BlazBlue or Guilty Gear, and you can play with PS4 and PC players once the online stabilizes itself.

19,Street Fighter V,21266586,english,"The game is not finished. It lacks alot of the content.
Let's use sf4 as the base example, SF5 lacks

1: Basic keyboard remap, you can't remap your desired keyboard controls. if you play with a keyboard, just don't bother

2: No arcade mode. some people don't care about an arcade mode, but alot people do, it's a great mode to play casually and testing out ur combos in semi real combat versus AI, but the game doesn't have it

3: No trial mode. The game lacks a trial mode that exsited in almost every fighting game that has been released after 2003, and it's a great mode to learn characters and basic combos, yet the game don't have it.

4: You cant really invite your friend to play with you at the moment, it asks for a fighter ID where requires you to login into the CFN(capcom fighter network), and the function is not avaliable yet, so playing with your friend is not possible.

5: varies missing features such as the store is not even implemented yet.

6: lots of fight sticks are not supported yet like the old games did, so if u have a fight stick and wanting to play this game, better check with the forum and see if ur stick is supported.

20,Street Fighter V,21266575,english,"It's hard to not look at the package that has shipped in February 2016 as disappointing. There are a lot of negative reviews right now due to the issues of launch day and the strategy of Capcom to put out a bare bones product in order to support their Capcom World Tour.

What we know is this: the online problems will be fixed shortly, there are more free content updates coming very soon and the core fighting game is really really good. 

If you plan on playing a lot of couch multiplayer then this is a no brainer to buy right now. It's a much more pure version of Street Fighter than IV and it just feels really really good. If your main source of gameplay will come from online, I would still heartily recommend. Yes, day one online issues are plaguing it right now, but throughout the multiple beta tests, the actual netcode has been really great and it's probably safe to assume we'll get that sooner rather than later.

However, if you're looking for a lot of single player content similar to something like Mortal Kombat, and you foresee yourself spending more time playing by yourself, I find it extremely hard to recommend. The current story mode is barebones at best, the survival mode is excruciatingly tiresome and, well, that's actually all there is.

The game Is perfectly fine, for the amount you're paying...well it's questionable more on that later. However even though people are complaining about the servers, when it does work then the game works flawlessly. The server issues are happening on PS4 too, makes sense because it's cross play. Don't think Capcom is screwing justPC players cause they're not. There are 16 characters in total which is fine by me because 6 more will be coming for free, you can pay for them as well if you want. This is good because the game is balanced because there aren't as many characters that need tweaking, when you look at MvC2 there was a lot of unbalance. I personally think the game is good and pricing is good,To things in perspective lets look at Killer instinct, right now the game charges a good 60$ for all the characters (18 so far i may be wrong). Note all those KI characters aren't free, when SF5 will be when DLC comes. 

So in the grand scheme of things there's not a lot do as of now, but depending how the game does and DLC too we the players get more free content in the long run. I'm not saying you have to get it right now, but if the features and online are worrying you. I can tell you the online for both PC and PS4 will be good soon, because they're on the same boat. more features will come in the long run for free, so if you feel it doesn't have enough just wait.

Those are the positives. Now lets get to the bad. My Arcade stick does not work automatically, and I am too lazy to download 3rd party drivers so I been using my Xbox 360 controller as a back up to play the game. The game is missing lots of content, but these will be fixed over time. This game is a little simpler than Ultra Street Fighter 4, which is not a bad thing.

49,Street Fighter V,21264770,english,"OK, the negative: The online multiplayer seemed to work relatively fine during the beta testing phase and upon launch, however, I have been unable to find an online paring since. I hope Capcom appreciates the problem and provides us with some kind of good-will gesture in the shape of some content.

There is a distinct lack of content although each character has a 'story' mode which is around 3 - 4 fights of filler story we are left feeling somewhat had by the seemingly rushed artwork and repetative fights (Literally you may have to fight the same person twice out of 4 fights) which are of absolutely no challenge.

Beyond these main gripes I love the game it feels like a mash up of the 3, 4 and alpha series which is welcoming enough for new players to the franchise and will hopefully provide a level of depth which will keep seasoned veterans satisfied.  

Visually, the game has never looked better as we move away from the cartoonised styling of the four series and are left with a more serious, earthy visualisation of our favourite characters.

Gameplay is undoubtedly more forgiving than the 4 series as combo inputs allow for slightly more time to perform and  many characters have been given easier inputs for example Chun=Lis hundred foot kick moving from the rapid button pressing of previous games to a quatre circle motion.

I see many people have issues with fightstick recognission but as of yet my Xbox Limited edition Madcats TE Stick is working perfectly. 

I have faith that Capcom will resolve these issues and we will have numerous updates with balancing etc it would be easy to highlight the negatives, but I choose to Rise up :)

Pre-thoughts: Excited as I hoped the critical bars would be replaced, move from the recurring SF2 Character choices (fan of Street Fighter 3). As a pc gamer I have fighter game luster over hating MKX for no more support (idiot studio).

After trying out:

Pros:

- Looks less chunky on the eyes like SFIV.

- Super special simpler.

- Cleaner Animation.

- Limited charactors

Cons

- Story mode is mild. More detail further with spoiler warning below.

- Network needs fixing.

- Shop not open yet.

Warning Spoiler:

The story mode is a open-ended experience. You'll get a story without a finale. Some people may like that but added the fact 'no animation', Manga style storytelling.

https://youtu.be/3aak5NZTxjU

!!Warning!! The servers are a complete mess right now and many people having input issues. Keep your eyes on the forums for fixes before purchasing. 

I just want to note I would recommend this game if it wasn't for the current server problems. Personally I haven't been effected by other peoples issues but they are clearly there. 
On a base value it's a solid fighter as you would expect. I love the art style theyve chosen for this version. It's bright and responsive.
I'm hoping they add more characters in future and I seriously hope they won't be paid DLC otherwise many folks including myself will feel a bit robbed for the price. With the current issues and low character roster possibly worth waiting for fixes and also finding out more about their future plans for DLC. Possibly wait until some sort of GotY/Ultimate edition comes out.

- Servers not working at launch (some people argue that this is to be expected this is not to be expected this game was in beta for awhile capcom had more than enough time to get it right)
- Lack of single player content, no traditional arcade mode? I mean really how hard is that to put into a game as others have said it makes the game feel unfinished 
- 1 character constume, (2 if you count the 2nd that is locked into story mode ONLY, even after clearing story mode)
- Two menu's on the game locked out saying ""coming in March as a free update"" to me that clearly means that not all of the game was ready for the Feb 16 launch but corp Capcom said LAUNCH the game, FIX it later.

:Pros:
Online Matches are Great and Smooth, just like they were in past betas.
There's lot of Offline Options to help you get started if Online is ""too much"" for you.

:Cons:
All the features aren't up.
Lots of Disconnects from server.
No Arcade Mode.

From what I can also tell people who bought PS4 gear for this game are in for a rude awakening to find out they needed to buy Xbox 360 Controllers instead because the PC version of this game does not read those controllers naitively so you'll need a third party app like Joy2Key to get them to run and for those that want to be Keyboard Warriors will learn you can't really change your keys. 

So it's recommended you get a Xbox controller for this one. 

So yeah this is pretty much Beta 5. Except now we don't have to wait around for a new Beta and We are guarenteed updates. Remember Street Fighter IV wasn't ULTRA Street Fighter IV when it first launched. This is one of those titles where you really do have to just wait it out. 

Also The problems found on this version of the game are also present in the PS4 version so it doesn't look like PC got shafted this time around.

64,Street Fighter V,21253842,english,"I love SF franchise since the 90's - however the new Trend of releasing Beta versions as a ""full game"" is starting to get old.
people get hyped, wait a lot of time. and at the end they get a partial game.

1. NO ARCADE MODE !! wait what? NO ARCADE MODE!!!!! - SF is all about the Arcade mode! choosing a character vs a character from another country - seeing this cool animation of the region of the character you're playing against.. that's basically the essence of SF ! weird move by Capcom.

2. Lazy story mode - I'm a fan of manga - but the comics in the story mode are very cheap. not interesting. no deep background of the characters - looks like a temp mode.

3, Online was better on Beta - now that's weird with no need elaborate. 

4, Challenge Mode - also .. should have been in the game since day 1 ( which is today) ...


What I do like?
Is the new system, feels more friendly ! I wish I could use my PS4 controller with the game but as for now it's not supported so I'm using my XBONE controller.

the graphics are really amazing - great job!!

othet than that I need more to keep me in game longer than an hour, but that's just me,

Feels smooth and really effing nice to play. Slower than USFIV but more deliberate.
More accesible but by no means easier
Low spec mode so even toasters like mine (R7 360) can play smoothly and still look somewhat nice. From the looks of things I seem to be getting close to console performance.

Cons:
Stick support is all over the place
Already seeing server issues. Assuming it'll be fixed as it is launch but it's quite bad.
60 euro for the amount of content actually recieved doesn't seem like a great deal, it's not that there's not content or that the content isn't good but it's very barebones in comparison to USFIV which has tonnes more content.
This MOBA-esque microtransaction stuff will become bothersome in the future. I'm calling it now.

This product is in an unacceptable state at launch, especially for such a high profile title:

- No controller other than XInput (IE XBox 360) supported - in a FIGHTING game!
- No customizable keybinds - in a FIGHTING game!
- (On launch day) frequent network disconnections that interrupt even single-player gameplay. This was unacceptable 10 years ago already.

Next, the ""Misleading Communication""/""Borderline Lies"" category - contains expectations that were set by predecessors and marketing, which de facto makes people by SFV:

- Missing and unfinished features (as announced, but info drowned in marketing)
- ""Story Mode"" feels like it was tacked on by two guys and voice acting (4 fights per character)
- No ""vs CPU"" singleplayer outside of training - think of that what you will.

7,Street Fighter V,21248832,english,"Well, after multiple hours of trying to get the game to connect, it's a fun game. The actual play is very good, with enough changes to make it feel considerably different from IV. I had long since before accepted that Capcom was mostly out of ideas, hence the art style looks like IV (but more polished), and much of the music is (again) remixes of SF2. That's fine. What I can't forgive is the terrible online play. IF you manage to connect, you'll be annoyed by the experience of trying to find a lobby or match. Which you have to do, because for some asinine reason they decided to omit an Arcade Mode for you to play in while leaving Fight Request On. Your only one-player options are Story and Survival Modes, both of which seemingly have no real difficulty settings for AI skill. Which means your one-player experience is beating up on a very, very weak and not-fun CPU. As a further insult, on the many cases where it fails to connect, the game reminds you that you can't get Experience or Fight Money in offline mode, and hence, nothing you do will mean anything. You would think that after the super-extensive Beta testing of this game, they might have all this figured out by launch, but you'd be wrong. Game developers making sure the game they've already been paid for is functional at launch is Old Economy thinking. That said, the game is pretty, and, when it works, is actually fun. The problem is this: do you want to spend 10 minutes screwing around and waiting for the server to connect every time you want 90 seconds of play?

My biggest gripe immedialtely is that it was not support for generic joysticks. IV did this so well, so why exclude this here? I don't want to have to run a third party app for something that should be in any fighting game on pc.

Another huge issue I am getting is the game plays at half speed anytime I am gettting less than 60 frames Seriously!?

Also, how the heck do you release a fighting game with no arcade mode? That should be the most basic mode in any fighting game. SMH Capcom.

Even though I get into fighting games becuase of the gameplay, I chose SF since the eraly days of IV because of the interesting characters. As such, if you want a great offline/single player experience, this game wil in fact dissapoint you.

I know they wanted to focus on the story later and use what we have here as ""story mode"" to be more of an introduction, but it also fails to meet the purpose, to get new palyers interested. Heck, I know SF story and lore and most of the character interactions and battles where very nonsensical and out of nowhere. Plus, battles in story mode are maximum 3 rounds, and I say rounds becuase there is only one per match with infinite time and the A.I. is so bad that it barely puts up a fight. You will be getting easy Perfects.

But going into the online, I have not managed to connect to the servers, and that also means that everything you do offline without being connected does not register for progress in your game profile as you gain in game currency (fight money) and experience, but again only if connected to the servers.

I would only recommend this to people trying to get into a brad new game for the online play, but even that is toufh as many seem to have trouble connecting.

- Character design/variety
- Competitive with a great online service

80,Street Fighter V,21243607,english,"Although I haven't played the game much as yet, I wanted to come here and post a review so that some of you guys can avoid being disappointed.

Firstly -

Content - There is none!  The Story Mode, is only 2 or sometimes 3 single round matches!  I finished story mode with every character in under 1 hour.  And that is all the one player mode!  One hour, and you are finished with everyone!
There is a survial move, verus and online battle which are the only modes available with any substance.  The online store and challenge mode aren't available to march!  so I am gaining fight money but can't use it for a month.

There seems to be nothing to unlock, except what's in the store (again, not available til March)

Optimization - I am getting extreme slow motion for an entire round, and then the following round on the same level/same character is fast.  I don't think this can be a PC issue because the entire round is nausiatingly slow, and the following round normal speed!?  I'm still trying to figure out exactly what this is, and will update if I can work it out.

The good points are that the gameplay itself seems fine.  Graphics/sound are great.  Nostalgia at it's best.  There are a lot of Street Fighter charactersa and themes in the game that we haven't seen since the 90's Alpha games, so it's great to be back here.  

So I will say tread carefully.  Playing this game reminds me A LOT of the Star Wars Battlefront debacle.  Nothing in the original game.  So making a purchase and having to wait a month or two before they start putting content into it!  I'm in disbelief that actual options and game modes aren't out until March.  Challenges not out to March? Seriously Capcom, are you in cahoots with EA or what?

At this stage I cannot recommend this game.  Perhaps in a month when there is more contect available I will change my mind.

Damage scaling is almost non-existant so just pull out those 3 hit combos a few times and your opponent is lying on the floor!

2: No arcade mode. some people don't care about an arcade mode, but alot people do, it's a great mode to play casually and testing out ur combos in semi real combat versus AI, but the game doesn't have it

3: No trial mode. The game lacks a trial mode that exsited in almost every fighting game that has been released after 2003, and it's a great mode to learn characters and basic combos, yet the game don't have it.

4: You cant really invite your friend to play with you at the moment, it asks for a fighter ID where requires you to login into the CFN(capcom fighter network), and the function is not avaliable yet, so playing with your friend is not possible.

5: varies missing features such as the store is not even implemented yet.
