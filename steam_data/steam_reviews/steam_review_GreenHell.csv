3,Green Hell,77167041,english,"It's kind of fun for what it is: But overall the lack of content in Survival puts the game at a ""no"" for me.

There are crippling problems with this game and exploration mostly largely unrewarding.

The game revolves around finding civilization prefabs in the wild in order to learn blueprint designs and finding one usually gives you a slight or large boost in ""power level"" (for lack of a better word), however, these are sporadically placed in a generated world. You'll be trekking across multiple grids for absolutely no reward, whatsoever.

There are mechanisms in the wild that are hard-locked by a chance encounter with the crashed jeep (grappling hook). In a single player game you might never find it seeing as it is really difficult to cover the entire grid of the map.

Exploration is extremely difficult not because of the lack of an ability to prepare for the said trip but because of an inability to mark out areas on the ""map"" item to designated where you have covered and where you have not.
Said ""map"" item is very, very unhelpful. No icon to show where you are exactly, realistic in a sense, but frustrating, very frustrating, in a game.

The pre-fabs can sometimes have a huge plethora of items but none of them can be collected or interacted with. There is a real sense of disappointment here (microwave, I'm looking at you).

Crafting is a gigantic pain in the ass. There is no way for you to load up the mud charcoal forge quickly, drag and drop your sticks in one by one. Items that you've already crafted multiple times in the past (arrows) are a huge pain to restock on. Feather, feather, stick, feather, feather, stick, ad nauseum. The game would have done better for you to be able to one-click discovered items to automatically craft them.

Despite having lugged around hundreds of logs to craft my house in the wild I've still only got the strength to carry 50.0lbs. There is no sense of growth whatsoever. And let me tell you how much 50.0lbs is worth. About 8x dried meat (how heavy is a piece of *dried* meat, has anyone held up a piece of jerky? That's how much it should weigh.) and your necessary Axe, Firestarter, Spear, Bow, Arrows, and a standard blade

What does Cooking +1 do, what does Axes +1 do, Spears +1 do? Not a hell lot if I'm honest.


I'll put this down as a final thought, don't get this full price. I might be inclined to pay at most $10-$13 bucks for the game. The amount of fun you'll have in this game is dependent on how much you enjoy pulling leeches off your skin every 30 mins IRL time.

9,Green Hell,77152742,english,"The survival aspect of the game is really good:
- UI is complex but it fits with all the actions that the player can do.
- 4 Different types of nutrients seems complex at first but the fact that you can look at your watch to see what you're missing is a great addition.
- Being able to interact with other players to help get rid of malus such as leeches.
- There seems to be enough food for all players without having to go far out of your comfort zone.

Why is my review in the negative: The AI is archaic
- Passive mobs that flee go in a straight line when the player spook or attack them.
- Aggresive mobs such as the Jaguar path directly towards the player without any warning (except the random growls 1/3 of the time). They could add something like in ""The Forest"" where the animal could inspect the player and try to find a way to ambush them, adding pressure on the players.
- The natives destroy EVERYTHING in seconds. You built a mud base for the last 10 hours? Destroyed in 5 seconds.
- Natives path in lines towards the player, they don't have any sort of ""Conscience"". This is way too simplistic.
- Natives don't flee or watch the player or instill any sense of fear, they are terminators trying to path directly towards the player without any sense of fear or pain.
- The natives don't have any aggressivity progression. Let's say you start a 4-player survival game on ""Normal"". For 3-5 days, you encounter NO natives, which lets the players get a glimpse of the game. Then, out of nowhere, 15-20 natives attack the base, destroying everything WHILE ALSO killing all of you until you respawned 10 times each and punched them to death. At this point in the game, players usually have a bow or spear and barely survive as it is. The first encounters could be progressive.

The Survival is great, the Story is great, the UI is great, the Level Art is great, the Level Design is great.
But all of those are crushed by the archaic AI that completely breaks the immersion.

All I've found on this issue from the dev team is ""You can turn the natives off if you don't like them"".

In all seriousness, this game is a lot of fun if you enjoy a more in depth version of a survival game.
This game is really similar to The Forest so if you enjoyed that, you'll probably enjoy this.
Green Hell focuses more on the survival aspect than of the horror aspect of The Forest however.
If you are looking to play this with friends the only issue I've had is sometimes when loading the game, friends will spawn in previous camps but will still have their inventory. I've not experienced any connection issues.

[h1] 5/10 [/h1]

[h1] QUICK REVIEW [/h1]
Tho i gave a 5, the game is absolutely lovely as a survival game, it can Top The long Dark / The Forest,
The main problems come from the interface, the story, the tutorial. Which unfortunately may be the final product, reason being the game is out of early access, thats why this deserves harsh judgement.
So, only get on discount, & maybe if you're playin with friends will be a blast.

[h1] PROS / CONS [/h1]
[u] Pros [/u]
- Unique Survival System (Management of Health, Desease, Carbs, Protein, Fats, Water)
- Unique Crafting System (Drag and Drop from inventory / Environment)
- Unique Structures (Basically Mud House)
- Hardcore Survival (Most realistic Survival game i've played so far)
[u] Cons [/u]
- Horrible Tutorial (Doesn't teach the basics / navigating the interface/menu, & stupid slow cutscenes)
- Horrible Unskippable Cutscenes (During story, its absolutely Cringe and draggy)
- Limited Animals (Just a tad bit more would make the game abit more worth)
- Combat with tribes is irritating, not difficult. They bug out into walls to hit you from behind, and have invulnerable times, so if you charge them, you cant damage them.
- Interface Management & design (Some small adjustments needed, so expect to accidentally drink poison & sleep on the floor with missclicks)

[h1] MAIN REVIEW [/h1]
Ok, im only into the game for a few hours, and it already bugs me a ton, basically a love hate thing.
The game is not suppose to hold your hand, which is great, it handles that aspect absolutely perfect.
But the story mode, oh boy, is quite stupid, voice acting is fine, Lines are extremely cringe worthy, but the cutscenes are freaking few minutes long and unskippable, worse thing you have to walk through it, click a button and waste your precious time.
Story narrative is cool, it is a interesting innovative story, all of which the cutscenes add ZERO value to.
I hate making and drinking the stupid weed water.
Basically there NEEDS to be a skip function, cos the cutscenes cut value from the game.
Only cutscene thats worth my time is the the Bad Ending, pretty cool execution, so aim for the bad ending.

Multiplayer, this is one of the good things, you can play the stupid story with your friends, that will make things less unbearable, and change the survival aspect. You can also survival mode together.
But i've heard that there are ton of bugs with the inventory, so keep that inmind.

Survival mode, i'm hoping to aim for this once i complete the story. 
Challenge Modes, also pretty worth your time and value.

The Pros i mentioned, the building & crafting is very unique and engaging and you do have to mange your inventory literally which is tedious but makes you think what to take and is Realistic.
Building is great, with snap feature for buildings, and items can be places anywhere else valid.
I do wish they add single frame walls, cos as of now walls must be placed on a 4x4 frame.

Animals are great, reacting to you, scaring you, hunting you. each giving their own harvest.
And while dangers are plenty, Tribesmen, Environment, Wildcats, Crocs, Venom creatures,
I can count them on my 2 hands, so do wish they just add 1 - 2 more predatory animals that differ from the wildcats & Crocs (Those are the only Biggame that are dangerous)

There will be instances where, IRL you would do something, but the game is limited from this simple task, like washing hands with bottle, simple step over stuff, very frustrating. 

Never had such frustration with a game before, because there is so much potential, but is all wasted on lousy planning and design.
But the Survival aspect is what has got me hooked, if only they polished the game, i would gladly pay AAA price for this, but for now i recommend only getting on discount.",1601806390,1601806390,FALSE,6,0,0.569304824,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,269,9,3198,3198,2352,1602011783,,

+ Interesting setting and environments (vegetation and animal life looks remarkably identical to real life flora and fauna)
+ Fun and creative crafting (almost every single item can be used in crafting one way or another)
+ Unique sanity system (you can go insane and start hearing voices, seeing things that aren't there, etc.)
+ Coop (playing with up to 3 friends can be both fun and helpful)
+ Multiple updates since release (including coop, mud stuff, farming, more buildings and many bugfixes)
+ Building and crafting things is really entertaining (you can actually see every stick, rock or rope appear as you add it)
+ Body Inspection and Healing are quite fun (bruises, bites, rashes, worms and infections are just a few of the things you'll be fighting off)
+ Tons of plants to eat and animals to hunt or trap (also various ways to cook or preserve resources)
+ Skills (become better at pretty much everything you do in the game, and learn new crafting recipes)
+ Hardcore gameplay and steep learning curve (watch your step, watch what you eat and watch your back)
+ Solid sound design (the first few nights in the jungle were especially memorable)
+ Really well voiced protagonist (Brandon Fague is slowly becoming my new Yuri Lowenthal)

- Graphically the game looks average at best (the art and assets are good, but somehow the game looks terrible even on ultra)
- Lousy lighting and weather effects (rain and moonlight are probably the worst; wet jungle looks awesome though!)
- Awful animations and rough transitions (essential stuff like chopping down a tree, throwing a rock or hitting a coconut looks sooo crude)
- A lot of bugs (double that in coop)
- Terrible draw distance (you can see grass and bushes sprout out of the ground right in front of your eyes, atrocious visible pop-in all the time)
- Boring, predictable story (no lip sync for Mia during the campfire scene kinda gave it away)
- Uninspired, unmemorable music (the combat music in particular is just the worst)
- Jake's model looks horrendous (nothing even remotely close to any of the artworks; seriously where's the beard?)
- Physics are so weird (the moment you steps off a ledge, you immediately plummet down as if Jake weighs a literal ton)
- No fast travel causes a lot of boring backtracking (both a blessing and a curse, but I'd rather have the option and not use than not have it and need it)

   There's a lot of potential here, and it's a really good start for their first original project. 

   I wish the sanity system was used some more. Maybe even force the player to go insane once or twice during the story. There's a lot of unused insanity assets that I wish were in the game. And that's actually one of the reasons why I bought the game in the first place.

   What can I say.. It was definitely a stressful, challenging experience. And I had a lot of fun making mistakes and figuring out ways to fix them. For ex. if you sleep out in the open, a worm may dig his way into your forearm. How do you take it out ? I'm a complete caveman so I had no idea. Instead I went foraging for food and found a lake. I caught a couple of fishes and ate them. Then I realized I got all these fish bones in my inventory. What if.. YES. I scooped out that disgusting worm using the fish bones. Then I bandaged the wound with some leaves and I felt real relief. That was an awesome moment that I'll remember forever. Because it was my own ingenuity that was at the core of that little misadventure. And developers who make moments like that possible are developers worthy of praise.

   In the end the good outweighs the bad and so here I am recommending this game. Give it a try, get out there and step on some snakes. It's inevitable, we all do it at some point!",1601695696,1601695696,TRUE,14,5,0.652924418,3,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,684,46,5169,1331,5168,1601950930,,

8,Green Hell,76913296,english,"green hell. don't think your entering a world like ark or conan exiles. here it is based on survival.
there is a story mode you can play,but survival mode is exactly built to a survivalist nature. no end game. just live. though the POI's are also in the story mode you don't get the items that progress the story mode.
if you want a chilling survivalist exploration game this game is for you. if you lack patients and need thrills of games like above then stick with them and save yourself some money.
as i pointed out before this game is all about surviving.
the base building elements are at times a lil funky when snapping foundations together. my only bad point to this game.
it is hard grind with the only reward of living to the next day.
the thought gone into this game so far from a survivalist attitude is pretty good. from crafting, medicating wounds to structures. it all makes some kind of sense. because you have to use to discover what can heal or make you sick. run you fevers while keep up you hydration carbs hydro and fats. all while constantly being suckdry of you sanity by leaches and many things you try to eat. like spiders scorps maggots grubs.
even when you think you built an awesome camp. like the indigenous people you have to be nomadic and travel because you trees run out so no more wood for constructing. your farms will last but since wood is you biggest problem fire wood will eventually run down to foraging the little amount falling from bigger trees.
as you would do in the real would surviving. i am no chemist but the combination of medical aids would also be something as a survivor having to learn plant medicines you would have to do as plant base medicine is a forgotten art today. right now the map is not huge but being added to so i hope this keeps being added to with new elements added as they go such as rafts and other useful items you would learn naturaly as a survivor in a real world senario.

i give this game top marks for the survival aspects of the game and the fact they have not used current end game genres like games i have spoken in this review.
if your the type of person who respects realistic survival then this game is for you.
i have played 102 hours and enjoyed every minute of just going back to roots of the hunter forager lone survivor stay alive at all cost grind. the sudden ratle snake impacts spider bites and frog poison by accidently picking a poison dart from up instead of a stick of retrieving from a small cage trap to stepping on a sting ray in the rivers
depending on the level you choose to play at you have natives who will attack you larges cats crocs.
to hunt you can build traps once learnt or spear and bow if not. fish with rod or set up rod traps. all that have to be kept and eye on or you kill essentially rots out.
so much to talk about for such a small resource hungry game you can invite your friends to join you survival exploration nomadic world buy hosting it like any multi play game option. only you do not need 16gb ram to host.

20,Green Hell,54977790,english,"One of those games that are unplayable without constant wiki search. Like my character got the worm and I got instruction on how to remove it but how to craft tools for that I don't know. Or got bit by a snake and the game notebook telling me that I need to find the plan that contains antivenom, but the time flys so fast in this game so you literally have to know what type of plant you need to search or you will die quickly.
The game desperately needs an in-game wiki. I had to google how to save in this game because the game doesn't tell you that. And there is no autosave (the game didn't warn you about that), even when you sleep so if the game crashes, and it will, you will lose any progress.

Never managed to make a fire because for some reason the fire can be lit only with bird nests. Yea, there is a lot of dry leaves on the ground, but they are textures, you cant pick them up. You can also use dry leaves but I never managed to find them, or birds nests. Why it can't be like The Long Dark did? Why you can't make tinder out of the fallen ad dry trees? Add some dry sticks randomly spawning on the ground.

The UI is terrible. Let's have a big book with pretty pitchers so the player will constantly flip pages back and forward to find a new and needed blueprint. Also, let's make a ton of sub-categories. That menu needs to be compact.

For crafting each time you will have to manually open a crafting menu, drag items from 4 separate inventories on the crafting stone, and then click craft. Want to craft multiple items? Well, repeat all of that multiple times.
No quick craft, no recipe references before all of the items will be on the crafting stone. Like you have to memorize all the crafting respites from the reference book (or Wiki) close it and do everything above.

For crafting buildings you need a ton of resources and time, and the tribes can destroy your bildings in seconds. You can disable natives completely, but why the devs didn't add the option that forbids the natives from destroying the player's buildings?

The game runs bad. GeForce GTX 660 for minimal? I have GTX 1060 6Gb and the game on lowes settings runs with 55 FPS with constant frame drops. You cant turn off specific graphical settings, like reflections or shadows, because there is only presets, low, med, etc.

The Forest game had the same problems and that's why I dropped it. I played 14 hours in EA and never touched it again. This game fills a lot like The Forest.

I will be looking forward to this game but for now, I stick with The Long Dark, this game is absent from those problems and far more enjoyable to play.

The game is simple but hard which is what I love, it is extremly realistic and unforgiving, but that doesn't make it good. The story mode is GREAT the BIG problem with it is that you can finish it in 1 day, The forest, I know how to finish it, you don't need a GIANT base to finish the game, but the cannibals keep you from going and scare you, or at least to me. Green hell doesn't have that scary element it's just stress and once you learn which plants are good, where to walk, where not to run, what to craft, etc; it just turns into a survival hell. The forest on the other hand, has always scared me and stressed me, that feeling has never gone away, the cannibals always come when I less expect them to or they're just too much, and it turns into stress. In green hell, you can shoot in the head with an arrow and boom they're dead, no matter how big the threat is, if you get a jaguar exploring, shoot him in the head, there you go, biggest threat dead. The survival mode isn't good either, there is no point in survival game mode, you're just grinding.

I bought the game without any thought to be honest, but after 10h of playing within two days I can say I don't regeret buying the game.
As of now the content of the game is fairly limited, but the atmosphere of the game is extreme.
I ran trough the woods without having any plan after the tutorial, first i starved to death, second attempt I was killed by a bunch of natives, third attempt I got bit by a spider, fourth attempt I died from eating poisoned food.
I kept on dying, over and over but I never enjoyed dying in a game as much as I did in this game. After the first 20 deaths or so I finally started to get a hang of the game, and still I kept on dying. 
After a few hours I finally got everything wokring out. 
And then the real fun of the game started.

Id call the athmosphere the core strength of the game, but you really have to give the game a chance and experience it for yourself in order to understand what I mean.

Nice game, full of content (28.5hrs game time: playthrough in story mode, no rush, yet also didn't stop to build a fortress), even though some controls and crafting are weird.
Big minus: the game crashes to the desktop near the end of the tutorial, but a save game is created by then (or can be worked around by ESC -> Skip Tutorial). ""So far so good"", didn't crash since then.
Small minus: The story is shallow to me, a little too linear and flat, as well as goes too long on 
the same path reaching one single goal.


[b]PLUS[/b]
+ Good character controller, no jittery edges of objects, etc, very well done (2D objects are distorted around the screen edges and in angles, a bit annoying for round items like cans or fan, but no big deal, easy to live with, nobody cares, really)
+ Great gfx, VO & audio in general, nice animations, the whole thing is together and cool
+ Lighting is good (some meh stuff coming from Unity's nature, like dead dark places in bright daylight but nothing big)
+ Survival is challenging early in the game, but one has to pay attention even later on as one mistake can leap the player right into a grave. Great balance here! (Only [spoiler] leeches grow a bit old [/spoiler])


[b]MEH[/b]
~ A somewhat strange, counter-intuitive and sloppy but OK crafting and inventory system
~ Same applies to breaking down (""Harvest"") items. To avoid spoilers: Using a tool on item ""A"", it turns into item ""B"", yet RMB -> 'Harvest' on item ""A"", it turns into item ""C"" (rather than the expected ""B""), seen it happen though with 1 item only, no big deal but as one of the first impressions it was a bit confusing
~ Message on screen 'new [whatever] in notebook' - other things are highlighted (were not noted on screen), but the mentioned thing
~ The player is not given time to read the diary / notes as time ticks away very fast. Would be great if time was paused when one is reading notes & text
~ It would be great if one could add notes to maps (i.e. as new POI, like ""shelter"" or ""lots of [something] here"", etc)
~ The crafting system could be a bit more robust


[b]MINUS[/b]
- If building a shelter wants palm leaves, GTFO with your banana leaves or any other giant leaves that would also perfectly do the job (i.e. lack of interchangeability of virtually identical items)
- ""bone needle"" is too difficult to obtain early in the game
- A bit too short days
- Over-exaggerated macro balance
- (noted in TL;DR)The game crashes to the desktop at the end of the tutorial, but reliable otherwise (yet one develops ""trust issues"" after this)
- See details in TL;DR : the story is shallow, not very well written (I write much better stories :P Just sayin' :P)",1597166166,1601068009,TRUE,0,0,0.454545468,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,390,12,1821,0,1821,1598110942,,

Lots of things you that you might think could work with crafting and such work exactly as you might suspect and you can figure them out by just trying which is refreshing. 

The ""macros"" and food maybe drain a little too fast and could be tuned so that the danger and attention has to be kept on something other than just eating.

Most of hostile elements are not that dangerous after you have a bow and plenty of arrows. Poisonous creatures do surprise you every now and then as you can't always hear or spot them as you might expect to.

43,Green Hell,76019176,english,"[h1]The Good[/h1]

Solid co-op experience. Co-op story mode that actually works, and very few glitches.

Modular building system strikes a good balance between creative potential and complexity.

Beautiful scenery and creatures.

Survival regime that cuts few corners: Thirst plus three other macronutrients, long- and short-term energy, various health conditions, and even mental fortitude. Mostly, these are presented very clearly.

[h1]The Middling[/h1]

Earliest portion of the learning curve is [i]very[/i] steep. Expect to die a few times while you're learning your way around the resources and the geography, then play the same thing later and wonder why it was so hard.

Crafting does not completely ""play fair"". That is, some recipes can only be found through trial and error or reading the wiki.

The story is interesting and sophisticated, but it is also intentionally confusing. If you demand to usually know what's going on, for loose ends to be tied up, and absolute internal consistency, prepare to be frustrated.

My impression is that Green Hell taxes your hardware more than it needs to. I experienced some asset-loading stutter until I moved it to an SSD, and it tends to spin up my GPU fan more than comparable games.

Gameplay is unabashedly derivative of [i]The Forest[/i]. Not a problem for me; I like them both.

Pathing of creatures and NPC is occasionally glitchy. They will run against walls or in circles.

It's similar but completely different from The Forrest. While The Forrest is leaning more towards building bases and surviving waves of attacks, Green Hell focuses on managing diseases and sanity. It's an amazing game and worth every penny. However, there are still bugs that need to be looked into.
Pros:
+ Single-player: Well crafted, worth trying at least twice.
+ Co-op: Great to play with friends, the Radio/Map mechanic require good communication between players in Story Co-op Mode.
+ Story: Good and thrilling story + amazing plot. (There are multiple endings as well)
+ Graphic: Good for a survival game, also not too demanding.
+ Capybara: Yes
+ Exploration: Fun and challenging, especially with friends.
Cons:
+ Difficulty: The game gets easier when you learned the basics of the diseases and the efficient way to keep your sanity up. When you spent over 10 hours of game time, you're just casually exploring rather than surviving.
+ Upgrades: There isn't any point of crafting metal when the normal rock arrow/bone armor is more than enough, even in the highest difficulty. The process of making metal is rather lengthy and inefficient. Devs should reduce the amount of bone drops (from all sources) for it to make more sense grinding for metal.
+ Anaconda: No
+ Bug: Happens more than a handful of time - Whenever our friend group loads a save to continue the games, there are members who were pushed back to old locations (even when everyone saved and slept at another location before we exit the game). It's frustrating for the said players to walk 10 mins back to the new camp, and for the other players to wait around for those walkers to die several times on the way (and brought everyone's sanity down like a punch from Mike Tyson). This single bug made the game much harder and probably took 1/10 of our playtime in this game. The bug also messed up the inventory big time (items are changed/swap with friends, items expired, items disappear).",1599920695,1599920695,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,111,6,2660,0,2660,1595706142,,

17,Green Hell,75724395,english,"Good game. If you're into primitive technology this is probably the game for you. Had been following early access for a while on Broadbent & Glock9's channels.
Haven't played enough to give a proper in-depth review, but I can say that this game is fun, looks great, works well, & is a good challenge. I guess it's like The Forest without the horror.

There is a map but you have to find all 3 pieces. Until then it's just a compass & coordinates that you should probably write down. Like, IRL. So you don't lose your base when you go chasing after that capybara through the jungle & get all turned around.
There are 3 hunger meters, not one. Fats, carbs, & proteins. Plus water & sanity.
So yeah, it's a long, steep learning curve. You will die horribly, scared & alone, many times. Nearly all the negative reviews are from people who couldn't hack it.

In this game you can get food poisoning from bad fruit or rotten meat (or even eating animal droppings if you want), parasitic worms from not washing your hands before eating, rashes, infections, cuts & scrapes.
You can be eaten by piranha while trying to cross a river, get bit by a snake or spider if not watching where you're walking, ambushed by a puma/jaguar, alligator, natives, hallucinations. You can accidentally on purpose walk into a trap that you yourself set. You can starve too, if you even make it that far.

The story is a bit meh. But that's my opinion, you might like it, & it's not actually bad per se.
I think this game has the best inventory management system I've ever seen. The way the backpack integrates with the gameplay is pretty unique. They should sell them as merch. I'd buy one.

Idk if I've seen a more realistic game outside of sim-racing & I wonder what this game would be like in VR. Looking forward to playing Co-op. It's a great game for open-world survival craft. Definitely grab if on sale, but at the same time, I feel like this game is worth a lot more than what they're charging. It's $36AUD but I'd be happy paying up to $60.

Will be playing this until Subnautica Below Zero, & Grounded drop. Though I wouldn't be surprised if this ends up the best of the three.",1599698985,1599701214,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,24,20,8549,1428,463,1601824029,,

42,Green Hell,75115034,english,"I absolutely recommend this game. Make no mistake, it's a hard bastard to get started. Discouragingly so, to the point that I uninstalled it in frustration but something always kept bringing me to try again. My third attempt, I stuck with it no matter what - learn the health system, learn what foods you need to eat and how to avoid danger.

When you do this, the game opens up in to something truly beautiful and an experience like I have rarely had with a game. You - not the character, the player - have to fight with Jake. You struggle to learn and you will fail. You go in to the jungle at first and it's terrifying. Maybe you're dehydrated, covered in leeches, losing nutrients and poisoned from a snake bite. Then you learn you can drink coconuts and use the empty shells beside a fire to purify water. You learn what plants you need to cure poison, you learn what mushrooms you can and can't eat (tip: just don't eat the ones that look like ballerinas, everything else is fine). You get in the habit of watching for the icon that indicates there's a body problem to address and then learn that fire restores sanity, don't sleep on the bare ground and turn your sound up so you can hear and *listen* to the jungle around you.


Then comes the breakthrough - you're bitten by a snake and have the things to save yourself. You could have saved yourself all along and this is the reward for your hard won knowledge. You meet a jaguar for the first time, crouch for stealth, meet it's charge with your obsidian spear prepared to throw and you pierce it's skull with a single throw, taking it's meat and life force for your own so that you can continue.

Survival Mode: Carries all the survival aspects without any story. This game then becomes like any other survival game with its own niche. It's challenging, depending on what you wish to do, and when.
Story Mode: This is the real showstopper. On the surface it might seem like it is a survival game with a superficial story, but the further in you get, the more you realize that this game is out to screw with more than just your character's mind, it's also yours. The further you get, the more will the hairs on your arms raise!

I couldn't avoid comparing to Stranded Deep all the time and find that even though it actually has a story, Green Hell falls short in many areas. The story is quite lame and forced, in my opinion. It's extremely square and presents no real challenges, except walking around aimlessly most of the time and stumbling upon a few things you need to advance, like grappling hook, fuel, etc.
Crafting is a pain and the unfolding recipe tree is awkward and often counter-intuitive. Anyway, you can complete the whole story with just the basic stone tools and cheap shelters and nothing else.
The backpack (inventory) is quaint but a pain to keep organized, as different elements have different sizes and take up space differently, forcing you to rearrange stuff all the time to make it all fit.
And the personal maintenance is infuriating. The ammount of time consumed just keeping your character alive - and sane - is ridiculous. Having to stop every 5 minutes to remove leeches, spending ages looking for ways (mostly through trial and error) to cure yourself from the multiple wounds, bites, rashes and deadly infections which can ONLY be cured in one particular way which depends on you miraculously coming accross the very few naturally spawning sources - this is all code language to avoid spoiling - is extremely annoying.
Encounters with story enemies are almost impossible to survive, either because you die in battle or from the inflicted wounds which are so hard to treat. Weapon manipulation is very clumsy and projectile or throwing weapons are extremely innacurate.

81,Green Hell,74789404,english,"First survival game I have tried to play, usually I would be all about RPG/MMO/FPS/TPS/Racing -- anything BUT, one day I decided I could go for something different, and browsing through the category I cam across this title, and as big a fan as I am of going camping, and learning new skills as far as how to start a fire with what I have, and having a little shelter/tent when going hunting with the family growing up was a must -- I figured to check it out and it was so nostalgic, the story-line however, not what I expected, it was thrilling, and every aspect of the game was well put together, very detailed and down to the core! 

Survival mode you find and explore which spots can be best suited but always have to keep an eye out not to  be hunted because everything will creep up on you at the least expected moment, it's always a good idea to be armed at all times. You have unlimited resources as to what to gather to build, eat what is good and sometimes what isn't ethical that would do great things, this feature I LOVE. But there's only so much you can create and bring to the table under this title. It has potential and looking for more add-ons.

Story mode is challenging and a bit more different than survival, as you are required to go on about and exploring to discover new objects you can build on your own, pushes your knowledge on survival and exploring skills, I always stayed on the edge of my seat, and it's not something I can say any game does for me -- definitely was the best experience for a first Survival game, and I am not disappointed. Doing re-runs with new crowds is fun as everyone has a different approach to the game, and it's hard actually memorizing where everything is, but a feat will sort of do that for you, so you can avoid getting lost, finding your way back and around hoping not to get off track reaching your checkpoint is fun and never gets old -- the jungle has a lot in stock for the new, less experience players, me included.

And there is lack in here. For building, why not put some option to put all stack same item to more easier?Why not add point for player at map where were stand in map?
And can I suggest more option? Like add other option in map to mark own player mark.Add standing tool for weapon or equiptment. Add stone wall for defend. Add archer tower and scout tower. Add some unique weapon or tools.

This game is even worse than when I originally reviewed it. It has gotten MORE buggy, MORE unstable, MORE bullshit. If you like being stuck in a retarded not challenging but lazy survival loop.

Natives will teleport to your bases you build and destroy them when you go only 10ft, then teleport away. The fun challenging new mechanics they put in end up causing more frustration than fun in the end because pure LAZY development of them, leading you to one debuff to the next to deal with.

47,Green Hell,74358340,english,"Green Hell is a must buy for survivalist fans, but not only. It is easily accessible to anyone who wishes to experience a very solid, polished and engaging experience in the jungles of Amazon.

That being said, this game had the worst first impression on me. I can't quite grasp whether it's the annoying menuing, lack of tooltips or the in medias res approach to story telling... Or something quite else. But it didn't click and almost threw me off entirely.

However, I pushed through the beginning hour(s), and little by little, the experience started to fall into place like a well-thought-of puzzle. The graphics are good but not that important for this genre. The audio is really solid from the moment you enter the game's main menu, thus audio-visually this is a neatly polished title. 

Furthermore, the story starts to make more sense as you progress, and despite it not being anything you haven't seen/heard before, it does the job at least. You can tell that the developers really cared about this particular aspect of gameplay, and from start to finish, I'd say they have succeeded with their interesting take on something common.

There are different modes available post-story, so replayability is also something to consider. There's survival mode, tourist mode, custom experience, even challenges are separately packed into it. That's a thumbs up any day.

My biggest gripes come down to crafting/building menus which are strenuous at best as well as the lack of flora/fauna variety for this kind of game. Don't get me wrong, what is in there is just good, but I wish there was more.

In the end, go and get this game asap! You will not regret it if there's at least one part of you that enjoys good survival experiences. Though I dislike giving scores, if I were, this would be a very strong 8 out of 10. Cheers!

There is still a lot of room for improvement: if you have leeches on you (and the jungle is filled with them) and also armor on, you will need to take the armor off. And if you don't have place for it in your backpack, good luck trying to sort it out.

If you want to play story mode with your friends, each of you needs to run through the tutorial. 

The interface is clunky and not intuitive.   You find yourself having to open your backpack and dig around in different compartments for things.   While you can build different structures in the game, it's very limited.  

You spend too much time worrying about food and drink and other ailments to enjoy the other aspects of the game.   The fist 10 to 20 times you die, it will because a snake bit you and you can't cure the poison or you ran out of food or drink.  Simply frustrating.

There is an option to play in easy mode but it doesn't allow you to fine tune the annoying things.  It turns them and all other threats off.  It would be nice if you could decrease the rate at which food and water were used up.

The game places the player in an isolated environment of a rain forest and places the burden of hardcore survival onto the player.

Surviving in Green Hell is not easy and it requires constant attention to resources and relies on the ability of the player to recognize plants and geography to stay out of danger.

The most fascinating thing about this game I found is that the isolation you experience in the game... overtime.... over days and days of surviving... ALONE... you really begin to feel ALONE.. and you start questioning yourself on whether you're actually in an okay mindset.. I believe it was an excellent intention of the game designers.

Story line wise... man.... It'll all come together at the end and its.....  its intense.... right up there with the Half Life series types of intense (if you've played the entire series, you'll know what I mean).

Cons:
1. Storage boxes tends to lose small items: ex. fish bones
2. In Multiplayer different players tend to switch inventories and duplicate items
3. Some dead animals or materials glitch through the ground causing loss of helpful materials
4. Gameplay sometimes feels repetitive once having decent hours in the game
Pros:
1 and 3 are rare occasions
Fun if you like challenging Survival games

23,Green Hell,57094725,english,"It's really good, and there's a huge learning curve, the player will probably struggle in the first 5 or 10 hours, but once you learn what plants does that, what fruits does this and all the important stuff for your survival, the game becomes a lot easier. 

Everything your character discover will be kept at a menu you access by pressing N which opens a little book that keeps notes about the stuff you find in the jungle, the more you experiment with materials you find the more information you will have when you press N, so whatever you find when you are starting you better experiment by eating it, cooking it, making brews with it, crafting random things out of them, putting it in a wound you suffered etc. The more you experiment the more information you will have in your little notebook.

Combat is not the primary focus, but it is there, you have commands for dogde, block, attack and throw spears, stones, and firing a bow. The natives will attack your camp if you have active campfires for too long, they will see smoke in the sky and will start teleporting closer and closer to your house like slenderman, so try to not have fire for extended periods of time  in your camp. When they appear at your camp they will start breaking stuff and if they see you, prepare to fight! You can also invade their camps and kill them or go there when they are not present, by investigating their camp your character will learn to craft some of the stuff you see there, there are many useful crafting recipes that you will only learn once you see them in the forest.

There are not much animals, i think 9 preys, 6 hostile animals, 4 hostile predators and some fish species (actually this all sounded stupid cause humans can prey on anything so you can eat tigers, alligator, snakes, spiders, ants, scorpions even other humans, beware that some of these actions will decrease your character sanity, i won't give spoilers about this mechanic but it's pretty messed up when you have low sanity level, so be careful in doing your sick crazy things). Everything can easily be killed with bows or throwing spears, also you can craft and place traps, you can try going close with axe and blades but most of these preys will outrun you except for the smaller ones.

The graphics are beautiful, sadly their engine has a bit of fps drops, but if you have a decent computer you can have textures on high and quality on low. I use this setting and the game still looks great going from 50 to 60 fps.

The sound is really good, a bit repetitive if you play the game for too long, but it won't upset you.

The story is surprisingly great, good voice acting and content for the story mode, some choices i believe affect the ending you get. Survival Mode has some zones that you can't go but the forest is still very big so it's not really that much of a let down.

disclaimer: i am not trying to make fun of the forest, i have the game and have 82 hours on it, i'm just using the forest as an example because its a great survival game, but green hell has more survival mechanics and is harder to learn, i personally think the forest is a great game and if you like survival games you'll like the forest.

83,Green Hell,73617155,english,"Green Hell is exactly that, a buggy, messy hell. Keep in mind that I'm writing this review after having played through the multiplayer only, so I have no idea how the singleplayer plays out. Finished the game after around 12 hours out of which 5 or more were running back to the place I've died because saves simply do not work, unless you're the host, and you spawn in a random camp/save point from before. The game doesn't help when everything in the jungle is out to kill you, which I understand because it's still A JUNGLE but since I was so frustrated with the bugged saving points that after a while you just keep running into things and brushing them off so you can get to the next part of the story, regardless whether you're dying from poison, hunger or something else. Losing things from your inventory after you die also didn't help the case of how frustrating the multiplayer was. The combat is non-existent and when you are put into such a situation it's again buggy and ridiculous at times. There were times when I was fighting an opponent that my friends couldn't see (full sanity btw so he was a real enemy) but they could salvage his body afterwards, even though they still couldn't see it. The NPC animations were stiff and funny most of the times with animals and/or people getting stuck in a loop or just in place for quite some time. The sanity system is pretty good but after a while of hearing it over and over again it just gets annoying and you really don't care anymore about the voices. 
Now, the game does have some good sides to it, like the graphics, sound design and the story, although predictable, was still enjoyable and it's what made me keep going to the end. The scenery was just gorgeous at times with how the moonlight would flow through trees and light up the jungle flora or reflect on the water surfaces. The sound design was amazing, you could hear every distinct sound and where it came from, giving you a few jumpscares along the way. 
Having said all of this, I highly suggest your first playthrough to be on singleplayer so you can avoid the frustration of the bugs in the MP part and have a nice enjoyable experience as I'm pretty sure most of the people that left positive reviews had.",1596302632,1596302632,FALSE,0,1,0.478260875,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,526,37,1004,0,1004,1596300965,,

- The mechanics are useless, you can finish the game without doing half of the craftings. Or even realizing those exist. The only thing you need is an axe, a knife, bow and arrows, since these are items are easily crafteable, there is no death penalty.

96,Green Hell,73566958,english,"I recommend this game because I thoroughly enjoyed the story with some replayability in the hardest difficulty on survival mode. I have much fewer hours in game than the number listed because I leave the game running minimized sometimes.

The story is great and is an excellent introduction to the game and its mechanics. You can tell the devs put a lot of time into it because it shows in the detail of the scenes and creativity. Please give the user some help with the blood sample task. I don't know how I would have gotten it without googling it, honestly.

Once I was done with the story, I went right to the hardest difficulty. It is too easy. Please see my suggestions to the devs below. The game is fun but lacks the depth you'd see in a finished game (understandably so). Look at The Long Dark as a comparison to identify the shortcomings of Green Hell as it is in its current stage of development.

Green Hell Suggestions
1) Wetness mechanic for player and items
	a) player wetness. Make water necessary to avoid sometimes. add issue of fungus on feet.  Add tiers of ""shoes"" items. Exposure to water affects hypo and hyper thermia conditions. 
	b) item wetness. wood fitness for fire and possibly weight.
2) Temperature mechanic incl hypothermia, hyperthermia.
3) More clothing
4) Scale difficulty. Impossible to starve or dehydrate on hardest difficulty. Scale mobs. Mobs not a threat. PvE not challenging. Make a no-win scenario possible: The more natives the player kills, the larger the counterattack native group that spawns seeks him out.
5) IRL Carbs burn fastest and fats slowest. Protien somewhere in between. Update macronutrient loss to reflect real life.
6) more randomized spawns of mobs. especially relevant so an experienced player is more likely to come across an unexpected snake or spider.
7) Parasites too easily removed. Nerf antiparasitic mushrooms.
8) Name the flora with their genus and species when discovered. Unknown mushroom? Do Pleurotus citrinopileatus for example.
9) Make local consuption of resources be insufficient for persistent survival at one location. AKA make travel necessary. At least make progressing to different regions necessary

99,Green Hell,73560761,english,"The first few hours you spend in this game are some of the best survival horror I've ever experienced. Gathering food and water is an absolute nightmare when you start out. Injuries and infections are not a matter of 'if' but 'when', and they will happen very often. Your first encounter with natives will be absolutely terrifying, especially if it happens at night. The game also has an Amnesia-style sanity system. It seems gimmicky and tacked-on, but actually adds a wonderful layer of depth as you learn the story. If your sanity drops below 50%, your inner monologue starts yelling hostile, demotivational things at you. It's not only quite disturbing, it drowns out environmental noises, which puts you in extreme danger. If your sanity drops low enough, imaginary enemies will attack you. If your sanity drops low enough to trigger effects, you're pretty much already screwed, but if you keep yourself healthy and well-fed and rest appropriately, you probably won't have any problems with it.

However, once you become adept at fighting the hostile natives and learn how to efficiently gather food, water, and treat injuries, the challenge lessens greatly. Once you've established your base camp, gotten proficient at survival, and explored the first area, the actual story mode can be completed rather quickly. The story was very predictable (for me at least). The only real challenge is finding the 'cure', which was very unintuitive and I had to look up a guide to figure it out, because it involves doing something the game has explicitly taught you is a bad thing to do. However, in retrospect, if you pay attention to all the notes you've read throughout the game you can figure it out rather easily, so pay attention and explore every area.

Survival mode is added almost as an afterthought. While there is building in this game, it isn't the main focus. Level areas to build on are small, rare, and often not near a water source. And again, after you learn how to survive and fight the natives, there isn't really much of a challenge.

6,Green Hell,73537454,english,"I have only played the game for a few days now so far im loving it im hoping the updates keep coming i am very intreged with survival/crafting/building  games its just so hard to find one that has good crafting and building and doesnt become to mundane and repetitive so as to eventualy loose your intrest finding one that is fun and not grinding and boring is hard but i think Green Hell has some awsome potintial.
With the addition of the Forge i am hoping to see lots more crafting and building develope in the game hopfully soon the abilaty to craft the machete and a bigger back pack would be nice i find that the leach thing happens to much and distracts alot from the play in the game from having to stop and check yourself so often  for them.
Also it would be nice to be able to Craft a bigger Axe that has way more Durability to be able to harvest larger trees at present its pretty much impossible to cut down a large tree due to Axe breaking and you wouyld have to craft so many axe,s that its unreal.
If the Developers would add the ability to Harvest the large boulders with the pick that would also be nice and with addition of the forge if they would maybe place boulders containing different metals that could be harvested with the pick axe that could be used in crafting that would add alot more intrigue to the game.
And also i find that Most resource you harvest leaf, wood, rope ect. takes an estremly long time to respawn which is a big minus in the game also cooking there should be more cooking reciepe's for things and the ability to craft Cooking utensile's and Stove or camp stove and food especialy fish and virietys of fish it would also be great to be able to craft a fishing pole 
Also currently you get very little meat from things like Hogs And other larger animals which i think the developers should adress.
and harvest bait.
Also the ability to craft different clothing using leaves ect. and maybe even tables and chaires and epecialy Standing torches and inside torches would be realy helpful.
A bigger map and more caves and other places to discover is definatly needed a very helpfull tool which you seem to have when the game starts is a rope and grapling hook to climb with it would be great to be able to craft one and would add a huge amount of intrigue to exploring the map.
And the ability to craft a canoe or raft to explore the good amount of water way in the game would be a nice addition as well.
Well thats just some of my thoughts on what would make the game way better in case maybe the developers are reading lol.
But all in all i think the game has great potential and so far outside the anoying leach thing is fun to play at first i wasnt to king on buying the game considering it was still in development and from what i had read from other reveiws that the game still needed but i love these type games and broke down and bought it anyway and after playing i can say it is very playable and worth the current price of $24.99 i dont think that it would be worth investing more than that price untill more content is added but its worth the price as of now.
I would highly recomend this game to anyone like myself who loves Survival,Crafting and building games hopefully in the future we will see more crafting and building ability among other things from the Developers.

9,Green Hell,73528948,english,"I am not a game reviewer, simply a player.

Green Hell follows in the footsteps of The Forest. It’s realistic, immersive, and just the right amount of terrifying. It utilises The Forest’s original progression, building, and crafting mechanics and also adds so much more to it. Though it doesn’t have the same punishing mechanics to progression as The Forest.

Many people say this game is incredibly hard, but after playing it on the highest difficulty, I strongly disagree. It’s just a matter of learning the cure for illness and injuries, appropriate water and food management, watching your Wonderfully limited HUD and wearing armour. Armour makes you go from getting a massive laceration from jumping near a rock to walking away without a scratch from fighting a puma. Just keep your distance from another scary creature and it’s not a hard game.


It has an original mechanics for dealing with the many wounds you’ll receive … until you make armour. A tiny HUD popup indicated that you need to inspect yourself. Then you pull leaches, bandage, clean, and or armour each limb. Very simple but unique and realistic.

This is the only game of the survival/horror game genre that doesn’t have a bulky HUD. To see your health, water, and food, you simply look at your watch. The carbohydrate, fat, and protein monitor is a little bit ill-fitted as it’s a bit too sci-fi for a modern setting. I haven’t seen anything like it other than the vitamins in Atlas, but that’s poorly implemented and even more ill-fitting to that title.

Mud brick is somehow a forgotten essential remnant of history when it comes to most video games, especially the first/third person survival horror genre. Green Hell utilises that significant survival method and adds it to the already fantastic and original building mechanics inspired by The Forest. It adds more content and some ways to build that I’ve never seen in another game.


The rainforest feels incredibly bare for the amount of animals and plants in the Amazon as rainforests are the most diverse environments on the planet. But that’s the limitation of game mechanics. It feels like there is enough to keep you busy, but you fast learn every plant and animal that helps and hurts you.

The story is highly rewarding though a late clue is too well hidden. It’s only in a note and one piece of the story and it’s massively overshadowed by something similar. The character would also know more about the potential answer than me, but somehow didn’t come to the right conclusion, which plays like a very heavy oversight in writing.

Ultimately, just playing the story is worth buying the game alone. Green Hell comes with much more content than just that. So it will keep you happily terrified for many hours.

The tribes people (Enemies) and Jaguars will not give you ANY chance, one shot you're pretty much dead with a tribes person. You go insane, vomit once and while your vomiting the tribes person attacks and kills you. Makes me chuckle, pretty unfair but whatever i'll just respawn on my save.
I wish there were a few more things to craft, however they're still implementing those. :)
It's great because you should and HAVE to explore to get the different herbs, flowers and such! 
It's great to eat something and find out it gives you a negative effect (hopefully you know the cure.)

53,Green Hell,73307890,english,"I recommend this game, but it may not be for everybody.

I love survival games, and I played extensively The Long Dark recently. I love a lot the immersion in it, but there was always the nagging feeling that you could not just pause and enjoy a nice sunny day: the resources being finite, and the cold ever-increasing, the game felt like a race with no minute to spare, with an inescapable death that you could only defer a bit.

So I am quite happy to have found Green Hell, as it fulfills what I wanted for such a game:
- Immersive, with really nice graphics
- Challenging, but not insanely hard
- You can take your time, just stroll around enjoying the scenery: you do not have to reach a high level of technology, and essential resources will re spawn
- The story is nicely done

What you may not like:
- Until you understand what is critical (staying infection-free, always have enough bandages of all types, keeping your sanity high), and have a clear roadmap of what to do if things go south, the game may seem frustrating for novices.
- Once you understand the basics, the game becomes somewhat too easy
- This is not the game that will satisfy base-builders. Logs are a finite resource, and large scale crafting/building can be cumbersome
- Not everything is explained, you must read the forums and wiki from time to time.

So, for me, it was the most enjoyable survival game I played, because I just love getting immersed in it. It is not perfect, some additional contents would be quite welcome, but I so not regret my purchase.

Bonus, some tips:
In addition to the various guides and tips you can read, here are mine:
- Stay sane, and avoid flirting with critical conditions
- Do not fear parasites: common mushrooms cures them, so do not hesitate to eat raw meat and drink unsafe water rather than get into critical condition.
- Tech is overrated: keep stone tools, they work
- raise and practice  the bow as fast as possible
- sleep at dawn and dusk, but you can do a lot of things at midnight as the moon is high and provides a lot of light. Basically work in 2 shifts",1595765395,1595765485,TRUE,1,0,0.517543852,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,36,2,4167,0,2353,1596745714,,

56,Green Hell,67077247,english,"Overall comment:
Really enjoyed the game. Kudos to the developers who are constantly improving things and working to fix bugs!

MULTIPLAYER STORY MODE:
Updated after more hours of gameplay. Although the start is confusing where you are separated from all your friends, following gathering resources and getting yourself started to explore further to try to find your friends, the game progresses fairly quickly. We did make the mistake of me going to all the places and getting the grappling hook before drinking our first potion. But once we have met up and the gameplay is pretty much the same as non story mode.

Recommend?
Yes


PRE MULTIPLAYER STORY MODE:
Multiplayer survival observations

Pros:
Really good graphics and realistic mechanisms. There are so many things you can make and it is super satisfying when you figure out something new.
After 51 hours of gameplay, I can safely say I enjoy the game a lot. The coop aspect is really what makes the game enjoyable for both of us.

Cons:
Some frustrating bugs. First and foremost is the coop loading, where anyone joining the game gets a blank character despite previous saves. The only fix we found from other players is to kill the guest character and respawn. Before knowing this fix it was super frustrating and we spent an hour plus loading and reloading the game, coming very close to shelving it until developers fix this with a patch.
Second bug is that the mud forge doesn't work after a while no matter what, where the host can't use it but guest can but anything forged in there disappears.
Third bug bear, though not as annoying as the first or second is that sometimes only one of us in the game can see the natives and receive the attacks. Whilst this is a set back, it also brings some minor conveniences to the game.

Bottom line:
Yes the bugs are frustrating and it nearly caused us to shelve the game indefinitely. But, credit must be given where it's due, the gameplay is excellent and game mechanisms are incredible, leaving the players hungry for more.

64,Green Hell,73257369,english,"Heyo, played through the game once now and put some time into survival mode. As a fan of survival type games here is my review.

Presentation:
+ gorgerous and believeable jungle athmosphere. Visited Borneo last year and this game perfectly captures the look and feel of wandering through a dense tropical jungle
+ even though there is only one biome there's plenty of visual variety due to different vegetation and points of interst such as caves, mangroves, jungle camps, etc.
+ excellent lighting and weather effects
+ sparse but athmospheric use of music in combat situations or during drug trips
- lack of ambient noise which makes the jungle feel lifeless at times. The game could do with more birds and crickets chriping or frogs croaking.
- Really lackluster animations. Character animations  are either incredibly stiff or missing completely with the screen simply fading to black when doing more complicated movement such as climbing. This is especially annoying in coop.

Story:
+ Very well presented, dreamlike cutsequences that allow for meaninful player interaction
+ Quite a few ""wow moments"" due to an excellent presenentation of the story even more so compared to other survival games where stoy is usually only dealt with on a sruface level
- Reading through other reviews praising the story this might come as a surprise but to me the games story was incredibly dumb even though it tries very hard to present itself as this deep adn thoughtful take on the effects of modern society (ab)using the rainforests natural resources. While the game tries its hardest to present itself as this realistic rainfroest simulation the player is expected to believe a Resident Evil levels of medical fiction. There's this magical plant that can cure any disease known to men including cancer. Not only alleviate symptoms of certain disease or prevent the spread of cancerous growth by X percent. No, completely heal every disease. This plant (!) is then turned into a vaccine (!) which causes a virus (!). The virus then convienently has an incubationt ime of months if not years so that evil pharma can infect a siceable amount of people with the plant born vaccine virus. 

I can understand why this seems like I'm being nitpicky but trust me I'm not. Not only does the unrealistic story heavily conrtats with the realistic gameplay. But the game tries so hard to make the protagonist (and by extension the player) feel bad for something they could not have been forseen that the whole premise falls apart upon closer inspection. Why feel bad for causing a plant born vaccine virus pandemic when all you wanted to do was find a plant that could be used for cancer treatment. Why feel bad for trying to save your wife from certain death when you already did it once? Why feel bad for the death of indigenous people when you had very friendly relations with them and a drug cartel decides to go full evil scientist on them and locks them in cages for their amateurish (and unfortunately deadly) experiments. The story only works if you don't think about it too hard. 

Gameplay
+ Fantastic food and health management. I've never played a game before that came so close to the true meaning of survival. In other games you simpyl have to eat food, in this game you have to make sure you eat a balanced diet of fat, carbs, proteins and water.  In other games you swallow a pill and heal any form of physical ailment, no matter if it's a broken leg or food poisoning. In Green Hell there's multiple diseases and wounds that require individual treatment.
+ Fun ""trial (dieal) and error"" game of findign out what the different consumeables and objects in this game can do and how they can be used in different ways. A cocnut can be used for providing nutritients but also to craft a method for carrying liquids and catch rainwater.
+ hyperrealistic buildmode that requires the player to collect and place every single stick and stone you use to build shelters and furniture. If you like shows like ""primitive technology"" you will love this
+ multiple ways to hunt, prepare and conserving food  
- most of the tech tree is completely unecessary. You don't gain any meaninfula dvantages from building complicated animal traps when you can simply build a bow out of stick and rope and hunt fish and tapirs with 0 problems. Why build a costly mud shelter when a simple palm leave roof or cave does the same? Why craft metal tools when a stoneaxe works pretty much just as fine. In fact you can play this entire game without building anything except for campires, simple shelters and a bow while you feast your way through a jungle full of tasty mushrooms, snails and dead birds that require zero effort other than picking them up. There's a serious disconnect between the things that are in the game but are completely irrelevant. Whoever thought a logholder would be a good idea for a game that doesn't even require you to use a single log should seriously reconsider their career choice.
- Meaningless Sanitymeter. Being Insane does nothing except for reducing the saturation in you field of view and hearing creepy voices in your head. Simply switch of your speakers until you are sane again. Or use one of the many bugs and go to sleep over and over again for an ingame minute on a comfy bed to get 3 Sanity every time you wake up. Oh an speaking of sanity, this is another example where the realistic gameplay and unrealistic story don't go together at all. You mean to tell me that I start hearing voices when I go insane but can hear Mia's voice clearly no matter how sane or insane I am? Yeah sure... 
- Meaningles combat. Crocodile? Just use bow. Puma? Just use bow. Group of hostile indigenous people. Just. Use. Bow.
- Survival mode offers no replay value. There's nothing to achieve by building the same looking mud hut for the 10th time or exploring a map that has pretty much the same gameplay elements and interacteble objects evenly spread across the map.

Performance:
+ Steady Framerate on both PCs I used to play the game
+ okay loading times
- Tons of bugs. Savegames and Inventories were lost a couple of times, I met unkillelable rattlesnakes mor ethan once and one time I even had to restart the campaign because I would just load into a completely flat plain covered in nothing but grass and a tree here and there. Quite bizarre but also annoying since the game saved this buggy state over my functionign savegame

Verdict:
A lot of good ideas that fail to blend into a cohesive experience. Everything in this game seems to be at odds with each other. The gameplay focusses on realism but the story is straight up medical fiction similar to what you woudl expect from a Resi game. There's a lot of stuff you can do but you never really have to do which makes it's inclusion in the game utterly pointless.

Coming from games like The Forest, you really expect that you've seen the limits of what these games can offer, however, I've never been happier to be proven wrong in my life. The game starts you off with a tutorial familiar to many survival game players of how to pick things up and put them together, what you haven't experienced though, is the level of danger and in depth detail to the environment you are in, at no point do you question your surroundings, this is a green hell and you can never know when to expect your next challenge. The story is amazing with full voice acting implemented and all animations, as a single player and multiplayer experience I could safely say you will get a 25 hour play through (that's not 100% achievements) and you will be very happy with it.


The best features:
[list]
[*] Amazing survival mechanics, you have to watch your step everywhere you go! Inspect your body for wounds and found different remedies scattered around the jungle to survive your next encounter with death.
[*]The story line was so well made, and paying attention to every bit of lore along the way really helped make you feel the massive twist in the end, it was like playing out a movie.
[*] On Ultra settings, this game is absolutely beautiful! the sun rays coming through the forest canopy, the water effects when it rains, this game is amazing.
[*] Developers have been updating it so often, I got this at such a cheap price on sale, and it paid off within the first day of playing it, I cant wait to see what comes next.
[*] Survival weapons feel strong, you arent just jabbing animals or the natives 100 times to get a kill like most games, which made it feel so realistic, a perfect arrow the head puts anything in the dirt, even you!
[/list]

What needs more work:
[list]
[*] The Multiplayer co-op is not working as intended due to some severe bugs, the first set deleted progress with infinite saving, but was patched, however, after the patch your friends have their inventory reset to who knows when, its so hard to track how to get around it, main thing is, it works for host.
[*] The building can get a lit boring in the endless mode when you run out of things to make, in time more things will come, but for now it has that ""what now"" feeling, but I totally understand its not the purpose of the game.

91,Green Hell,73171309,english,"The story is good so I'll get that out of the way to focus on the other things that I enjoy
even more.

I love building crafting games, from 7 Days to Die to Empyrion Galactic Survival, you get
the picture. So this game is not so story driven that you will feel it's over when the story
finishes. Start a new game on survival and be a person who's decided to live in the wild
Amazon jungle.

The map is big... I mean crazy big so there is piles to explore and great if you're looking
for that perfect place to build your safe paradise get away. Deep jungle, cave, small
river, waterfalls or bamboo forests next to pristine waters full of fish; you have loads
of great places to build your house.

Great building options. Simple palm beds to mud structures and gardens (by way of
using the planter box). You can basically grow our own jungle in your base of many
different plants that still reach full size. (Aren't dwarfed for growing) You can go off
to adventure and come back to Banana trees, Palmetto Plants and other trees with
food all over them. Build a house and then make it pretty.

A few minor issues to be aware of and tips to help you mostly with building. Mud
floors can be a bit glitchy on items. 
Dropping certain things on mud floors fall cause the item to fall through to the ground. 
Not game breaking
Mud floors can block other frames from being built next to them or on them at times.
A little problematic but a work around is to plan well first, build your frames and then
put in your mud floors roofs etc. Construction breaking at times so plan ahead.

That's all the cons though that I can think of. A great great game and incredibly
beautiful. If you can't afford a vacation to the tropics and want one with a challenge
then you'll most likely enjoy this game!

              - why can't we build a rack for the planks, but we can for every other king of wood/bamboo?
- Multiplayer: the Host has the save file method sucks, really. A dedicated server feature would be best way to solve this problem.
- Buildings: in multiplayer players can add blueprint to the same spot at the same time, even building both walls...
- Story: - the game tries to push you to progress with the story, but you can still build the base elements. At least restrict the base technologies if you want the players to run from location to location, but do not punish them for building a base and creating a miniature economy.
- Unfairness: - 10 tribal warrior camp spawning as soon as you start melting iron ingots is not challenging! it's just a dickhead move.

Save system is a joke, when I'm playing with my friend if I'm not hosting the game next time when I log in I'm spawning in a irrelevant location rather than where I must've spawn. That's the biggest problem that I annoyed.

Also your inventory is not there for you when you start playing after you log off from you multiplayer session.

Optimisation is not there yet either, I've played this game with both Nvidia GTX 1080 and RTX 2060 and its not hitting that sweet 60 FPS is all the time.

Pros: 
- Solid survival game
- Decisions matter
- Learning the survival recipes from seeing the villiagers work was a nice touch. 
- Story so far is pretty good (really just starting still as of this writing)
Cons:
- Dude eats like a tank, even on the lower settings. This asshole ate an entire wild pig on his own and was bitching about being hungry 10 ft away from the camp fire. 
- I'm 9 days in, to keep energy levels up it is purely running in circles trying to find enough food for this ass. 
- I have to sleep twice a day to keep energy levels up. (Likely related to scarcity of food and this asshole being an Olympic tier binge eater.)
- There is no guidance, likely my largest actual complaint.  This dude is supposed to have made his life work in the jungle and he don't know **** about anything. 


At the end of the day, I get the whole go for difficulty gig, however, this dude either needs to have died WAY before now, and needs to get a clue.

They can't cross water, have terrible eyesight and you can literally snipe one of their friends sitting next to them and they won't notice. With enough arrows you can actually take out an entire tribe this way without once putting yourself in danger, it's basically coded cheating.
    [*] Building placement is generally OK but mud buildings can be a real pain. The game allows you to build the frame but the moment you want to cover it with mud, the boulder that shouldn't be a problem suddenly is. You shouldn't be able to place the frame in the first place OR you should be allowed to cover the ""offending"" object with mud, which would make sense. Or maybe a way to remove big rocks and big trees?
    [*] Animal AI. You can put an arrow into an armadillo, watch it run away and then very quickly forget and start walking back to you on it's predefined path.
    [*] Food bars, all whopping 4 of them, drain far too fast even on perfect health and minimum activity. If any one person actually ate half of what my character eats in a day, they'd literally explode.

68,Green Hell,72934026,english,"Disclaimer - Only played story mode with friends. Contains spoilers.

Story (6.0 / 10):

The plot itself turns out to be very interesting: We are there, in the middle of the jungle. A bunch of natives we r messing around with happen to do something to Mia, the protagonist's wife. Exploring those ideas up to the end, are pretty well made. The interesting points such as: The family in the island, the drug dealers, the Omolu Corp, and most importantly, what damn happened to Mia in the beginning of the story. You as a player will like a lot through the game, but it lacks of an epic final. The curiosity levels that you have until the end, are high af. By that said, the expectation to the best moment in the game - the end - was at  the same level or even higher, but all of that went down by a mediocre ending that lacks explanations and just seems like a rushed work that was there as a container until they finish the actual end. 

Gameplay:
For this part, I'll separate in some parts because I want to talk about things a little more specific...

FPS and Performance (3/10) : Even ARK players would feel a bit of this lag. The FPS is okay most of the time, but as soon as all players gather nearby the FPS just go completely up and down. It is quite frustrating to see the freaking native get a shot on you while you're just there lacking of FPS. Saves are quite glitched, and sometimes the game would just spawn you at the spawn from the very beginning, YES, EVEN IF YOU WERE ON THE END. This was one of the bad sides of this game, as it made me feel that the developers didn't invest as much to this part.

""Survival Experience"" (9.0/10): The survival of this game is amazing. Snakes, spiders, scorpions, alligators, and all kind of stuff that wanna kill you will be there. The fauna and the study they made about Brazil is quite amusing, as it is actually coherent in most, if not, all parts. The ""snow ball effect"" which me and my friends experienced a lot, which was basically where 2 people would die and make sanity go down to 0 and make the other 2 die, which led to a cycle of people dying and making healthy people loose sanity over and over. This all summed up to a great experience in the survival aspect of the game. I personally am not giving it a 10 just because by the end of the game, the strategies and how the game works (i.e. people could 1 shot natives or any shit pretty much) didn't quite make sense and were somehow disappointing.

Extra - Study over the Amazon Rainforest and Brazil (9.5/10): As previously mentioned, I believe the developers made an amazing job. The Amazon biomes are pretty well made, with animals accordingly, and most of it is almost perfect. Lacks of some biology studies, even though it is fictional, I expected something a little more realistic. But for this one, you guys made a great work.

Overall (6.5/10) :
This game made some memories. I loved the way it evolves you through the story, but ""I feel my heart crack"" by the end. Greenhell will not be forgotten and has some unique ways that games within this genre have not made. Makes people have a good teamwork, and also to be careful while on grass. I hope that the devs actually come with something that explains everything, and to be honest, if it wasn't lacking of good explanations by the end, I would gave it a high score. Worth to give it a try if you enjoy survival games and exploring in general.

If you read this far, I hope you can push it to the developers so that they read this suggestion: Please make more slots. It does not matter if it makes easier for players. Is it your gameplay? No. I want to be free to play with more than f***** 4 players. Please make more slots to your game. 10? Good, because, as I said, the snow ball effect will take care of it

TL;DR

Story mode of the game has a very unique idea and ways to explore the narrative, though it lacks a good conclusion. Gameplay kinda sucks but it is playable. Can't tell about survival mode.

It feels extremely similar to the Forest, which I really enjoyed with my friends. The only difference is, this game is way more hardcore. You will die at least 10 times before you start to learn little tricks, craft certain things, and learn how to efficiently hunt. I saw my first native after 6 hours of gameplay. I was walking through the jungle looking for new landmarks/areas when suddenly 3 natives are less than 10 feet away from me. Never having used the bow yet, i pop a lucky headshot on the first native. At this point I realize I forgot to craft more arrows. The second native charges me, I cut him with a stone blade, he falters backwards. I quickly equip my spear, take aim, boom another headshot. The last  native looks like hes jerking off by a rock and very well may have been. Being super hyped of my first two kills, I rush the third native, throw my bone knife and it hits him right in the eye. I then beat the fuck out of him with a stone axe. The moment when I wished I had instant replay enabled. I then harvest the body and cook up some human meat. I use their bones to pry worms off my body later. 10/10. Yes there are a lot bugs, literally, its the jungle. This game is the most immersive survival game I've played yet.


Update, after progressing even further into the story, I am very surprised how big the map is. I won't spoil anything but the world is HUGE!

98,Green Hell,72871392,english,"So this game is good. Certainly wouldn't call it great, but it's definitely good. The environment looks nice on cursory inspection, the game is functional if occasionally glitchy. If you're into survival games that don't hold any punches back, this is a good addition to the collection.

As for actual gameplay, this sets you alone (or with up to 3 friends) in the middle of the Amazon Rainforest. You must figure out how to craft tools, build shelters, get food and water, and use your environment to not die like an idiot. What this actually means is you eat some random stuff off the ground and pray it doesn't kill you. Usually this is a 50/50 for plants, less so for most meats. Predators, natives, and starvation/dehydration are all significant risks and can hit you anywhere. The game does have a complete story mode which is definitely a wild ride, but a bit too predictable past the first area.

Things I would like dearly to see added to the game are some additions to the build system, like awnings, and roofs that make the rain effects stop indoors (please, for the love of God), better long-term food preservation (salting for example), and perhaps some sort of improvement to the crafting system to make bulk goods for things like arrows/fish hooks/bone needles/stone blades.

2,Green Hell,72862879,english,"Cons: 

- Resources drain a little bit too fast, slowing down progress in building, crafting, story etc. due to constant need of replenishing water, food, etc.. I changed difficulty to custom and set the drain to ""low"", which made the game much more enjoyable. 

- Story is pretty disconnected from the gameplay. There's no reason to explore most of the map or even build a house. All you really need is a campfire and a bed, both of which you can craft very easily on the fly. Maybe some cover for the fire. 

- You get kicked while you're down, a lot. Especially in the beginning. You go out looking for stuff and you get bitten by a snake. You now have fever, meaning you lose energy very quickly, and you can't make it back to your bed to sleep the fever off. You pass out on the ground. You wake up with a worm inside your arm. You dig the worm out, but the wound is now infected, because you are dirty, because you passed out and slept on the ground. You're out of protein, so you make a campfire to cook meat. You get the campfire ready and the meat is almost cooked. It starts raining. 

Pros: 

- Story is pretty good I guess. I usually end up ignoring the story in a game, but this one kept me somewhat invested. 

- Crafting is very in-depth. Even if you're not required to utilize most of it.

This is hands down the best survival game I have played. At first I died a ton, was overwhelmed by menu's, and just confused in general. After acquainting myself with the UI things began to go more smoothly. I figured out ways to heal myself and just survive a bit longer each time. The crafting system is really nice in this and adds to the immersion. It takes a bit to get the hang of but this UI lets you spend more time in game than in menus. This is great for a game in this genre. This game has a phenomenal story which I didn't expect at all. Story mode has you surviving all the elements, wildlife, and skull warriors, while seeking answers through introspective trips. Most of the meat and potatoes of the story is told through notes and through communications on the walkie talkie.

71,Green Hell,72645934,english,"I decided to try this playthrough with the lady, after hours and hours of toiling and constant deaths due to oxygen overdose and overall living, I find that this simply isn't fun. The challenge is constant maintaining of four different food bars that hit near zero after like 5 minutes of gameplay. Trying to consume water is basically having a ton of mushrooms to remove parasites since its pointless to boil water since it only hydrates like 5% after waiting like 3 minutes. God forbid i get an injury, by the time you figure out and gather material to fix it you are already dead. Tutorials are nonexistent and teach nothing useful to playing the game. You can't ever cook anything since it rains like every 3-4 minutes making the window to cook impossibly low. I'm down for survival games, they are challenging and fun to overcome but this just uses monotonous gimmicks to pad game time and progression. The only way to make this playable is have a better crafting system and to have slower degradation of your survival meters so you can actually play through the story instead of constantly eating enough food to feed an entire city.

Edit: This game is gorgeous, runs with no issues and is overall enthralling and interesting. Such a cool idea for a game gone to waste because survival is impossible and just not fun. 5/10 I would recommend something like Don't starve or Ark if you want a better and more compelling experience.",1594683479,1594683924,FALSE,0,1,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,342,2,1121,0,1106,1594683960,,

Green Hell is gorgeous, game-play is intuitive and slick. It may be frustrating for the first 4-5 plays, but that frustration kind of adds to the experience. The Natives and Tribes feel like an afterthought (like another reviewer said, these folks are MASTERS of this environment and Green Hell seems miss that) so the ability to toggle Tribes in survival mode is nice.

79,Green Hell,72633113,english,"[b]TL;DR: This is by far the hardest, most realistic, most frustrating survival game I have ever played. AND I LOVE IT![/b]

[b]Wiki Description:[/b] [i]Green Hell is a sweltering struggle for survival in the Amazonian rainforest. Clinging to life, the player is set on a journey of durability as the effects of solitude wear heavy not only on the body but also the mind. How long will can you survive against the dangers of the unknown? Having only a radio at your disposal you will follow a familiar voice through a seemingly endless and ruthlessly inhospitable jungle. Bit by bit, you will unveil more of the mystery of how you came to be in this hostile situation and what you discover just might be worse than what you fought so hard against to survive.[/i]

OK, so I've got this game on Summer Sale just because I liked The Forest and I wanted something new. But I didn't expect this kind of game. It's hard. It's fun. It's frustrating. And still, I am playing it everyday to relax. Odd, right? Hear me out!

[b]Gameplay:[/b]
First of all, you need to complete the tutorial. It's not a typical ""move forward with W, interact with E"" type of tutorial. It's an introduction to the story and without it, you can't play multiplayer. Now, you can play Single Player or Multiplayer in ""Story Mode"" or ""Survival Mode"". 
I recommend playing the story first, so you can get familiar with the game and gain some endurance to frustration. And begin with an easy level of difficulty. Then you can flex to your friends with other levels of difficulty. 
Multiplayer is fun and you should try it!

[b]Difficulty levels:[/b]
- [b]A Walk In The Park:[/b] Recommend for players who want to focus on building and exploring. A peaceful mode with no hostile or predatory animal attacks. The player still walk into danger, taking damage from the environment such as Food Poisoning,Venom Wound and Worms. Sanity - OFF; Hostile Tribes - OFF; Predators - OFF; Nutrition depletion - Slow. 
- [b]Welcome To The Jungle:[/b] Recommend for all players. A balanced survival experience. Sanity - ON; Hostile Tribes - ON; Predators - ON; Nutrition depletion - Normal. 
- [b]King Of The Jungle:[/b] Recommend for survival experts. Enemies are more hostile and sanity penalties are increased. Sanity - ON; Hostile Tribes - ON; Predators - ON; Nutrition depletion - Increased. 
- [b]Green Hell:[/b] Recommend for veteran players. Enemies are more hostile and sanity penalties are increased. Perma-Death, all progress will be lost after death. Sanity - ON; Hostile Tribes - ON; Predators - ON; Nutrition depletion - Increased. 

[b]Graphics:[/b]
Superb! 

[b]Performance:[/b]
Well optimized and you can play this game on an average computer or on a super high-performance one. It will be smooth, but the graphics will be sacrificed on average ones. I have an i7 4770 and a GTX 960 GB and I run it smooth at medium-high settings at 45 fps constant. 

[b]How I spent my first 7 hours in this game:[/b]
Day 1: injured myself, got an infection, died. 
Day 2: starved to death. 
Day 3: I was bitten by a snake. I died. 
Day 4: Some kind of tiger attacked me. Died. 
Day 5: Some painted indigenous killed me. Of course, dead. 
Day 6: Survived first days, advanced in the story timeline. Injured myself, didn't see. Went to sleep. Time passed. So did I. 
Oh, and I found out the by sleeping you don't save the game. You need a construction for this. So I got back to square 1. Oh, the joy of life.

23,Green Hell,72118572,english,"Green hell is an open-world survival game set in the Amazonian Jungle. You start with nothing and you have to build, craft and harvest everything by yourself or, in case you are playing online, with your friends.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]

The first time you appear in the jungle, you have nothing and you know little about the local area and wildlife. The game wants to be realistic and that can be seen, from your nourishment management, to how dangerous it is to be injured.

You need to eat and drink, but  food will spoil after some time and water can contain parasites. Additionally, you need to clean yourself, or you can get an infection into your wounds. The Jungle is very dangerous and every enemy you meet can be your last.

[h1]Surviving[/h1]

The game has some enemies but they are not as life-threatening as your environment. They are dangerous, but not as much as the injuries that you get from the encounters with them, infection in your wounds, poisoning or just running out of water and food.

You have a sanity meter that you deplete and replenish by various actions, how you sleep, what you eat, etc. I really liked this feature because it can be deadly when it depletes. You start to hear voices, which are really similar to those in [i]Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice[/i], everywhere from no set direction. Apart from hearing the voices, you can see hallucinations of natives, that will attack you but if you kill them they disappear and you get nothing even if you receive injuries.

Apart from sanity, you have health and energy meters. Health is dependent on your Macroelements levels and you have to sleep regularly and if you don’t, you pass out. Energy is an indication of your maximum stamina, too.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2155429875

[h1]Combat[/h1]

Combat is not a strong part of this game. You have a number of combat options you can choose, but you don’t meet enemies too often, if you are like me and usually stay at your base and craft your Items.

Natives can attack your base and you can meet them, or predators, in the jungle, but unless it’s a predator that takes you by surprise, you don’t have to fight much, and natives are singing their songs all the time outside of combat, which can help you prepare for the fight or to avoid it completely. As I told above, the most dangerous are the consequences of the fight.

[h1]Smartwatch, Map, and Notebook[/h1]

The Player will start with a notebook and watches, both of which are of most importance. Your notebook is like a silent guide that will tell you how to craft something and it will enable you to build structures. Apart from crafting, you can see the progress of the story and other pieces of information important to survival - statuses, plants, effects, etc.

The Smartwatch has 3 functions: Time, Compass, and Macroelements. Time needs no explanation, Compas shows your coordinates and directions, and Macroelements is your meter of hunger and hydration. The game has 3 different types of nourishments which are counted as hunger - Carbohydrates, Proteins, and Fats. Your level of Macroelements is affecting your maximum health - more full = more health.

The last part of the important gear you will get is your map, which is obtained in your first steps after the tutorial. You cant see yourself on the map so to find your location you have to use compass coordinates too, the fastest way to find your location is being at the marked area on your map.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2155430807

[h1]Environment - graphics and sound[/h1]

The game is in the Amazonian rainforest full of trees, some areas have bamboo instead , and you will see various other plants everywhere. During your exploration, you will find rivers and other areas with water.

The game looks great in comparison to some other survival games that I’ve seen and details are a nice touch, animals make sounds while they are moving through the plants, you can hear the parrots and other jungle animals screams.

[h1]Game modes[/h1]

[h3]Story[/h3]
I really liked the story in this game, it lets you unlock new areas, it was interesting and you have a nice plot twist, too. It isn’t a story-driven game but the story was really great. Most of it is told by your radio conversation but you can see various clues to what happened from scattered documents or audio-logs you can find in some areas.

The biggest revelations are in the form of a Spiritual journey. After drinking hallucinogenic brew, you get to see the forgotten past and get to know the true story.You can take your time and explore the area instead of following the story, but as it opens new areas I recommend you to try completing at least some of it before making your base.

[h3]Survival[/h3]

Survival is almost the same as the Story mode. The main difference is that you can't access a few areas and features connected to the story. Apart from those you have access to a bigger part of the map right from the start, even if you still have to get the equipment to gain access to all of the areas in the game. Location of the needed equipement can difer from those in story. I recommend trying the story first because I really liked it and if you don’t hurry up you can take as long as you want to finish it. There are not many differences between them in terms of gameplay, apart from things connected to story like radio or Spiritual pathways.

[h3]Challenges[/h3]

Challenges are mini-missions in the world and they are not connected to your story progress in any way. They use the same areas but you appear in a given location with your mission and the coordinates of your objective, you don’t have a map or any other item. You are given a certain time to complete the objective before the challenge ends.

[h3]Multiplayer[/h3]

You can play with other players, with no friendly damage, and explore, build, and do stories together. If you want to play multiplayer I recommend you to play it with friends because you can save your progress and if you change to another server/player you lose it. Even so, you can find active players in public games that would play with you.

[h1]Problems[/h1]

Be aware that there are still sometimes some bugs or complications - Game of the host I played with lost his save and he had to do some things again. Sometimes you can see bugged animals or items thrown on the ground - not very often, but the biggest issue I had was the natives’ and some animals’ AI.

When you jump on a rock or you go to a platform built in the water, Natives will ignore you as if you disappeared and they will “find” you again when you step on the ground. I tried this multiple times and they ran away when I was on the rock, then back to attack me when I stepped on the ground, then I repeated it more with the same results, same happened with Black Caiman (crocodile) when I jumped on and off a fallen tree. This doesn’t have to happen every time and needs more testing.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]

As my first Survival game, I really enjoyed it, apart from a few problems mentioned above. It looks really great, the sound effects are good and the story is a nice touch. Because I didn’t play many survival games I can’t compare them but from what I saw, this game is on the right way to take a place among them. The sound effects are good and the story is a nice touch.

26,Green Hell,67312625,english,"New review: (1.03 patch Acheivments and Co-Op implemeted)
Story mode made it into co-op now, Which made it more enjoable and suddenly survival mode has purpose as you don't really have reason to do it on story mode. The game still had some weird bugs, espaccially in regards to a frog bug at a crucial story part (We had to let the host interact with that quest part). Sadly the game let a bit of sour taste and my tip's for anyone playing story mode it is that you have ""multiple maps"" you can find and you can swap inbetween them with a little arrow when you interact with the map (Standard key M), Armour doesnt weigh anything while worn and always bring more water then you think you need. 


Old review (1.0 Release)
The game might have merit for the solo gameplay and story but DONT buy it for co-op. Its not optimised for it (So plenty of bugs to fuck up your inventory) and so far its just have ""survival"" mode not any story mode.

40,Green Hell,67235223,english,"Green Hell is like all of your other survival games. A lot of people say it's hard, well I can tell you for sure it's not hard at all. The only time the game is hard when it is trying to find a group to play co-op survival. Normally the groups are assholes, they just kick you or leave you do all the work and then kick you and never leave you join that group ever again. Which can happen a lot and that's one of the reason why I say some of the groups are assholes.

[Story Mode]
So for the story mode for the game I would only give it a 1 star out of 5 star rating due to multiple reasons that you are about to hear. My first reason is the story is more just the survival mode but with dialog every so many minutes. Now don't get me wrong and say hey well what did you fought it a survival game and you are going to be doing all of the survival stuff from co-op in story mode, I get that but for me you would get dialog when you found the next objective and they don't tell you your next objective. Mainly you have to explore all 3 maps for the game to get your story. You are doing more exploring then actually survival. Now I already know some people are not going to agree but oh well this review is based off of my opinions of how i think this game is. Now the exploring was my second reason and my third reason is replay value and do i forget what the story was about after playing a week latter. So I will be honest for me the story is really easy to forget and hard to understand whats going really on. If you take a week brake then you might forget what the story was so far and replay what you all ready have played. Also you mainly have to figure out the story for your self. Once again most people will disagree of i don't give a shit. Now for replay value of the story mode. The value of the story replay mode i would rank it at 1 out of 5 stars because once you played it it's not that fun anymore and you are better playing survival co-op instead. This is what i think about the story mode now lets talk about the story co-op mode.

[Story CO-OP Mode]
Its what the same thing i talked about above for 95% of it. So one thing i will say that the story is definitely not made for co-op for story based material. Now it's really hard to get a group to play the story co-op mode and if you want to play from the being well good luck if you want to because you will be needing to host the game then your self then. Now also it's really buggy and broken well i played it and that was yesterday. Now what would i rate the story co-op mode? I would rate it at a 0.95 stars out of 5 stars. Now let's talk about co-op mode the main reason what everyone play this game for.

[CO-OP Mode]
Now where do i begin? Let's start with what everyone say's it's hard. The game is not hard at all just they only 3 thing that make it hard and it 90% is not even gameplay mechanics its about bugs, groups and it's death loop. First lets talk about the groups a little. Now i already talked about the groups above this section so i'm just going to summarize it. The groups are asshole, hard to find one also hard to find one that will keep you and leave you play with them. Now let's talk about the death loop. The death loop in this game is horrible. Here's the reason why. When you die in this game you lose 5 major stats in the game you must keep up all the times or you will die a lot and it's not always easy to get them up after death or keep them where you need to. You lose Sanity, Proteins, Water, Fat and Carbs. ?Now when you lose Sanity it would not be a problem when you lose a 100 when you die and if someone else die that's in your group everyone gets his -100 sanity. Now with that they can spawn in enemies that are hallucinations that only you can see and kill you in one or 2 hits depends on the difficulty you are playing one. Also if you have low stats you are not going to be able to attack as much because everything you do in the game requires stamina. In order to have stamina you need all 5  of you stats up and in order to get them up you got to fight the hallucinations and become not insane but you need your other stats. Okay i will just get my stats up first but it's not easy when you got to find nuts which can be really tough to find at times depending where your camp is at and this go for the same for water and proteins and carbs also you have to get double then you normally would to get you stats up and now heres the problem with that these items can be really hard to get if you been in your area for a while. It's just the nutrients depletion is a shit show. now i'm not going to talk about every main thing that is really bad about the death loop because if that's the case i would not be done writing this article for the next 5 years . if you want to learn more about it play the game. Now it's time for the bugs. The bugs huge in this game. Also they don't get fixed.",1586790570,1594485724,FALSE,1,0,0.523809552,3,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,27,6,6300,327,5577,1601934707,,

52,Green Hell,72480676,english,"[u]What I liked:[/u]

Green Hell has beautiful environments and a fairly satisfying, though often clunky, crafting system. There's a wide variety of things to pick up and learn the function of, which I've always liked in Survival games. The tutorial is very basic and doesn't over-explain things to you, serving largely as a way to introduce some of the story. Pay attention to your environment during this section, because some of the things you read will be important later on in the story. 

I'd suggest going through the Story mode your first playthrough, I think it was handled pretty well. You won't get the more nuanced bits unless you pay some attention to the notes you find and also explore some of the dialogue options with Mia. There are two endings a good one and a ""bad"" one. You learn essentially the same thing in both, so that's nice. You learn much of the plot through the use of ayahuasca, which I thought was a nice touch because it forces you to use your head to make sense of the visions you see while under its influence. 

Ayahuasca serves another purpose, which is to open up certain areas of the map. When you wake up you'll find a door to a previously inaccessible area has been opened. Most of the map is unlocked this way, which I thought complemented the story of the game. 

Green Hell has three different nutrient types to balance as well as hydration and you only see those things if you look at your watch, which is a nice change from the food/water UI elements in other games, even if it's not entirely realistic that you could check those things from your wrist. Your watch also have a GPS which you use with a map you have to find in order to navigate your way through the jungle. I love this aspect of the game.

[u]What I disliked:[/u]
Combat in this game is basically nonexistent. I played the Forest and I was expecting the natives in this game to be the sort of threat the mutants in the Forest were. I thought that was because I played the story on easy so I started a game on the second hardest difficulty. The natives in this game will never ambush you. Nothing ever does. Every threat in the jungle announces its presence to you from yards away, then creeps into range of your bow to be instantly killed by a headshot. This is [b]broken[/b]. The only time I've been ambushed it was my own fault. I heard the jaguar, looked around and didn't see him in the grass, decided I'd been hearing things and turned back around to finish what I was doing. The jaguar got a couple cheap shots in before I had a chance to get my bow out and hit him in the head. Natives are only a threat when they come at you in groups of 4 or more. That only happened to me once in 50 hours of play and it was the most exciting combat I experienced in the game.

[u]What I'd like to be changed:[/u]
There are certain crafting options that are simply not useful the way combat is right now. I don't see a reason to craft the stone tip arrows or the metal arrows when the stick arrows can kill things in one headshot. It would be nice if they sometimes broke on headshot, or flew wide (while alerting the target) to incentivize the crafting of the better arrows. I also feel the same way about the metal axes. Most anything you kill will give you bones you can craft into axes. 

Please make it so that at least on the higher difficulties threats don't announce themselves from so far away. Jaguars should definitely be ambushing me more often, they're ambush predators. The caimans should be charging at me, cause alligators are pretty fast on land. The time between threats is also very large. Threats like rattlesnakes and spiders are fairly common, but I almost never see jaguars and natives. 

The three nutrients you have to balance are easily capped out. Once you figure out the foods that give you the most of each nutrient it becomes easy to stock up on them. Hydration isn't an issue when it rains all the time and you can set your bowls out to get clean water. I thought carbs were the most balanced of all the nutrients. I didn't find anything common that would give me more than 25. Fats and proteins are far too easy to get. It would also be nice if rain gave you unsafe water you had to boil, and if dirty water had to be filtered into unsafe water in order to be boiled for clean water. Additionally, the negative effects of drinking dirty water aren't even that bad. If you have to, you can easily drink up to full Hydration and eat some mushrooms to cure yourself of the parasites. 

Also increase fall distance. It's so laughably short that I don't even bother to try and jump down from places anymore. 

[u]Would I recommend the game?[/u]
[b]No.[/b] Not at full price. This is an amazing game - the story alone is worth at least $15 on sale, but it isn't balanced well for a game that I can tell wants to be challenging. I would highly recommend it on sale. I highly enjoy the game and I'm going to definitely be playing it more with friends, but it's just too unbalanced for solo play. Combat isn't a threat, starving isn't a threat. Snakes and spiders are barely a threat, but they're a loud threat so if you bumble into one it's because you were running through the jungle like a dumb dumb.",1594446597,1594446696,FALSE,46,3,0.734630227,4,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,183,2,3322,0,2992,1597535842,,

You can muddle through a soap-opera-esque story line or build yourself a mud fortress in endless survival, play with up to three friends or tackle the jungle solo, and if you enjoyed The Forest you’re going to love this game. At the time of writing this the game lacks a little polish, sound balance is an issue in all modes where as soon as an animal warns it sounds like it’s right next to you even though it’s way over there. Multi-player was added after the game was released and is pretty broken, the host will always spawn where they save but other players will end up who-knows-where at other bases or near story key-points and have to walk back, oftentimes woefully unprepared. If you’re playing this with friends be prepared to have to set about 15 minutes aside before you really begin to play as you either go and get them, or they carefully pick their way back to base. 

Longer & SPOILERS - 
So it should tell you something that despite the fact that I, personally, don’t like the game I’m giving it accolades. The story mode was so cheesy and unfulfilling that it almost ruined the game for me but the way Creepy Jar handled the survival aspect really had me nailed down, I was going to beat this game if only to spite it. They have nailed survival in this game, creating a beautiful, vibrant, dangerous world that you want to explore even after you’ve completed the story because there’s something to see everywhere. 

The story was a massive guilt trip, and pretty predictable from the get-go. You’re in the jungle with your wife Mia who is bent on contacting an indigenous tribe for…. some reason… when something spooks you out of your nice, safe tent and you go running blindly into the rainforest, falling, smacking your head, and suffering from amnesia. From there it’s a journey through several hallucinogenic highs to help you remember that you’re out there alone, looking for the cure for cancer, because Mia is in a hospital somewhere in civilized Brazil, possibly dead. Oh, you may also be responsible for the pandemic death of hundreds of millions of people but they’re only ever going to touch on that for about 5 minutes before dropping you off at the conclusion which is highly dependent on whether or not you were paying attention at the very beginning because the answer is literally right there on the wall.

It almost broke the game for me, I was ready to put it down for good a few times just because Jake and Mia are so polarizing, and to be honest Jakes small mental break downs every time he built a fire, broke a tool, or had his torch go out grated on my nerves like nothing else could. I’m still not sure what the ‘moral of the story’ was at the end of the game either, it was just trying to make too many points too loudly and everything you discovered along the way that you thought were clues were mostly unhelpful story filler.

Take the story out and you have a survival game that is as ultimately frustrating as it is satisfying. In other survival games you can provision and walk for days, but thanks to a size-centric storage system Jake is only going to be able to take what he needs to survive for a short while and you’re going to have to make do on the run. You can also be the most prepared person in the world only to have a wandering spider or danger noodle come along and ruin your plans right outside your base. They give you an audible cue and so can be avoided if you’re on your guard, but you have to keep your eyes and ears peeled constantly. 

Your enemy is dangerous, make no mistake, but you can handle every situation the game throws at you if you keep your cool and manage your health right. There’s no T-Rex popping out of the woods, there’s no zombie horde every seventh night, there’s no ‘insert trope here’, it’s just you and the rain forest, and it is pretty amazing. If you're looking for a deep and meaningful experience you're not going to find it here. If you're looking for a survival game that pits you up against a beautiful and mysterious environment that can be just as cruel as it is gorgeous than this is the game for you.",1594399151,1594407692,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,71,20,2217,0,2217,1594182621,,
77,Green Hell,72449425,english,"At first I was sceptical. I saw the game and said ""meh another survival game, let's give it a shot"". Next thing I know, I cannot stop playing this game. This is the best survival game I have played in a long time! The difficulty is extreme. This is not your usual ""you're hungry - eat"" kind of a game. You have to look after what you eat, maybe you get sick? You need to cure yourself. Constantly need to get rid of worms, leeches and etc off your body. The game is by far the best experience in a survival game. 

The game is not a ""horror"" game per sa, however, the horrific sounds of snakes and scorpions and jaguars and all kinds of wild animals that are hiding somewhere in the bushes will keep you on your toes at all times. 

You need to walk slowly, listen to the sounds and be prepared to die at any given moment. 

The co-op story mode is a mode that should exist in every single game out there!!!! As this game is so immersive, we don't know how far we are into the story just yet (we don't google to make it more interesting), but hopefully the story is 100s of hours long.  The game is A+++++

81,Green Hell,60959469,english,"Graphics (9 of 10)
Immersive and well done.  Performance resulted in occasional chunkiness on a high end PC.

Audio (7 of 10)
Good, but not too varied.  Listening for animals is key to the game.  The dialogue with your wife is naggy, there's a lot of repetitiveness that gets annoying like cursing while starting a fire or voices in your head when you're sick or dehydrated.

Gameplay (2 of 10)
The game takes a try it and figure out the hard way approach.  If you don't mind dying and reloading repeatedly it's not that bad, but with the repetitive dialogue it gets old.  You can only save in very limited circumstances, not good if you want to exit for a break.  There's a bug that coconuts (essential to boiling clean water) only appear in trees or on the ground in about one of three games.  It's a game breaker.

Interface (3 of 10)
Interface is awkward, e.g. holding right mouse while navigating menus, or using the mouse wheel (without scrolling) while moving the mouse rapidly in combat.  Tutorials were acceptable, some key steps were missing.

Story (7 of 10)
A well crafted story, open world, requires exploration, and careful preparation for dangers.  Some elements are either easy to miss or hard to find.

Stability (10 of 10)
Very stable, with very few crashes or bad lags.

98,Green Hell,72411011,english,"As far a survival games with at least some semblance of a plot go, this is definitely one of the best. That said, the strengths of Green Hell end abruptly once outside the immediate survival aspects of the game. I played through the game with two players and enjoyed it, but don't think there's much in the way of replayability or coming back to the sandbox.

The good:

-The environment is very well done; some of the best foliage I've seen in a first person game. They even went so far as to having the flora and fauna actually match the Amazon setting. The narrative sequences look even better, oddly enough. The only thing that stands out badly here is the rain, which looks awful, though the wet surface effects look fine.

-The sound captures the jungle ambience perfectly. Almost all the animals and player interactions have appropriate sound affects accompanying them, though they can get a bit old. Having mice and armadillos constantly run into your camp and then run around wailing like banshees with the exact same sound effect every time can get a bit annoying. And of course there's the player character who will scream obscenities if he so much as breaks a stick on accident.

-The core gameplay is perfect for a survival sim. Materials aren't too easy or too hard to get. There's a wide variety of craftable tools and structures that are believable and intuitive. There are also plenty of ways to die, and quite easily might I add, but the difficulty can be fully customized to anyone's taste. The best part is the learning experience in the early game where you will spend most of your time discovering what the various flora and fauna  as well as the many ways you can die.

The bad:

-AI. It's not good. On basically anything. 

-The bugs. There are TONS of bugs. I suspect most of them are unique to co-op, and none of them were game breaking, but I did have to rehost the game quite a few times. Most bugs related to the cooking system and the player inventory, with items disappearing, duplicating, and turning invisible almost constantly. Thankfully the crafting, harvesting, and exploration were mostly bug-free, which makes up the majority of the game. 

-The reward. Okay, so first of all, the story itself, albeit a bit predictable, is quite interesting. The issue is, the main purpose in the game is to survive and progress through the story, but progressing through the story doesn't really require you to do anything other than running from one landmark on the map to the next. 
       Me and my friend played through on one of the higher difficulties and spent the majority of our time stockpiling supplies and building a self-sustaining base with all the cool interesting unlocks from the notebook. But in the end, once you understand the basics, the game becomes trivial, and you realize there is no reason to build a base. Nobody really attacks you. You never run out of food or water. After building our base and stocking up, we went out to explore only to end up finishing the game in almost one sitting, without needing any of our supplies. You could easily steamroll the story in an hour or two.
       Of course the point of the game is to enjoy the survival process, with the story serving as an immersive aside for the player and that's why I still consider this to be a good game. I just wish there was a bit more to shake things up and threaten the player, since the games difficulty only really matters when you're just starting. 

All in all, I'd give it a 7/10. Worth playing if only for the well-made environment and great trial and error experience of the early game.",1594355809,1594355809,TRUE,3,0,0.541923344,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,244,10,1120,0,1120,1594274408,,

3,Green Hell,72402574,english,"So this game..

I originally bought this game a year ago when it had tag ""multiplayer"" before it was actually multiplayer. I didn't touch it for a year until recently someone mentioned it to me and I got intrigued. 

From the second you load into the tutorial, it's a beautiful game. The graphics in this game are breath-taking. The sounds pairing with the graphics can get a little repetitive, but it's still a nice addition. The music that plays is also really well done. 

Originally, I was trying to rush through it. Not taking the time to build beds and fires and that was not working out for me. I was getting annoyed at how many worms I was getting, and how many times I was dying. Eventually, when I slowed down, I started to appreciate the actual survival aspect. It does a good job of balancing the different things you need in the game to survive. 

Multiplayer I think is almost necessary, in my opinion. Obviously you're only playing as one character, but for some of the situations you find yourself in, you'll want another mind there to help you figure out the puzzle that is the jungle. 

Dreamlike. The trips you go on are SO beautiful. Even in times where I didn't think they would be (Like those nasty snakes) I still thought they were amazing. 

So what didn't I like? The saving. I originally started playing with 2 friends and 1 ended up quitting because he would always load into the camp, even if we had saved at another location. Instead of trying to fix this, it seems the creators put a band-aid solution in their Discord. This caused me to end up trying to get to the next story parts as fast as I could, instead of enjoying different parts of surviving in a jungle. Single-player story reloading. I understand why it might be set up this way, but I can only imagine how frustrating it would have been if I had to load in everytime I was playing alone. Thank goodness Multiplayer is set up to load in from the last place you slept. I think the Devs should consider doing this for the single-player story as well. 

I would still recommend it. It was a fun game and the story was interesting. Don't go into it with too high of expectations, because that could kill any game for you.

It takes the idea of survival to the extreme, so that you’re simply on a constant scrabble to gather enough resources and food to keep going. And you will consistently come up against cases where you’re not able to avoid getting screwed over by the game.

Yet for all the emphasis the game places on survival there’s no penalty for death. If you die you just respawn at your last sleep location, and you’re able to pick up you kit and carry on. Which completely neuters any sense of suspense or weight the game could have otherwise had.

Compared to The Forest this is a complete mess of a game. It has none of the suspense. None of the storytelling. And the mechanics are an overly complex mess. They’re complex for complexities sake. The food system is a prime example of this. Rather than just getting hungry you now have to worry about macro-nutrient balance and eat enough protein, carbs and fats each day…because that makes sense. I mean, we all know that you die if you fail to eat meat for more than 24 hours…

And this adds nothing to the game save to make the need for food three times more annoying that it would otherwise be. It’s not a clever system. It’s not a system that adds any depth. It’s not a realistic system that enhances immersion. In fact, it outright hampers all three of these things. It’s just a bungled complex mess of a system that serves no sensible purpose.

So as you can probably tell I disliked this game. If you want a great solo survival experience get Subnautica. If you have a friend or two and want a brilliant coop survival game get The Forest. Green Hell’s a poor shadow of either of those games.

Edit: Okay, came back to leave a real review. As the current steam sale is wrapping up, I'm looking for new Survival Open World Craft games to play, and I find myself comparing everything I'm looking at to Green Hell and using it as a standard. 

This game is awesome, especially in retrospect. There are a ton of things it does right. It's unforgiving, the graphics look great, it handles well, and all the survival aspects are done very well. One of the issues that I have with these types of games is that you often reach a point where your base is built and resources are managed and then the game gets very stale, very fast. Green Hell's story mode keeps pushing you to new areas of the map and requires that you keep moving. You have to build a shelter to be able to save, so nothing is guaranteed. Food goes bad and backpack capacity is limited, so stockpiling supplies is very difficult. There are new things to fuck you up in every area, and it's fantastic. 

Maybe I'm just a glutton for punishment, but looking back on my experience with this game, it's hard to overstate how much I enjoyed it.",1581234081,1594291251,TRUE,2,7,0.543568492,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,137,11,1807,0,1354,1583062633,,

Maybe once you know the game, it gets better. The reviews are generally pretty positive, so I can only assume. But as I'm operating under limited time (thank god for steam refund) and I could only assume the tutorial was the intended starting spot, why would I even try to risk sticking around. If money isn't an object for you and the premise is interesting, then cool, go for Green Hell. If not, good news, survival games aren't a exactly a rarity in 2020. If money isn't an issue or you were going to play alone, get Subnautica w/ below zero. If you wanted co-op or were attached to a forest setting, try The Forest. Hell, I'd even recommend minecraft as a survival game over this frustrating and unengaging experience.

69,Green Hell,72279596,english,"Green Hell is a well rounded mostly realistic survival game with a really nice story mode.

If you are starting out with no knowledge of the game, it is brutal. 
Survival is hard!
Death is the only constant.
I have never died so much in a game before.
Until you learn the game everything kills you.
I was so scared to leave the safe area.

Spiders freak me out with their rattling noise.
The voices you hear when your sanity gets too low is super freaky. 
 
Bit by a snake. Sick from fever/Dehydrated. 
Some s.o.b in my head keeps screaming that I'm going to die.
Native walks out of jungle and stabs me with a spear. Dead

Went into a cave. 
Bit by scorpion. Jumped back, bit by a spider.
Ran out of cave, speared by a native. Dead

Cooked and ate dart frog.
Big mistake. That voice in my head says I'm going to die again.
A native appears. Dead

I find it really hard to find major fault with this game.
The grunting when chopping and jumping is the biggest annoyance. 
Who in real life does this?

Picking up and moving items around your campsite without putting in your inventory is something that needs to be implemented into the game.

Survival games need to be fully randomised to provide new game experience every game.
Leave the story game as is but randomise the survival game.

For example: 
Native villages, camps, jeep spawn in random locations every game.
Loot/crafting items also spawn in random locations.

Doing this enables a new game experience with the player having to search the map for the new locations for that particular game. 

The survival game can get boring if base building is the only purpose. 
Some non story based interactions with the natives, drug camp and the mine are some possibilities.

Anyway, the story mode was a great play and I would recommend it to those who like a challenge.

- being survival game with realistic approach to wounds and mental health in a stressful situation, I dont see any reason why the player character could not put the modern day stuff, which seems to be laying all around, to good use.
- survival mode (perhaps even on story mode): when my wound is infected and I require certain animal to get rid of it, it would be fair to be able to find it. My current load is stuck where the character is dying from an infection yet there are plenty of possible spawn locations all around but none can be found. Unrealistic, knowing what that particular animal is doing on those spawn spots.
- like so many other survival games, the passage of time and the requirement to find sustenance, is not in balance. Very few games get this right, some allow more adjustment then three settings.

20,Green Hell,72190717,english,"Great survival game. Graphics are beautiful, and the survival elements are one of the more realistic that I have seen. The best comparison I can make is to The Long Dark, although I don't think this game is nearly as difficult. The game can be brutal at first, but once you learn the ropes, it actually isn't too bad. Learn what you can and can't eat, take your time, and watch (and listen) for dangers, and it is quite managable.

The plot of the story mode is interesting. You are an author who returns to a previously visited region of the Amazon with your wife. You become separated and lost, and can only communicate through a walkie-talkie. I won't say any more, for fear of plot spoilers, but it does have some (somewhat obvious) plot twists.

The story mode isn't too long. I completed it in ~15 hours. Past that, there is an unending survival mode, which is pretty much story mode without the story. This is a good chance to put those long-term structures and strategies to the test, which you really don't need to do in story mode. There are also challenges, which require you to complete a certain objective in a certain amount of time. I haven't tried those yet, so I can't comment on them.

I do have a few gripes:
1. There are some pretty obvious things that you might want to do, but can't. Like getting water from the river in a coconut shell bowl so that you can boil it.
2. Even when you learn how to build new items, it isn't always clear how to use those items. (Like the water purifier.)
3. Most of the plants you pick are labelled as 'unidentified mushroom/fruit/flower', even though you have used them 100 times and know exactly what they do. It would be nice if they were named, even if you had to assign a name yourself.
4. No achievements!
5. There seems to be no reward for completing the challenges.

46,Green Hell,72135790,english,"The only reason why I bought this game is to play it with my wife. I don't like to play survival games alone. So when I saw this one was co-op I was super excited for it. I installed it, was enjoying the tutorial and excited to play with my wife. We both use gaming laptops specially ordered. Top of the line at least by the end of last year. Cost us over 3000 dollars for these specs. Sorry I don't know the specifics myself. Point is, her laptop is almost identical to mine. But when she tries to start up the game and go through the tutorial the game was literally causing her laptop to (blue screen of death) crash. Several times. This has not happened with any other game.

So we looked up online and tried several fixes. It then took her to the loading screen and froze. However, she could hear the same dialogue from when I first started my tutorial as the guy climbing the cliff. Yet she was still staring at a frozen loading screen. So she hard quit the game. After this we decided to lower her graphics as low as we could and even put it into windowed mode. Now every time the game gets to the loading screen it just crashes to the desktop.

We have tried several different things to try and make this work. This game is clearly not optimized as it should be as I've also found dozens of other people (maybe more) online who also have many complaints of losing save data, hard crashes, pc crashes, infinite long loading screens etc. This game should not have come out of early access if it is not ready to be played. This was a horrible first impression, a huge let down for us, and we are both getting a refund. If you choose to buy this and play with someone, make sure you know ALL the facts. The game is still buggy as hell and there's a 50% chance your game will not work for you. Or it might work for you but not for the friends you wish to play as.

48,Green Hell,72133722,english,"I'm a fan of survival/crafting games in general and this one is up there with some of my favorites (like Subnautica and Don't Starve). That being said I recognize that these aren't for everyone and this one in particular has some potentially controversial mechanics. I played this only in single-player story mode so I'm not sure about how co-op plays.

Setting: Green Hell opts for a handcrafted map rather than procedural generation. While this might hurt replay value, it means that the map as a whole makes a lot of sense, has cool things to find, and is just very well-put-together. It does a great job of imparting the lush rainforest vibe, with plants and critters everywhere. Having been to the rainforest myself in real life, this gave me a bit of nostalgia for it. There's a surprising attention to detail here, for example small ponds that fill up as it rains and dry out afterward. It also really delivers on the harsher aspects of the setting; there are many opportunities to get poisoning, infection, parasites, or just mauled by hungry wildlife.

Story: While the story isn't super intricate or expansive, it has some cool ideas in it ([spoiler]I especially love the reversal of ""first contact bringing disease to the isolated tribe""[/spoiler]]) and the delivery is on point. The voice acting is great and manages to be sincere without being overbearing. A lot of the background of the story is very well-thought-out, the writing considered the consequences of the actions characters took and had them play out in what felt like a realistic way; I never got a sense of ""oh this is just here to satisfy the plot"", and I was pleasantly surprised with how they researched parts of it (for example, [spoiler]they mentioned the testing timelines for pharmaceutical treatments and the consequences of bypassing of those regulations plot[/spoiler]).

Gameplay: Here's where things might get a bit controversial. Green Hell opts for very immersive mechanics; it's pretty light on UI to explain what's going on, instead trying to give you just enough of a hint to be able to find what you need. For example, it won't show most afflictions directly, these are instead found in an ""inspect your arms and legs"" minigame (although it will tell you that you have things to inspect). Crafting and inventory are done in an immersive way too, where you can drag items around and play a bit of inventory tetris, or look through a notebook to find the right page on how to make a shelter. This can feel a bit clunky but rather than becoming more bothered by it over time, I got used to it and started to enjoy the immersive aspect.

My only real complaint was the save system-- there are only certain locations (that you can construct with some effort) where you can save the game. While this is fine for saves that you can repeatedly reload, I do wish there was a way to pick up right where you left off; I ended up just leaving the game paused in the background when I needed this, but if I were on a laptop or something that would've been a bigger obstacle.

Challenge: Like most survival games, you feel pretty useless at the start. It doesn't really explain how to get the resources you need safely (I think that's fine, learning it is fun), and for water in particular it ends up being a bit unintuitive (this part really needs better hinting because it relies on different types of containers which each support different interactions, while based on the immersive UI you might expect the containers to be able to do both). However, you can get over a large part of the hump by doing a single ""try all the things and die terribly with six different diseases at once"" run. After that, if you play on the normal difficulty you might find it gets fairly easy at this point, where you know how to find the foods you need and how to deal with the various afflictions.

This game might be good in the sense of a great story in singleplayer and really good graphics and immersion in the game world. As a survival experience it will provide something different from the typical zombies/monsters survival games which adds some ""realism"" to the topic by placing you in a jungle with natives and other dangers of nature.

Anyways, I barely did any refunds before but this one was refundd because the game lacks of actual content to make the multiplayer coop mode worth at all. You're just thrown there and there isn't much to do except the same story you play in singleplayer which is boring. 

I choose instead to play The Forest and other games that provides way more options to express your creativity with friends and even compete with other players while experimenting challenging dangers of the PvE elements of a game, which Green Hell failed to provide imho.

If you like to have games you don't play in your library you could buy it on a sale but it only worth if it goes under 60% off, though they only did 20% off so far, so whatever.

Also a note for the developers, the people managing their Discord are doing a horrible job, there are like hundred channels and they overmoderate people for simple things like asking something in the general chat and such. Consider loosening a little bit these measurements and allow people to just interact more fluently in any spontaneous way they choose to do it.

Well, this game induced a different kind of illness in me! Motion sickness. 

Let me preface that I do not get motion sick whatsoever, but this game legitimately made me feel dizzy and sick with its peculiar mouse controls. Aiming up and down seems to have slightly less sensitivity or so of left and right? It causes an incongruity of what I want to do and what happens, and it makes me feel GROSS.

Also, while this game does allow you to independently adjust your sensitivity axes, it doesn't offer a numerical value, only a vague slider. No good, in truth.

This game uses mouse smoothing, and for reasons I do not understand. It is not a good feature, and it's on by default. Merciful that they let you turn it off. Even after turning it off, I still felt very ill and my eyes were hurting. I had to turn the game off.

     Exploring the deadly amazon jungles might be a little hard for a rookie explorer like you, that's why I, Didalu, will teach you the basics of surviving in the jungle. (Heads up, sorry for the trash formatting, I'm still new to reviews.)

[h1] Chapter one: Nutrients [/h1]

     Jungle exploration is quite tiresome, when cutting down logs and pulling leeches from your skin you might start feeling a little hungry. Its important for someone to keep all of their nutrients in balance, protein, fats, carbs and thirst. Having one or more of these levels at a low amount could decrease your energy by a considerable amount.

     There are many ways of gaining these nutrients here are some notable ones. 
[*] Cooked meats, like fish are perfect for a big boost of protein whilst cooked snail is a small boost. 
[*] Nuts, like cocoa nut flesh are perfect for a big boost of fats whilst harvested nuts are a decent boost.
[*] Fruits, like banana bunches are perfect for a big boost of carbs whilst fruits and mushrooms are a small boost.
[*] Water is very dangerous when non-pure, its advised to collect rain water with cocoa nut shells.

[h1] Chapter two: Sanity [/h1]

It gets hard to keep cool in the jungles of the amazon. Disease and sickness always lead to paranoia and anxiety especially when you are on an empty stomach or aren't curing major injuries. Sometimes times get desperate and the ends justify the means, that's when your sanity will really drop. Here are a few ways of curing a falling sanity
[*] Make sure to have a warm meal
[*] Sleep well, its best if its near a fire
[*] Staying near shelter, sometimes a low sanity might cause hallucinations and migraines

[h1] Chapter three: Shelter [/h1]

Shelter is extremely important for jungle survival, without a proper sleeping area and a comfortably lit fire the dangers of the jungle might come crawling in. Parasites, worms and leeches might become a problem without a proper resting place. Though without a sturdy house in general other, bigger threats might come and attack, from panthers to caimen, there have even been reports of singing in the deeper jungles, sometimes, someone, might see the skull of a poor lost traveller.

[h1] Chapter four: The depths of the jungles [/h1]

Deeper in the jungles of the amazon people have started to go missing. Explorers haven't been seen in many, many years. Some say it was a mysterious cartel operating in the depths of the jungle, others say it was a lost tribe of cannibalistic warriors. No one knows the true story of the jungle, but maybe you might just find out!",1593889764,1593889924,TRUE,2,0,0.545454562,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,37,4,1878,0,1875,1596700715,,

Now seriously, the game is like The Forest.
The story mode is quite interesting to play through once. Although, just like The Forest, if you are going to do only the story you will barely need the survival part because there are supplies all over the place.

The survival mode is unfortunately the disappointing part. It is well made but it lacks antagonists. In The Forest as the days pass the threat of cannibals, and mutants increases and gives you something to prepare for and fight. In this game you have very few antagonists (wild life, and human), and they really are not dangerous. So once you are done building  a camp and establishing your food source circle there isn't much else to do. Also surviving is really easy.

The graphics are great.

The price is ok for what it is, but if what you want is a survival simulator maybe get it when on discount because there isn't much there.

8,Green Hell,71989007,english,"The only survival game I've played in the past was Don't Starve, so this review is from a stand-point of a casual gamer who enjoys unforgiving games. Green Hell drops you into a beautiful Amazon Rain Forest where death awaits around every bush and tree, quite literally. Running through areas is not advisable as you may just end up stepping on and getting bit by a rattlesnake (or other venomous creature) that likely would have given you fair warning before threatening its space. The jaguars, on the other hand, are somewhat unavoidable if they notice you, so you had better craft a weapon and be ready to fight. Should you survive your jaguar encounter (or even one with a venomous creature), you'll need to tend to any wounds, stings, or other injuries with bandages craftable from distinct flora. Some plants or other items even have medicinal properties which will help fight off infection, toxins, food poisoning, and more.

When you're not getting stung or eaten, you'll have to fight more familiar threats: hunger, starvation, and energy. The hunger system incorporates a diet requirement of balancing proteins, fats, and carbohydrates and you'll need to find or make clean water if you hope to stay hydrated without getting parasites. The only way to learn what each plant does is to quite literally taste test them. So you'll need to figure out how to remove food poisoning should you consume the wrong thing.

In addition to fighting off the flora, fauna, and dietary needs, you'll encounter hostile natives that don't take kindly to you encroaching on their territory. You may start out defending against jaguars, but find that the natives are the true predators of the jungle. Don't give them reason to investigate your camps.

Along with an unforgiving environment and a spectacular crafting system where ""If you can think it, you can probably make it"", Green Hell also includes an interesting modular building system where discovering new materials can make your stay in the jungle just a little more comfortable. While you may get distracted building out your base and getting into a routine of hunting, foraging, crafting, and purifying water, you are trying to return to civilization some day. Green Hell has a very interesting story that makes you load up your pack with supplies and explore the jungle in hopes of finding your way back home.

The game is pretty tricky at the start but once you get use to it and put a little work into making a few spots to camp out across the map to make food and get your hands on a bow then the game is pretty easy. I found the AI was too dumb and would have liked to see smarter enemies and animals.


pro tips:
1. quickly get use to using a bow, its your best friend.  you can bow fish, hunt, shoot coconuts down,stealth kill and instantly kill any animal(or human) with head shots.
2. Blue mushroom and yellow mushrooms are amazing at killing parasites+give energy... that means you can drink dirty water eat the shrooms right after to kill any parasites. (lazy way to get water)
3. harvest your rotten meat for maggots to heal infected cuts.
4. always have a supply of bandages and tobacco bandages !
5. pain killers are best used to cure poison.
6. head shot a few locals to get some easy brand new gear.

pros: 
1. great story that leaves you on a cliff hanger.
2. beautiful map and surroundings.
3. real danger if you aren't focused and let things snowball.
4. they really leave you in the dark to figure things out slowly by trial and error.
5. I would say the survival was made better in this game then the forrest and the story was better too.

Survival mechaniscs are the best I've seen so far, really scary at first, but enjoyable once you master them.
Combat is not bad but could play a more central role, enemies are too easy to avoid and not aggressive enough. Except the jaguars, those are fun.
The realism of this game is unmatched by other garmes I've played so far, cant complain really.
Overrall an excellent experience, as good as other amazing survival games such as subnautica and the forest. While it may lack some of the challenges posed by the enemies of those games, the more personal and realistic approach surely makes up for it.

We skipped the tutorial, nearly spent half an hour trying to make a weapon and a campfire. But no, no regret for skipping the tutorial (and the story, will try that later on). Started confused without any idea on crafting mechanics, and when we came out, we felt like the actual people who really survived an expedition in a rainforest.

Ate a mushroom, got food poisoning, vomited everything. Got bitten by a snake, died. Drank unclean water, got parasites in the stomach. Just made a fire, rained and the fire went out. Fell from height, died. Bitten by leeches. Got fever. Ate maggots. Ate bananas. Everything is challenging yet still so enjoyable. 

Beautiful landscapes and immersive environment, ambient sounds and a decent optimization. Co-op is great, no network issues. No bug or glitch encountered.

Gameplay wise this game is like ""The Forest"".
You got your mysterious island, some tribal people who greet you with spears and bows, and some basic crafting and building to survive.

I haven't gotten too far into the story, but obviously there's a different tale here. 

There's also some interesting survival mechanics. 
For one, the health/food system, where you need a varied diet for full health. 
You also need different treatments to wounds, depending on the type of wound, toxins, infections etc. And check yourself for leeches regularly.

When you first start playing, everything looks like a big green mess.

However, after playing for a while, you develop an eye for each plant and what you can use them for. The play area was really well implemented. It isn't huge but it's dangerous enough to where it feels like it is. There are alot of unique areas but the developer didn't go overboard with trying to make them radically different so it still feels cohesive. 

Survival mode is a sandbox but it's definitely worth playing through the story. The writing wasn't perfect, Creepy Jar gave themselves plenty of mcguffins and the Ayuasca angle was eye rolling but overall I still dug it enough to want to check out the multiple endings. I really appreciate the protagonist's superhuman appetite for chugging DMT.

 The Good:
When I say the Game play is just magnificent, I am in no way giving enough credit on how beautiful this game really is. Some one definitely  put in the leg work. Kudo's to those people. Game mechanics are simple once you get use to the lay out. Lots of things to keep you busy, Fishing,hunting(for that matter, being hunted),building, exploring etc..

The Bad:
While this game is a wonderful place to explore, it really falls short on anything to explore. Sure there lots of places to go, but that really all there is. There are few places to go to and see how others were set up, but no big take away. I feel the game could of added tons more places to explore and find useful items as you were out on your travels. It like having access to the cave of wonders only to having nothing to wonder. This was biggest set back for me. Once you have uncovered the whole map There was no reason to go back. Your not gonna travel all the way back to get a snickers doodle. I just felt they could have add tons more of interesting places which would of help in keeping you busy and always trying to get back out there and find useful stuff. Story mode in this game was just awful. To me the story mode was away to get you use to how the mechanics work. The real fun was in survival mode. 

 The Ugly:
In its current state the game is just a waste of a beautiful game.  Signal player or co-op mode, the game really is just a build simulator. Building your camp and all is fun, but that only gonna last for so long un-till your thirst to explore come back. And really once you have explored the map there no real reason to go do it again. The balancing of your four food groups really just becomes annoying. Not to say it cant be done, but the balance is off. I feel that you are burning through them at a quicker rate than you normally would. Its like you gotta have three square meals a day to function, and truly that not how that would work. You would preserve your food. Sleeping also another issue, if you get up to early your tired half way through the day. Yes there is food to help with energy, but it just a waste of food to stay awake longer. The game is still has many bugs that need worked out. 

Overall:

 The graphics in this game are off the charts, Very well done. This is why I Recommend to play it. The game is worth the cost even in its current state. For the most part you can work though most of the problems and still have fun. The lack of content and the balance still needs worked out, but overall still a very playable game. I feel all the budget went to the graphics team and very little budget went to the content team.

The increased difficulty of having to statisfy multiple nutritional needs is intriguing at first, but adds no real depth. At the end of the day, the player is caught in a constant loop of gathering, preparing and consuming food just like any other survival game.

This wouldn't be bad if the NPCs weren't shockingly bad. E.g. attacking jaguars or jungle folk will just stop dead in their tracks, if the player hops on top of their shelter. Mammals keep repeating their scripted paths over and over, pretty much bumping into the player before running off. And on and on...

Add to that, game breaking bugs (fall through elevator anyone?) that remain unfixed (""we added this to our bug data base"" - 2019) and you're in for an underwhelming experience.

A diary of my journey through Green Hell.

Day 1: Made a lovely little shelter out of palm fronds and vines
Drank milk from a coconut.
Ate a frog.
Wrong frog.
Dead.

Day 14: Finished my simple mud hut. Neat fireplace!
Ate a frog.
Right frog!
Hear a snek.
Dead.

Dead 21: Found a grappling hook.
Hear a snek!
Oh ho little snek, I see you!
Don't see cliff.

Day 41: Mauled by a panther.
Put maggots in the wound to kill the infection.
Make antibiotic bandages to heal wound.
I am a survival master.
Eat beans.

Been playing other survival games for decades now, and this is the first time a basic need was completely absent from the game.

But its just impossible to enjoy the  game with all of the things that can happen to you. I know the devs wanted to make some realistic experience, but I have been backpacking before and I have never been this hungry or tired in a 5 min period as in this game. Below are some of the huge problems of this game that have just made us say ""enough"" and throw up our hands. 

1. Constant annoyances like leeches, cuts, ants, infections
2. You always have to stop and inspect yourself.
3. No amount of food really makes you ""full"". I had 3 cooked crabs and like 5 rats. I was still starving. Walked 3 feet, guess what? Hungry again. 
4. Hey im thirsty, once again. Just drank 3 full coconuts full of water, 3 mins later. Parched and bitching about being thirsty again. 
5. Want to find coconuts? Too bad, you will die looking for them, when you find them they barley do anything anyway
6. Want to start a fire? Too bad. This place gives a new name to the location ""Rain Forest"". It rains every 5 mins in this game, putting out your fire when you are trying to cook food to eat. 
7. Forever dark. The day night cycles are odd. Its seems like its always dark and when its light, there are 5 mins of light. But
that is something you cant enjoy, since you are prob tired again and need to go to sleep. Wait, you want to sleep but arent near your bed. Lay on the ground. Get worms. Want to remove the worms? Go find bones to make a bone pick. Cant move cause you are tired and hungry again? uh oh, you didnt save at your little house you are far from, you ded. You lost progress. 

8. Make a fire? Cool. Come back 5 mins later, its gone. The fire is gone and you have to remake another one. Want to quickly make a fire? nah, you need a tool and dry leaves once again. ugh

blah blah. there is a ton more but you get the idea. 

The main issue: 

Story mode is impossible to explore due to all of the work you need to do to survive. I seriously couldnt explore 5 feet from my place without almost dying of hunger, thirst or disease. 

Turning off these things will help, but the game is boring after that. Base building sim in a sandbox. 

Wait, you want to retry with some settings removed on story mode? Guess what? You have to watch and do all the starting cinematics and crap with your girlfriend again. Re learning fire making, bandages...etc.

87,Green Hell,71600625,english,"This game is amazing - punishingly hard at times, and not overly fond of holding you hand (or doing anything but watch and laugh as you die of a snakebite), but an absolutely amazing survival crafting sim. Very in depth wound and food management systems take it a step above many others in the genre is that it's very hard to cover all bases - so caution becomes a lot more valuable than just stockpiling whatever the game's wonder food/healing item/drink is. Multiplayer is excellent and probably my preferred play style - splitting up to search for set things really makes you all feel equally valuable

You will die (or get very close) a few times to learn mechanics and how things work, but it has an almost Dark Souls-like charm in that the repeated challenge makes you adapt to the world and learn how to survive, rather than just feeling like the game let you off. 

The sound design is especially excellent - without spoilers, there are some seriously incredible uses of sounds to create a living world which mixes beauty with threat. 

Would definitely recommend this, and don't be afraid to just scoff down everything you find - it'll kill you, but once you know that, forewarned is forearmed (also - don't pick up incredibly poisonous frogs by hand. One of our multiplayer crew honestly had to learn that the hard way...)

93,Green Hell,71591048,english,"Bought this for the co-op mode for my husband and I to play and there are some seriously problematic bugs with saving that need to be worked out before I would recommend the game. Losing game progression sucks.

#1: Host Saving/game corruption. Multiple times within the same day, game won't allow the host to save. It says it saved, but then spinning wheel of death continues, no matter what.... you cannot get the game to save. This means forced rollback to a previous saved state. The only workaround is to continuously build save structures while you play and try to save often. Re-launching the game does not help. This behavior started happening after passing through Lamba-2 in story mode.

#2: Client saves --There are also bugs with the joining character unable to save (which causes loss of their inventory on reload). This started happening from the spawn zone.

If you're willing/able to make save points often and can deal with losing game progress since your time last played, then it's worth grabbing. Although, I wouldn't personally recommend buying it for the story. The dialogue is cringe and unrealistic, unlike the rest of the game. 

It was initially very difficult to survive, while we learned game mechanics, what animals/plants were deadly and how to heal ourselves and we loved it. However, with the saving bugs, it's becoming cumbersome to want to finish the game. Crafting was fun the first time, but unnecessary for game progression.

First up, I started in survival mode, King of the Hill difficulty (or king of the jungle? Hmm, second highest difficulty anyway) and thought I was playing the story mode. I played for a couple of hours before realising my mistake and starting again in story mode. This turned out to be advantageous because I already knew how to make a bow, armour, etc, and was quite adept at freezing in my tracks when I heard something amiss. In total I think I died twice while completing the story, both times from tribals who I decided to try to melee down rather than arrow to the head.

Anyway, difficulty aside (I don't think it's an overly difficult game), the STORY is what kept me going. The brilliant cut scenes, the mystery. In short, I loved this game. I got lucky and got myself the good ending on the second attempt, but the bad ending left me open mouthed and shocked for a good 10 minutes before I got back into it.

- I skipped tutorial at first because I want to experience ""Hell"". I was extremely struggle at first few hours.
- 90% of eatable in this game are safe to eat (I only spent like 2 hours to eat literally everything can be found)
- the condition / status of body is pretty good idea at first but after you understand how it work basically it won't affect to you anymore (such as I drink dirty water because orange mushroom are everywhere)
- there is a dock in map where I think it spoil the whole game experience as you could stay there for as long as you want and you won't die anymore (full of resources - endless meat from animal, endless fruit from tree, water from river)

Green Hell has a neat emphasis on the hunger system making what you eat matter more in the long run, various foods grant different nutrition which effects your overall health.    Crafting on the other hand can be done by throwing things into your crafting area and adding and removing till you have a workable item to craft, this however doesn't work with base building as you'll have to raise your crafting level or craft certain tools/building parts to unlock others.

0,Green Hell,71368774,english,"At its core, Green Hell is a micromanagement of your body in the Rain Forest. This is a lot harder at first than it seems.
1) You have to check all 4 limbs constantly for multiple problems. (This is the second hardest of the 3)
2) You have to keep your proteins, carbs, fats and water levels all at satisfactory levels by eating different types of food or suffer major deterioration in energy levels. (This is the hardest of the 3)
3) You have to keep your sanity level high or you start hallucinating. (This is the easiest of the 3)

You'll have to learn via multiple deaths how to maintain each of these 3 main things about yourself. You'll have to learn what's good to eat, what's bad, what causes insanity, what decreases parasites, etc. 


On top of all of this, you still have to navigate the rain forest and learn what all the dangers are and how to avoid them....and there are tons of them. Animals, diseases, plants and tribal people. You'll have to learn what each sounds like, looks like and moves like. Is that white mushroom ok to eat? Is it ok to place on your skin? Is it ok to put in a soup? There's only one way to find out. And once you do, you'll understand how to interact with that plant in the future. Take that and apply it to ants, larva, maggots, many different types of flora and many different types of mushrooms, animals and a plethora of other things. Once you have an understanding of all of these things, you'll finally be able to actually navigate the jungle.

To put it bluntly, if you start this game up and just play it, you will NOT make it to the other side of the map. You'll be lucky if you can get 1/4 of the way through without dying. After you learn the secrets of this Green Hell, you'll be able to understand the enigma of the jungle and you'll understand how to properly navigate through the punishing jungle with ease....

...and even when you know the secrets of the jungle, it will punish you the moment you aren't properly prepared. Forget your anti-venom bandages or just ran out? Then it's only a matter of time before the jungle punishes you for it.

To be honest, I got this game to play with my friends, who enjoy survival games, because it seemed challenging and it seemed hilarious to watch your friend obliviously pick up a dart frog.

What really struck me was the story. I wasn't even aware there was a story to the game and was excited to try it out even if it only meant improving my survival skills in the game for when I would play with my friends. Surprisingly, the narrative was unique and extremely interesting. I was getting Conrad's ""Heart of Darkness"" vibes until the game progressed to show you the true series of events which I found to be much more compelling. I haven't even spent that many hours on the game but I was able to complete the story (I think?) and believe that it is much better than the way I thought it was going to turn out.

There are a few bugs that I did notice with respect to building but they only occurred when you were trying to snap two different pieces together.

However, the sense of discovery and progression gives one a real sense of mastery. Mastery over one's defeats. The ability to overcome.

Dislikes:
The user interface is slightly cumbersome as I've never liked in-game sub-menus
Saves are not tied to sleeping, and I see why they did it this way to prevent deaths that may occur shortly after sleeping, but still, it's an easy thing to forget to separately save
Some common resources can be rather difficult to find due to spawn location randomness
Discovery of some what-may-seem-to-be obvious recipes are less than intuitive

Likes:
Making your own way
The feeling of having overcome serious and minor needs and threats
Discovering a recipe that improves your ability to survive
Enjoying the beauty and learning a bit about the jungle environment

The likes far overshadow any dislikes here, and while I was hesitant of earlier comparisons, I now am having similar thoughts and comparisons to Subnautica.

In this game, there is a lot of trial and error which adds to the difficulty of the game but it is not impossible to play. You just may die often at first until you figure out what can be eaten safely and how to create bandages and such. After figuring all this out, you will thrive.

You can customize the game in many ways as well by choosing the dangers that will be present, the level at which your hunger, thirst and sanity decrease and such.

There is still some room for improvement as it is such a big game but it is quite worth the purchase. 

The only thing I would say isn't good about this game is that it will ruin all other survival games as they don't even come close to this one.

The negative review is for the game's save file mechanic. There are only 4 save slots.
I was playing a solo game, and I was invited to play on a friend's server. If you save on a friend's server, it gives you a little warning message about ""not being able to select which save slot blah blah blah."" The save overwrote my solo game. Basically, happened twice that I overwrote my active solo game, erasing several hours of gameplay. That flaw is completely unacceptable.

i don't usually write reviews but this game is too cool not to. i'm a huge survival fan, i have just about all of them. First, Green Hells story line is gripping, I stayed interested in working hard to not only stay alive.. but to find my way through a jungle, day and night, rain and sunshine all in search of my goal. I've played other games that included your sanity as part of your survival skills but Green Hell just about nailed it. It can be a pain to have something else to worry about.. other than being hungry, thirsty, tired.. with danger lurking all around you etc.. Green Hell does a great job of making it not too hard to maintain if you give it the required attention. I also enjoyed learning crafting recipes over time as I do and see different things  that may relate. When the story ended I wished I had taken more time to explore and survive and just enjoy the game for how awesome it is.. rather than rush through the story wanting answers. I've yet to play it in straight survival mode so I cant say anything about that end of things, but I plan to very soon and feel well equipped in know how now that I played my way through the story.

The last minute of my survival co-op experience with a friend before refunding. Playing in the same lobby and world, but two different, game-altering experiences. You can build, craft and explore together, but combat and confrontation with the AI tribesmen seems to be reduced to a single-player endeavour. Can't imagine how that could possibly work out, and didn't try. This game's closest rival - The Forest, which is epic, doesn't face this puzzling issue.

It's a beautiful, smooth, cracking survival game with some cool innovations (e.g. a smartwatch showing health vitals, tools, etc), but honestly this isn't a true-blue co-op game.

4,Green Hell,71166385,english,"First of all - I am giving a positive review because I cant give a neutral review and I don't feel like this game deserves a negative review. 
That being said the game is at a state right now that some people may find not recommendable. I only encountered one bug but this completely broke the game for me at around 3/4 of the story. Still to that point the game was really fun and immersive.

A friend of mine and I bought this game on sale to play through it together since we really enjoyed the forest and wanted to have a similar experience again. On that front the game really delivered - sandbox survival with natives that want to rip of your head.
I enjoyed most of the mechanics. The inspecting felt really immersive and the only improvement to that would be a key to switch limbs instead of using your mouse and a wheel. Bandaging wounds and removing leaches and worms on a regular bases is part of the jungle experience and I felt it was just enough on normal to not be annoying.
Gathering resources also was enjoyable besides the occasional lag when picking up stuff. Especially the splitting wood into smaller pieces was kinda cool.
Melee combat feels a bit wonky sometimes and shooting the bow is hard if you don't realize right away that you can hold steady with shift (duh). Early in the game the natives are borderline op but as you get better weapons and armor the encounters lose their initial terror and you just deal with them.

The story itself is good I also like that there's multiple endings though my friend and I didn't see either of them ingame unfortunately. We got through around 3/4 of the story then the game bugged out and the safe corrupted putting my friend an me at the start of the game with no items. Even though we enjoyed the game so far we didn't want to spend the time to play to that point again and just watched a playthrough to see the 2 ends of the story.

If that wouldn't have happened I could wholeheartedly recommend this game since we didn't encounter any major bugs but because the one we had broke the game for us I have to say that its best to get this game on sale and hope that this doesn't happen to you. 

Maybe If they add more stuff we give this game another shot but since we both know how the story ends there isn't much incentive.

17,Green Hell,71154713,english,"I am... Bewildered by this game.

Green Hell, an iconic game I will never forget. Even if I do stop playing it.

So basically, green hell is an open world survival game, it has multiplayer and just recently added multiplayer story mode. Something I was looking forward to for a long time. The graphics, the overall detail is incredible. The story mode is fantastic, You are stuck in the amazon jungle, and you are trying to find Mia, your wife I assume. You go through these visions, yet.. its all just a figure of your imagination.. Mia is at a hospital, she isn't there. She's gone.

Playing in multiplayer was fun, you had to survive in a hostile environment, with jaguars, pumas, caiman, natives, and so much more. You could suffer parasites, food poising. All sorts of stuff. With that, comes the fact that you sometimes have to save your friends, difficult, but fun.

The animations, were also some of the best I've seen. You don't get animations like that in most survival games, rain would cause fires to go out, wind would push bushes and leaves around, and moving through bushes would cause them to move. Being bitten by a snake, you can see it extends out to bite your ankles.

Noise, that noise of the game. Hats off to the creators because that must've been hard finding a ton of those noises. The thunder, ambient noises, it was all incredible. Listening to a Puma in the distance, or maybe even a caiman snarl at you. It was all so incredible, the noises were amplified to sound louder.

Even when I started off, I didn't use the tutorial, its mechanics are quite easy to learn. You are able to figure out just about anything. The notebook, if you craft something and forget, you can always go to your trusty notebook there, and figure out what your recipe was from that. Once I learnt the mechanics, it became a little easier to figure out how to survive. However, my most favorable moment of the mechanics of the game, was when I speared a crab, lifted him up, pressed E to get him into my inventory, and since it was full, it floated. Me and my friends were laughing just looking at the fact that there was floating crab.

Developers, tops to you for making a game, I think anyone would enjoy.

31,Green Hell,71114272,english,"Just Right.

I started my survival games journey with Stranded Deep, went on with The Forest, then Green Hell, followed by The Long Dark, and at the time of writing this I also played a bit of Subnautica. All great games but I am wondering what made me stick to Green Hell for so long. Below I'll try to compare my experience in the other games to Green Hell.

I think it's not just the good mechanics, no nonsense waste of time etc. but whenever I question a process in the game whether the time spent or things done are necessary, it just seems to make sense. Or maybe I am rationalizing.

Though I looked for some challenge at the end to keep playing, I found myself joining different multiplayer games, mindlessly doing perhaps the same things over and over again but still enjoying the process.

Stranded Deep didn't have the ending back then but the feel and accessibility, the balance of land and sea and the island/summer/sunny theme clicked with me. After achieving the endgame objectives I kept playing again for a while.

The Forest is also a great game. It made me tense, sometimes jump scares got me and the overall theme was somewhat disturbing. I guess I prefered the smoother more relaxing vibe. The constant threat seems to give this game a different dynamic. Good amount of action if that's what you're looking for.
After finishing the story, I didn't want to go on much. Tried multiplayer once but found no appealing reason to go on.

Green Hell was as frustrating at the start as the other games but once I got past the basic understanding and finished the story I realized this was pretty much exactly what I was looking for when I wondered ""is there a game that would make me experience something similar to what the Youtube channel Primitive Technology and the likes are doing"".

Once you're past the point where you are surviving fine when it comes to food shelter etc. the only challenge is the natives attacking. A bit lacking when compared to The Forest. Also not very rewarding since you don't get relevant stuff from natives that could make your base grow the way the mutants in The Forest can. (ie. build stuff from bones)

The Long Dark had a different pace compared to the previous games. The sheer amount of time spent traveling didn't make me admire the oh-so-realistic approach but rather question whether it was worth it. Great game nonetheless.

Subnautica seems to offer a smooth experience as well. The whole futuristic sea oriented theme doesn't appeal to me right now. 
- - - 

I also wonder whether the prominence of the story is affecting the game.
In Stranded Deep and Green Hell which I seem to have enjoyed the most, the story doesn't seem to matter much. Felt like I'm just a guy trying to survive in nature. Somewhat easier to get immersed in.
The Forest and The Long Dark feel like the story plays an essential part to make sense of the world around you.

I think the closest comparison I could make with this, is The Forest, being a story driven, physical feeling, kinda intense, survival experience.  

I was reading that some people were having some performance issues and such from the recent update, but the game ran pretty great to me and I don't have a high end system.  My only annoyance with the game was that there's this weird hitch switching between examining your body and leaving that, but it's less a problem and more just an obnoxious element that could use a patching.

If you are looking for ""The Forest"" in this game, you're up for a disappointment. This is NOT the forest. While the prior mentioned is more about killing Armsies/Legsies/cannibals this has more like a minecraft approach. You are stranded in the jungle and your priority is to survive first (hunt animals, gather herbs, establish a solid income of food and drink, use them to craft things,etc...) while there are tribesmen in the game who occasionally appear (depending on the game difficulty you are playing at they will either ignore you or attack you in groups).

All in all, it IS a very great game! However there are some bugs yet, so if a dev might see this post, i'll leave some here that i encountered:

- Killing tribesmen while standing on top of a grappling hook place and then sliding down to grab their meat makes them vanish, leaving only their loot behind (arrows shot at them also disappears)
- Guy talks in his sleep (""God... So Hungry"", ""So thirsty""...)
- The luminosity in the caves are the same as outside, meaning that if it's noon outside, it'll be light inside the caves and will only get dark if it's night
- planting boxes inside the cave will get the same hydration as the ones outside if it's raining
- washing yourself will remove a bunch of dirt, but swimming doesn't
- there is a significant (1,5-2 seconds) wait time between firing shots with bows
- Sometimes after washing yourself in the river the ""washing"" visual effects stay there even after the process is done (there's 2 ""splashing water"" effect in the air that remains)
- You can not re-bandage a wound after the first bandage disappears (got attacked by a jaguar. bandaged up my leg, but it disappeared the next day. Long story short, i died of wound infection several days later and the wound refused to heal up + it was impossible to apply a second bandage)
- (Not really a bug, but is quite frustrating) Will we have an option to carry planks around as we do with logs/long sticks/leaves? currently they have to be put inside the bag and only 2 of them fits. This is quite a nuisance when building multiple Boxes or small garden boxes.

Regardless of these, the game provides an almost infinite hours of fun and a huge plus is that the devs haven't abandoned this game yet (unlike forest)",1592161528,1592694422,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,2,1,5471,0,4895,1598383183,,

- barely anything is explained and without wiki or youtube you will have many frustrating moments
- tribals still spawn in your camp right next to you
- a spear, a bow, a knive,two pieces of meat,  three bananas as well as some herbs weight combined about 25kg, which is utterly ridiculous and especially bad because the more you weight the faster you get tired
- after waking up and eating tons of food and all that stuff your char is already so exhausted that you need to sleep again in the middle of the day, if you dare to explore you are already tired when you have just left your camp
-short naps are being punished with sanity drop like what the hell devs?? Who goes crazy by sleeping?
- performance is not good, i have double the fps in comparable games

Originally you could only play with friends in Survival mode which was fine until you started being attacked by tribesman that only 1 player could see (they only appeared to the other player if one of us killed said tribesman). What happened because of this though is the tribesman killed me at our campsite and then proceeded to spawn kill me over and over without my friend being able to help. So we quit and called it a loss (we spent 10 hours on this save building up a base while trying to deal with invisible enemies). 

We wait a couple of months for some updates to roll out and fix things and the co-op story mode comes out and now we're interested again in giving the game another shot. We hop on and play about 4 more hours and start getting into building a base when all of a sudden I can't draw my bow anymore. I think that's strange let me create another and see if it works. Nope. Still can't aim a bow for whatever reason. We also couldn't make mud bricks anymore. We would mix them but the bricks would never actually ""make"". Instead, you would just hear the mixing noise but nothing would happen after the circle fills up and they would just never do anything after. Once again we think no big deal. We'll just go ahead and save at our shelter real quick and load back in. What happens next you ask? Well, I load back in and my save file says it's only been 3 in game days despite having played for hours and I'm standing on a big square area of grass (prairie?) with mountains in the distance. On the edges of this square is a sheer cliff that falls into grey nothingness as if the game world isn't loaded in. I try multiple times to quit out and load back up and nothing. Just more wasted time. I regret having bought this game to play with my friends and regret having recommended Green Hell to them since now we're past the refund window.

81,Green Hell,68598596,english,"My review is currently just for co-op mode.

If you enjoy a new challenge and open world survival crafting games, Green Hell is a game you should absolutely look into. 

You'll find a lot of reviews mentioning how this game is like The Forest. It's a fair comparison on the surface, and it's fair to say you'll enjoy Green Hell if you enjoyed The Forest. Green Hell co-op is like The Forest co-op, but with a lot more glitches (and The Forest has its fair share) and a LOT more threats. The games have enough similarities that I quickly reverted to my preferred open world survival play-style and started rushing around, trying to get things done to keep our four player squad alive. I quickly learned that Green Hell is not at all a misnomer. I died. Spectacularly. And often.

Within the first five minutes, a rattlesnake bit me and I died. Upon respawning, I decided to take a nap to replenish some energy only to wake up covered in worms. I attempted to kill something for food and bones (because my notebook insisted bone shards would help me with worms), but I failed. So, I drank some water instead because my guy kept complaining about being thirsty. I ended up with 4 stacks of parasites. Trying to figure out how to cure them and panicking about the flashing symbols on my HUD alerting me of my imminent death, I picked up a poison dart frog without bothering to read that it was a poison dart frog. It sapped what little health I had left and I died again. After I respawned yet again, I was dead within about 30 seconds when I ate something that gave me food poisoning. As my character continued vomiting every few steps, my macros plummeted. It didn't take long for me to fall over and die a third time. This cycle of dying and respawning happened for my first several hours of gameplay, and keep in mind that my squad was also repeatedly dying around me so our collective sanity was abysmal. I turned down the game's volume for fear of actually losing my sanity to the constant voices in my head as I watched this poor guy curl up into the fetal position in the mud, pass out from exhaustion, and subsequently die because I didn't know how to keep him alive for longer than a few minutes.

The learning curve was steep. 90 degrees, I'd say. All four of us went into this blind, and it ultimately made (and continues to make, since we're still playing!) the survival element a [b]lot[/b] more satisfying once we figured out how to, y'know, [i]not[/i] die every few minutes. There was a brief period where I felt myself inching very close to rage quitting. I could hear my boyfriend starting to lose his cool and my friends getting frustrated. We were adamant about not giving up, and it nearly reached that point ... but then we found a dock. And, hey, there's a fire pit! And tons of beds! We built a camp (albeit [b]very[/b] slowly), then things started falling into place.

My favorite thing to do in these kinds of games is build a solid base then explore around it. While we figured out the base part, it took me a lot longer to figure out the surviving-while-exploring part. When I thought I reached a point of confidence, I spent about an agonizing hour repeatedly dying to jaguars and pumas while I was simply trying to replenish my lost resources.

The game has beautiful and immersive sound and visuals, and I slowly learned to use that to my advantage. I now survive quite easily just by paying attention to audio cues, moving a bit slower than I usually do in these sorts of games, and keeping my eyes locked on the scenery for any sort of movement. I only just recently started identifying creatures by their gait. You'll hear all kinds of sounds around you, and it's initially difficult to tell, for example, what's footsteps and what's a capybara roaming around nearby.

As with any game, I do have gripes. We've experienced a lot of glitches in co-op mode: invisible natives that only appear when they die, weapons vanishing from hands, storage boxes randomly sorting and mixing items up, the inability to pick things up or interact with anything that's fixed only by a reset, items flying across the screen, getting stuck in the water, dead fish endlessly splashing in and out of the water making this loud buzzing sound, and just overall lag. None of it has kept me from enjoying the game, but it might bother someone looking for a more seamless experience.

My other gripe has to do with the guy you're playing. While I haven't played story mode yet and don't know his deal, I get [b]very[/b] tired of his almost [i]constant[/i] whining. Even just starting a fire makes him have a hissy fit. He often just randomly exclaims things like, ""You've got to be kidding me!!"" when there's nothing around. When your tools break, you'd swear someone just cut off both of his arms. I get he's in a terrible situation, but his persistent moaning and groaning got very annoying very quickly.

Overall, Green Hell is a pretty intense and rewarding experience if you jump into it blind, and I highly recommend that you do.

*I have not tried out the multiplayer yet as my friends do not yet share the same sense of self-loathing required to play a game like this.*

This is without a doubt the hardest Mid-horror survival game I've ever played. (I had to add mid-horror because, of course, Ark exists.) 
Tried playing through on the hardest difficulty (one death and your saves' deleted) from the start because I'm seasoned in the ways of survival games. Or, at least, I thought I was. 

First try; Grazed a snake in tall grass less than 5 minutes in. Save slot deleted. 

Second try; Picked up a frog the game specifically warned me not to pick up. Save slot deleted.

Third try; Decided to circumvent both the snake and the frogs, because I didn't even trust walking close to either of them anymore. Slow-stepped right into an anthill.  An ANTHILL. Save slot deleted.

Try four-nine; Both malicious hunger and thirst got the best of me. Save slots deleted.

Try ten; Built a hut, killed my first animal, found several coconuts to use for water. Built a fire. 2 hours in. No story elements to be found because I haven't made it 100 feet from the starting point yet, but I was alive I had food I had fire! I cook two pieces of meat, and it was like the God of Green Hell felt my hope and sent Monsoon season outta left field. Doesn't stop raining. Ever. Fire went out. Eating my two cooked meats almost yield no results in helping my completely diminished hunger.  Desperately trying to build a sub-hut just for protection for the fire to stay lit before all three hunger slots diminish. Oh joy, I have found another snake. Save slot deleted. 

Try 11; beat it on easy and have never been so disgusted with myself for giving up

Some features of the game, like your crafting pack, inventory, and base building are on the clunky side compared to other survival titles in the genre. However, the amount of different objects you can craft, along with different types of bases you can create really help make this clunky system much less tedious and more involved in the process. I actually prefer this over, say, The Forests ability to craft extremely proficiently. You become that much more involved in what you pick up and use.

The story line of this game, in my opinion, is superb. On story alone I would rate it a 8/10. only-2 for how short the story content is in relation to the game, however Green Hell easily makes up this difference with self exploration and figuring out some connecting story elements intuitively. I thought I expected what was to come, from the very beginning, which initially felt like a huge let down early on. I was so wrong and had no idea what was to come. Game takes you through a roller coaster of different perspectives on things. 

Graphically, the game is beautiful. The environment of the amazon with both the animals and dynamic sounds really do the trick in feeling like you are in an insatiably large forest. Coupled with the fact you cannot actually see where you are on the map, I think they hit gold. 

The only reason I knocked it 3 points is because there were some things environmentally I did not enjoy. Understand this is just extreme personal preference from playing too many survival games. Having the map walled off by higher area, to me, makes the game feel like a box, no matter how large it is. I totally understand why they felt the need to put these physical boundaries here. The map has to cut off at some point. However, I felt like once I realized this map was completely ""boxed in"", with the exception of the entrance/exit to different zones I knew I could take advantage of this system and found everywhere I needed to go by walking along the wall, where it was also the safest place to be, only leaving the walls when i needed to go continue the story. Then, back to the wall to go to the next place. Exploiting this tactic was on me, but I feel like it robbed some of the ambiance of the entire game to even be an option. Also, the hallway with different skins felt lacking too. But again, that is just personal preference. 

Overall, a very well done story, not too short, beautiful graphics

Having a blast with this one! 13 hours in with bit of a mix between mostly story and a bit survival, I don't think I've even made a dent on the story so far. Which IMO is a good thing 

Truly intrigued by both the mechanics and gameplay.
One might experience a bit of rough start but if you hold out it's pretty premium a few hours in when shit just clicks for you.

One slight issue that I've noticed is that the hitbox on resources (logs, sticks and whatevs..) in the ""blueprint"" when building is quite often a bit off and you have to kind of aim below or to the side of it.

28,Green Hell,70803476,english,"So far its been a fun game, I'll let any newbies know that if you're playing the tutorial and you happen to get bit a rattlesnake just reload unless you already have tobacco and bandages, you likely wont survive, I was stuck just trying to get away from the main camp for over an hour because every time I made it to a place to discover etc I was bit by a rattlesnake (when running you wont have enough time to stop when you hear it) and then spent about 5 minutes slowly dying, the one time I did find tobacco, my inventory was too full to pick it up and I died emptying it, so yeah otherwise not too bad

Edit: Alright after awhile I noticed that certain items are far more commonly found in certain areas of the map and staying in one area while you explore is completely not a viable option, however while listening to a dialogue my character collapsed in a cave, a foot from a bed, after pulling the worms out a rested to regain some stamina, the game began to lag and then I noticed my health falling drastically, within a quarter of a second I was dead from an infection, with my previous save being over an hour prior as I was trying to continue the campaign, disappointing at best.

Edit 2: So the first part of the tutorial is constructed okay, you have the map and are able to see possible areas where you should check out explore etc, however the second part is absolutely brutal, hours of endless walking for little to no reason, no notes giving even the slightest hint of a direction you should go.

Please note this review is for Story Mode single player only, I have not explored the Survival or multiplayer aspects. 

Positives
- Lovely visuals, it's a very beautiful game (aside from the odd stuck armadillo)
- 'Realistic' survival - In that you have to be conscious of where you sleep, what you eat, clean water, venom and animal attacks. You have to check each limb and provide the appropriate care to each area. You also have macro-nutrients to manage so you can't just eat a banana and be full, you need to find a source of protein, carbs and fats. 
- Fun crafting and inventory management - Your inventory is your backpack which has different sections for different items that you can then drag out onto a crafting rock. This is a nice immersion element and fun to do. 
- You're on your own - Apart from a brief tutorial style level, you have to discover a lot of things (e.g. which mushrooms you can eat) by yourself. You have a notebook that will record things you find our as you go so you don't have to remember things. 
- Fun building style - To build anything in game you first place a ghost, that you then need to fill out with collected materials. Again, very immersive and a good sense of realism. 
- Really fun map/ navigation - You have to use the 'co-ordinates' on your watch to match up where you are on a map, rather that just seeing an icon. This makes navigating the jungle quite fun (and tricky if you're not paying attention). 
- Customisable difficulty - You can fully customise for your play style. If you want to focus more on the story, you can reduce the difficulty for the survival needs. If you don't want to deal with hostile animals/ tribes people you can turn it off. I think this really opens up the game to more casual players.

Cons
- Bit of a grind to get things - You can only carry so much and some items you can't pack so can only carry one at a time (e.g. when building a shelter, you can only carry 1 palm leaf, but you need 26 to make the shelter, so a bit of back and forth). Personally I think this adds to challenge of choosing what to carry and what to leave. 
- Could do with a few more clues on how to do certain things. I think most players will like that you have to figure anything else, but would be good for the notebook to maybe have indicators on some items that are safe, perhaps a customisable setting. There is a wiki, but personally I like to figure things out but just needed a little hint. 

That's really all I think of in terms of cons, its a really enjoyable game!

What really killed it for me was after finishing the tutorial, and starting the main game, with 80% health, and 50% thirst, you go insane! After 30 minutes, you go insane! Then the games main character (you) starts continually screaming at you, and instead of quietly moving through the jungle searching for survival, instead you are constantly and I mean constantly, berated and ear bashed by your insanity 30 MINUTES AFTER STARTING THE GAME!!!! It's frigging insane. Who wants a game that screams at you continually. Mostly in my case it was due to thirst (50%), but where the game started me, the was plenty of water, but it was all bad. So this is the first 30 minutes

Look for sticks/stones to make  weapon. 15 minutes later, found a stone to make an axe. 
Bulld a fire in nearby cave, oh shit it's night time, and have no embers and no way to make any. 
Sleep, wake up. 
Set off to explore, looking for food, and anything else. While he says I need a drink at 60% thirst
Over the next 10 minutes you go insane. 
Once the game starts screaming at you ""ARE YOU LISTENING TO ME"" and there's voices continually all
around you driving you nuts, making you spin to identify them. At that point I'd had enough. Instead of

Day 1: Made a lovely little shelter out of palm fronds and vines
           Drank milk from a coconut. 
           Ate a frog. 
           Wrong frog. 
           Dead. 

Day 14: Finished my simple mud hut. Neat fireplace!
              Ate a frog. 
              Right frog!
              Hear a snek. 
              Dead. 
 
Day 21: Found a grappling hook. 
                Hear a snek!
                Oh ho little snek, I see you!
                Don't see cliff. 
                Dead. 

Day 41: Mauled by a panther. 
              Put maggots in the wound to kill the infection. 
              Make antibiotic bandages to heal wound. 
              I am a survival master. 
              Eat beans.

53,Green Hell,69919853,english,"I always think reviews are pretty meaningless if you don't know what someone's into, so, firstly, I'm 40+, into survival games particularly. I like to chill and get immersed in a game's atmosphere, that's the ideal, for me. I'm playing this single player.  

Five comparable titles I rate:
 
1) Subnautica            - Like a dream.
2) Firewatch              - Not exactly survival but, hey. 
3) The Long Dark      - Those blizzards.
4) Project Zomboid    - The huge content, the constant threat.
5) Empyrion               - Not quite as ground breaking but a serious contender.
 
I've Played the Forest, Rust , Stranded Deep, the raft... and plenty of lesser knowns and other variants on the open world survival theme but the above five... 'instant no-lifers' - I've struck DayZ from the list because Bohemia broke my heart.

I'd put this up there with the best of them. It's a very well made, well considered survival game taking a refreshing approach to many of the more common issues compromising games in this genre. I would say, if you haven't played the other 5 on that list, take a look there too. 

Green Hell stands out even in that group in one respect: maintaining a persistent threat level and challenge during the 'daily grind' of feeding your character etc. This game is very well balanced and satisfying on those PVE terms, Project Zomboid and The Long Dark are the only others I know of that really succeeded there.

Firewatch I mention partly because this game has a surprisingly powerful story which does remind me of that masterwork, Green Hell engages the player with the drama through many of the same techniques Firewatch employed.  

I'm 24 hours of playtime into my game and the environment remains hostile and unpredictable to me (which is unusual). Hard-to-spot poisonous spiders and scorpions are a stroke of genius as they stop you running around like an idiot and force a more realistic, cautious attention to the path you chose through the undergrowth - and exactly what you're about to stand on. The focus traversing this open world demands in that way makes exploration a deeply immersive experience which few games can match. 

Like the Long Dark, this game punishes you if you overreach the limitations of your character, this forces careful planning and navigation - landmarks are rare in the dense foliage so you can easily get lost if not paying close attention to your compass bearing... you don't want to be wandering around out there at night. 

There's also the threat of bumping into a tribesman or large predator - either can easily overwhelm you if you blunder into a confrontation unawares. The encounters with the NPC tribesmen are just beautiful, the confusion and mystery there, the way these ghost-like natives emerge and evaporate back into the jungle... you don't know where they are or how many there are... you don;t know where they come from or go to... but they're there and they might be all around you... and you don't belong here.

CHECK THIS - The nutrition system has four separate requirements to satisfy, so, straight off, it's more engaging than most in that regard but more interestingly... and this is the really clever bit... your health at any one time is calculated on the sum total of those four nutrition stats (more or less), so, your health level is in constant flux depending on the level of each nutritional component. Together with a fairly realistic appetite, this keeps the daily grind for consumables relevant, even when you have worked out how to maintain a stable food supply.

I also rate the creative approach these guys have taken to handling the inventory. They've kept the rucksack and the objects in it rendered in 3d as they are in the gameworld, they're dragged and dropped straight in. That's far more immersive than all that hard earned stuff becoming a 2D icon in a drop-down menu when it's picked up. ...Your collection of sticks, stones and lumps of meat maintains much more value that way. 

I think it's fair to say I haven't played another survival game which maintains such a consistent pressure on the player through PVE alone - since that equation is the backbone of the survival experience, imo, this game deserves recognition for proving that prioritising survival mechanics over combat related content can make for a far more interesting and immersive experience.

...It also looks and sounds fricking gorgeous and all the rest. ...All in all, Atmospheric, immersive and challenging, even to a survival game veteran. Hats off.",1590632276,1591900522,TRUE,940,7,0.976451933,32,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,49,15,1407,0,1407,1590542968,,

NOTE: This review only encompasses the (pre-story) co-op experience of the game: 
Graphics: It looks Ok, but i had to reduce them to ""Medium"" because it drops frames on a GTX 1080(?!).
Sound/Sound Design: It has decent sound and quite nice sound design as it is highly positional even when not listened to through surround headphones
Gameplay: [TLDR: shallow crafting, empty uninteresting world, sparse enemy events]
This is the oof section. You enter the game, you learn the intricacies. ""Hmm i die from that, from this, if i eat this i'm ok etc."" You have an aggressive enemy faction, and you have exploration besides the survival elements. You begin by exploring your surroundings, you find a decent spot to build a semblance of base. You ""thrive"" (survive a few days without illness) , you get attacked and that's about it. In exploring you find places with a slight interest, you find gadgets that don't get lost when you die so they must mean something. You use them to pass some points, and then you find 3-4 more camps and that's about it. If it sounds kinda shallow, it's because it is. It really, really saddens me that this game did not succeed in keeping me entertained more. 
The crafting system is somewhat nice, the whole mud thing is a chore really and when you reach the pinnacle of crafting a.k.a. metallurgy, you get dissapointed.

94,Green Hell,70395601,english,"This ""Review"" is more of a rant, so do not let this be a decider to buy this game or not please.
On a lot of game development on the Unity game engine I see an A-typical behavior with centering mouse behavior after you do a task either in a menu or anything else outside normal movement.

To compare it would be the same to you using your computer and for each and every task you do the mouse would center on screen. Forcing you to constantly correct the mouse on screen and on your mouse mat.
I really can not see WHY this is something many game studios seem to either not get or catch up as something worth fixing. 

Examples, every time you craft something in this game you have to correct your mouse down again (As you usually craft things on the ground or in menu)  and then you need to look down again to what you where doing. Making you constantly correct for the movement. 

Another example is when you want to remove leeches on your arms and you have armor on. The mouse centers everything making you not having any possibilities to drag armor on your arms. This works fine on legs because either character move camera to look down anyway. If they could implement to remember MOUSE POS they will get A LOT smoother user experience.

I will leave this Thumbs down review until this is fixed. 
If ever. Other than that I enjoy the game very much and I do see the devs do work hard on this game.
This is sort of game breaking as I get ""tired"" of playing a game that make me move my mouse constantly up and down on my mouse mat.

Holy ♥♥♥♥, this game is ADDICTING.

BEST Survival/Open-World Game I've played yet.

It's not a simple, repetitive survival game. Yes, if you die: you kinda know where things are to start again: but the game will also randomize those items time to time.

I have been playing 100+ hours at the time of this review: I usually die within the 10-20 minutes but I have been binge playing this and have yet to get bored.

This game MAKES you listen to your surroundings for tribal members, predators [Jaguars, Spiders, Snakes] and makes you been on edge.

You also lose your sanity after awhile: and frankly: the first time I lost my sanity: it reminded me of a horror game. It SCARED ME. It was 3AM when I lost it, and I paused the game immediately.

So far, I LOVE THIS GAME!",1589490736,1591200234,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,40,12,6530,0,6511,1591224585,,

I have only played story mode so can't comment on the survival mode but so far, 37 hours into the game, I have encountered nothing other than the odd stick or two re-spawning at the foot of the first grappling hook location. Very atmospheric in patches and pleasurable to make a fire and cook jaguar soup. Interesting skill advancement in that it is not accentuated but purrs away in the background with notifications of levelling up flashing up in the bottom right of the screen. Almost to the point of accessory. The crafting system is nearly tedious as is the magnifyng glass icon popping up relentlessly, warning you to check your limbs for leeches, worms, cuts, venom wounds. I haven't broken a bone yet but am tempted to jump off a cliff and try to break both femurs... graphics are solid, leaf litter effect very realistic.  75+

14,Green Hell,70213198,english,"To start off this review I must make it very clear that I strongley recommend you should either purchase Stranded Deep or The Forest instead of Green Hell and by that i'm sure you know how my reaction to this game was.. 
      Green Hell was a very interesting game as it was geared to be an extremely realistic take on the player being dropped into the Amazon Rainforest and having to survive when supplies are scarce. This concept is great and in fact I bet if executed well it would have made a crazy fun experience however Green Hell's execution was rather rough to say the least with its mind numbingly boring story and way over the top level difficulty. Last I played the game (which was soon after launch may I add) you were forced to play the story mode before you could actually jump into the actual ""good"" bit of the game which is absurd as the story is extremely bare bones and just has the player looking around for supplies for minutes on end which you get real sick of real quick. Once you get into the actual survival bit of the game steaks are raised far far too high as simply being bit by a snake means your game is over as poisoning was never ending and the only way to heal it is laughably hard to obtain. Rather than a game like Stranded Deep were at least you get an island that has no enemies on it in Green Hell nowhere and I mean NOWHERE is safe even if you build a cabin or shelter a leopard will just take you out the second you leave or you will be cursed by nearly uncurable poison from a rattlesnake. There is no way I can stress enough how crazy difficult this game is and although I have just over three hours on the game all of that time was either on the story mode (not by choice) or constantly restarting the game when I was poisoned once.
      To the games credit there are some good things but this is a rather short list. The first plus I can give this game are the looks and ohh man does this game take your breath away with its stunning visuals but a good looking game can't hide garbage gameplay. Next the environment feels like the Amazon and although i've never been this seems like a very accurate portrail of what I believe would actually be in the Amazon Rainforest but once again a games visuals are only as good as the gameplay and as I previously mentioned the gameplay is far to difficult and unfun. 
      Overall if your thinking about buying Green Hell I highly advise against it when there are much better survival games such as Stranded Deep or The Forest which are fun and fair portrails of survival situations somebody may find themselves in that being stuck on a massive island somewhere with unknown species and being wrecked on a tropical island somewhere in the middle of the Atlantic. And once more this review is solely based on the game JUST AFTER LAUNCH so mabye the game is better now but I have no desire to try it out again..

If you are wanting a review, I can't give one. I've only played 2 hours, but it was just an overall frustrating exercise in my patience due to the constant need to resource hunt. 5 Stamina bars. FIVE. And all of them affect your max health and stamina. The character eats like a trained food contest winner, and drinks more than an alcoholic fish.

And that doesn't include the sanity meter, which I refused to use. No, its too tedious. I'll wait for my gf to build a base and then just go murder things.

The game plays similar to the Forest and features neat mechanics. Maintaining specific limb health, and the crafting interface extends into other things like cooking and making medicines instead of just being bog standard. 

The game is in a rain forest setting, and if you run lower graphics it all just looks like mud. Everything is mud, even the leaves are mud. Not a stickler for graphics, but you need to be able to distinguish usable things from just regular flora. Kinda hard to do when everything looks like a clay sculpture until you are right up on it. For reference, I'm playing on a gtx 960 using medium default settings at 1080p.

This one is a no go for me until I can get a base setup, by my gf who has quite a bit more patience for the grind. I also need to get a better graphics card due to the textures just not texturing with any detail.

89,Green Hell,69915494,english,"Great survival game for the first 2-5 hours. 

Cons:
After learning the remedies to ailments, seemed too easy.  The variety of animals and danger of animals was disappointing.  Jungles are fairly noisy places, there was not enough noises in the Green Hell to ""set the mood"" and there was also no music. A few music pieces, but music was noticeable missing in most of the game.  Combat with natives seemed to easy and a bit clunky. Sounds and music are a negative score from me, sound and music is what sets the mood in most game and this game was lacking music/sounds. See The Long Dark for a very well done sounds and music survival game, really sets the mood in the Long Dark.

Pros:
The animations and graphics of the animals that are in the game are well done.  The forest is generally very lush and well done graphics. The remedy/medical system is superb, all though I wish there was more ailments. The crafting and building of structures is very well done, nice UI and system. The GUI is great. The story line is great, really well done story line and voice acting.

In closing,
If not for the story line, I would have stopped played after 7-10 hours. Sadly after playing the story, just didn't find any value in playing anymore because the survival aspect is too easy. 

Recommend game for story mode. Hope they fine tune some challenges and add content to make survival mode worth a challenge.

The physical inventory system is refreshing and generally intuitive. Constructing a shelter can be a little tedious the 10th time you've done it, but it's always satisfying to complete a camp and make use of it. 

Navigating the jungle is really fun, the sounds and graphics are solid, and having to watch your step is engaging - stepping on a rattlesnake you didn't notice can be a disaster, but spotting it and killing it becomes an opportunity for lunch. 

And the story - total surprise.

95,Green Hell,69883544,english,"Currently I am so addicted to that game!
First of all I want to mention the things I dislike. There are some problems with using the storage boxes: If you move items inide the box they are still shown but the stack can't be moved anymore amd the item amount counts 0. But if you re-open the storage box the items are complete again, I didn't lose any.
Another ""problem"" I detected is that sometimes the fighting theme starts playing while hunting animals and it does not stop anymore, which can be annoying but there could be worse.

Now here are the things I love about the game:
Usually you are able to hear almost every animal or reptile that is able to poison you early enaugh to avoid running into it. So if you are carefull enaugh you can avoid bites or stings during the whole game - at least as far as I played.
I also like the concept with that smart watch on the wrist instead of having the information somewhere on the screen. And working with coordinates is a little more of a challenge than having the current location shown on the map. So far the whole game is set up more realistic than other survival games I played before. I don't know if that is going to change at some point - I think I still have a long way to go through story mode.
I'm glad the spiders don't jump towards my face - I would love to have settings for arachnophobics tho. Still it's a survival game so I do not complain about included spiders.

All in all I enjoy this game a lot so I do recomend the game.

If you don't play the story mode, you are doing a serious disservice to yourself and the developers. I initially purchased this game as a co-op survival game for myself and a few friends and while the game was beautifully made and the survival elements very unique, there was only so much you could squeeze out of the experience. In order to become better at survival management, we all decided to play the story mode to learn the basics and this is when we all became stunned.

I cannot stress to you the need to play the story mode. The last 50 hours have been an unexpected emotional roller-coaster and I came out of the end with serious respect and admiration for what the developers have done. This is right up there for me with the likes of Mass Effect, Bioshock and Firewatch. I'm shocked at how well this small developer was able to bring so many triple A elements in to craft such an amazing story.

The only Cons I have are the frustration of inventory management and some glitches and bugs present throughout the game but those were not nearly enough to prevent me from hanging on every last word of the storyline and enjoying my riveting playthrough.

In story mode I've only had 1 visual bug where my bow was invisible but could still be used (destroying it and made a new fixed it for me).

For those without friends to play with, or not even willing to cooperate with randoms and just looking for a nice story - just go ahead. Would say the Story Mode is 7/10. Just don't google anything, it's gonna ruin all the fun of discovering new places and plants.
Here are the main problems I'd like to emphasize:
1. Bad optimization. Been playing COOP with players having really good PCs, they still had issues.
2. Even the hardest difficulty setting stops being challenging after just a couple hours of playing. Tribesmen aren't much of a threat. Resources are too plentiful. (Bows are way too OP, imnsho)
3. Setting up a base in story mode barely serves any purpose, which might be disappointing for some players
4. Random world generation is what really lacking for COOP, without it the game is very limited.
5. Plenty of glitches in COOP. Items from one's backpack suddenly appear in backpacks of others after restarting the game server. Food keeps spoiling in the backpacks of those, who aren't playing while the host is playing. 
6. Plenty of glitches in general, like tribesmen flying into the evening sky after doing a couple of backflips, bows constantly disappearing from the inventory.",1590517615,1590517615,FALSE,1,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,58,3,2826,0,2826,1590514922,,

One of the better survival-genre games. Co-op survival is good fun and the storyline of the singleplayer campaign would not be out of place in the Black Mirror tv show.

it looks and sounds great and the attention to detail in the models is accurate.

the nutrition aspect is (thankfully?) more simple than something like SCUM, the building mechanics are ok (after a bit of trial and error), but it's the [b]SANITY[/b] and psychological side to this game that really set it apart. everything affects your sanity (positively or negatively) and you only need to go insane once to REALLY value your sanity (just like real-life ?), it's actually pretty confronting and scary.

as of version 1.5.5 the game is pretty stable and the few bugs it does have are generally solved by saving often (and can even be turned into exploits...;) )

replay value of the single player seems high as there were hints to alternative endings.

I'm 30 hours into this game, so if I missed something let me know!

Survival/Multiplayer: I've had a LOT of fun playing survival with tha boys. My only gripe is the crafting recipes for the traps and utilities can only be ""found"". So if you want to have a quick session with tha boys you have to spend the first hour or so running around to discover stuff.

Here are some suggestions which I think are also missing:
- Crafting: Floor Tiles (Wood & Stone), Small Bridges, Platforms (Balcony, Catwalks, Stairs (Indoor & Outdoor). Also, I would really love to be able to create fences anywhere I want! Just fences, no frame required.
- Terraforming: Flatten, Even and Clear pieces of terrain to make room for new constructions. Also, being able to dig holes for either Traps or Pool.

41,Green Hell,69721466,english,"If you like survival games, Green Hell delivers. Manage your health, fight a harsh environment and craft your tools for survival. 

Green Hell is not game breaking, but the environment, the jungle, is nice to be in. The sound system is developed, the overall environment is gloriously realistic, and you will feel in the jungle.

However, do not expect *too* much from the game. For 20-ish$ it will definitely be worth the price, and the singleplayer story mode is compelling and keeps you in-game.

However, after a few hours of learning and stress, the Green Hell becomes a Green Paradise. At which point you will not be the hunted, but the hunter.

The game offers multiplayer mode, with which I had no difficulty to find other players, and hats off to the devs for servicing their fan-base. But after story mode, I did not feel that much of an incentive to pursue Multiplayer.

Conclusion:
+ Great Graphics and environment
+ Good survival and balanced threats
+ Compelling story
- After the learning curve, you master the hell
- Once you know the mechanics and finish story, you are over with.

54,Green Hell,69678484,english,"Green Hell reminds me a LOT of The Forest.  The crafting/inventory system, the mind'freak' story/twists, the survival methodology, gameplay mechanics, etc.  I would say that Green Hell is a MUCH MORE POLISHED (and interesting) version of The Forest.

With the difficulty cranked up, it can be really frustrating, but it still seems to be fairly tame for a game about being a lone survivor in the middle of the Amazon.  There's snakes, scorpions, spiders, murder kittens, etc. etc. all looking to kill you.  Meanwhile you're trying to keep yourself from getting food poisoning, parasites, worms under your skin, and having to maintain your constantly dropping SANITY.

There's really not a lot that I *didn't* like about this game.  It's super fun, the story is really good, the graphics are amazing, the sound/voices are top notch, the gameplay is what I expected for a survival game, etc.  Here's a few things that I didn't like and/or oddities I noticed:

a.  For the first half of the game, the conversations over the radio were overly enthusiastic ""HEY MIA, I JUST FOUND A....""  like dude, calm down...
b.  The scorpions and snakes would not make ANY sounds until you're already tripping over them.  I just got used to carrying around a lot of plantain lilies and lily dressing to keep from dying so much.  Still, VERY annoying...
c.  The story is quite short (but VERY interesting).  Knowing *how* to play the game now?  I could probably run through and beat the story in about an hour or two.  I might do that next weekend...  (It look 26 hours because I built several ""homes"" with all the luxuries along my journey...)
d.  The list of things available to craft/build is actually pretty short, but it kind of makes sense for a game of this setting.  (Compared to other crafting/survival games)  That doesn't mean there's not plenty enough to do.
e.  I know it's a bit immersion-breaking, but I really wish games would WARN me before I reach a ""point of no return"" in the story.  I ended the story HOURS ago and had to load an earlier save because I wasn't done building/exploring.  I just beat the story again (the right way - the way I wanted to beat it...) but the first time was a bit of a slap in the face...

All-in-all I highly recommend this game.  I had a blast with it, and I'd love to spend more time in it if I could A. make a friend and B. convince them to play it with me.  Unfortunately, now it would appear that I've done all the things and seen all the places and built all the stuff - nothing else to do except put it on max difficulty.

Managing your health, wound care and being limited by both number of items and carry weight is definitely a new approach and an enjoyable one. This is easily one of the best survival/crafting games I've played and a step up from about 90% of the ones out there. The story is immersive, heartfelt and subtle, the ending (which I will NOT spoil here) was a well-deserved shot to the feels and one that could only be described as artistically executed no matter which ending you chose.
PROS: Riveting story, challenging mechanics, easy to use controls, and both navigation and crafting systems are excellent. Multiplayer option is also a plus and most enjoyable.
CONS: The game's tutorial could us a bit more in regards to basic survival (notably towards food-effects). Likewise, daylight/night length seems a bit fast and could be slowed down a touch. As-is day seems to pass too quickly and night seems to lag on which is easy to skip by sleeping but having a little longer daylight would be nice. Respawn rate for trees and bamboo could be a bit quicker and increased drop rate for planks (less branch more plank when harvesting a log) and logs in general from trees would be an improvement.
SUGGESTIONS FOR DEVS: suggested 3 logs/larger tree instead of 2 and 2 planks/log instead of 1 would be nice. adding actual live anaconda's to the game would also be interesting, as would monkeys or more varied wildlife. Purple Leaf herbs (Albahaca) could drop 2 instead of 1 leaf as they seem pretty rare despite having selective use. Also, adding in something (perhaps a book/s or magazine/s) to the survival mode that will identify plants (at least giving a name to them) so they stop showing up as ""Unknown Leaf""/""Unknown Herb""/""Unknown Bulb""/etc., would be a huge improvement. Increase to the shelf life of both orange and green fruits (Cocona and Soursop) to maybe a day or banana-level would be nice instead of having them spoil literally before nightfall of the day they get picked.

2,Green Hell,45381334,english,"Okay, so I'm not big on writing reviews, or survival games, but I had to drop a few lines for this game. I'm in complete awe of the way the game is built and the current state as an Early Access title. The jaw dropping graphics and user friendly controls had me hooked immediately. The biggest draw for me is the sweet, sweet optimization that has been done. This game has no lagging, no stuttering and no freezing that I can find at all. 


(Currently running a NVIDIA GTX 1070 with 16GB RAM and Dual i7 2.7 Ghz processors)


The controls are as smooth as butter and well thought out. Even the combat is fluid and every animation has meaning and weight. My first encounter with a tribal skull warrior went in my favor but he got a few good knocks in and I died shortly afterwards due to a puma that came back for revenge.


As an early access title this game has earned a 10/10 from me for mechanics and gameplay.


[strike]For story though, I think it needs to be slightly re-storyboarded. The pacing feels excellent but there's no real urgent need to feel for the love interest/wife/girlfriend/co-worker...you see where I'm going with this. Have her up and digging through bags instead of laying on a cot. The conversation points are paced perfectly but it should be made clear WHY the player should care for this person. Frankly, she feels like an after thought. That's just my two cents.[/strike]

I feel should update my review at this time due to the inclusion of new modes and items. I am still extremely pleased with the progress of this game and the blood, sweat, and tears that have went into making it the best it can be. The controls and gameplay are still a 10/10. The story no longer feels as though it is lacking. There is real meaning behind why we should feel an urgent need to find and care for the love interest. This is a huge improvement over Early Access.

22,Green Hell,69458595,english,"I have fallen in love with this game. Yeah, I don't have a lot of hours, but it is amazing. Be aware as it is very, VERY enraging. I was on day 32 with my last save at 26 because I was moving inland and still building my new hut. While I was returning with logs to finish building a mud mixer, I was attacked by tribe members. I got a small cut from one and bled out during the fight. I'm writing this just after calmly quitting the game and now I'm gonna angrily sleep. Seriously though, take your time and be very careful. Everything can (and most likely will) kill you. Now for a couple of hints of mine.
1. When crafting, you don't need to know the recipe to make an item. If the black dots become white, it means you are on the right path to creating something. If the dots disappear, it means two of the objects are not compatible with each other.
2. Use sound cues to know if you pissed something off. Snakes rattle, spiders make weird spider noise, big predators growl, little prey squeal and squeak.
3. Fix your wounds ASAP. You die fast if you don't, especially if you are dying of hunger and thirst,
4. It's okay to drink dirty water, it won't insta kill you. Just be careful and prey you don't get too many parasites. If you do, test different mushrooms, fruits, flowers, and herbs to see if any cure parasites. (but make sure you washed up because you could give yourself a parasite from being dirty on accident and waste the healing item)
5. Save. Save a lot. Never save over day 1. If you royally fuck up and cannot fix anything you will have to go back, or maybe you just want to restart. When you do save, save over the oldest (except for day 1).
6. Go out and explore. If you stay holed up in your camp forever, you will not progress or find new material.
7. Don't be afraid to eat something with a debuff. If you get food poisoning from a flower that gives you the much needed carbs, then just find something to cure it. (Charcoal is the cheapest way but it does cost sanity)
8. Evolve to mud bases as quick as you can. Shit gets real fast. You will be attacked if you keep lighting fires and progressing. It sucks because you will also probably die. Mud bases have a lot of benefits that will help you progress.
9. Avoid unnecessary fighting with anything that is big or has a weapon. You are not god. You are a human being who will die from a small cut becoming infected and killing you overnight.
10. Don't sleep through the night. There are special hours in between night and day that have the worse lighting, aim to sleep during those house. Night and day both have plenty of light to see what you're doing but at night try to keep it near your base.
11. WATCH OUT FOR STINGRAYS THOSE FRICKEN WATER SNAKES WILL STING YOU SO MANY TIMES AND WASTE SO MUCH TOBACCO!
12. Don't get mad at the game. If you died, it's 99% your fault for not dealing with the situation right. If the game glitched out, then you just have to suck it up. Getting mad will make you do subjectively worse.
13. Don't sleep on the ground. Build a bed or small shelter as fast as you can so that you don't sleep on the ground and wake up with a nasty surprise.
14. Keep maggots on you. Don't eat them tho. They can cure infection.
15. Hunt. Berries, fruit, fish, fallen nuts, shrooms, and bananas will only feed you for so long (and you won't get any fat tbh). Go hunt some animals and cook (or dry) the meat to gain lots of protein and fat.
16. It will not rain every day. I went through a 4 day dry spell and almost died of thirst.
17. Use coconut shells to collect clean water and not die.
18. In the end, just have fun. It's a game meant to piss you off and be very difficult. You will die, you will suffer, you will succeed, and you will die again. It's about learning from your mistakes and not repeating them. You died to snake in the grass while running? Don't run through the grass again without listening. You died because you ran out of energy and couldn't escape your doom? Go back to your base sooner and rest up. You got stabbed 28 times by some random guy speaking an unknown language who may or may not want to physically abuse you? Die. You will probably die. Seriously, screw those natives.

Let me tell you, the storyline is epic, its tough getting thru it a bit while you figure out how to take care of yourself,  Its an open world with a bunch of points of interest, when you reach one you have to build up a bit to stabilize your health to push forward.  Its enjoyable.  Crafting is fairly intuitive, graphics are very pretty.  You really feel like you're lost in the jungle striving to push ahead.  Then theres the survival mode where they let you loose with nothing and you just run around doing whatever you like, building up bases is basic wall, doorway, roof crafting style, with a few quirks and a certain in touch with reality vibe.  Its incredibly immersive.  You really feel like somethings gunna jump out and get you, and it might.
Give it a try, definately worth the buy in to support the devs at least, they've done great work here.

In detail
a very slow paced game, and kind of realistic (sure not 100% realistic but more realistic then most games) where it can take you 3 or more attempts just to walking a to b.
I first started this game in survival coop and had to figure everything out and had quiet a blast. Problem is in survival coop if you build a decent base craft armor and weapons (or just take the tribal weapons from killed natives ;) ) there is not much to do. We scouted the first map (I don't even know if it is possible to go to the other maps in coop) but then didn't know what else to do. The building mechanics are sadly not that good and it doesn't feel so necessary even having a big base. The crafted iron item are not even that good (whats okay because they should not be OP) so it does not even make sense to craft them, unless you want to have them because you can.

Then I started the solo story and boy that is great. Not only is the story great the mechanics are just right for this. Your aim is to get out of the jungle so you don't need to set up big bases just enough to have a save point (actually to save the game) where you recover. And then you push on build the next small base and so on. And the most times I died (and I died a lot) where because I was to eager to press on. Scouting the jungle at night didn't watch my step. And one snake bite forces you to got back sleep the fever out get fresh water heal up and try again ….. 
and yeah the game does not explain very much, and its probably even more fun to figure everything out by yourself. I used the green hell wiki from time to time because I'm stupid and lazy :) but tried not to overdue it and also found some stuff by myself.

Ah and when you die in solo story you don't just respawn in the last place you slept like in survival coop you really have to load your last game... there is also no auto save I didn't know this and had to start the game 3 times over …...

So the singleplayer story is worth the game! 

For coop I fear there are better games. Unless the make story coop, this would be really great, I know it would make the game far easier but who cares you can still play solo ;D

If you are into crafting and base building I also would not recommend this (I would recommend Astroneer or Raft for this)

If you are reading this, there are a few things I'd like to ask:

1. So far animal feces are somewhat scarce, and I am surprised that we, as survivors, don't poop ourselves.

2. If we are desperate enough, why are we not allowed to eat poop?

3. If eating poop isn't an option, can we at least get the option to make some Poo Stew, or Poop Soup? XD

4. If neither of those sound appetizing, perhaps using some sort of jug, we could hold said Poo Stew or Poop Soup to divide up the hydration and fertilization between multiple crops?

Good points:
- Well thought out nutrition system
- Amazing environment, beautiful graphics
- Good sound design
- Co-op!

Bad points:
- Once you figure out the nutrition mechanics, it's pretty easy to survive, even on the harder difficulty
- The natives don't really pose that much of a threat
- It takes way too much effort to build a base, and there isn't much point in building one. Natives and predators don't attack much. All you need to survive is a bed, a fire and something to cover the fire. It's easy to hunt and forage. You can collect all the water you need with coconut husks.
- Not enough variety of wildlife (only what, 2 types of birds?!)
- How can nearly all mushrooms be safe to eat? It seems mad.
- Day/night cycle is far too short

32,Green Hell,69162297,english,"What a fantastic survival game! 

I bought this game after they released the COOP update.

The game caught my attention because of the unique and in depth food and medical system. You need to maintain all levels of Hydration, Carbs, fats and proteins by eating different animals, fruits and fungi. 

The medical system puts injuries on your limbs forcing you to check for damage and remove leeches, apply bandages or stitch lacerations. Ignoring injuries drains your health energy levels and nutrition quickly so it's best to stay on top of it.

The crafting system is similar to other games like ""The Forest"" and ""Rust"". There's not a huge amount of variety to the recipes but you can usually figure how to make things before the game teaches you how to.

The game is built on the Unity engine and mostly runs very well for how it looks after the latest update, however the usual stutters from unity are still present. 

The story was deeper than I expected and had me guessing a little about what was going on. It doesn't outright spell everything out for you and how much of the story you learn depends on how much you explore. The game has 2 endings though I found one much more satisfying than the other. 

The combat and survival mechanics start off very challenging at first but once you get the hang of them get much much easier. The combat in the game I found too easy and if you plan and approach situations logically the game isnt hard. The exception for this is the single player “challenges” which I had a blast playing. Having a strict time limit forces you into risky situations. 

The coop mode and survival mode are the same in their systems just with more people. The survival mode was fun to play before I understood the game mechanics and was still learning the game. Up to 3 clients can join the host bringing their saved inventory with them. Dying means they respawn losing some items and dropping the rest. My main gripe with the survival mode is you have no purpose. There’s no win conditions and surviving isn’t that difficult. Having some large challenge your group needs to complete or increasingly difficult conditions would add a lot to the survival mode. 

Overall I thoroughly enjoyed Green hell and wholeheartedly recommend it to survival fans. 
The review scores on sites and on steam are very accurate. I feel the game well deserves 85/100, as it’s great fun but could use a few improvements and quality of life improvements with game modes, achievements and crafting.

I'll start with the Cons because they would be the determining factor on whether or not I would want this game.
Cons:
The game doesn't hold your hand at all, and finding things without a guide can be difficult. 
The co-op mode on regular settings is a nightmare so if you want to play with a friend, mess with the hunger rates and such.
Building requires TONS of resources and time, so if you want to build a cool base, be ready to put in some work.

Pros: Surviving is BRUTAL. This could be a Con for some people, but it is what set the game apart for me. You constantly have to balance proteins, fats, carbs, water, sleep, and sanity.
Exploring is fun and rewarding. Finding a cave, camp, etc. feels amazing amidst the dense jungle.

Been ""following"" the game for a bit, always wondering if I should get it or not.

So one evening I thought I will get this and play through it today, since it probably isn't going to be that long of a game, well 8 hours later at 4 am I had completed the story for the first time, I didn't get to sleep much that night

Some thoughts I got, most of them are subjective.

Pros
- Good story
  - Quite unpredictable 
  - Long, took me about 8 hours to finish it, ONLY aiming at completing the game.
  - Interesting, only made me want to explore more and more after each discovery
  - New setting, you don't see that many games about, the Amazon

- Rather good graphics
  
- Good controls

- Interesting new features that I have not seen in other games. 

Cons

- Ground is very dull looking, makes me want to look towards the sky constantly. 

- I really hate the sound that the animals make. It's very loud compared to other sounds and extremely annoying to listen to for hours on end. BUT I guess that's the Green Hell. 

- Lost some interest about the story at the end.

Overall, I very much liked the game. I am recommending this to anyone just looking fro a story game, or why not just a survival experience.

[spoiler] So, the game, as a survival game, I think it's very good, it's like what I was hoping the forest would be, the forest ended up being a cave simulator, while this game is an actual survival game that takes place in a, well, green hell, and I think that title is quite fitting, since this game, even on the easiest difficulty, is hard, like really hard, and I like that, as for the story.......bleh, the story is kinda crap, as a person who plays video games to escape from reality and to be cheered up from the horrors of it, this story really isn't what I was expecting or hoping for, and if you're curious yes, I did get the ""good"" ending, and honestly, it kinda shits on the entire story of the game, since, I understand what they tried to do but, as someone who grew up hating cancer/coma theories for cartoon shows, this game's actual story being one kind of pissed me off, granted it's not exactly like one of those theories, it's more of a third person version, but still, also out of curiosity I watched the other ending and, eh, also sucked, I just feel that the ending being so bitter that the tiny amount of sweetness to it makes either ending too sad, also when I first beat the game I was dumbfounded and confused, I had to look up on the internet what the hell was going on, and even after that the story still isn't that good in my opinion, overall I'd recommend it, if you avoid the story mode, I know the game tells you to play the story first but since the story sucks I don't see a point in playing through it.

I don't have alot of experience with survival games and don't know what good games are out there in the genre but what I can tell you is that Green Hell is an amazing game with a slight learning curve. Me and my friend hopped straight into the online co-op and this is the most fun in a co-op game I've had in a while. Like I said there is a slight learning curve and some trial and error and the first day we had little to no clue what we were doing. But by day two we had a little more knowledge about the game and by day three we were fzeling co fident in our survival. Maybe a little bit too confident as we found ourselves in pretty tough situations from time to time. 

Exploring is key and alot of fun. There's alot of stuff in this game and when I thought we've seen it all we found certain ""items"" (without giving any spoilers) that would aid us in further exploration of the island and places we could not go before.

Killing big animals doesn't reward you.

83,Green Hell,69046423,english,"This is going to be a rough review for me as I have to decide thumbs up or thumbs down.  It is really in the middle.

It was good fun for a while.  I play mostly in offline mode as my wifi is super slow and I hate being forced to do updates.  So I only go into online mode if I want and update or a new game.  I have probably played about 40-50hrs.  Which honestly means it is an OK value.

But the game gets tedious.  When you do not know what to do it is fun.  Once you have the kinky worked out it is trivial.  And most of the complexity is just figuring out which things need to be done in which order.  Even Civ is like this but it really does not have the same replayability of civ given the static map.

If you want a good survival game, Ark, The Long Dark and Subnautica (the first one, still mixed on below zero) are definitely superior.

So I guess I am not going to recommend this game.  It has a lot of potential.  But it is missing fear and repeatability.  I do not fear for my life in Green Hell the way I do in Ark or the Long Dark.  And it lacks the pure beauty and slightly randomized map of Subnautica.

Though if the price is low I would pick it up just for the 20 hours of play it will give you.  And then you will never look at it again (unless something dramatic changes).

96,Green Hell,68844816,english,"I like survival games so I wanted to give it a try. I completed story mode and still playing on multi player survival mode. 

Ambience is amazing! Expecially during the sunset how the forest looks is beautiful. Exploring can be dangeous. You need to be prepared if you are going to have a walk in the forest. Story was nice and told well. Some scenes were cool looking. Story mode end was unexpected. I was hoping have a huge fight, was prepared and excited about it, but no, was a sudden and quiet end. Kinda disappointed.

There are some things need to be fixed in game. They are; 
- Group members spawn in different locations at the start of the game.
- If one of group member sleep and other don't, tribesmen can only be seen by the one who doesn't sleep in the group.
- What is the meaning of building a base or making armor if you aren't gonna fight or get attacked by natives? I was expecting them to be in the caves or at least in the camps we need to explore. Had them attacking us only a couple of times.
- When you die you drop every single thing in your inventory all over the place and once you are back you need to pick them one by one. Why not drop it as a bag so we can get going?!
- There are caves but nothing in them more then a scorpion and some ore. Makes you skip exploring caves. 
- Trees dont regrow, so it is pain to carry logs from far while building. I think this should be an option to turn on and off in settings.
- Many plants spawn on top of eachother. 2 herbs at one place. Nice bug :D
- House made of mud with roof still gets the rain inside.
- If you build a water collector on a higher floor, water drips down.
- If you drop logs and sticks from higher floor, sometimes, it drops on the ground like floor doesn't exists.
- Ladder is horrible to use.
- At nights while raining leaves reflect light bit too much.
- You take damage from falling even if it is not high at all.
- Difficult to walk on logs to pass to the other side.
- Drinking and eating is bit too often. It starts to annoy after a while.

1. This is a explorative game with enough action. It's not just a believable rainforest, no you will feel really immersed.  
2. Graphics and sound are well done. And you can also play it co op w 4 people.  
3. There is a reasonable story that can vary a bit how you play.
4. The ayahuasca trip is seriously well done.
5. User Interface uses affordances in a great way, the user interface is pretty high end.

However, some things could be better, but none of these are show stoppers for me (and i guess there wont be for many either).  

1. PVE's are just too easy to kill once you get the hang of it (they should get harder to defeat while you get better). 
2. The story could vary more so you could have more ways to finish.
3. Holders for bamboo are missing, making things unnessary clumsy without adding anything useful top the game experience. However these are on the roadmap on Q2 2020 (but now we are in Q2 and I dont see them!)
4. The game has most essential things too build, however surviving isnt the only thing of the game. As you are sheltering in your building (to go to sleep, saving games, eating and drinking, making stuff, adding supplies) you spend some considerable time there. It would be nice make it look prettier: there are no chairs or tables, no carpets, or notes or maps to put on your own buildable corkboard. It would be nice to be able to draw on the map or put your own written notes to specific coordinates (also useful in co op games to communicate)
5. This game in VR would be so friggin awesome!!!

69,Green Hell,68883937,english,"I might love this game. As I write this, I've only played 2 hours. I've only played 2 hours, because I just received my first ""You died!"" screen. According to this screen, I survived 3 days, traveled 4.4km, and vomited 3 times. I was ""Killed by a cut"".

A whopping 3 days. Should I be proud? What did I accomplish in those three days?

I managed to build a lean-to and crafted a palm leaf bed. I even built a small fire! Unfortunately, I had very little sanity left by the time I'd accomplished those three feats. I was hearing voices. I was hallucinating.

You see, as the first night set in, I had to sleep on the ground. Lots of... ""things"" live on the ground, I woke up and noticed a sore on my left arm. Apparently, a worm had burrowed its way under my skin. Wonderful. As if the visual wasn't enough, I saw the game inform me that my sanity was dropping due to knowing a worm was... y'know... inside me.  But, I had a shelter to finish. I didn't want to sleep in the elements again, and besides - I didn't know how to remove the worm. 

As I worked, I passed out to dehydration four times before finally giving in and drinking the unclean water nearby. I vomited, canceling out the hydration. Wonderful.

I found bananas here and there, but no source of protein or fats (I had yet to see a single coconut - I began to believe them to be a myth). But lo! What did I find 'neath a tree? A spider! I took him back to my campfire and cooked him. My sanity dropped further, but at least I had enough protein to last me 2 minutes.

I picked leeches off my exposed limbs hourly. By the third morning, I had a worm burrowed into each arm and each leg. I heard voices that weren't my own from every direction. 

And then it happened - I found a lone little wild pig, and cornered it. Killing it exhausted me to the point of passing out atop its carcass, but when I awoke, I was able to harvest the bones into bone needles. Needles, that could dig the worms out of my limbs! I was going to do this! I was going to conquer this land, these beasts, and this insanity!

It was the third night. I found a coconut on the ground, further proof that luck shined upon me. A bit of fat from its fruit, sweet, sweet liquid for hydration, and a husk I could potentially capture rainwater in! Now to find a plant to make poultices for the wounds left by the bone needles, before sleeping above ground in a hammock I'd found in an abandoned village.

All in all, it was looking up. I was grateful for the chance to experience more of the game, and as I stumbled toward the hammock in the dark, I was struck from behind by a local. I turned around as he hit me, too exhausted to raise my axe, and watched as he struck me one more time.

You have died. Killed by a cut.

The wounding and diseases are sometimes difficult to take care of due to medicinal plants being available nearby or even if you run in a direction you might not be able to find any, but they are otherwise cool and feel pretty gross to look at and cure.

PROS:
- Plausible premise, realistic survival mechanics. The player is not a superhero.
- Immersive interfaces. The inventory is managed through a backpack, not a standard inventory screen. The player HUD is small and unobtrusive.
- No ""hand holding"". The developer encourages taking measured risks and figuring things out the hard way.

CONS:
- The game is new, and some helpful features are missing. The developer has a roadmap that they seem to be sticking to, but some quality of life upgrades (like certain buildable containers) are ... eagerly awaited.
- Inexperienced gamers may feel as if they've been thrown into the deep end. This game requires learning my making mistakes, which some people may find frustrating. This is a matter of taste, and not an issue with the game design.
- The game encourages the collection and use of resources as needed rather than stockpiling as is common with other survival games.

After playing some depth to the coop I tried out single player. I am just going to say SAVE YOUR GAME.

If you like the survival genre, you will love this one.



Pros:

- Try to be as real as possible, without removing the fun of the game. 
- I loved the macro nutrients division, makes you go for diferent types of food, most survival games lack that.
- Graphics are very good, the game is beautiful
- The dev team is great, they listen to the community and really try to fix bugs and add new features to the game.
- Single player history is good, and you should probably play it before going to multiplayer

Cons:

- The biggest cons of all in my opnion is: things like animals, plants and some other items have determined ""spawn places"". This makes the game non-random, and after you identify the patterns, the game became less fun and you lose immersion because you know the location of the dangers and resources (this is the number one negative point of the game for me).

- We need to be able to carry more weight (there is a mod for that already, but i would like to see a progression system for this, like we have for other things like fishing, fisting, etc).

- We need to be able to carry more logs/long sticks (maybe a craftable cart like the one we have in ""The Forest"" game)

- Not very optmized, meaning that most high end rigs will run it on ""low"" fps (i have a low end pc, and have a 30~ fps average on medium settings)

- We need a map editor! This would make a huge difference in gameplay replayability, since the current map doesnt change (fixed locations and animals/plant spawn)",1588962899,1588962899,TRUE,1,1,0.523809552,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,184,29,14715,0,9416,1592938701,,

I enjoyed this game thoroughly. 

I think Green Hell is a great game for what is currently released. Co-op wise it's probably missing I'd say a large chunk that would make the game outstanding (mainly objectives, goals and challenges). 

Overall it probably has around 10 - 20 hours of content for co-op and once the above parts are implemented, i'd say another good 20 + hours. 

Multiplayer is quite smooth and it does feel complete when you first try it. Would give it a go and then watch the space once you get over all the sandbox content.

A very good game to play. I am enjoying it a lot.
Although quite tricky at times to the point of making you think twice on what to do first... Just die or fight to survive your insanity! 

I have already recommended it to 7 people and they all love it too...
Although multiplayer doesn't allow for more than 4 people on a team so we all can't play at once, but we are managing for now. Hopefully you can make it an 8 man team in future updates... that would be nice.

Green Hell is about exploration and learning things, sometimes by trial and error and sometimes by a BIG error, but the joy of Green Hell is how much you learn from each death, moving forward and how you build on those failures. Part of the difficulty is because you can’t save your game until you build a shelter.

Survival means having to monitor many factors above and beyond the typical hydration and hunger. You have to monitor your macro elements (proteins, fats, carbohydrates), energy level, health and sanity. You can be poisoned by venom, food poisoning, and many other environmental factors. All of these types of factors have a negative effect on your sanity. Loss of Sanity will cause the player to hallucinate and start hearing his inner voice, often yelling demotivating criticism and insults. This happens at around 50% sanity. Try to keep your sanity up because it will make your life a nightmare if it goes down too much.

95,Green Hell,68671151,english,"THIS IS SO GOOD I JUST CAN’T. Seriously, I got a friend who's also a big survival game freak like me, and for so long have we searched far and wide in the abyss of the Internets for a game that really suited our expectations, which can be summed up as simply as; immersiveness, and beautiful scenery. That’s literally it. And Green Hell serves it all. 

So in a random order I just made up because why not; 

Skill development. I want it to be there, but I’m not the type to ask for a really complex tree where you have to strategize with your attribute points and all that fuss. Green Hell has a beautifully simple and effective way and I absolutely love it. You just get better at what you do. That’s it. It goes slow, but that’s good for me. It’s useful, realistic, and easy, and the development speed is at a good pace for my taste, which is on the slowish side.

Hunting. First of all, that music that starts playing when you throw a spear and land it on an animal but it doesn’t kill it and it starts running away and you run after it and it’s just going right and left in the busy undergrowth OH THE THRILL OF IT. Sometimes I can’t find them and I lose a spear as well as precious meat but hey that’s all a part of the hunt. Thanks to the skill system you can’t just pull up a bow and some arrows and start bringing mass extinction on your second day in the jungle. Good balance, fun pursuit, and rich rewards when successful. Another hardship which I found myself masochistically enjoy is that the fish in a lake won’t be just circling around in a predestined path, they actually move around, and sometimes they have a spot where they gather up but the next day you go there and you find them way on the other side just swimming around doing fishy business. Neat. 

I’ll give a good immersiveness badge on environmental variety because the jungle does look beautiful, but I feel like there could be more. This is not a complaint, I’m fine with it as it is. Maybe a couple of more tree species and definitely some more animal species can be added. For example so far we only came across one species of snake. Should definitely be more snakes. Never enough snakes. 

Weather. This is gonna be a gold star for trying. But I do remind myself and anyone reading this is that this is still an early access game. Just that right now the rain comes and goes as if with a switch but hey, early access, not our first rodeo. Mostly though it’s that the rain drops are almost invisible so it’s sometimes hard to tell if it’s raining or not. 

Food and other needs. This one makes me really happy so throwing another good immersiveness badge here I mean looks like there’s more where they come from sheesh am I loving this game or what. Well I find all the survival mechanics in this game feel so natural and smooth. Green Hell has a simple and efficient and real enough system with fat, protein, carbs, and water needs. Sleep is also really well done I think, in fact it works so good that after one point my friends and I (who are playing on coop sandbox survival mode on Welcome to the Jungle difficulty) realized our eating/sleeping cycles have become like real life. You need that wholesome breakfast in the morning if you want it to be a good day. And a good afternoon nap is always useful. I mean, how much more real can that get? I do wish though there was more realism to the needs like poopin. Yes pooping yes I said I want to poop in my video game yoU KNOW WHAT YES I’M THAT GUY. When you think about it pooping is actually a big part of our everyday survival (Tried not pooping for a few days? That sh*t can kill you.) Plus you can use it for fun activities like throwing it on your friend’s face. No? Never done a poop fight? Live a little. Also on this topic I want to say the treatment of wounds and infections is just beautiful but I’ll let you discover all that for yourselves. The game doesn’t give you a helping hand in everything either. You have to learn what the healing herbs and useful ingredients are and look like, they won’t be shining up for you or even have their names written of top of them. Once you discover something it’ll be added to your notebook but the fact is, you’re not running around looking at pictures of herbs in your notebook, you have to remember them. Otherwise you just pass by so many blessings of the jungle. Wow look at me, that banisteriopsis vine must be kicking in, making me one with nature and all that, namsayin?

Crafting. One random thing I like: when you “craft” something, your character goes on to pretend like he’s doing something with his hands and ayy so cute I love that. It’s a very basic animation where it looks like he’s just learning to dance to disco music and is very confused about it but still kudos for trying. The craft system is a lot like the one in The Forest, with a little difference here and there but certainly all a success for me and my likeminded friends. I like that you start the game with some craft recipes in your notebook but then you add more to it as you discover stuff yourself. I like to discover. Thank you for letting us discover, Green Hell devs. Base building, so far so awesome. It looks a lot like how that one guy on youtube with the primitive technology videos does it. And I am a fan, if you couldn’t already guess that. 

Group work. This is a good one because the difficulty of the game is at such a balance that, yes you can survive on your own, but having friends just makes things so much better, unlike some other survival games where my friends and I would find ourselves not interacting with each other like not asking for help or team working, because hunting and building and gathering was so easy that everyone would end up doing their own stuff at some point. Here I find that it’s only when we deploy task distribution that we go off and do things on our own, but it’s still part of the team work. It’s incredibly fun to play with friends, I’ll say that. 

Exploration is really rewarding. My friends and I have played for 11 hours so far and the desire to go explore is strong, and every time we go out it’s always a fun time. Not just the items you find, but the whole oh sh*t we got lost, where’s the river, SNAKE!, aw nice view, omg look at that, let’s go this way, take a screenshot of me here, hunt, run, bandage, ANTHILL!, run, ooo nice spear, new craft recipe wooo!, and all that, is all really fun. I don’t know for how long it’ll keep going but it looks like it’ll make it far enough that I won’t feel like I wasted my money. 

Last point before conclusion; there needs to be a female character. YEAH YEAH PUT A CORK IN IT. All you feminism haters don’t even know what you’re hating on. Look, it’s 2020, don’t even wanna talk about it all over again, and I know that in single player the story goes around a man (much surprise) and maybe that’s not easily changeable, but at least for the coop there can be a female character that we can choose. Or even not choose, just like one does not choose to be born, or rather become, a woman, or a man, it’s okay not being able to choose your gender in game if that makes things easier for the devs. Again, I don’t know how difficult that is in terms of programming and design but, come on, worth it. 

So finally to conclud, yes it's always a labour to keep yourself healthy and leech-free, keep an eye out for the predators and crawling menaces of the jungle (respect though like that's their home turf) and just be on alert most of the time, but all this comes with really nice and immersive tools that are very helpful once you learn how to do things efficiently, and it’s just So. Much. Fun. I really recommend going into this game not having read any guides about it and just discover it all by yourselves. And stay hydrated. And wash your hands.

98,Green Hell,68332313,english,"Jumped into a 2-player co-op blind/unprepared and was absolutely blown away by the attention to little things Green Hell has to offer mechanically - and the same care extends to graphics and the music.
The game looks and feels breath-taking.

The jungle felt huge and unknown for the first almost 20 hours as we struggled to survive and set a foot in the beautiful landscape, figuring out the game mechanics as we go.
Now I know we never figured out there's armor in this game, but once we became the righteous rulers (and destructors) of the jungle, pwning what we called ""savages"" left and right (debatable who the real savages were), on the default difficulty we really needed no armor - without armor we were more exposed to the jungle - thanks to which we became the jungle.

Crafting is intuitive and there seems to be nothing stopping you from immediately crafting the best gear, provided you have the resources and know the recipe. That you can (and will) use resources you combine from the ground and your backpack is a clever and nice touch - some things just don't fit in your pockets yet you'll want to process them.

The hazards of the jungle are well exhibited - Eat the wrong toad = Die, Step on a snake = Die, Greet your not-so-friendly neighbors = Die, Walk Carelessly = Pit -> Death, Spiders & scorpions = ... You get the point.

How fast you adapt to doing safe routines and collecting everything necessary to be safe another night... Just to be on the brink of death out of thirst when waking up is all refreshing.

Building a base is nice - Green Hell offers a good selection of pieces and options of materials which you'll have to decide upon. Gathering building resources (Or any resources, for that matter) is not going to work like you'd just stuff a whole house in your pockets or backpack - but this brings me to a minor nuisance with the inventory management - unsure if by design, but I didn't seem to find an efficient way of moving a stack of items from container to container (or drop them fast without destroying them) and 20 hours in it gets a bit tedious... But I have to add I believe I'm being picky here.

I have still to play the story mode and while I fear I'll get my huge hype into the way and ruining the experience, this game would've been absolutely worth it even without the story mode.

Cheers to the developers - and for those I might have convinced to buy this game I wish you'll have a blast!
Open World Survival at its best is at your hands right here.

EDIT: Played the Story aswell in one sit. Once you're the king, you'll always be the king, it seems.

26,Green Hell,68399709,english,"*So I came to change my review from ""recommended"" to ""not"" and I'll keep my original review.

Beautifully designed environment and awesome atmosphere. But all the sounds are low quality and badly panned (or sourced idk what's the term of it ~ the distance and the animal's sound never matches. You are walking away and it's still like in your head) and I'm using $40-ish headphones only. 

Also the survival system is a bit weird, eating tons of meat but dying of a banana? (or any fruit). Drinking tons of water from a pot and 10 secs later~ oh, so thirsty. Still fun tho, I'm enjoying with customized settings: food consumption is low and all other hostile things are on. That way feel better-balanced actually, since it's literally hard to find a stone in a forest and takes too much time to gather stuff in that SMALL sized map. While you are getting hungry so quickly in normal consumption speed. Combat - easy because your are fighting with a lords of bugs. But I still keep them (you can remove if you want) it's fun to run away.
---

The map is pretty small for a sandbox and crafting is super easy and limited. You are in a circle of troubles (besides hostile attacks) leeches - worms - parasites etc. Some of them appears with an interaction and some of them randomly. It slows you down often, that way you can think the map is big actually.

+ Beautiful forest to walk around
+ Good atmosphere

- Bad ambiance
- Animal noises
- Environmental sounds
- Combat bugs
- Enemy bugs
- Co-op bugs (like: many times happened that only one of you can see the enemy. it's not the low sanity effect, it's the real enemy)

And again, animal noises are the worst, makes the game really boring when you hear those low quality mp3 sound files. 

Waste of money. 

All the scores you see 8/10 is probably a marketing.

2/10

*Well I can't make a real progress in those sandbox games within 2 hours to understand if it's worthy to keep playing or refund it.
You buy this, and you get stuck.

The game is extremely well put together, minor bugs did hinder some things but all together i was very impressed.
I think it needs to open up a bit at least for survival. The map feels like a campaign map, things are found and enemies are fought just as they would be in the story and it feels less than what a proper sandbox survival should, a different or altered version of the map should be introduced for survival to make it feel more open and interactive. As it is now there is so much potential, but survival mode is basically finding a pre-made shelter, stocking up on supplies and hoping you don't get ambushed by tribesman or running out of tobacco leaves.

34,Green Hell,68588614,english,"PRO:
I have very much enjoyed this game and of the survival simulators I've played, even the beginning mode is extremely tough. Early decisions can have a significant impact as you battle hunger and thirst. Fires need to be tended to and protected. Who would have thought, rain will put one out? It didn't in other game, whoops, this isn't other games. 

I died of parasites and unnoticed infections as well as venomous stings from spiders or string rays I failed to notice, even during late game stages. The jungle canopy is beautifully rendered along with lighting effects. I haven't even tried with predators and angry natives yet due to the overall difficulty in basic survival. I think that's a great opportunity for co-op mode.

In basic survival mode, I'm still working my way through the tech tree and finding the best uses for traps. The cooking is well advanced too with many remedies and soups to explore.

CON:
Ground animals are a little glitchy. I stabbed at spiders several times and they'd still hit while seeming far away. Similar experience with snakes and scorpions.

53,Green Hell,68559903,english,"Let's rename this game: The Boring Hell
At first you are marvelled at the sight, but then you notice,it's shallow as a pool.
It has some good things to add to the genre but not enough to stand out alone.

Let me explain: It's fun to have different bandages for different kind of ailments. Several predators or hostile animals, but they are just wandering around and only hunt you.(Saw a tribal and a panther standing next to each other, lucky me, they both spotted me.) Dead birds,sticks and nuts fall out of the sky, while I managed to pin a green coconut to the tree cause they never seem to fall. You cannot climb, jumping against a rock might get you hurt. But okay I am playing story mode, then halfway, I begin to understand the story, it changes from finding your wife to get out yourself, just for one reason that ruins the whole plot of the story. It might work in an novel or movie, but not in a build/survival game. So I tried survival, not giving up on this good looking game.

 Items might disappear if you leave your camp and I am not talking(only) about the ones you touched. The machete was placed on a boat, but had no space, so left it, came back after a hunt,literary 20 feet away, turn around and it's gone, it happened too with my steel pan I found. Some items slowly break, but some items shouldn't.

Learning curve: It seems steep but it takes you less then a hour to set up your camp and that's it, finding new items to build is the only goal you have, but all ya need is the water collector and a dryer and ya can sit and relax. No fuss, no tribals, no fun.

But you can spice it up yourself, just let the fires burn all night and if they come through your traps, you can help yourself to the other white meat, which has a very Victorian idea of cannibalism. It might see insane to eat human meat, but eating it does not make you insane(It gives a brain disease, as seen in tribes in Guinea, but that was most likely due frequently use and eating ashes of their dead. While survivors who have eaten human meat never got this disease.) But it's a nice mechanic, esp if you are bored and trust me you will get bored with this game fast.

Every wound is treated differently, and I found in some cases if you don't have the items to treat a wound it's better to leave it as is until you do or risk infection/fever/death.

+ Campaign is what you are to play. Story is interesting and you know nothing till the end)
+ In Survival (especially co-op) mode you may live many hours.

Those, who say, that this game is too hard, I want to say: it is the main pleasure, you can take from it. Everything is dangerous, everything is scary. I remember, how while campaign I decided that I am good enough, and just went to the jungles to explore it. I met the puma and killed it (yeah, I am good! - I thought) but while struggling, I steped on snake two times... No worries, I have two dressings! So I bandaged the wound, but severe fever began. I headed back to my camp... but forces were running out, so I fell on the ground passing out. After few hours I woken up dehydrated, and the worms were in my skin. When I got to the camp I started to go crazy from worms, fever and dehydration. I deleted the worms, but dressings ended and it was too late, I didn't managed to make new when hallucinations killed me. This was amazing! In green hell some consequences lead to other consequences. This is a game you are to play! Without a doubt)

P.S. *For developers* Unfortunately, after 40-50 hours the game became easy for me... I tried ""Green hell"" level of dificulty, but it changes not too much, not to mention one life only...Now I am running like chingachgook through jungles and killing 5-6 tribes like nothing. So I ask developers to revise dificulty levels to make hard levels really much harder for experienced players. What I wish it would include:
1. Much bigger distance for animals to detect you. Now it's too easy to hunt, cause wildfowl let you very close. On ""Green hell"" level hunting should be challenging and you are to steal to get near for the shot
2. To make aligators more fast, silent and dangerous. Now they are no dangerous, cause they are very slow and easy to kill
3. You should not be able to kill from one shot to the head with common arrows and spears (only with iron weapon).
4. Much Macroelements needed
5. Traps for animas have small chances to be successful.
6. bonfire should be very attractive for tribes at night (so that you will have to extinguish a fire every time).
7. Tribes and wild animals and spiders can attack while sleeping (you wake up)

Yes, when you first start it will be rocky. A lot of it boils down to trial and error, but you will shortly realize the 'can do' and 'can't do's' of this game and then you will realize the difficulty of this game ends in the first couple hours. Things like:
-Blue, Red, Green, Yellow mushrooms are all safe (Blue and Red remove parasites)
-Parasites can be ignored pretty much. Just drink dirty water, these mushrooms are EVERYWHERE.
-Bandages fix everything. Healing, poison, rashes, They're easy to make.
-In fact, any and all damage can be healed with a bandage (touch a poison frog? You don't get sick and need medicine, you just get a wound on one of your limbs you can bandage, then sleep off the poison debuff
-Bows 1 shot everything
-Food is everywhere. Fruits (like 6 kinds), nuts, all but one mushroom (don't eat the brown ones), snails, crabs, larva, maggots. These are in over abundance.
-Canned food, beef jerky, bags of nuts, and chips respawn at camps all the time and give pretty much max Protien, Fats, and Carbs. You can literally survive off of just eating the canned food and jerky from camps.
-Hear a hissing sound? Just move away, its either a snake or a spider
-I've plated 29 hours (at the time of writing this review) and I've maybe seen 20 natives (enemies)
-""Killer Traps"" guarantee you easy food on a constant basis without needing bait.
The game was fun for around 10-15 hours and it really tapered off. Crafting is lacking a bit. Everything boils down to mud huts and that's about as good as it gets. Metal stuff can be made, but stronger obsidian items can be crafted far easier. Metal stuff is really shoddy looking barely functional in appearance looking items, so don't expect anything fancy like a gun or helmets.

Overall you will spend the majority of your time making mud, farming sticks, and cooking meat. There's not much else to do.

Yes this game is hard. Guess what, it is exactly what all the other “survival” games should actually be like! If you’re looking for an easy game pass on by because life outside of your bedroom is hard, brutal and wonderfully beautiful. That is if you can survive long enough to enjoy it of course.Just like life survival is about experiences and building upon those experiences, don’t take the shortcuts you’ll be missing out.

It is definitely more difficult and realistic than the Forest in comparison. The sanity mechanic is pretty cool but it is very hard to get your sanity back up once it's down. The noises/voices can get a bit annoying after a while. Love Co-op mode (4-players) - would love to have at least 8 players though! This game is really hard at the beginning - highly recommend doing some of the story mode before going straight to Co-Op as story mode will give you a bit of a tutorial. If you like the forest and other survival games, check this one out. There's no PvP and the studio has said they never plan to add that so don't expect PvP.

6,Green Hell,68468925,english,"GH is a decent survival game; if you've played The Long Dark and liked it, it's likely you'll enjoy  Green Hell.

That said, you should know that the developers have decided to give the player a piddling 4 save slots, and tied the player's ability to save the game to building a shelter, which does in fact take time you may not have. If you're like me, and you often need to save and leave a game for an extended period of time, and you don't want to leave the game running, you're out of luck; you'll need to shut down and lose any progress you've made.  When I complained about this on the Steam forums, the fanbois had the gall to tell me to ""plan ahead to save the game"", which of course is ludicrous. Plan ahead to have enough food to not die of starvation in-game, plan ahead to be somewhere safe for a night's sleep, yes. Plan ahead to save the game?? 

So in summation, while Green Hell is probably a fairly decent wilderness survival game, the community is not welcoming of people with complaints about the game and the developers don't value your time or your investment in their game, The game itself is challenging enough without making the player jump through hoops to save the game when they need to.

18,Green Hell,68443235,english,"Bought it last night...played for 4 hours straight and am about to hop back on. I'm not sure I've been as tense playing a game in my entire life. The world is absolutely breathtaking. The way they've designed the map...it envelopes you. If they ever decide to develop it for VR...I'm not sure I could handle it. My first 20 minutes in I'm nervous as hell, crouched behind some bushes on the side of a river bank because I hear what sounds like foot steps sloshing toward me. Blood-thirsty cannibals? Drug-crazed narcos? Some sort of tropical chupacabra? NOPE. Just a cute, fat capybara. 

My first try through. I went insane and eventually succumbed to self-inflicted wounds caused by digging parasites out of my skin and worms eating through my stomach, because I decided that drinking the dirty water from the stream was a better alternative to dying of dehydration in a RAIN forest hahaha. 

 My second try through I figured out how to catch rain in a coconut shell, built a small little camp in a cave, spent an evening trying different combinations on the crafting bench until I sussed out how to make a bow and arrows (an aspect that I love, btw--being able to use logic to try and guess recipes before they are handfed to you--and then while stupidly and overconfidently running through a section I'd been to 30 times, I got bit by a snake and died slowly, trying to find something to treat it. It was awesome.

I think one thing that I noticed that is very cool...I walk more than I run in this game...which never is the case in any other game. The world is dangerous and moving too hastily can be the end of you. However, it doesn't make it boring. The way they've designed the world and all of its ambiance makes it work. It's tense, it's unforgiving, and it craps on you the second you show any signs of confidence. I love it. 

The only bad thing I have to say is the voice acting/script for the single player campaign is...well it's god awful. It feels like the devs paid two people on fiverr to just read off words they had written down, exactly as they were written. It makes the whole thing very odd and kinda of takes away from the seriousness of the actual gameplay.

Bottom line: Great game, absolutely worth the price.

Graphics are fantastic, the story is interesting, game mechanics are solid with little frustration.

The game is definitely challenging, with enough tutorial to give you the basics but leaves you a lot to learn on your own. My only qualm with the game is the ending. Due to not revealing any spoilers all I will say is that there could have been more dialogue indicating you would end the game and might need to do more exploring or accept the conditions you have currently achieved. Not a big deal, as long as you save often you can redo anything.

The game seems to cover all aspects of solo and PvE play. I have not tried multiplayer but I hope they continue to develop this game to the point that you can do PvP and try to survive in a game against nature, tribes, and other players. A Deathmatch mode would also be awesome. Even further but more likely, a dedicated server system that would allow maybe 25 players to to have compete against each other and form their own ""tribes""

It's fun, for a few hours. Once you get the hang of how to do things you start to realise there is nothing more to it, an endless grind for building up a base without purpose. You're hungry, you eat, you're tired, you sleep. You die a few times a first in order to construct ways to obtain water and food, most likely fish. You set up a campfire and start cooking food, after a good run you max out all four stats you need to survive and stop to think: Now what?

Another negative is when out exploring with friends a tribe of natives can rush out and attack you, and only you: Your friends won't see them on their screen until you kill them.  This game has so so so much good stuff, but if you look deep enough you realise it's very barebones and no real point to anything. You are supposed to survive as long as possible but 1 hour or 1 month, nothing new happends. If you're looking for something like rust this is not for you, no other players but your premade ones, same Co-Op system as State of Decay 2 meaning whoever host the session is the owner, without him/her you can not continue on that specific base/group.

Also, the crafting book, I don't really like how you have to discover things to build them, I understand the idea of it, but that's just my opinion on it. I wish we were able to craft some more things, without having to discover them if that makes sense.

-Unresponsive controls and overly complex inventory

-Collected resources disappear (glitch out) when trying to build/craft 
-""Insanity"" sets in too fast

The multiplayer system offers a better chance since you are not alone, even though it has its fair share of game play and performance problems. The single player story however is totally unplayable in the current state. It feels ""unfinished"" and maybe it is so seeing how today's games are all about the multiplayer aspect, only.

Hopefully these issues will be fixed soon enough because this game and what it can really offer is very promising. The environment is absolutely stunning, perhaps even setting new standards in map/level design but the rest is just an uneven race against time, though attempting to simulate the reality of panic in a jungle, it is done in a very poor and rushed way. The game is designed to kill the player in 1-2 days max and not provide a progressive challenge where you can combine logic with fun game play and feel the accomplishment. At this current state, unfortunately, I cannot recommend this game. I will be looking forward to updates.

66,Green Hell,68368060,english,"I would like preface this review by stating that I haven't played through the story mode, however my review is here to ward off people seeking an engaging multiplayer experience.

On paper, Green Hell produces a vivid image of an enticing and aesthetically beautiful, horror/survival experience. However this game, in its multiplayer state, could not be further from that. I had been eyeing off this game for numerous weeks after coming from the likes of Rust and The Forest. Rust, although more expensive, provides enticing and engaging game play that feels smooth, responsive and rewarding. The Forest, a smaller and cheaper indie game, also provides this level of engagement, however it also provides a goal (in the form of a story mode) in multiplayer servers of up to 8 people. 

Green Hell is a bit of a mess in its current multiplayer state. After reading numerous reviews, I came into this game expecting a challenging yet rewarding experience. I was not met with that. Let me walk you through my experience. It took me and my party of 2 a total of 1 DEATH to figure out this entire game. 1 death. not 4, not 8. 1 death and half an in game day. On the highest difficulty at that. After one of us died to infection after drinking dirty water and picking a fight with 2 tribesman (who both bugged out SEVERELY), we stumbled upon a tiny shack-like fishing outpost, that supplied us with beds, axes and cover from rain. After taking all of 3 minutes to figure out how to craft a fire, some shelter for said fire and a spear, before the nights end our whole party had the entire game figured out. Where to get all three types of nutrients (carbs, fats, protein) and a constant clean water supply, enough bandages to last until kingdom come and, enough food to end world hunger, obsidian spears and bows with arrows. 

Not to mention the connections were terrible on the server between 3 people that live 5 minutes away from each other (one of my mates is even living in my house with me). My party was constantly lagging around the map, as were tribesman, animals and resources. My connection is fast and wired via ethernet. 

And that was it. That is the problem with with the multiplayer IN ITS CURRENT STATE (im sure the experience will improve with the introduction of story mode in MP). That's the whole game. 4 hours is all it took to beat the game.

so, in conclusion, ANYBODY LOOKING TO BUY THIS GAME AS A FUN AND ENGAGING MULTIPLAYER EXPERIENCE, PLEASE LOOK ELSEWHERE FOR THE MEANTIME, THIS IS NOT THE GAME FOR YOU.",1588343014,1588343014,FALSE,6,2,0.542163253,1,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,43,2,403,0,239,1594888894,,

70,Green Hell,55048064,english,"The thing about Green Hell, is that it fills a giant hole in the survival genre. In the last few years we've seen a miriad of survival games come up on steam, fueled by the apparent appetite for building/survival games that became obvious through the countless free-to-play mobile games dedicated to the genre. The problem is that, on the PC ecosystem, developers always seemed to think that survival/building mechanics by itself wouldn't be enough to set them apart from competition, so they always came with a twist to the gameplay. Either focusing too much on building and nothing in construction, or too much on survival and with little to build. Massive place-holders for your constructions - like Space Engineers. Dedicate your life or start over every day - like Rust. Ultra-grind like Conan Exiles. Dabling into super-natural horror like The Forest. Going unfinished for years on early access - like The Long Dark. Others are just so easy that in 2 hours you figured out how to do everything. Others so incomplete that you lack either parts, blocks, working mechanics to be able to go all in. Some with crappy dishonest developers, like Ark. 
I played many of them. But for all I've played i couldn't find one that would get the fundamentals right. Strip them all down to the basics, the building and survival mechanics, and  all of them were flawed one way or the other. 
Now, Green Hell. For starters, it comes with a launch price of 20 euros, lower than most of it's competition. And then it offers a really fine tuned survival mechanic, together with a great building system. Both well balanced with the amount of resources at your disposal. 
There's a small tutorial explaining how you ended up alone in a tropical island and showing you the very basics of building and surviving, and then you start. There are no monsters , no super-natural anything. You can choose either Story mode or Survival. And you can choose from 5 different difficulty levels, acurately explained in the description. As someone used to survival games, I went ahead for a level above normal. There's just the jungle and the dangers that you would realistically have to face. Leaches, Spiders, snakes, worms, big cats, bees, ants, and all can be dangerous to your health. Health you need to manage, and there's a great number of conditions you can suffer from. It's not just about eating to fill a bar. You need to have a balanced diet over time or you'll suffer the degradation of your condition. Water, proteines, fibers,vitamines, all are needed. So you'll need to find different types of food in a dangerous jungle. You'll need to make tools, not just to hunt, gather food and resources, but also to rest on. Sleeping on the floor will quickly get you filled with skin worms and leaches. Untreated, they can origin infection, fever and death. You'll need fire to cook, boil water, escape cold and keep your sanity at night. But fire draws unwanted attention from the local tribsmen.  Eventually you'll need to build walls to defend yourself and store stuff. The loop is good and very well balanced. In survival, it's you against yourself and your own mistakes while striving to survive and get better conditions. You can take your time and avoid the tribesmen. On story mode, you'll be forced to risk yourself to advance.  
All in all, it's a no bull***t survival game, with a realistic setting, harder than most, with amazing graphics and great survival/building mechanics.

23,Green Hell,44626808,english,"There are weird game design choices. Worst of them are timescale and healts design.

Time pass very fast as for such game with lots stuff to do. It is 1 minute in game = 2 seconds in RL.

Sandbox mode on normal nutrition dificulty.
I spent in game time constantly managing my damn character that is just dying from lack of food in only hew hours. 1 day without food makes character HP go way down like instead of 1 day he would starve for 1 month. I must feed him all the time! I have no time to explore, read notes ETC!
Sollution for this is reducing nutrition needs to lower level. Then it is manageable and does not overwhelming. It is close to real life this way! So ""normal"" seems like hard mode!

I can drink in game full pot of water that in real life is about 3L and he is not hydrated enough. Drinking coconut water gives only half of hydration compared to what this pot have. Coconut in real life have about 1L of water but character in game gets only 15 hydration points. Drinking full pot of water (about 3L!) gives him only 50% of needed hydration! Even on hotest days on earth human cannot intake such ammount of water at once. And if he drinks 1L it should last for few hours.

HP seems to be combination of fats, carbs and protein... This is so dumb design :/
I had never seen dumber survival game in my life in terms of food needs.
No time to think in this dumb game because of sick timescale.

This game is not bad but some weird design choices ruins immersion and fun aspect. After few attempts and patience to learn it may be fun to play.

I wait for mods ability then things like timescale could be changed and maybe aspect of hunger reduced to not hit HP so much. 

Also AI for animals and humans must be fixed. AI animation are not that great too. They accelerate from 0 to max speed in unnatural way.

Game have also good elements. 
For example.
Body investigation.
Inventory mechanics are awesome. One of the best I ever experienced not only in survival games!
Character movement speed.
Weapon useability.
Character skill learning progression.

35,Green Hell,68262936,english,"So I want to give it a five star, but there a few things that makes me hold onto that 5th star. 
The story mode is great. A friend of mine was really surprised when they finally added it to the game as it never had it in the beginning. It's one of those games where you start questioning yourself what the hell is really happening? Is a person alive? Is the rainforest is messing with your head (in-game)? Everything you do has consequences to your health. It's really cool I like it for what it is. 

Now the multiplayer is what made me hold back the 5th star. 
Reason behind that is because it gets repetitive. It's extremely hilarious at first with your friends. Those who get insane and start fighting tribes you cannot see or just simply getting told you are worthless by a voice. Thank you poisonous frog! It's hilarious. You have to take account for dry and wet seasons. Prepare for them for your survival. Making traps, weapons, food, houses, etc. It's fun in the beginning doing these activities, but after a days into your realm you just find yourself doing nothing anymore. You just wake up grind the house, make food, make clean water, hunt, and go back to sleep. Exploring is cool, but there is only so much you can explore until it just all looks the same. 

Worth it? 
Yes. The single player will have you investing your time. Especially during quarantine. Multiplayer is fun, but it will get repetitive. Luckily you can start with different settings and stuff like that so you can customize the world. Start single player then multiplayer. 

What I wish could be better? 

When it comes to multiplayer there are a couple bugs. It says that the host has disconnected and you lose all your items. You then have to restart your application and tell your friend to invite you once again. You wake up and you spawn at the first spawn point of the game. Sometimes it throws you into an empty world and you have to exit the game and restart it once again. 

I wish the multiplayer had more of a purpose than just survival. The concept of green hell is intense, amazing, and fun, until it's not. Maybe side quests, co-op story mode, find help, get rescued, rescue someone, etc. Just some ideas because the co-op does get boring eventually.

I bought this game for multiplayer and I thought it was pretty interesting. However there are major desync issues with multiplayer. At first my friend and I just thought this was the sanity mechanic. If you are looking at your crafting journal when enemies attack, you will not be able to see or interact with the enemies. This will leave your partner to fight enemies alone, sometimes 3 v 1 while you just stand there watching him swing at air. The desynced enemies will not despawn unless you either kill them, or exit and reload the game.

This will be problematic if they attack your camp and only one of you can see them. For example, I was killed while my partner couldn't interact...I respawned at a different camp with no weapons, and had to attempt a 3 v 1 with only my fists to get back to my partner. He could not offer help beacuse, the enemies were desynced for him.

The bad: This game is no joke. It's HARD, especially when you have no idea how to craft or construct the items you'll need.

Could benefit from support for people not used to the genre, perhaps more than the tutorial/intro offers.

The good: Story is trippy in a good way, and visuals are stunning. Genuinely feels like a sprawling open world with plenty of variety.

Not a lot things to craft. Kinda like it due to real human capacity of crafting. Game is putting a lot of pressure on being as real as possible. No weird laser guns that could be done by hand, no weird ghosts spawning everywhere.

Very well though system of eating - getting sick from dirt. I wanted to play a game in which impossible would be to speed run through entire map. This one sometimes allow it because as in real jungle there is a slight change not to meet any danger at all. Fight with tribe warriors done well. An arrow to head and guy dies which is fair to me. Sometimes enemies are bleeding out as well.

Cannot really find faults in that game. One that could be is you explore very quickly all of the flora there is. Limited animals, birds are giving only one red coloured feathers although it is Toucan with black one. Skins of animals were completely omitted and not implemented. 

Map is big, I was thinking I had it all but I did not. And it kept surprising me.

I wish there could be a few changes done where the villagers had a difficulty setting, instead of turning them off all together. My group and I had issues with the custom multiplayer setting as well.

1. Wall torch features to hang around.
2. For storage box max quantity, best to use item quantity instead of area of the item
3. Make a bamboo stands as well
4. Easy shortcut for keys such as harvesting, crafting, etc etc
5. For crafting, able to do more than one crafting at a time. Such a nuisance if you have 10 leaves, and need to one by one to make into bandages. 
6. Able to clear off dead logs on the ground which is a nuisance that we need to jump over or walk around just to walk over it.
There are still got a lot bugs we found during CO-OP, such as
1, some of us can't see incoming hostile, and only pops out when they're dead. 
2. Mud mixer can't work after few times of using. 
3. Items went missing inside our storage box

Unfortunately, I cannot. 
I stream games for fun on twitch, and for the life of me I can't play the game to it's full potential without a dedicated streaming PC for the sole issue of a RIDICULOUS GPU leak (or at least that's what I assume it is) where No matter what settings I run, the game hogs 100% of my GPU (RTX 2070) This would not be an issue as even when this circumstance arises my systems cooling can handle it, but the reason it is unplayable is because with the improved stability and quality of NVENC, that is now my go to encoder. When streaming green hell, even on its lowest settings in widowed mode, the game is still hogging more than 90% of my GPU, which leaves no space for encoding, causing lots of dropped frames. This is not an issue with any other game, other than games having a similar issue of using all of your system resources. 

PLEASE DEVELOPERS. This is a serious issue.

Disappearing loot, storage not working, placed items lagging up walls, and the worst of it is lost save files. I was playing with 3 other people last night and somehow the game files didn't take the save we all did before logging, I can only load a previous save file. We had to turn sanity off, not because we didn't like the idea, but because developers thought it was a good idea to make it so when your character is low on sanity stuff attacks and kills you that isn't there and really loud voices CONSTANTLY berate you. It would have been a better idea to make this happen when you eat a bad shroom or dirty water or get a fever, but no. Sleep is borked too, get ready to play sleep simulator. You have to sleep like 5 times a day and it will only let the meter fill up so much before auto waking you up. I would rather have a sleep screen for 10 minutes and be able to stay up an entire game day tbh, but I am constantly tired and passing out. it's either this, or turning off sleep completely, which would make beds irrelevent except for saving (which the game doesn't seem to do right anyway). Simple tasks like filling a bowl of water for soup or to fill another container is unneccesarily difficult. You cant put filled containers in your inventory, and you can only pick up items when your ui is open and blocking half your screen, couple this with the fact that you cant turn your camera or move around much at all while your carrying something. So basically, you walk backwards a lot, get stuck on walls, and trip all over the place just trying to carry 1 small bowl to the fire for crafting. With 4 people playing, and because 1 soup doesn't really fill you up (more like 3-4) and because even if you find a large pot and make soup it still only counts as one when it obviously should be able to be used for at least a few times, I am constantly having to deal with this borky and shoddy system. If these simple things were fixed, the game itself would be more fun to play, but right now if you want to buy this game, especially for multiplayer lovers, probably stay away and play the forest instead until the developers take this seriously enough.

Take on the natives … die.  Build awesome base,  natives destroy it … I kill them … bloody tiger.  And that was on easy mode.

At first, you don’t now the UI, what you can craft and what you foods and bandages you need.  As you play, you learn.  I suppose that is the fun part.  But as you know what weapons to use, how to target natives and how to dodge, the game becomes easy.
I just finished story mode on hardcore, only 2 snake bites and healed myself.   Went looking for natives … not much of a challenge.  Visited all camps, got all blueprints.  Never starved, never had issue with insanity.  Just too easy.

TIP.  Do not watch streams or read posts on how to things work.  The fun part is figuring it out and immersing yourself in the game.  Once you get through that, you build massive base … okay, that was fun.  Then the game wears off as there is no challenge.

0,Green Hell,67991191,english,"I've always loved adventure/survival type games so when my buddies told me to look into this game I pretty much bought it without a second thought. We jumped right into multiplayer survival on the hardest difficulty and needless to say we died so many times our sanity made it impossible to play. That didn't discourage us though, two of us went and did the start of the solo story mode in hope for a tutorial, but sadly all we found was a short little 5 minute into that only showed us one or two things. The game is definitely one of the hardest survival games I've played seeing how unless you looking things up, you have to teach yourself virtually everything (and a lot of the times you learn by dying repetitively). The first day isn't for lollygagging and looking around either because your nutrient consumption will kill you before you can even figure out how to replenish them enough, and that's even before we talk about all the different hazards and things you'll have to deal with on the side. The learning curve at the beginning is pretty rough but once you learn the basics it gets easier.

5,Green Hell,67983594,english,"Green Hell is a great survival game. When I say survival I don't mean fighting hordes of zombies or fending off against dinosaurs and taming them, I mean actually survival against the harsh environment around you. This game is time consuming and very interesting to play at every bit. Don't listen to those kids talking about their friend dying to ""invisible"" natives that are ""glitched"" cause they're probably newer than me and don't understand how to maintain their sanity levels or the consequence. I do wish they added more harmful insects and made it so snake roam rather than have them set to be a kind of natural trap. Many were against my idea, but I think they should add another creature that is much like the leeches much like; Mosquitoes, and Ticks and spiders that crawl onto your skin (All for a much harder/harsher experience) I like the natives, but near their tribe areas should have native traps that can damage players, like a hole with spikes covered in leaves (Palm or Banana). Also bats should be added to caves with a higher chance of animal droppings being found inside the caves. Centipedes should also be added just for more venomous critters. As for predators I like the Jaguar and Caiman and Piranhas, but they should add animals that can steal your resources much like monkeys that can take food you have laying out like fruits if you don't store them, giving the storage box more purpose than just to store things for inventory space. Also i believe there needs to be more toxic plants and some plants that can give you rashes; Rafflesia (toxic) and Urtica dioica (Gives you skin rashes). When your sanity is very low you should hallucinate more than just Natives as well, with maybe some predators or having ants on you. As for foundations you should be able to create a bamboo water pipe, which will allow you to get more water than the water collector and open coconut shell farming. Also for when harvesting trees some should be rotten and have a change of having carpenter ants, or termites in it giving your character even more skin issues to deal with. Also some big trees should allow you to collect sap from it which shares a similar effect to honey. As for the atmosphere everything feels right except I believe there should be something added to give off a more humid feeling, but what we have now works great as is.I would want there to be a PvP option for multiplayer so players will have to deal with more than just PvE making it more challenging. I love this game and rate it 9/10 even though there is some bugs; spawning inside map at times, being able to carry infinite amount of things when laying them down on your crafting table, and inventory breaking at times when you try to apply armor or crafting things.

40,Green Hell,67779736,english,"This game may be worth playing if you modify the difficulty to LOW nutrient depletion, otherwise you are in for a game that feels more like a punishment.

Story (8/10):
- The story of this game is surprisingly good, well fleshed out, mysterious and full of twists that give you goosebumps. However, the ending is absolutely horrific with your typical BS cliffhanger. I'm tired of writers that do this.

Sound (7/10):
- Soundtrack itself is pretty good, but ambient sound isn't particularly good which is important for a game like this. Sound such as one from a waterfall can be abhorrently loud 1 second and then when you step a foot away, it goes completely silent. Animal sounds are incredibly mediocre as well. They tend to emanate from them once in a while.

Game-play (3/10):
- Awful. Even if you have played survival games before and if you play this on on Normal difficulty, prepare for absolute tedium and frustration. This is not a realistic survival game, this is an annoying survival game. You get hungry, thirsty and tired for what seems like every 5 to 10 minutes. You can't walk 20 feet in the jungle without getting bitten, stung, and all of the above. And since the resources in the world are RNG, you better hope you got lucky and you'll find what you need to make medicine (prepare to do research here) and bandages. And speaking of that, when it comes to crafting, have fun experiencing the most unintuitive controls ever. I feel bad for console players when this gets released on those platforms (controller controls for PC are horrendous). This is not a fun game, and the story is the only thing that pushed me through.
- Good luck trying to place structures to build because most of the time the game won't let you even if the ground isn't that much on a slant
- Also, how convenient that every time I pull out my lit torch or light a fire it starts to rain

Graphics (7/10):
- Graphics aren't as great as people claim. The only thing really impressive was the moonlight at night, and the high resolution ground textures (best I've seen). Pretty good for a small game studio though.
- Animations look terrible. If you have something in your hand like a tool, when you run, the tool is completely stagnant. It doesn't look realistic.

Optimization (1/10):
- Absolutely terrible. With an i7 7700 and a GTX 1080, my frames fluctuated from 40-120 on max settings at 1080p. The problem is the inconsistency. One area you may get high frames, another part, really low. Last night, I saved my game in an area, taking note of the frame rate looking in one direction (110). Next day, I load that very save, look in the same direction and my frame rate is now 90. What the hell? From the research I've done, this game seems to perform worse on higher end cards.

(spoilers ahead)


My feedback to the devs would be that beyond finding the most basic gear; there's really nothing to bother working for, why would i put the effort to make metal gear when i can get by just fine with bone axes and make obsidian as i come across it? I just beat the game on GreenHell mode yesterday, relying on nothing but gear i was able to hand make on the run from location to location.

For example, killing a challenging enemy like a jaguar has little to no rewards. compared to killing something passive and easy like an armidillo early game which is really helpful. 
The most deadly challenge in the story-line for me is avoiding snake bites early on before i have had the chance to stock up on remedies. 
I think it would be way more exciting if there were battles with the native tribes at certain times in the story, like if there were a group of them who ambush you at lambda-2 or the final locations. I beat the whole game on the hardest mode without ever killing a tribesman.

My problem with the game is that it plays too much like The Forest, where you have to interact in kinda of really specific ways with the environment, but you don't know the recipes. Combine that with the fact that everything is trying to kill you (which I fully expected from a title like Green Hell) and you get a lot more frustration than fun. You essentially brave the jungles of the Amazon as a couch potato with 0 survival skills and most things aren't intuitive. Like your first bed... better not get banana leaves instead of palm, otherwise that last bit of strength you have left will go to waste and you wake up from passing out with your new friends, worms.

Water gathering is the dumbest thing in the game and of course you need a lot when you are sweating your buns off trekking around the amazonian jungle. You can't make any bowls, so you can't boil water until you find a metal one. Until then have fun finding coconuts and placing them in the rain. The tools and weapons never feel like they connect properly either, you are always left asking, did I actually do what I wanted?

On a personal note, why in the F do the devs write in the storyline about needing gasoline, make a POI that has drums of it lying around, but then I can't get any... get outta here with that garbage.

Now im old and i cant handle it anymore.   When i play games like Green Hell, i will never even try any difficulty level harder than the default.  If default is still too tough for me,  i will try at an easier level.  What im getting at is im not after a super challenge, i want to win whatever it is i'm playing.   Real life is challenging enough, im playing games to have fun.

Well Green Hell is one of those games where default was too tough for me to enjoy.  Thankfully they have added difficulty selections and the game is now very enjoyable for me.

The game is one of the easiest ive played to become fully emerged in the environment.  They created made a very captivating world.  Its beautiful.  There are still a few quirks here and there but the devs seem to be very actively resolving issues.  They may not be taken care of in the order some may wish, but they are active and the game is improving.  This is not the case with many games at the same place in development so i feel it should be recognized.  

My biggest problem with default mode is the pace is too fast for me to enjoy the scenery.  I wanted to be able to slowly explore for a day without feeling hurried.  

I would have given the game a good review even without the addition of difficulty settings.  I hope they give even more game options to use to customize to individual play style, Maybe length of day/season settings.  Things along those lines.

Anyway, great game, one of the best in the genre.

Maybe it was the writing, or maybe just a sign of the times with this whole COVID scare, but the story mode really hit me close to home making me stop and think about those close to me and what I might do to hold on to/get back to them.

If you are looking for something casual, probably this is not the game for you, because it is far from casual. 
You have to adjust your diet, look out for predators and tribals and you do all this while trying navigate in the jungle with a map and compass. You can't see where you are on the map, so you always look for landmarks, rivers, mountains and etc. If you don't plan what you will do carefully, things can go south very easily. Just as an example; At one point, I was returning to my base from an expedition, all was okay, I still had an hour of sun, enough water and food with me, and my stamina was okay. Somehow I lost track, and could't find the way back to my base. It got dark, I panicked and got more lost. I was running left and right to find a familiar landscape, heard to sound of the rattle snake, but could not react fast enough and got bitten. I had anti poisonous bandages, patched up but the struggle drained my stamina. Just as I gave up and wanted to sleep, a tiger attacked me, I had a chance to take him out but missed with the arrow.

Everyone knows that you buy an expensive game on Steam and need to try it quickly and in less than 2 hours, and for this game, in particular, 2 hours is nothing.

So, my advice for this game is:
* Play the tutorial part first, and try to be a professional survival, I'm sure you will enjoy it.
* Adapt to the game, it's a game, it's not real life some things don't make any sense.
*Take a look at the guide game section to improve your knowledge.

On top of it being more buggy the player models and animations (not the natives, the co-op ones) are shockingly mediocre, like someone bought cheap a premade model and barebones animations off a store and stuck them in. You can definitely see this was added hastily at a later point as a new feature. Considering the forest did the same they did it much better, Hopefully this improves, it's a huge outlier compared to how lovely the rest of the game looks and feels.

There's currently a really frustrating (known and acknowledged) bug where myself or my buddy will see a native while the other can't, its a solo battle where the other person can't even stab the air and damage them as far as we can tell. Very immersion breaking.

Besides all of this you can see I give it a positive review, because this game is still a ton of fun and extremely immersive.

4/10

I like the idea behind this game, don't get me wrong. 
BUT. You die every 10 min from something different, 
or the same. Walk 10 ft. Die.
Here's my story.

I spawned in the world with 1 other friend. We spawned 
sort of close, so it didn't take us long to find each other. 
During this time, picking up resources and crafting tools. 
OH WAIT! You have leaches all over you. Now you have 
to spend time pulling them all off. Not bad right. OK. 
Once we found each other, we started our search for a 
place to build a fire and some shelter. Before we even 
found a place, we each had died like 3-4 times from 
starvation, thirst, snake bites, rashes, worms, etc. 
FINALLY we found a place to build, right next to a dock 
with some shelter and sleeping bags. GREAT!  Time to 
make a fire. 10 MINS later, after finding a bunch of wood 
and a birds nest (random), and after dying again, we got 
our fire going. During that time we found a coconut and 
some rope and made a canteen. Started boiling water, 
so we can stop dying. You have to boil water like 8-10 
times to fill your thirst meter up. So by the time i was 
done drinking water, i needed to eat. So while i was 
searching for food, I died yet another time from a snake 
bite. Finally I found a fish trap in the river that already 
had caught a fish, and cooked it. By the time I ate i 
needed to drink again. By the time i was done drinking 
i needed to eat again. See where I'm going with this?? 
AND this was STILL happening after we started a 
different game and turned all of the settings down. We 
couldn't even get the most basic shelter built before i 
was rage quitting. 

How can you play the game if you are eating and 
drinking the whole time STARING AT THE CAMPFIRE!!
Lol

What i DO like about the game...
Graphic Visuals are stunning!
The Learning how to survive aspect - by doing
Different from any other survival game
Controls are easy",1587180949,1587385325,FALSE,3,0,0.521739125,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,309,26,315,0,315,1587167300,,
89,Green Hell,67680596,english,"Here's what i hate.
1. Lag. Sometimes the game freezes for a couple seconds every time there's a notice or update.
2. Hand limitations. Can't pick up materials while certain items are in hand.
3. Physical Conditions. I get the devs want to go for a more ""realistic"" approach by giving conditions like sanity and injuries. But specific conditions like food poisoning, rashes, worms, etc? And each of these conditions have different cures. Worst of all, the proper cure to these conditions are scarce. You will die and accumulate more conditions before even finding a cure for one in the first place.
4. Losing items. Are you kidding me? Even after making it so easy to gradually lose health over nothing, You will lose some items in your inventory when you pick them up at the previous location of death. You will lose food. cures for conditions. Lose your tools.
5. Picking up inventory. The Forest lets you pick up a bag of all your items after your death. This game? IT CLEARLY SHOWS YOU HAVE A BAG. But you have to pick all of the items on the floor ONE BY ONE.
6. Invisible enemies. i understand the whole ""hallucination"" thing the devs want to implement. But enemies that your co-op partner cannot see? And they even do damage. And they come in numbers of 3 to 6. And can you still call them ""hallucinations"" when your partner can suddenly see their corpses after you killed them? Do you want real enemies that do damage and everyone can see? Or do you want hallucination enemies who don't do damage and disappear once you killed them? You can't do both.
7. Restricted on-hand inventory. In this game, you can carry only one stone at a time. you can't put it in your bag, you can't pickup other things like small sticks and small stones when you're carrying a stone. You have to drop it first before doing anything else, then pick it up again.
8. Sequenced crafting. When you want to craft a structure, you place a blueprint of it on the ground and start installing it using the required materials. The problem with this game is, it forces you to install items in sequence when building it. Example : This water collector needs sticks, leaves, and ropes. You have leaves and sticks. But no rope. You can't install the leaves because you have to install the ropes first. so you DROP YOUR LEAVES and go find rope somewhere and then come back to install the ropes. Then PICKUP YOUR LEAVES again to finally install it. That is if you didn't die somewhere along the way and lose your items.
8. Almost nothing on HUD. Again, i understand the desire for realism. Lost your way? Lost your co-op partner? Lost your camp? Good luck. There's no indicator for any of these on your HUD. You have to rely on the compass and coordinates on your avatar's watch, which is a good design that i love. But when it comes to trying to find your way quickly? Trying to run away from enemies throwing stones and shooting arrows at you? You will die just because you're trying to read your watch while running and losing stamina.
9. Random spawn points. Really? Its already hard enough to build a save point and trying to stay alive while gathering materials for that save point. When you die without a save point, you will spawn at a different place. You'd be lucky if you spawned close to the campsite you're halfway done with. If you spawn far away, good luck navigating through the forest without any indicators and previous inventory.

Hopefully the devs will consider these problems in the game. But hey. I'm no professional game reviewer. Just stating my opinions on the game.

90,Green Hell,67679393,english,"played this game for coop mode.

pretty world, very punishing game, too much effort for too little reward. sequential building, unlike The Forest game.

coop mode is pretty buggy i'd say, wait for a new patch.
i can't see the enemies but my coop friend sees them. our base was ambushed by AT LEAST 10 of them. 
most of the time when you spawn the first time you cant see each other because you're spawned leagues from each other, good thing for coordinates. enemy attacks are very frequent.

i'd probably wait for another patch and will play this game in the future with my friends. for now.... i can't not keep stressed out from playing this game. The Forest is still probably easier and fun in coop than this until it's patched.

If you liked ""The Forest"", I'd call this a, decidedly, less mysterious spiritual successor. You're stuck in a rainforest/jungle instead of a traditional forest, the natives appear to be just regular natives and not strange monster-canibals, and quite frankly your biggest enemy is going to be attrition and wild-life. 

The map is quite big, has many places to explore, but doesn't feature the cool and very eerie speluncing aspects that The Forest had to offer, but there are caves to explore. 
There's also, as far as I can tell, no climbing, but the game does permit you to obtain a grappling hook which makes certain places accessible that weren't previously. 

You can't craft boats yet, and that's a shame, because the game is packed with rivers.

You need to tread lightly because the tribesmen aren't your only enemy out there. Many things can kill you, and other things can hunt you.

In co-op mode we played 25h, so far not bad ,but its surely shows thats this game was made for the single player sadly.
Co-op mode necessery items sometimes not spawning  , it would be good that NPC AI would be better  not that they bug in every corner because traps this way totally useless. 
Most annoying that some places only avilable in single player story mode :(
The permadeath mode if all the annoying bug that kills the game would be fixed , it could make a fine challenge .

It may start off as really difficult even with a walk in the park mode. Like you can't even survive for two days due to the lack of tutorials. You need to keep playing and learn by yourself all the cure for diseases and which plants are good and bad. Just learn from your mistakes and you will enjoy the game more. 

The story on the other hand is just one of the best I played. It feels like The Forest but it has it own unique to it. I really do enjoy how the game tells the story. Full of suspense and make you just wanna know what really happened. It feels like your really a dude going through all that. 

The weapon and building are fairly realistic. If you think it won't work in real life, it properly don't. I didn't expect it but when I stepped on the banana leaves rooftop it actually collapsed. I was shocked and impressed at the same time. It kinda give a realism to the game.

I would recommend it to any players who like survival game like The Forest. Do bare in mind, the game doesn't hold your hands. It just kick you into the river and let you learn how to swim on your own or you just drown.

I've played other survival games and this one to me is similar to the forest or ark, but with more complex life/survival meters/bars to control, which for me make the game more interesting. Similar to ark and forest where you have to manage food and water bars, you also have to control certain calamities that take place deep in the rain forest: fever, infection, bug bites, scratches, skin lesions/wounds, food poisoning, snake/spider/sting ray poisoning(s). At first they might as well call the game Australia or 1 millions ways to die or everything can and will kill you, It was quite entertaining, I died from a rash, from a fever, from infection, from a snake bite, from a scorpion bite, from a string ray , I was mauled by a cougar on many occasions, a jaguar on another occasion and from the native tribe members many many times: bow and arrow, spear would to the head etc. On another note, Co-op was just added recently and as a 1st player game the game is smooth AF, once you add co-op to the mix, the game is somewhat buggy, but creepy jar has its own discord so that you can report bugs and Development there is quite responsive. I feel like that development group is already quite engaging and responsive so it already feels like they're addressing alot of bugs quite quickly. I look forward to new content coming out later this fall in terms of new buildings, decorations, constructs that you can put in the water etc. I also look forward to seeing how much better the game becomes as Development works through these co-op bugs and smooth out the experience.

73,Green Hell,67584200,english,"I enjoyed this game immensely. Most games are predicated on repetition, yes? So then, it would be appropriate to judge a game based on how well a player enjoys the elements of repetition. I find the aspects of survival to be palpable, the build mechanics to be immersive without dragging my patience to pieces, and struggling to survive is a rewarding and involved process. Everyone who enjoys survival games ought to take a look at this work of art. I find that we are drawn to games of this caliber because we are comfortable and content in our own temperate environments, and this game gives us the perspective that even though we have nothing when we start, we can make it anywhere. This overarching theme is iterated several times over the course of the story. Time and time again, our esteemed main character is thrust into the violent ebbs and flows of a primordial environment, one not all that distance from our modulated gaming rooms. The story being engaging, some tropes which arguably are overused, think unreliable narrator, lost loved one, alone and afraid, and drug use, while on their surface seem perfunctory flow together with a decent plot. I'm certain any player of survival games will be satisfied.

 I don't care what any of you say, I think Jake was rich enough from Omulu Corp. that he had Mia in proper medical care sustaining her coma. The cure totally got back to her. On another tangentially related note, I believe that Mia's dialogue at the end, ""You can always come back to me."" May symbolically represent the fact that no matter what we as humans do, no matter how terrible, and it probably won't be as terrible as killing millions upon millions of people, we can always escape to our roots as human beings, struggling for survival as the ultimate escape, a refuge of mistakes in the past.

Pros: Building, hunting and exploring with friends makes the game very enjoyable and fun. The game graphics are very good and everything starts to feel pretty simple and easy as you get more experience. The beginning can be very frustrating yet interesting. I am also very optimistic of what the developers can bring in the game; new craftable items, a more diverse building system (right now there are too many spots you cannot build on) or more diverse flora and fauna.

Cons: A lot, a lot and a lot of bugs. Co-op is a new feature so it is understandable that there is a lot to improve, but they should be fixed precisely and asap. It is also very unfortunate that there are so many places you can't build on. Also the bigger trees should be able to be logged into logs and sticks.

Unfortunately unplayable. The game itself is very fun and in the beginning you die from different reasons so often that the instability of the game doesn't matter as much. We had a lot of fun for about 10 hours. Sometimes it desynced and sometimes enemies and items glitched causing some hassle for us. A quick restart solved most problems though, and that's fine when there's not much progress to save. 

As you play and start gaining experience and master some aspects of the game the instability becomes too much. Around half of the natives in game was invisible to one of us. Desyncing almost every hour means you have to invest a lot of time making costly structures that enables saving so you don't lose your progress. The last straw was then a desync caused us to lose all items and experience gained.

Green Hell is one of the Games i really started to fall in love with.
I still got 31h but, in just a few weeks it´ll be hundreds of hours^^.

Positive:
- Grafiks, textures, Leveldesign are very beautiful and crafted with many love for details
- Sound is so realistic i somtimes turned it off because i wasnt shure if its comming from outside or from my PC
- Different levels of difficulty - from boring easy to almost not winnable hard is anythng adjustable
- Story is fascinating and pushed me really going forward through the game to reveal its secrets

Negative: 
- Character Models are the only thing i dont like at this game, but: It dosent really matter, because there are just a few scenes showing characters

PS: Taking mindchanging drugs, if ur alone in the Jungle, might not seem to be an great idea - but i really loved the colors my monitor was showing up after xD

My suggestions to the DEVS:

- Starting a fire is way to easy.  
     1. There should be a chance to failure depending on difficulty and experience. 
     2. lighting a fire shouldn´t be possible while standing in rain
     3. U wear your fire-equipment on the outside of your Backpack - so it should be wet and not working for some hours after swimming or standing in the rain (at least on green hell difficulty)

- Spearfishing is way to easy also hunting fish by throwing spear on them
     1. There should be a chance to failure depending on difficulty and experience (even if u hit the fish) (GH difficulty).

- Heat and Cold
     1. The Character should be able to freeze or sweat (higher consumption of water or food)
     2.Outside-temperature should depend on daytime 
     3. Character body-temperature should depend on outside-temperature AND character should be able to get wet.

I know the game is still heavy in development, but some bugs are actually game-breaking unless you rush for chests and weapon racks to keep all of your items and tools safe while you go off to chop a tree (Items would de-spawn minutes after dropping or hours.. completely randomly). Also, the AI for the Tribe Members definitely need a re-haul to where when you're behind them stabbing them in the back they do not attack forward and hit you, or simply go invisible for your co-op partners making it a 1v3 while your friends just watch you stab at the air, literally dying from stab wounds inches from their face.

Crafting anything larger than a small handtool is a painful progress of carrying extremely small amounts of resources back and forth for no other reason than to simulate realism.  I mean, really, my character can't carry more than two of this 'long sticks'?

Sanity mechanic is tough for coop players to deal with.  Expect to die regularly, with each death giving your partner's -20 to their sanity.  Too low, and your character begins hallucinating -- voices, imaginary enemies that can damage you, etc. -- feels very reminiscent of Don't Starves sanity system.  In fact, the game feels like it borrows quite a great deal from past survival games, mashes the ideas together into a hodgepodge of systems, and gives you this.  Whatever this is...

43,Green Hell,67508467,english,"Let me start off by saying I am having loads of fun playing the game so far. I have about 20 hours in the last 2 days. 

There are many things that I would call issues, but the major thing that needs to be fixed is items disappearing. Especially after you die, I am losing way more stuff than should be lost. When I die I lose almost all weapons, anything and everything in the backpack tab with a leaf symbol, almost all food, and any fire-starting stuff. That is literally hours of progress gone because an invisible tribe member one hits me when I can’t see him. If there is one thing that I would change about the game it would be the items disappearing.

I found a machete and carried it around for hours, I put it down to hold an axe and get wood. Literally within minutes the machete disappeared and isn’t respawning at the location I picked it up at. 

Me and a friend were playing coop, we had 2 turtle shells, 11 iron, bows, spears, knives, birds nests, dozens of food items, and much more. When we died and ran back we got some rope, sticks, a little bit of our food, and a single spear. That was literally hours worth of progress gone because an invisible enemy killed us.

I absolutely love this game. It is amazing. Its beautiful, and extremely fun to play. However this problem with disappearing stuff is game breaking and has pushed me to nearly quit many times. If I had to give it a review as it stands, it would get maybe a 5/10 because for all of the amazing moments I have had, it has been overshadowed by losing almost all progress.

if you like survival games that look pretty, this is 100% a must have, but be prepared to lose a lot of progress every time you die",1587144699,1587144699,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,50,1,2219,0,950,1594020903,,
44,Green Hell,67508452,english,"I'm not great at survival games, especially ones with multiple ways to kill you. Getting a hang of the mechanics, the meta, starting over again and again, I rage quit. Took me months of abandoning it and coming back before finally getting the hang out things. When I did, not too tricky (""Normal/Welcome to the Jungle difficulty, I know my limits) and I think I love it.

The scenery is great. I didn't notice the beaten paths really guiding you around because they're subtle, and unnecessary, but even guiding you to the first abandoned village was some pretty great level design. I don't feel like my hand is being held, I can explore to my heart's content, it feels like I'm wandering through a strange jungle I haven't seen before.

Threats are easy to manage and avoid or take care of when you learn the tricks. Like every game if you can aim the bow is OP even with basic arrows (I never actually did anything with metal). The notebook is detailed enough to identify cures and plants as well, though much of it requires trial and error. E.g. find a strange plant? Effects unknown till you eat it or try combining it with other things. It may cause or cure food poisoning, you'll just have to cross your fingers, adding to the ""realism"" of surviving an unfamiliar jungle.

The story is... I'm torn. I can poke holes in it, but I'm a sucker for the romance types. I suppose my biggest annoyance is the ineptitude of an anthropologist who has been to this exact jungle before. It'd change the whole story if he was new to the jungle, and it wouldn't be nearly as fun gameplay if they let you know everything an experienced anthropologist should wandering the jungle. It's kind of explained in the story later, but it's not exactly perfect. Also the chance of missing the ""bad ending"" is a shame. I wasn't smart enough my first go to find the good ending, but someone who pays more attention than I do won't have a problem, and the bad ending is what ties everything together.

Edit - 12 hours later. I'm still mad. I can't see myself playing this game for awhile now. All my skills also reset to zero, my notebook reset to nothing. Hours of crafting/hunting gone. I can't play without my one friend who has all the skills. Completely demoralized and unmotivated to play again. 

Pretty annoyed. Someone in our party DC'ed, so it removed everyone from our party and two of them were unable to save because of some error. I was the only one that could save. I saved and remade the party, but everyone had to respawn as a new person. Unless they created from their own save. Then they'd have to have to host and we rejoin, and be new users. We did this in an effort to drop our items, one person save, and then reload. It would have worked, until I saved after respawning, because I wasn't host, it overwrote my old save. As default. So now he's the only one that can host. 
On top of that, the invisible tribe people still spawn, so that bug isn't fixed.

This game is beautiful!

Cons:
The building system is still a work in progress, but they are at least working on it.
One technical pet peeve is that the human body does not require carbohydrates to live, native populations in various parts of the world thrive on foods that are almost entirely fats and protein. 

On a personal note the W key sicks on my computer, which is a serious pain in the ass (or in this case painful snake-bitten legs) and very dangerous in this game.

Personally to me, I don't find that Hardcore but more so a little unfair for players who are JUST trying to figure things out especially right after the tutorial. 

Good example, The Forest. First couple of days are fairly easy but after those few days go by that's when players are met with the actual difficulty of the game.

For me, first death occurred via tribe killing me with a spear. I walked maybe a few feet beyond the log crossing over the river.. Talk about oof.

93,Green Hell,67447986,english,"Green Hell is a survival game. You find yourself from an Amazonian jungle without much knowledge of how to survive, with hazardous wilderness around you. You're only one small mistake away from that life-threatening disaster which will end your sorry life. However, through trial and error, and exploring your surroundings, you start to learn about the plants and animals around you. This knowledge will help you to survive, and then start to build your own base, where you can seriously start preparing for longer distance exploration, Take your time and keep your cool, and you'll be fine. Mostly.

The game has persistent environment, day-and-night and weather cycles, which will affect many things during your play. Without rain for many days, you might find yourself parched and unable to take care of your hygiene, thus affecting you negatively in multiple ways. Maybe you can find some dirty water, and make it drinkable. Maybe you can find some fruits that give you some hydration and buy you some extra time. When rain finally arrives, for example some recesses might temporarily fill with water to drink, or wash the dirt off you.

Going from there this game is a very immersive, time consuming, quite realastic survival sim i really do think its worth the purchase.
Pros:
Smooth learning curve just follow the story
Story and co-op!
VERY immersive
Surviving and building is both a challenge and a feat that yeilds fun rewards
Soft skill system, the more you do something the better you are at it
Food and hydration feels done well and not overbearing
Wound system makes sense and is easy to manage

Again i do reccomend this game just pointing out my own personal problems and issues that i had in my time which will likely be adressed in future patches

Cons:
AI is quite wonky. Both animal and human tribesmen move in very weird fashions and in some cases dont respond to you unless your right in their face or will freeze outright. Good for hunting, but really immersion breaking
During co-op it is possible as the host to not see hostile tribesmen while your other players do. You literally will not be able to interact with them possibly leading to your partners deaths.
Upon crafting, checking watch or occupying hands your tool wheel will sometimes bug out and is hard to fix
(Generally i found brining up the watch by pressing f can fix this but not always)
Building placement could use some finer tuning as you are unable to build in quite a few spots for some reason
You can fully break a stucture by jumping ontop of it, i do not know if this is a feature or a bug but with how much time building takes this was a ROYAL pain in the ass to find out

Recommendation for Devs,
Watch the ""Law of Jungle Korean Series""
this will give you more ideas to add to this game

Things I like to be Added:
1. Coconut oil out of Brown Coconut, then using oil to fry food that give higher sanity and higher fat in food.
2. Log Carrier, Sometime we need to go far places to get more logs and carrying 3 is kind of very time consuming.
3. Higher BackPack weight limit
4. bridge schematic
5. infusion to be carried in bidon, like bone infusion or for fever herbs. since being bitten and having fever to still your energy and you need to make fire plus bowl plus water at that moment can really be hussle,
6. remove the -20 sanity on coop when the other player dies, since there are trolls who come and die to reduce your sanity. and ruin the game
7. I love you guys, BEST SURVIVAL GAME

Unfortunately, ( even after the patch today)  the co-op is unplayable due to major game-breaking bugs and multiplayer issues. My three friends and I purchased this game 3 days ago and started a lobby to play together. We had issues immediately! One of my three friends could not even see our player model and we could not see him but we can see him build and drop items / invisible enemies to some of us caused us to fight helplessly as the other players just watch ( sanity was %100  for all of us on multiple occasions ) / All animals disappear from the map completely  ( we go out to find food and there is nothing, not even in the normal snake spawns ) . Items such as logs and food will randomly fall through the floor / My friends would sleep on the bed and won't be able to get up. after reconnecting they lose everything they have gathered. / and after loading back into saved games, all my friends lose everything but me! My friends and I have tried multiple nights restarting from scratch and after about 2-3 hours of gameplay, something breaks witch makes us have to start over again. After the 20 hours I have on this game, I can say we have been playing the same 3-hour of start gameplay, started over 6 times and the gameplay consists of finding a place to set up, get the building materials, build, something breaks and we start over. /  and many more small bugs.  Now 1 of my 3 friends has given up on playing because he can't see us half the time ( he has 5 hours of gameplay )  and the rest of us have tried to be optimistic but we played again today after the patch and things seem worse.  Our saved game was broken, we started a new game and still have issues with not seeing enemies and animals not spawning in and other issues that are pushing us away from this game. I am frustrated because I see this game has so much potential and I want it to succeed but at this stage, I feel like I have been deceived. Spending close to $30 for a game that does not have an early access tag but is clearly not finished.  I feel even worse that I convinced my friends to buy this and we collectively spent $100 + after-tax on this game and all we got was frustration and issues.

34,Green Hell,55053034,english,"Green Hell is an immersive and rather intense survival based game. Unless you like to spoil your game, it is best to go straight into the game without any knowledge prior. Read everything and you will understand the story line. There are two different endings, based on how well you learn the game. Every trail or bush, you can expect danger. Do not take care of yourself and you lose your mind. 

I am not someone who dumps 2000 hours into a game, but I have 300 in ark, 150 in the forest, and 80 hours in 7 days to die. All games that I enjoyed. However, Green Hell, in the short time I have spent playing it, dethrones the other games I have played, when comparing it to its survival aspect, and really forcing the player to focus more on actual survival. 

There are numerous locations to travel to, so for those who hate spending hours building things, do not worry, there are plenty of awesome, and lush places to visit. For building, it can be tedious, but looks wonderful with the completed product. 

My one con to this game, is the frames per second, and not enough tribesmen that you cross paths with. The campaign or story mode, is a solid 3 hours or less with knowledge of the game. A new comer could expect up to 20 hours if you really take your time and enjoy the experience. 


This game did not come out too long ago, and the developers stuck to their roadmap, which absolutely blows my mind. With this being said, Coop for the game is expected, which is what is going to bring more of my friends to come and play. 
However, this game has done perfect as a single player game. I highly recommend this to anyone who is interested in really testing their survival abilities in the video game amazon rainforest. 

I give the game a solid 9/10. Voice acting great, beautiful atmosphere, great price. This is the kind of game that I have been looking for.

I think this is a great game for anyone who enjoys open map exploring and harsher survival game mechanics, where the reward cycle is - well, surviving. The game challenges you with continuous management of resources and stats, with a short but steep learning curve at the beginning as you navigate both the UI and the dangerous jungle. There are no breaks in taking precautions as literally one misstep can easily kill you. The map itself is interesting to explore as the thick underbrush limits visibility and adds to the suspense of exploration. The game feels robust and well thought out, smooth performance and few bugs to note (however as of this review they said they had fixed a bad glitch with enemies were indivisible to certain players in multiplayer but I witness this as not the case.)

I have played this the majority of my time with my brother and it works as both an individual game and a game to play with a buddy – both ways are good. The quotes above are the phrases we have used from our gameplay, which I hope others have spoken too :) . And for 25$, it has great value. Give it a shot!

I can not recommend this game enough and anyone who just wanted to play the game for the survival mechanic or the multiplayer please take some time and play solo and actually run through the story without doing any other research.

Frequently, one of us will get desynced from the game and need to reconnect. When doing this, we can't find the hosted game without both of us restarting steam.

The host can never see the tribe people so one of us ends up taking on 3 by ourselves. (This is a common bug according to the discussion forums)

We cannot get certain mud walls to place or certain building pieces to place. The collision in this game seems VERY wonky to us. 

We really like this game though. We want to keep playing it. It's brutal without feeling impossible. It feels rewarding when you manage to succeed at something or kill off aggressive NPCs.

Survival in this game is brutal, but pretty realistic compared to most. My first day or two in this game were absolute hell. Still, something compelled me to continue. Once you get the survival aspect down and start to understand what to do and when, it actually turns around quickly, to being able to survive and build out a base of operations.

So far I have only played the story mode. I liked this quite a lot. It could have been longer, but it was good. I feel the game is still somewhat lacking in content to play without the story. The story pushing you to work towards the goal of finishing the campaign. So It becomes survival in function of that.

Some of the game mechanics seem a bit obnoxious. This being in the sense that you feel like some actions could be faster or there should be bulk actions. But the fact that it is the way that it is actually adds to the realism of the survival aspect.

36,Green Hell,67340736,english,"I cannot recommend Green Hell. From what I can tell, Green Hell is an attempted copy of The Forest. Now, when you try to copy something, you have to be at least as good if not better. Green Hell is not even close to being as good as The Forest. In fact I would struggle to find a single category where this game exceeds The Forest. 

Apart from the story being a generic suspense rescue variety, there was a fair amount of effort put in. There are some nice voice-overs, a few cutscenes, dialogue 'choices', and a nice guided introduction. 

However, the core gameplay is just frustrating at best. The crafting is so un-intuitive and grueling! If you want to make 10 bandages, you can't put 10 leaves on your crafting table and hit craft 10 times. NO. You have to add a leaf to the table, then craft. then add another leaf, then craft...snakes may kill me in game but this kills me IRL. All the different menu and inventory screens are just so clustered and they get in each other's way. For example, to put a bandage on a wound, you must open your 'inspect' menu first, then your inventory, and you can place your bandage on your wound (after you find it). You cannot open your inventory, then inspect. The inspect menu bumps you out of your inventory screen, even though you can have both open at the same time! It's just weird and frustrating!

Building is also a shitfest, and is superseded by The Forest in every way. The Forest is an imperfect adventure of a game, but the limitless creativity of building is what kept me hooked. Green Hell seems to max out on creative building projects the second time you build a structure. Not only is the time cost of building very high, there are few ways of increasing your productivity, and the grind is real if you want to get a big project going. Building is not why you're going to like this game, trust.

There are fun moments of course. The map is okay. If you like survival games, just know you're in for a pretty short lived generic adventure.

52,Green Hell,67328612,english,"well, the game has a huge potential, the crafting system is good, exploration feels how it should, and hunting is fun. But, there is a huge but here... tbh. In actual state, is really buggy, with alot of game-breaking things, even stopping you and your friends to progress through the game. I'll try to list here what i've encountered with my friends within 21 hours of game:

1 - Natives are just buggy as hell, they some times spawns on nowhere, or are invisible for some players in co-op ( no, i'm not talking about loss of sanity, they are just invisible and pop-up when killed by who seeing them). Even animations stop working some times, with the classic ""cross shape"" position. 

2 - building a base has no benefit at all. besides just small things like shelter, and even so, the only penalty for rain is the fire being put out. You can virtually survive with only two or three structures and it will be just fine. Besides, they offer no protection at all, since natives and some animals will spawn there quite often.

3 - some times craft is just a waste of time. Item balance is just terrible, literally a simple stone knife built with 2 stones is more effective collecting material than any other material expensive tool. Literally takes less stamina and time to ""knife-down"" any tree with this blade than with an axe, wich makes no sense... and mind the simple blade, its not even the knife, only 2 rocks to craft this tool.

4 - actually an extension of the 3º problem, but with item ""grade"". Metal tools are just horrible for the effort. The system that you have to learn to make them is great, but they lack any reward. Literally, i didnt notice any benefit from iron knife to stone knife, or axe, or anything. Its just not worth the time.

5 - the game life-span is around 15~20 hours. When everything is new, you are having fun. After that, its quite repetitive and dull. Its not a ""problem"" tho, it will be different depending on how you deal with this.

6 - hunting different animals is quite pointless, since almost every animal will give you only different types of meat with no real benefit. You cant get their fur, or they skin to make armor. It was really sad when my group almost wiped out fighting an jaguar, only to find out that he only gives you 2~3 pieces of meat that does nothing new. So, if you set up a trap to kill big animals, thats it, you literally have nothing to do anymore. Only one animal has an actual usable item, its the armadillo's. Hunting is pointless, but is fun. Animals will run off if you hit them with throwing weapons, and you better run for it, or you'll probably lose your weapon at the dense vegetation. Atmosphere is just neat, 10/10 there.

7 - Lack of objectiviness. Well, tbh the game has and objective and you can find it quite easy. the map is not big as it look like, its quite small actually. You can, in less than 5 minutes, run cross it. Surviving is NOT the objective, that means you have an ""point a to b"" to reach out. Thing is, there is nothing interesting there. Just nothing. 

8 - Connectivity issues, lots of them. Even desync is quite normal.

There is two major game-breakings bugs: 

1 - If you're playing co-op, there are especial items that need to be collected to acess some areas, one of those items is a grappling hook. If you or some of your friends find the hook and some one is not close enough, this player wont get the hook, thus not acessing the area. To go around this, you have to enable cheats and spawn the item. 

2 - When drinking water or sleeping, some times your character just freeze there and the controls become unresponsive, forcing you to reboot the game ( happend 3 times with my host).


Bonus glitch:

1 - Some times when you join a server (that you have played before, thus saved game and char ) and your character will not load. You start on random location and without any item, like a fresh game. Reconnection will solve the problem.

2 - Items will duplicate if you drop them, save the game and exit. Probably server state is not sync with player state.

The game is quite fun when it works, but it wont work 70% of the time, wich is a shame. I wont recommend to play this alone, the only reason it was fun within 20 hours was because i had friends with me. 

if you are looking for an incomplete game and want to support it to gets better, buy it and play with friends. 

if anything that i wrote here bothers you, dont. Those are not rare cases, they are literally the game itself. Dont get me wrong, the game has some INSANE potential, if the devs carry this on, within 1 years it will become a good game. Lets hope they do it.

While playing with friends the jaguar we were fighting clipped in and out of existence appearing and attacking us, then teleporting behind one of us and hitting us again. I found there to be no incentive to set up a home anywhere as it was more efficient to just sleep in the nearest bed you found and go back to the place you died to pick up your stuff, besides even if you did build a settlement it would get destroyed by the tribesmen.

Off the rip I can say that this game, much like any other survival game I've played, there is little to no explanation on how most things work in the game. However if you have patience it can all be figured out. I started out in story mode as recommended to run the games tutorial, but like I mentioned it doesn't explain a whole lot. After dying about 100 times I decided to try out survival mode. This is where I was able to learn a huge amount through trial an error. The game really is about experimentation. Its like ""oh hey, just found this new mushroom, lets pop it in my mouth an see what it does!"" There is a bunch of different ways and methods to handle most situations in the game an its really just down to the player to discover them either through exploration of the environment or experimentation. So far I'm really enjoying the game but as with anything it isn't perfect. Combat to me feels very clunky, albeit hunting prey is easy, combat with predators or natives can be a bit awkward. That being said, combat with predators and natives is 100% avoidable if you're careful an pay attention to the environment. Really all negatives are avoidable completely if you stay vigilant aside from one thing, which maybe my biggest annoyance in the game. That is leeches, they only have a very slight impact on your sanity/health but they appear to be on a scripted trigger to appear on you, an they seem to do so a number of times per day.

9,Green Hell,67274735,english,"Bought this game to play with other mates. After a short tutorial, I have only been playing multiplayer since, so I am strictly speaking as a co-op player.

Hardcore survival and very punishing even in normal mode, the stats degrade very fast and will overwhelm players with less micromanaging ability and those who are looking for a more casual game play, in addition to scarce resources spread throughout the map that will make new players panic. These can be adjusted by the host however, to suit the players' need, including turning insanity meter, predators and venomous snakes off etc.

When you start to get the hang of the game and its mechanics, in addition to having adequate essentials to survive, things start to kick off as players will start to build a proper base and can wander off without dying every few minutes. This of course feels very rewarding as this game has a high risk -> high reward factor.

After hours of fun, the flaws will start to be apparent... these are game breaking bugs and buzzkill. Those that we encountered include:
- Multiple kicks and unexplained disconnections.
- Missing inventory when joining player logs back in. (this can be solved by the affected player to quit the session and log back in, but it is not acceptable for this to happen in the first place)
- Respawn points not saved for joining player who logs back in, even though we clearly slept in our new beds to set a new respawn points.
- Unable to use bow, as we switched our weapon wheel to the bow we can't shoot anything at all. (this also has solution after we refer to the forums but again, shouldn't happen in the first place)
- Unable to use grappling hook, only plays animation but character remain at the bottom.
- Unable to drop item, forever holding it unless we kill our characters.
- Only some players can see enemy tribesmen, and those who can't see will only able to see them after the enemy has been killed.
- Spawned tribesmen standing in T-pose and not moving unless we attack them.

AND THE LAST BUT NOT LEAST:
- Host UNABLE TO SAVE!!! This is the worst as we all lose so much progress and time. The host only have infinite spinning ""saving game"" icon at bottom right but the last save files he has is hours ago! When we realized this it's already too late.

Other minor nitpicks:
- For a game that has some level of realism, canned food will respawn in abandoned backpacks. This is awesome, but what??
- Need the option to turn off or lessen head bopping, I have IRL motion sickness just by sprinting for the first few hours in game.
- Need faster way to pick up items from the floor, especially after death when all items are dropped by the character. Picking up fish bones and feathers one by one is not fun.
- Stuttering and FPS drop on above average PC specs.
- Enable us to mix and match normal wood and bamboo, and palm and banana leaves. What survivalist will be like: ""Hey I need to make a stick frame to build a shack, but I can build them ONLY IF I can get all the same stick types to build it.""? Long stick and long bamboo stick should be interchangeable etc. 
- When fall from ground to shallow water, the player character will jerk back and forth in between the ground and water from standing to swimming animation. Very janky.

TL;DR: This game's multiplayer really has potential, I am sincere when I say I have fun! I know the dev is an independent studio, but at it's current buggy state I cannot recommend it to others.

You're dirty, one of your four meters is close to empty (every couple minutes), you have worms, you have leeches, you have wounds, you have a rash, you're tired, you have food poisoning, your inventory for this type of stuff is full SHUT UP!

I only played 3 hours of this game and have died about a dozen times, even with help of my friends, who have played this game more and have played every survival game out there. And don't get me wrong, I don't have a problem with dying in a survival game, it's just not fun inbetween, because if you don't adress the issues, you will die even more. And don't bother to make some stocks so you don't have to attend your needs all the time, because everything rots in hours. Ingame hours.

And the UI could really need a rework. Why is using and picking stuff up on the same key? Why do you have to use the context menu for tons of stuff? Etc. 
Don't know if there are options to mess with it, because the overall experience was bad enough, I didn't even bother.

There are some cool mechanisms in the game like not having a compass or indicator where you are on the map (if you find it in the first place). Or gathering water by just putting coconut shells on the ground while it rains. Or having to figure stuff out by eating it or combining stuff while crafting.

78,Green Hell,67226779,english,"É uma recomendação mas com vários ALERTAS... Vamos iniciar pelo o que o jogo tem de bom, survival muito bem construído, ele é bem difícil e desafiador, no início parece impossível mas depois de alguns fracassos você vai aprendendo e se torna um melhor sobrevivente, ainda assim, depois de muitas horas de game, ainda assim você poderá sucumbir, os problemas e perigos surgem e podem te complicar, o que faz do game um belo survival. 

Me diverti muito com o jogo, é realmente prazeroso depois que tu pega o jeito aproveitar o craft e fazer uma base enorme de barro enquanto busca recursos para sobreviver... A história main é interessante e te faz explorar o mapa com cuidado... Eu recomendo até aqui. 

Agora vamos aos alertas: 

- Engine não é lá essas coisas, é bem pesado e sequer usa sua GPU direito, mas tudo bem, ainda assim você consegue manter uns 50-60 fps... 

- Modo Cooperativo achei meio sem sentido, é simplesmente um survival com os amigos, sem história, então se você já conhece o mapa o cooperativo se resume a construir e sobreviver. Mesmo tendo uma mecânica de survival sensacional, não se compara à experiência que The Forest Cooperativo oferece, por exemplo. 

- BUGS de craft e seleção de itens, muitas vezes tu simplesmente não consegue completar uma construção ou acessar uma que está sendo feita por que o jogo simplesmente não permite a seleção, isso é um pouco irritante. Por vezes as construções param de funcionar, não aceitam itens, é tudo na mesma linha, bugs de seleção dos itens. É bem comum tu não conseguir construir algo por um bug de colisão, então se você destrói tudo acaba conseguindo, mas isso é ALTAMENTE irritante já que o craft do jogo exige MUITO... 

Items somem seguidamente, quando você abre novamente o jogo ele da respawn em tudo e muitas vezes os itens somem abaixo de terreno ou construções. 

Enfim, esteja preparado para enfrentar bugs graves.

No geral é um ótimo jogo, joguei e jogo bastante, mas eu precisava alertar a todos vocês que ele tem problemas bastante irritantes, o que é uma pena.

I love survival games, and i've played quite a few of them. 
I just finished the Story mode and it was captivating. I was so eager to unravel the story, but trying to rush to the next point would always result in death. This game made taught me to prepare, be cautious, and tread slowly.
While not as much combat as I thought, the difficulty of just surviving the landscape can be extremely punishing very quickly.
It made me adapt a much different play style, where I wasn't seeking the hard combat because it held valuable loot to survive, I was just trying to survive while being careful to avoid the dangers of the jungle.
On a 10 point scale, I give this game a solid 9.5 and have already told the majority of my gaming friends to try the game.

0,Green Hell,67207971,english,"Green Hell is a good survival game with some really unique aspects.  
It has very in depth survival with exceptional realism and details. The crafting is really well done with some fresh ideas and tons of nuances that other games don't bother with.  I have not gotten too far in the main story, but it seems pretty solid and I would say it's better than many survival games.  The real enjoyment comes discovery, you will be doing a lot of trial and error if you play without a guide or googling everything (which i highly suggest doing)  You will get much more out of the game if you take notes and try to figure out everything for yourself.  8/10 initial score.

Pros: Overall, it is fun. The crafting system is good and easy to learn. Best is to just go in blind and learn along the way. Multiplayer is great *when it works*.  Lots of room to keep developing content.

Cons: reaaaallly buggy. Especially multiplayer and combat. Feels like an early access (kind of like how DayZ used to be). The map is surprisingly small.

As difficult as the game is, I'd strongly recommend avoiding guides and walkthroughs if you can. The challenge of the game is what makes surviving just one more day feel that much more rewarding. Each day you'll face new obstacles, and through trial and error you'll have to figure out how to overcome them. Because saving isn't easy, I became extra invested in staying alive. So many times I found myself lost, limping back to camp on my last shred of life, starving, exhausted and dehydrated with strange voices whispering in my head. Then you see your camp and rush towards it like your life really does depend on it, thanking god for the opportunity to save and sleep. 

I expected a wilderness survival game, which I got, but through exploration an unexpected story began to unfold. I had my theories as to how the mystery was going to play out, but I was not prepared for the gut punches I received by the end. There are many devastating and haunting discoveries to be made.  The music and atmosphere wonderfully convey moments of horror and dread.

34,Green Hell,67190945,english,"This game has potential, I'm hoping to re-review it when later versions come out. I loved playing the forest and this game is reminiscent of the play-style of that game. Dropped in the middle of the (jungle) forests, you fight to survive while being weary of the local tribes. 

However, where this game ramps it up is in the survival aspect. You must maintain your levels of meat, fruit, nuts (fats) and water (in simplified terms) instead of just one hunger level. AND, an energy level directly related to your stamina. And, lets not forget that sanity management is a thing.

The game punishes you hard for: 
-Running (aimlessly - uses a LOT of energy) 
-Walking without paying attention (snakes, termites, spiders, sting rays, and a menacing lion that I keep running into.) 
-Getting any sort of scratch, and not being able to find a specific plant for a bandage. (I just learned that after infection, you can use maggots from spoiled meat to help)
-Eating anything you aren't aware of; its almost a ""first time for everything"" system. Once you eat stuff, then you know what the effects are and don't have to test again. So be careful cause most mushrooms are good, but there are bad ones.... and other stuff may suprise you as to being really helpful (Thank you sting ray meat).
-Falling
-Not having supplies
-Not being able to find supplies...
and ANY other reason you can think of

NOW, with all of that in mind, the game is challenging, addictive, fun. If you enjoyed The Forest or games like it, then you will enjoy this. A simple and controlled crafting system allows you to thrive in your own shelter... if you can survive of course. 

I highly recommend this game for groups, although solo may be fun for a good self-challenge.

MAJOR COMPLAINTS / BUGS
-The chest stacking systems seems to bug out, because you aren't holding the item, it usually says 0/0 items
-The combat system between you and the tribesmen is completely messed up. I understand it is supposed to be hard, but there is no telling when he is going to strike, and it only takes two hits to die. Blocking may save you but it doesn't allow for a parry. It just feels clunky and frustrating.

Great game so far, lots to do with a bit of a learning curve. Graphics are really nice and the ambient noises are done very well. Some glitchy building components depending where things are positioned but no serious complaints yet.

-Crafting is pretty straight forward and simple to start out.

-Natives will leave you alone if you stay away from them for the most part.
(Until they show up to smash your hut and kill you)

-Jaguars are jerks too but make for some good eating and the other non hostile animals aren't too bad to chase down if you're a bad shot and don't kill them instantly.

-The health system is a bit much until you get a good feel for whats good and what will kill you.

Other nutrients are easy enough to find when you wander through the forest. 

Combat feels a little wonky, but not game-breakingly bad. Not sure if the natives ramp up in difficulty as your base gets bigger or you unlock more tech but it doesn't seem like it. Might be a good idea for the devs to add later?

So far haven't found a way to identify plants/mushrooms, which has been a little frustrating. No idea what can be used as antihistamines or antibiotics. Been eating everything, trying to craft with bandages in both natural and dried varieties, no luck so far.

68,Green Hell,67172513,english,"Just some things you may wanna know about the multiplayer of this game:

1. Especially the natives but also some animals (like the jaguar) tend to be bugged so not everyone sees them. In our case it was usually the host who wasn't able to see them. It tends to be very annoying. I'm not talking about sanity here btw, I know when you're insane there are natives only you see but that's not the case here.

2. After a while of playing everything bugs. For example for us, suddenly two boxes were buggy which resultet in the loss of some items like iron ore and melted iron. It's very frustrating.

3. Sometimes saving doesn't really save. For example: you save, log out and when you log back in you're reset to an earlier point. This apparently only applies to those who are not hosts tho, the host and the world stay the same. This can be annoying because it means that some progress is lost because your inventory is reset automatically aswell. 

4. Sometimes you're getting kicked from the session. This was worse before the first patch but it still happens occasionally. This can reset your progress aswell. 

5. It's not only boxes and creatures that bug but also for example camp fires. They suddenly stop working. To make them work again you have to destroy and rebuild them. This is not only annoying but slows you down aswell. 

6. There's barely any difference between ""normal"" mode and ""hard"" mode (not talking about ""green hell"" here). Maybe that's just me but I feel like it should be a bit trickier like maybe in hard mode you lose your whole inventory when you die, enemies should be stronger and recourses maybe rarer. This is definetly not the worst part tho, the points above are what really made my experience bad.

Green hell definetly has a lot of potential, in single player it's great but multiplayer is not it right now. There's much that needs to be fixed.

Great game, amazing looks and sounds. Runs very smoothly but let me tell ya, the save system was not nice to me. When playing with my friends on their server, i would leave and the next day my stuff would not load in. Sometimes it even spawns me in different areas then where i saved last on their server. There were also times where i would pick up an item (palm leaf was my issue) and my character was stuck holding it. I couldn't pick up anything or drop the stupid leaf. Eventually i used TAB to go into my backpack and used my Fire Drill tool to break the chains of my suffering while my friends laughed at me. Even the bow is glitched (sometimes fixable by pulling out your watch) and sometimes it wouldn't even acknowledge that i had arrows in my bag and therefore i would be the spear hunter of the group.

I even had to restart the single player campaign because it loaded me into the last spot i saved, but all my stuff was gone and i was trapped in an area where you need a certain item to get to and off of. Sometimes in single player i would take a drink from the water and my WASD would not work at all or i couldn't even move my camera and would therefore be forced to reload (and there are not many save points unless you take the time to build a shelter in order to save, only save points you can find are calender's...don't ask)

Despite all these issues I FACED, my friends in multiplayer had their own issues that were different than mine and some didn't experience any issues. I cant explain why but this game is STILL WORTH IT in my opinion.

The single player story was very good and the ending was unreal. Multiplayer is still really fun just to survive and build with your friends, although the story is not available to do in co op mode (yet??).

It isn't 7days or the long dark where you'll have weeks of replay value, but its a unique 15-25 hour purpose driven experience worth it at 1$/hour.

Pros:
-Visuals, looks great on my low end backup gaming laptop
-Survival game actually set in the wilderness vs post apocalypse scrounging for tuna cans
-Endgame goal gives it purpose which many survival games lack
-Solid challenge which can be adjusted for sanity
-No leveling really, late game is very easy due to you knowing your environment, as it should be in survival games
-Few performance issues

Cons:
-Fitting that its set in Latin America because the story/characters are as melodramatic as a daytime Telemundo Soap Opera, cut scenes are annoying and abuse player patience whining about characters we are simply told we should care about
-Pacing is terrible, you spend 95% of game time learning to survive in the first 20% of the map, then steamroll through the other 80% of the map and story in a few hours.

Co-op is broken at this point with the following bugs:

Sometimes you cant equipe/shoot with your bow even if in the right bottom cornor you see it equiped;

3) Random disconnects from co-op sessions that force you to re-host in order to invite your friend again.
4) Friends who join your game sometimes can't equip items and when they disconnect they lose items regardless of saving game.

Let me summarize the current state of Green Hell Co-op:

1) Spawn around the map, use GPS to find each other, pick a place to build. Fine.
2) Get some basic materials to build a save location and fire. Fine.
3) Instead of being able to grab anyone of the 10 million leaves and such within immediate reach, you have to wander around looking for a lone dry leaf or some bird nest. Starting to get weirdly grindy.
4) Once stable, spend all our time getting minor injuries that require major wandering to find supplies, continuously dying and making our friends go crazy. Seems best way to reset health and sanity is just die. Starting to seem pointless.
5) Once dead, all your stuff simply spatters out of your backpack for some reason and when you return to collect your prior materials, you have to pick up each item individually and go through 100 hundred hand-reaching animations. Devs clearly never played another game with a backpack metaphor. 
6) The PVP vs inhabitants is simply terrible, fraught with slide-show lag, enemies glitching all over the place
7) Not sure what happens with the save file and non-hosted player inventories. We had a lot of occurrences of disconnects and then when reconnecting, all their items gone.

I am truly disappointed I waited this long to buy this game, hoping the Co-op would be like The Forest and I'd have a Great Adventure with my friends going through a shared story.

82,Green Hell,67091985,english,"This game is garbage.  

Got it to have a co-op experience like with The Forest.  Figured this game would have improved on concepts in The Forest, since this game was in early access for years and even had a full release months ago.  Turns out the opposite is true and this game is a clunky, buggy mess.  It's also a broken game that is effectively unplayable, but I did not realise this until we tried to continue playing and found that the game simply did not save hours of progress (despite being the same host).  Put 4 hours into it and now Steam refuses to refund it, so now I am giving this game the review that it deserves:

- This game is far from complete, and it should still be in early access.  The fact that they just added co-op as a feature is an obvious red flag.  
- Co-op, the only reason why I would even want to play this game, is fundamentally broken in multiple ways.  Sometimes there are enemies that spawn, attacking you but your buddy can't see them (even when standing in front of them).  These enemies are not part of the hallucination mechanic.  I managed to kill one of these guys because he bugged out and was running into a wall, and then his corpse became visible to the other player.  
- Co-op apparently has no story aspect and is purely survival, which is pointless.  
- Co-op save states are broken.  They are designed to follow the host's progress, but they don't.  We lost hours of progress because the host's game simply didn't save it for some reason. 
- There is no autosave, and the game will randomly kick you out of co-op.  It has done this to me both times I played it.  Even though I was not the host, it still affects my character's progress in skills and items if I was not fortunate enough to save before I was randomly kicked. 
- The survival mechanics are just ridiculously restrictive, to the point where it is simply more effectively to die and respawn than to try to keep up with eating food and drinking water.  It's difficult to even go and explore because you have to spend every waking moment eating and drinking.  Maybe there is some leveling system here where you adapt better, but it is still so stupid.  You drink out of eight full coconut bowls of water and your guy is still dehydrated, really?  
- The enemy tribesmen or whatever are just stupid.  They are either glitching out or completely destroying you or both.  When I was playing earlier, I walked 20 feet out of camp and dropped dead and it said I died of ""thrust"", and buddy found that there was some tribal archer that hit me with an arrow.  I'm not even sure if this enemy was visible to me or not.  
- Item management is just sad.  When you die, which is often, all of your weapons automatically disappear.  The rest of your items are just sitting in a pile where you have to individually pick up each one (then you die a minute later from some stupid BS).  In The Forest, you can carry all types of items with a limit per type of item, so you never had to deal with this nonsense.  
- User interface is just horribly clunky.  I use a gamepad and it should not be this bad, and there is no option for rebinding controls or anything.  You want to craft an item?  Well, you get to pretty much go through multiple menu options or drag one object into the crafting pile, instead of you know just pressing a dedicated ""craft"" button.  And you also have no helpful description of what is craftable, unless you want to try to navigate and memorize the notebook. 
- For some entirely frustrating reason, the game will not update the names of plants and mushrooms, and most of them say ""unknown"" despite already eating them.  I don't care if it says ""yellow mushroom"" or ""green mushroom"", don't need its proper latin name, just a basic name to differentiate it from others. 

This game has some potential, but they really need to streamline a lot of it to make it a fun experience.  I get all of the added depth for survival, like dealing with parasites and wounds, but it just adds a major drag to gameplay when your character requires 5 gallons of water and 15 meals every day.

Stuff like the tribals t-posing in the distance before you get closer, tribals hitting the air far away from your base and your builds, but still managing to break them from a good distance away, after dying your stuff just lays down to the ground separately (sometimes scattering far apart from each other, I found my stuff many meters apart from where I had died, still some remaining in sort of a pile, had a hard time looking for it all), which is a bit unlogical since you have your backpack as your inventory, would make sense that you'd drop the whole bag behind if you died. In co-op groupmates names disappearing after a certain distance between you tends to be a bit annoying, since there's the ability to help out your friend if they pass out, but it's fairly hard finding them since name tags don't show far at all. 

Not all of the above said are bugs, but just some annoying things that I have faced during my gameplay.

The combat is so god awful, the game is almost unplayable. I can't even begin to describe everything that's wrong with it.

Sometimes you need to hit them first, before they unfreeze, stab you 4 times in 1 second, and kill you. Dodging works 1/10th of the time. Some AI can't figure out what direction you're in; and some AI will teleport behind you cutting you twice and ending you before you can turn around.

- Hotkey for craft menu (I can't swap from backpack to craft fast enough with keyboard)
- Hotkey for Harvest and other ""additional"" options instead of Right Mouse Button click, for example when I need to harvest Long Stick or so
- A little less freezes would be nice, but it's not crucial so far

45,Green Hell,67050902,english,"Just finished the story mode, and man, what a game! Many twists and turns, and such powerful imagery in the encounters of Jake and Mia, aboriginals and civilization! The only negative in my opinion was Jake's (the protagonist) script. He is awfully insecure, craves attention and gets too easily frustrated. I caught myself cringing so much in some conversations. And god it is annoying to hear him whine every time you need to start a small campfire or his crappy stone axe breaks for the 1000th time. Other than that, the game is spot on!

If the devs go forward exploring this game's potential (and believe me, there is so much!), I think that the game might struggle to find a balance between keeping it interesting for veterans and manageable for beginners. As it stands, the game is difficult in the beginning, when you don't really understand the mechanics and don't know what to do or not do. That's why you see so many reviews of people with worms in their buttholes, explosive vomiting and necrotic wounds. The game does, however, become a lot simpler once you know how to prepare for your trips and become acquainted with the map/navigation, as well as fauna and flora. A veteran player will probably never have such problems, well maybe the worms one, if you get a fever when you're in a vulnerable situation (damn spiders and sneks be sneaky, man), but that's usually no biggie anyways. 

In that context, making it more challenging to veterans (in other words, adding replayability to this game), but not a chore (like quick nutrient depletion and super punishing debuffs), is difficult without overwhelming beginners even more. I hope they add more things to build/craft, more fauna and flora, more mini-event variety (that is, more than just the eventual jaguar or tribesmen patrol I mean), will make this game more difficult to master and thus become more engaging when you play it for a longer time. Co-op is great fun right now, but after a while you start asking yourself what else can you do to extend the fun. It's just the first week of the co-op's launch though, so I'm excited to see what comes in the future.

This games story mode is really good and constantly makes you wonder what is going on. I wanted to keep exploring and finding new things all the time. It has a very good narrative with likeable characters, it goes to show that even survival games can have a very good story.


Pros: 
-Challenging
-Exploration
-Primitive survival
-Good crafting system, makes you explore and try new combinations to make the best tools and items.
-Very good story
-Extremely good graphics
-Audio design is very good
-wide range of animals and flora
-large map
-Co-Op survival mode
-Keeps you on edge 

Cons: 
-Story mode while amazing, makes it hard to have a permanent base
-Tribesman are a bit buggy and almost impossible to kill, AI for them needs work. They will sometimes be right in front of you when you wake up so make sure to save often.
-You have to have a shelter or find a calendar to save the game, makes it hard to save late game as there is not many calendars forcing you to make a shelter every time.
-No way to upgrade backpack storage, this can be very annoying late game
-Energy drains to fast and can get annoying when you have to sleep in the middle of the day, maybe implement a chair you can build or find to rest during the day.
- I have one of the best PC builds you can have, and i cannot get 60 fps at very high settings. it could be because i have 1440p resolution. i did get 80-90 fps on high settings with minimal graphical difference though. 1080p should have no issues most likely.

For the most part these are minor nitpicks, and which most of can be resolved easily. All in all i would recommend this to everyone that enjoys playing survival games, especially if you enjoy difficult gritty experiences. And for $25 the value is incredible.

Rating: 9/10

(As of 2020 this game ties into real world problems we are facing right now even though it was released in 2018, so i would play it asap. It really gives a deeper understanding to certain things.)

I still love, but these little problems make it difficult to adore.

The game was released last year as a SP game and then last week the MP option was added.

Lots of positive reviews!

You're basically dropped deep in the amazonian rainforest with no map no tools and no guide. You have to learn the skills you need to survive night after night of dark and creepy. You also have to overcome physical and mental obstacles as you try not to freeze to death before you lose your mind.

As someone who played and enjoyed ""The Forest"" I was excited to see this game seemed similar as I had been waiting for something like The Forest to come out for awhile. The game isn't bad by any means but it runs poorly, and a little unpolished and rough which isn't the end of the world or unique with these sort of games but instead of copying what's already out there for the core mechanics they had some neat features and ideas like, inspecting your limbs for wounds or infection, the different nutrients required, and the inventory system was well thought out I think. But for me only really having the option of a rigid story or none at all kinda killed it. In the forest they make a little intro to set the scene and let you piece together the rest from your surroundings giving advice or tasks very sparingly which really worked perfect for solo or co-op play in this sort of game.

Edit: just realized you can safe the game. its prompted on top of your shelter where as I though it saved everytime you sleept.
pros:
- great mechanics
- my type of survival game (open world with lots of mechanics and challenges)

cons:
- it doesn't have enough cons
- sight non-game braking bugs with the sound while an animation is playing under certain circumstances. (happened once)
- very unforgiving which may be unfavourable to some.

Verdict:
if you like unforgiving survival games with loads of mechanics and lots to challenge you and discover then this is the game for you. easily hundreds of hours of gameplay and online which is a win at this price point


I was extremely exited for this game and I got it on sale for 22$ and immediately fell in love with it. the building and overall survival mechanics are brilliant. Think the forest but much more sophisticated and not as many canibals. I only touched the campaign but it has a little tutorial and gets you started with the base mechanics. If you love unforgiving, open world survival games then this is the game for you. I would 100% recommend it even at its base price but if you want to save a buck or two its nice to get it on sale however I never seen it over 25% off. The only problem I have, and I'm not sure if its intentional , but whenever you die you start back from day one (at least in the campaign) no matter how far you were. I was 8 days in and I died from infection because I stupidly ran too far away from my base with low energy and I have to  start from the beginning. Also it took a lot of tries to fully understand all the different mechanics like water, food and planting but I eventually got though it with trial and error.

48,Green Hell,66977065,english,"    Firstly, the name ""Survival Game"" doesn't fit this one; rather, Survival Simulator. In Green Hell, you not only have to worry about food, water and sleep, you have to worry about food types, AE: carbs, fatty acids, and proteins. On top of a wilderness that can give you multiple debuffs ranging from venom, parasites, infections, and more, all of which require specific ways to deal with, and cure. The game is not for the faint of heart. 
    The game is wonderfully made, with awesome game mechanics that strive on truly immersing yourself in the wilderness.
    Now, onto what is wrong with the game. Bugs are everywhere, especially in multiplayer. I would even go as far as saying multiplayer is almost unplayable without cheats to spawn stuff in. My personal experience with multiplayer up to now is dying from falling through water, spawning next to a tribe member, spawning in with no items after saving (two times) and not being able to see mobs/creatures that my friend can see. 
    Multiplayer is honestly one of the main reasons why I bought the game, so it's sad to see it not working correctly. However, it still is a new game so give it time and it will (hopefully) fix these bugs.

[*]Amazing graphics, story mode is intriguing, and game play is challenging. You go from moment of ""AHA!"" to ""I'm just going to throw myself off this cliff and end it now."" 
[*]Sound is as much a part of the game as what you see. 
[*]Survival is real and finding resources feels like you are truly stranded in a rain forest. 
[*]There is limited saves which forces the player to think and act cautiously. Actually, I'm revising this because I looked online and found that you create your save points by building shelters. I had been finding and sleeping in caves up to this point.
[*]Crafting is fluid and does not require a lot of trial in error. When you pick up something, your journal is updated with possible applications and the necessary ingredients.

[b]Cons:[/b]

[*]Control pad play seems more quirky than mouse and keyboard.
[*]Player has to resist going onine to get answers.
[*]Dehydration sets on fast, or at least time progression is very fast in the game.
[*]Machines with only 8g of ram will struggle even with video settings at it's lowest setting
[*]Very common problem and I had to search on line. To throw an item using mouse and keyboard control settings you must click and hold your center mouse wheel to and then let go of your center mouse wheel. If you don't have a mouse with a center mouse wheel I assume you have to remappap that control to an available button on the keyboard.

One of us just woke up from passing out due to exhaustion, we still need large sticks to finish our wall, there's a thunderstorm rolling in that will no doubt kill our pitiful fire, and a voice in my head screaming ""you're not good enough"". As we look at our shaky shack that looks like a strong wind could blow over, we hear footsteps in the trees behind us. I hardly get the words ""you hear that?"" out, when a spear wielding tribesman murders him. I attempt to swing my spear at him, but in my deep exhaustion, I miss horribly. My screen goes black - ""killed by thrust"". 

This is, without a doubt, the hardest, most rewarding, and most realistic survival simulator I've ever played. It fills you with a weird sense of pride when you accomplish something from building a fire to finding food (hunting, catching fish, etc).  I have HUNDREDS of hours in 7 Days to Die, but 2 hours in that game, you can be flourishing. Tons of food, tons of materials smelting in to bars, weapons, water, etc. This game is absolutely NOT like that. It WILL punish you over and over. Only purchase if you truly want a survival experience that will test you and your skill. Imagine being on the show 'Naked and Afraid'. This is pretty much it.

With all that being said, this game is poorly optimized. I can only assume the developers have no idea how to do anything that isn't plug and play.

3,Green Hell,49288257,english,"EDIT:
Well, what can I say. I think they really delivered on this one. I wrote this review well before they implemented base building and most other stuff on the roadmap and I still enjoyed it.

I left it laying about until shortly after they released 1.0. 

I played through story mode now and I gotta say: I love it. Cool story, pretty trippy and overall a very nice experience. 
I had a lot of fun with it. I especially like that you're not set on a timer, you can just play as you like, build as much as you want to and progress as you see fit. 
It took me about 80 in-game days to finish the story, but you can finish it a hell of a lot faster if you so wish.

It is pretty straight forward though, with minor puzzles along the way, look for something here, get this, bring it to location xyz. 
Nothing serious except for the last part where you can decide if the game has a good or a bad ending. Took me a while to figure out how to get to the good ending.

If you already know what you're doing and where to go to get stuff, story should be pretty short, I guess about 6 hours maybe.
I played a lot longer, I really took my time, built several bases all over the awesome, very beautiful map and tried to discover as much as I could while doing so.

I started a new survival mode game on hard right after finishing up story mode. Already sunk in quite a lot of hours and I still wanna play more.

This game is awesome and well worth the 20 bucks or whatever they ask for it, I recommend this 100%!



ORIGINAL:
It's a decent game... looks stunning, runs very nice. And it's pretty hard if you start out and don't know what to do... you're going to die in this game, which is cool. 
It's challenging for a while, a lot of stuff is going to end your journey pretty fast and you'll be like: wtf!?! 
I really liked that, but after some time you know what heals what, know what sound means danger, what to  scavenge... and at this point it gets kinda boring. I think this  game  simply lacks content, stuff to do. 

Base building would be nice... increased threat from the bad guys if you took out a dozen cause their singing in front of your place was just to much for you to handle, lol.

I played this for about six hours and I don't know what to do now. I need some kind of objective. Or something else to do besides eating and drinking all the time after I slept.  Or kill people...

All in all, it's really a decent, visually stunning game, they made a really nice, living jungle sandbox. 
This aspect  is really good. I'm looking forward to the story, it sounds really interesting and I am absolutely looking forward to this once they release it in 1.0  (more sh!t to do, hopefully, fuck people up who messed with Mia... whatever creates more content to keep you playing would be appreciated)

First attempt: got bitten repeatedly by a snake in the brush. Died.
Second attempt: tried to grab a poison dart frog for some reason. Died.
Third attempt: drank dirty water, got overwhelmed by parasites and badly dehydrated. No water. Died.
Fourth attempt: managed to collect some rainwater, and build a basic shelter, survived a couple days on mushrooms and bananas. Slowly going insane because of worms under my skin.

There are a lot of ways to die in Green Hell, and not a lot of ways to survive. That said, it's a hell of a lot of fun figuring out how things work, deciding on your next step, and struggling to pull it off, while not collapsing from exhaustion.

Being in a tropical climate, it rains a lot. When time to sleep, be sure you have a belly full of food and drink a gallon of water, in spite of the parasites it contains or, you'll die. If not, you wake up starving to death anyway and will die if you can't find a bushel basket full of some sort of unknown mushroom to eat. Then there's the parasites, again. Every five minutes, you have to stop and take a breath, eat, find something to drink or, that frkn watch beeps until you do. As for the character, movement is like some whimpy little boy that's always had mommy doing everything for him. Carry me mommy, I'm tired. Chop a tree, 3-5 hits he's wore slap out, needs to take a break and a nap. Come upon a log in your path, try to jump over it, it's like trying to scale the Empire State Building as if, it were some great effort to clear 12 inches of ground. Craft a hatchet with a stick and a stone, when it breaks, the character acts out as if that was supposed to be made out of cold-rolled steel and wasn't supposed to happen. If I could ever stop picking leeches off of me, I might get something done. Be sure to save your game every 5 minutes of progress. Have managed to survive 9 days now, no deaths and this is in Walk in the Park mode. 


On another note, be careful what you post, the developer is ban happy. 
Got a 30 day ban without a warning for telling someone they were ignorant. Steam rules are a warning, x3. Evidently, the developer doesn't like corrective criticism about his game, either. Reminds me of other fly-by-night developers. When they start banning people first off, they can always expect a negative review, especially from me. Take my money but, I can't have my say. Back in the day, sell me bullshit dope, I come back, kick your ass, get my money and whatever else you have. Still that way today but, without the dope. However, with all this bullshit digital online purchasing, they can get away with it, more-so, by hiding behind the Internet & Steam.


Due to the ignorant community and foreign nationals trying to think they're smarter than everyone from America, I still don't recommend this game. I wish they'd stop begging the USA for help every time they get their balls squeezed and grow a pair of their own.

Natives and wildlife can be a pain, but teaches you not to just run around wildly like in most other games - you have to watch everywhere you step, and keep you eyes and ears peels for tigers or natives.

69,Green Hell,66484408,english,"I bought it and played it this evening on quite capable hardware (8 cores, i7, respectable graphics hardware w/4GB VRAM, appropriate drivers). Reading other complaints about frame rate, it's apparent that this is just not a very well-optimized computer program.    Perhaps the developers are not using effective tricks to optimize 3D world projection.  Perhaps they are drawing all objects at maximum detail regardless of said objects' distance from the camera.  It should be possible to achieve a respectable frame rate for a game like this (at least 30FPS, which I think is more than adequate) with a fraction of what's required hardware-wise. Loved the Pepto-Bismol hot pink water, though!  Very funny!  (hint to devs: put fallback shaders in place).

The game suffers from a variety of interface issues, too: most glaringly, the inability to bind TURN left and TURN right to a key -- the developers apparently believed most players would want to use the mouse to ""steer"".  Also, the need to continually switch between the touchpad and the touch nipple for mouse input, the latter required when the C or F keys were depressed, along with the inconsistent use of the ""drop circle"" which sometimes turns green when an item could be dropped, sometimes didn't, detracted from the overall experience.  

The graphics settings must be set at the title page to confer any performance benefit in the game; simply changing them once the game has loaded and started seemed to have no effect on frame rate.  That in turn brings us to ridiculous load times of several minutes.

All in all, this program relies heavily on over-spec'ed hardware requirements for what it is to cover up for code deficiencies that could have been addressed with more efficient world rendering algorithms.  Trees, occupancy grids anyone?

I am mainly playing it for its educational value. In spite of the game's many shortcomings it does offer a decent Amazon survival story and I thus give it a ""recommended"" rating, 2.5 stars out of 5.",1585903456,1585943392,TRUE,0,2,0,3,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,3,2,719,0,225,1587414509,,

9,Green Hell,65895226,english,"After playing 80+ hours of this game I decided a review was in order (also felt a survival guide was needed so I made a video about that).  Green Hell lives up to the name.  If you download it right now, and don't watch any guides on youtube, or read any website articles about it or how to survive in it...you'll likely be dead inside 20min from food poisoning, snake bites, jaguar attacks, parasites...and i don't just mean one of those...it'll likely be all of them...at once...

This game has found a way to make surviving feel like ""SURVIVING.""  The game itself is against you. From the moment you spawn into a new game, you are slowly dying.  Your nutrients are dropping, leeches are latching on to you, food can be scarce at times, clean water is literally no where to be found unless you boil it or collect rain water.  The deeper you go in the jungle, the higher your chance of coming across natives that want you dead, or hungry Jaguars that need a quick snack.  Gathing food and resources means braving those same jungles and risking snakes and spiders, and if you don't know how to treat those wounds and cure the poison, you'll die or be close to death.  

The sounds that emanate from the jungle itself will stop you in your tracks questions what it was you just heard...was that distant thunder, or the low growl of a jungle cat about to pounce...did I just hear footsteps of an Armadillo, or an approaching predator. After my first 5-10 hrs of this game...i felt like crawling up in the fettle position and just waiting in my camp to see how many days it would take for me to die there. 

Graphically its beautiful.  Sometimes frame rate will drop, but i don't care.  There are times when playing when the sun is just coming up and the light first cracks through the canopy.  You can hear the crackle of your fire slowly dying out.  You'll think to yourself ""WOW...how can a GAME be this beautiful"" and all you want to do is admire it the art work for what it is....but then....you hear a jaguar roar in the distance, then lightning and thunder crack in the distance, as something rustles in the bushes behind you and you realize that you don't have time to appreciate the art work of the game, b/c that game is still trying to kill you.  

I don't like doing ratings like 9/10 or 10/10 b/c i think thats a bogus stat.  

Did I get my moneys worth: Yes.  80 hrs in and still going strong.  So long as hours play exceeds dollars spent...its was worth it.
Is it replayable: Yes.  Every time you start a survival, you spawn in a different location.  Each location has its own unique challenges...I've had games where i spawn in and get killed by a jaguar or native within 20 minutes...I've also survived 21 days without incident.
How much content is in the game:  I've played 80hrs and still haven't crafted all items, or eaten every type of animal in the game.
How does it compare to other games in the genre:  Is far as I'm concerned, Green Hell is redefining what it means to be a survival game.  Some people call DayZ a survival game, but you can load into DayZ and have all the best weapons and gear inside 3 hours and start to dump on people just spawning in for the first time...in Green Hell you'll play for 5-10 hrs, and start to craft high end ""armor"" (armadillo shell with banana leaves and rope) but it has such crap durability you'll probably still die from a jaguar attack.  Meanwhile everytime you leave camp to get food, you don't know if theres a hungry cat or angry native waiting for you, or whether you'll return to your camp where a hungry cat or angry native is waiting for you...and did i mention you have to BUILD SAVE POINTS from material you gather in the jungle....good times

36,Green Hell,65502342,english,"This is a great game, although bits of it still feel incomplete. Some advice: avoid spoilers for both the story and the gameplay (e.g. crafting recipes). It's extremely satisfying to think about what you need, what should work to make it, and then try to create it. The crafting system sort of hints you along without giving much away, and is probably the best I have ever seen. The combat system generally feels quite good and realistic, though it is very, very easy in the end. I don't think I ever had to treat a combat injury, just the occasional venomous bite. Oh, small warning -- this guy cannot jump. Be very careful going off ledges, even small ones.

 Some minor complaints: they used a different crafting system for structures than items, so none of the structures can be figured out on your own, you must find existing structures to blueprint them (or possibly level your crafting skill until they unlock? I'm not sure on that one). I think some of the more ""invention""-y structures should actually be made with the same crafting system as items. You'll likely see what I mean, there are at least three structures that anyone with a passing knowledge of survival skills will think of making long before they find them in the world.

There are also definitely some things you *should* be able to make that you cannot, and those are probably the most frustrating thing about the actual gameplay. For example, there is currently no blowpipe, which would be much easier to make than some of the other weapons that are included. Another minor negative - you cannot delete/destroy most existing structures, which can get in the way of interesting base building.

FYI, the ending of the game is open-ended, so be prepared for the most important questions being left unanswered. The overall story is very good, but the ending is not really satisfying. You'll also likely feel ""ahead"" of the protagonist for a lot of the story, which makes bits pretty frustrating as he says things you know are not true and he should not be saying given the information he has.

71,Green Hell,64983034,english,"If you're a fan of games like The Forest but felt that you were missing out on some added challenge, Green Hell might just be the game for you! 

With an interesting setting and a compelling, surprisingly complex story, Green Hell delivers on almost all fronts. My biggest issue is that it is still a bit buggy, and much of your survival relies on trial and error. Certain situations call for specific items in your bag (a bone needle to take out a worm, and then a bandage to protect the wound for example) that aren't fully given to the player. While this is fine, I do feel that an expanded tutorial or hint system would go a long way to preventing some of the frustration I experienced during my first 2 hours. 

Beyond that, though, the game is very immersive and I love the extra mechanics of self-inspection and sanity. I would love to see these expanded upon in future updates!

To summarize, Green Hell is like a tougher version of The Forest with fewer hints. If you're up to the challenge, it'll be perfect for you! But if you're not used to the tougher aspects of the genre, you should try watching a playthrough first to see if it seems to be more of your speed.

73,Green Hell,64969626,english,"At first I thought this game was realistic and challenging.

But the more I play it, the more it feels like a ""Guide-Dang-It"" game.

For example: want to collect clean water?  You basically have to have a coconut.  There's almost no other way to get clean water that I've found.  I expected to be able to form a cup from a banana leaf, or use some empty tin cans I found, but nope, coconut.  What's worse is that you have to attack green coconuts with a weapon while *not* holding them to make them useful, rather than using the crafting system like everything else.  Good luck figuring that out without a guide.

Another example: You can pretty much only use bird's nests to create the ember to start a fire.  Want to use the traditional method of finely shaving a stick?  Too bad.  Want to use some dry leaves?  Too bad.

Because the game doesn't give you the recipes at the beginning (you have to discover them, one way or another), it should encourage experimentation.  But since there's only ever one way to do things, experimentation is simply an exercise in frustration.

Where to start?... well, it's just... boring.   Not that many things to craft, unless you want to build a giant complicated hut, but if you want to do that, buy Raft, it's more fun.   Every day is an annoying search for food, and that's after you manage to get past 10+ initial attempts to get through Day 1 and build a basic shelter to save the game (what idiot thought that was a good idea?  Oh, I guess to make a game that was completely boring otherwise somewhat of a challenge?).   

The terrain is boring, nothing really to do or explore...just gather... eat... collect water... sleep.... walk around and find nothing.... eat...collect water... build a fire.... cook... sleep... wake up.... walk around and find nothing interesting....

Anyone that has played any kind of survival game should be able to pick this game up and do well with a bit of common sense. 

That being said there was a few things in the game I found lacking however. The AI and pathing are fairly poor. Examples of this are npcs not entering structures, crossing rivers, pathing around logs exc. It would also be nice to see more types of wildlife. The day/night cycle I found to be somewhat faster then I like, but this is minor. Survival mode would be a lot more fun with a different map and perhaps a larger area to explore.(more so to this point with coop) Once you have gone through the story mode a few times it makes survival mode trivial I felt.

The survival demands are not too crazy and the give a few ways to preserve your character so you aren't constantly watching your stats every second. 

The jungle density and map sizes are enough that you can easily get lost, but they provide a realistic mapping and coordinate means to keep on track (no arrow of you on map, which I like, so you need to stop and think for a second to find your place).

-a few tips below-

Build a shelter right away, you can use it to save (look above the shelter). I went two days playing the game thinking it was perma-death before realising you need to look above the shelter to see the save option.

You can throw stones in your inventory with the G key.

Don't run. If you absolutely must, make sure it's a clear path, running blind through the brush is almost always a sure death, as it should be. And just because it's the river doesn't mean running in it is safe, you'll see why eventually.

Don't run from big cats, they'll get you from behind, back away.

Don't randomly eat things you aren't sure of, make sure you have a good store of safe food, water, and a place to sleep off sickness before you try to test things out. 

Save your painkillers, you can't make any more and they're instant cures for those times when you're already injured or dying and end up getting bit. And always keep a few cures/bandages with you.

Injured animals often run off and die with your spear/arrow stuck in them. So wander around and you may still find their corpse. 

Head-shots are instant kills.

All natives don't like you. Messing with the natives is dangerous, but rewarding. Their gear is often very good. They have certain boundaries they won't cross, so you can keep them distant, but arrows can still kill you fast.

Even the weakest armour is great at keeping you from harm.",1556861726,1583737836,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,342,63,8006,0,1483,1583473608,,

Just to save the game you need to build a hut. You need to sleep to regain some energy that you wasted trying to survive. You need to find ways to build numerous tools that make your life easier in the Amazonian Jungle by exploring the areas......

Then what exactly do people expect from survival games nowdays? This is a SURVIVAL game...

► Of course you'll need to battle the elements. Of course you need to fight against the local Tribesmen not only for territorial purposes but also to grab the necessary blueprints for tools and weapons. Yes you will have to become a time manager and get your rusty brain moving because this is not a simple linear game. You need to start THINKING. The core of pc games (back in the day) was that the player needed to think and to be challenged. So start enjoying and stop complaining. Enough of you people. Play Mario or something and leave that game for us that can appreciate the realistic simulation and the managerial portions of it.

I have written 61 hours in that game and i own it since the PRE-ALPHA version when half of what we have now in game where not available. I haven't played for 4 months and when i launched it again, i have forgotten how good it was and how solid it played. This game is addicting and makes you stick with it constantly unless you have no idea what survival stands for. You have to find ways to explore, plan your daily expeditions and each day that you get off your base, make it a mission. This is not a sandbox game. There are 4 different levels of hardness, as also a custom level that you can enable or disable elements.

✔ Everyone that owns that game, needs to know the basics. The only way of that happening without watching videos online, is by playing the fantastic story mode. This is more fulfilling than snooping through videos cause the game itself gives you the sense of accomplishing something when you learn something new. Get familiar with the simplistic UI, the mechanics that are easy as a childsplay and the Jungle that can easily disorient you even if you are going straight. Also this is a game that after many years of drought and lack of imagination by the companies, gave us a solid, serious, well written and MAJESTIC STORY.

❌ Don't get me wrong. The game is fantastic BUT it needs heavy optimizing. All machines are going to struggle running it.

► We are excited for all the future updates as also for the coop mode. Playing that Gem of a game with friends is an awesome idea, BUT!!! If the devs ever decide on an MMO Open World gameplay (something like GTA V), is going to kill that experience.

31,Green Hell,64156543,english,"If you want to experience a game that gives you the thrills of bushcraft survival in the jungle, this is for you. It is excellently balanced, survival will give you a serious challenge, until you know your way around all the local plants and animals, how to treat different wounds and afflictions, and most importantly staying sane while at it.  

Crafting and building is fun, even if tedious, but it makes sense. Just remember to take a little time playing, as exploring may fast become very dangerous and you will need to build a shelter to save the game. Nevertheless exploring is the most interesting and fun aspect of the story mode, and it will keep you going.

I understand that the current plants and animals follow game mechanics, but coconuts and bananas don't exist in the deep brazilian jungle. This way it is a little easier in the beginning as you actually recognize safe plants, which makes for a better gaming experience, but I would have preferred a more realistic flora, so we would even learn something.

The the learning curve is a little steep at the beginning. Watching a few videos before diving in would be my advise.

I really recommend this!

Plus everything you make LOOKS like the stuff you made it from. A basic axe looks like you jammed a sharp stone in a split stick using tree vine to hold it together. Same with buildings, no perfectly crafted walls. It's an experience I think everyone should try, in the dark, with headphones on. 

Disappear into the Jungle and let your sanity level go down a bit, you'll be surprised how well they make you question your own sanity, won't say more though. It's better not to read what happens first, just get in and try it out!

Yes I  recommend it.
Have played some 520 hours now and it is just getting better .
So many improvements.

I have played it for many hours  straight and the only frames drop is an occasional bump or jerk in the game .
I'm running an Intel i5 with 3.4GHz
1060 GTX NVidia with 3 gig onboard.
16 gig of ram.
Windows 7x64 prof
2 TB Sata HDD. 
Power supply unit 850 w corsair.
The developers have been very hard at work fixing everything for us with quick responses explanations, and they listen.. 
It is early access but is more than halfway finished now.

Well all I can add if you really love survival then this is one of the best.
However!  it still has learning curb and like any game without effort you may get hurt and die.
Green Hell works with Macro Elements setting it out from other survival.
Macro Elements= player must learn to how to manage  proteins Carbs Fats water. 
We now have 3 levels to choose from.
A Walk In the Park allows the player to experience survival with nature itself learn the skills and what native animals  / plants to watch out for. 

Then try the normal mode Welcome to the Jungle level where you will experience the whole game with tribes/ predators and sanity.
Keep both levels and switch between them.

This game is unlike any other survival game I have played , it takes some players time to realize the only goal is explore learn and survive against very real and lifelike predators.

If you have ever watched Lost or Naked and Afraid.
Build shelter find food and water craft your tools explore.. Watch out for spiders snakes but they give a warning sound when near by.
It's so addictive, failure is not option for many players who then get frustrated as the only way was to learn by their mistakes and start again.  
Save  manually often reload when you die, learn, move on and avoid. :)
Save is possible only when building a small shelter, or a roof.

There is no mods or quick fixes.
Use your compass and save .
Look at the great Steam /Youtube guides first !!!

If you experience any dizziness as  the FOV is very immersive, simply .
Press the tilt key for the frames to displayed.

3. you have to cut ever tree down to have the resources to build, only as justification to scold you for cutting down all of the trees.

but, when i accidentally stumbled to the ending of the game 
( yes by accident ) i found out, tho i had not started to build any thing yet, i was yield at by ""Mia"" for my part in cutting down the rain forest. to top it off now that i am only building ( since the story is not ruined for me ) i am finding the game is set up so that you HAVE to cut every thing down to have enough to build with.

All my storage boxes were empty, my backpack was empty and my fps dwindled from my standard 60 to 3.

Maybe the devs should have spent some more time testing. If you look at the forum, there are a ton of reported bugs and glitches with their 'release'.

90,Green Hell,63393388,english,"This game does a great job of capturing the feel of being in a jungle.  I actually get itchy IRL while playing this from walking through the dense underbrush.  The story in the story mode was great.

Biggest downside would be the enormous learning curve.  Other than the most basic of mechanics covered in the tutorial, you're completely on your own to figure everything out.  There's nothing explaining how to get safe water, what effect plants have, which plants are actually harvestable, what different bandages do, etc.  The better way to put it is you'll inevitably get injured and be clueless how to treat it, such as treating a venomous wound, a rash, a large red bump (burrowed worm), etc.  

To some degree the game expects you to just wander aimlessly grabbing things and eating them.  Once you do part of the effects will appear in your journal, assuming you're still alive.  There are also craftable recipes you only learn by finding the crafted version of the item in the world, but if you know the recipe you can make it at any point.  It's kind of an awkward mechanic.

Considering that your character is supposed to be experienced in this jungle, figuring out the basics shouldn't be such a trial and error thing.  You're better off having the wiki up the whole time, since you'll spend the first 10 hours very frustrated not knowing how to handle basic things.

Once you finally learn those basics, though, the game is fun.  The world is fairly interesting to explore and there's an ever-present sense of danger that's done well.

The game is hard, immersive, avoids hand holding, is pretty and overall well structured. You can have a lot of fun exploring the maps and learning the several mechanics of the game. The Story mode is well made, but short, and sadly focuses little on actually playing the game.

The problems start when you've done all that - which is something you can do in a fairly short amount of time. The game offers little replay-ability, and in general little incentive to keep going in survival mode once you are established. Building your dream base is hindered by the fact that the game is very picky about where you can place what. While immersive at first, the sanity and hygiene systems grow to be nuisances.

8/10, great game.  It's very immersive, and the map is beautiful for sure.  The survival mechanics are good, and there's lots to do.

32,Green Hell,55894075,english,"BLUF: Game is needlessly difficult and has a lot of bugs. Will likely recommend in future, just not in present state. 

The game is made incredibly difficult, not by the designed challenges of the game, but by the inherent inefficiencies of the game's mechanics. Example: Game can only be saved in a shelter, but entering a shelter does not save the game. Crafting is very difficult, just because you have to open a backpack menu, then a crafting menu, then specific backpack pockets just to craft an item. Game has a ""blueprint"" and experience system, but even common objects (Ex: Spears) cannot be crafted at start.  Shelters require leaves to craft BUT NOT THOSE LEAVES ONLY SPECIFIC KINDS. Simple tools require stones, but for some reason stones are hard to find OUTDOORS. Literally everything can kill you (it is a jungle), but predators can be found every square meter. I have only played for a few hours, but the lack of a decent tutorial makes the game incredibly unforgiving, even compared to similar games such as The Forest and The Long Dark. I have read that ""natives"" can destroy your constructions even without giving you a chance to defend them. Realistic perhaps, but not fun. 

Last point: I'm running the game on a very high end computer. Nevertheless, the game has strangely long loading times, random low FPS, and crashing.

EDIT (after playthrough): Still not recommended. If you like Long Dark or the Forest, this will be equally interesting. Needs improvements, most notably more content. The maps are very small and easy to memorize, which degrades the ""lost in the jungle"" feeling.

I played through the story in ""Walk In The Park"" mode which takes a lot of the more nightmarish dangers out of the picture, but there's still plenty of ways to die for the unwary or undisciplined.

While traveling overland I found myself continuously aware of my macronutrient depletion rate and was anxious to get to my destination so I could set up a small camp and craft some food.

49,Green Hell,62548916,english,"TL;DR - tasks require such specific tools to accomplish that it is near impossible to do anything.  I was unable to start a fire, drink, cook, or build shelter.  When there is a task, the first 5 ways you'd think to accomplish it won't work, and you'll give up.  Also, if you do something you'd think would work, but doesn't, the game doesn't explain why.  This should still be considered an early access game.

This game is awful.  You die of magical, invisible, or invincible enemies.   You need the exact perfect tool to do each task, but it doesn't tell you how to make those items, and you can't just do what you'd do in real life.  It is extremely frustrating.  

I needed water, and it says you have to cook water to avoid getting parasites.  So I found a pot.  Can a pot be picked up to fill with water?  Nope.  It's static.  Can I roll up banana leaves to carry water to the pot?  Nope.  I ended up having rain fill the pot, but you can't drink that water, there's no option.  It says to make a fire under it, but it won't let me start a fire.

The tutorial shows you how to start a fire.  You make a bonfire, use a firestarter bow, put tinder on it, and start an ember that you place in the fire.  The UI makes it difficult, but it works.  Once the real game starts, it doesn't work.  Whenever you get an ember going, your character just yelps, and the tinder is refunded to your inventory.  So you can't start a fire in the game.  I tried at least 10 times.  I do not know why it didn't work.  That isn't explained.

Spiders can fly, and they're invincible.  They also don't have to get within 10 feet of you to bite you, and if they do, you die.  Other animals have asspull reasons you cannot combat them, because I bet you need a specific tool to kill each one.  I found a crab in the stream that is like 6 inches across.  So I went to whack it with a spear, but it can run faster than I can sprint and stays perfectly out of reach, magically.  Like I have a bubble around me that pushes it exactly too far away.  I found a scorpion, and I had to stand right on it and crouch to poke it with my spear.  If it was six inches from me, it was too far to hit.  Similar with a snake, I had to be the diameter of its coiled body away.

If you drink water from a stream, you get worms.  It tells you you need a bone needle to remove them.  Can you use a knife?  No.  Why?  Dunno.  The water also doesn't hydrate you.  And how do you make a bone needle?  Not with bones and a rock.  Not with bones and a knife.  Not with bones and a piece of obsidian.  Not with bones and an axe.  No idea.  So you die.

88,Green Hell,62157666,english,"I don't often write reviews (and not with less than 100 hours of gameplay), but I feel compelled to here. Green Hell is basically the survival game I've been looking for.

To sum it up, it combines the required patience of The Long Dark with the native threat of The Forest (without being... as obnoxious), plus base building elements very similar to ARK.

The survival elements are broad. Your overall health is determined primarily by fullness and hydration. Food is broken down into proteins, carbohydrates, and fat.s Your overall stamina is determined by sleep. Might sound easy enough until you start hurling numerous venomous critters in there. From spiders to snakes to stingrays, you have to watch (and listen) where you're going. Predators may be hunting you, not to mention the violent faction of natives. Eating unknown substances may land you a new food source or cure, land you in bed, or just outright kill you, especially if you are unprepared. Sanity is a very real thing. And it's fleshed out (*side eye* e-hem). The first time you experience your character's sanity dip below the threshold is unnerving. As it drops lower, it can greatly affect your ability to do certain things.

The crafting system is very similar to The Forest. If you've played that, you will understand it. If you haven't it may be a little unintuitive, but the tutorial explains the basics. Cooking is necessary and the system is pretty intuitive. Preparing things in different ways often has different effects. Something that may be poisonous raw may become edible in a stew, for instance. There is food spoilage. Inventory management is also a thing. The backpack is a slot system that harkens back to, say, Diablo (but much prettier). You can rearrange, stack, turn, and organize to your liking. This becomes important as your inventory fills up. There is also weight. As far as navigation: There is a map. It's not given to you out of the gate. It doesn't mark where you are. There is a compass and GPS coordinates. If you understand navigation, you're all set. If you don't, it's time to learn. As far as the game map: it's a lot larger than I expected, honestly.

The AI is good. The natives will try to flank you and going in all RPG hack & slash on more than one will probably leave you dead or greatly wounded. Predators don't just run at you like crazed animals, stalking you much like in The Long Dark. Prey will run. The stealth mechanics are intuitive. Sneak up on your prey and you can get in closer for a kill shot. Or to avoid conflict. Headshots are a thing on everything. This can be critical to your survival.

The game isn't flawless. There are bugs. That said, the game is out of early access but it's not ""finished"". They are updating and bug squashing regularly.

I do recommend playing through the story. I was very surprised how good it was (and how close to home it hit) and would definitely play through it again. It gives you the basics of the game at the beginning and after that, there really isn't any hand-holding. They just kind of plop you in and say, ""Cool. Seeee ya later, bye!"" And you have to figure things out on your own.

Both Story and Survival modes have presets. Survival mode allows some customization. You can choose permadeath in both.

6,Green Hell,61993415,english,"While many mechanics of this game are great, I must give negative review because of two main reasons:

Game is really unforgiving towards new players, tutorial is really lacking and from the beginning you are dying from so many reasons, while you dont know how to deal with them. (In my case, mostly poison)
Which is big problem because of next reason:

Horrible save system. 
Saving only in sleeping tents (which you must build first) is horrible idea. If you die when exploring, you die from random snake bite or your game crashes, you have to re-play maybe several hours of playing.
You dont have time to play several hours at once?  Dont even start, because you cannot save on game exit.

Good solution for that would be auto-save feature, or at least backup save when exiting game (which you cannot load manually, if you insist of keeping this mechanics).

Similar mechanics is in Fallout 4 survival, when save is created on exiting game and deleted after you load game.

I would really love to give this game positive review, but after having to re-do several hours of gameplay multiple time, Iam frustrated to the point of deleting game.

If they add some better save mechanics, I will gladly return to this game.

[h1] Full review [/h1]

[b]Graphics: 8 [/b]
Why: Decent textures, models, lights. Looks and feels pretty good for an indie game.
Why not 10: Doesn't have graphics of 2019 - no ray tracing support and other advanced techniques.

[b] Audio: 9 [/b]
Why: Sounds are realistic. Items, walking, jumping, environment sound pretty good. You'll feel like in jungle.
Why not 10: There are few (or almost no) soundtracks in the game.

[b] Gameplay: N/A [/b]
Why: Haven't finished it yet to know all the game mechanics and scenario. Will update after finishing.
Note: The game can sometimes be so addicting, that you may ignore the main mission and start building and living your own life in a beach.

[b] UI/UX: 7 [/b]
Why: Generally UI fits well into the theme.
Why not 10: Menus could be improved to be accessible easier. Not very intuitive to go to notebook to build buildings, traps, fire. Takes some (little) time to get used to.
Below is a personal opinion, which was not counted in the in the score.
Instead of 3 scales for fats, carbs, etc there could be 2 scales - Nutritions (call it anything), and Energy. In that case each food could give both - X nutritions and Y energy. 
That would make things a little bit easier to [i]track[/i]. Yet could be implemented in a way so that it did [i]not[/i] make the gameplay easier.

[b] Simulation: 10 [/b] 
Why: Get used to dying. There are plenty of ways to die, and they are all very realistic. 
Crafting and buildings are diverse. You could learn some real survival skills from the game, which may be useful in forests and jungles.
Why not 10: Well, what?

[h1] The Game [/h1]

Here are the first impressions from the game after 10 hours.
The main game starts [spoiler] after the wife gets lost. Checkpoint. [/spoiler]
Jumped off the cliff, as if it were GTA. Dead. Restarted from the last checkpoint. 
Jumped from few meters. Dead. Restart. 
Jumped from 1-2 meters. Got wounded (yes, alive!). Ignored it. Walked through jungles. The wound got infected from dirt. Got sick of it. Dead. Restart.
This time didn't try to test jumping. Oh, great, found a cave! Lets check it. Scorpion bites. Didn't notice it. It bites again. Poisoned. Seeing how life goes down, can't find leafs/mushrooms with antivenom properties. Dead. Restart.
Oh, lets build! Building a hut... Forgot about drinking water. Thirsty! Ocean water nearby. Argh, its too dirty! Got parasites. Ignored. Continued to build. Hut is almost ready, whooray! Lets eat banana... with dirty hands! Got more parasites. Thirsty, again! Drunk that bad water. Got lots of parasites. Got sick of it. Dead. Restart.
Lets do it right this time - food, building, water etc. Not wounded, got only few parasites, half on food - its okay. Lets explore the beautiful jungles! Nice! Heey I see lizard! Lets hunt it. Got it! Oh, got tired and sleepy. Hut is not nearby. Lets sleep in the jungle... under a heavy rain. Woke up. Had fever. Can't treat it. Dead. Restart.
Oh, and these is only the beginning. Haven't yet seen those tribes, big animals, fishes, snakes... which will kill me too!

I loaded into a survival world, as I wasn't quite ready to do the story until I knew what I was doing. I was dropped into the rain forest with a clue what to do. The game doesn't give a flying fart on how well I did, and I adored that. This game truly embraces the sort of, ""figure it out on your own"" ideology, and it works in a splendid manner.

Many survival games in similar circles allow you to get hurt, you fight nature and even some enemies while crafting items and tools to help you get to the next day. Great sounds fun, lets dig in! Green Hell takes survival to a whole new level! You are struggling to find food, not everything is safe to eat. You could eat a bad mushroom and become poisoned, you stay poisoned for days in-game unless you find an herb, that you don't yet recognize, that cures food poisoning. All while you are puking out your guts about every thirty seconds and your life is steadily dropping. If you do life through it, you are not dehydrated and need FRESH water. All that is around you is dirty and unsafe water. You get desperate and drink the dirty water. You get a parasite. Now you have to find a way to rid yourself of that before it kills you. Guess what, no idea what does that yet! Trial and error is the key to this game that is both your savior and your ultimate demise. And you are doing this Russian Roulette of survival all while avoiding violent natives that are not happy you are in their forest, and natural predators like large cats. Did I mention you also have a sanity bar and will pass out if you don't sleep? Yeah that is a thing. Sanity gets too low, voice are now a huge distraction and constant in your day to day life. If you pass out on the ground you get leeches and worms burrow into your skin and you lose more sanity if you do not remove them. Worms do not go easily like leeches either. You have to find a way to remove them. 

So would I recommend this game that tortures you at literally every possible point it can? A solid YES! On top of all that punishment it is so much fun with the amount of crafting involved, the trial and error is close to real, but do not use in real life!

The map is not nearly as open world as TLD, and it's a lot smaller too. Gameplay/survival mechanics are good, controls are slightly awkward (and unfortunately not really well suited to a Steam controller or Xbox style controller, which is a shame). Sound design is really good and you definitely have to use your ears to survive, as well as your eyes and your brain. 

Overall this is worth the purchase, and I hope this developer makes a follow up - with a few small tweaks to the controls (and adding FULL controller support), maybe more of an open world sandbox and less of an on-rails map oriented around a story, you'd have a really killer ""pure survival"" game on your hands with a lot of replayability.

76,Green Hell,61261576,english,"**STORY MODE REVIEW**

This mode is specifically for the story, as I haven't played Survival Mode since months before release.

PROS:
- The story provides direction, which is a great way to see new places and put the setting and plot together in an interesting way. 
- Voice acting is great! All of the characters are believable and no one threw off the immersion.
- The visuals are quite pretty. Seeing the moonlight spill through the rainforest canopy over a waterfall is quite pleasing.
- Nothing is better in a game than a feeling of challenge and growth. In the beginning of the game, I'd died several times, learning from each mistake, and each step became cautious until, by the end, I was the King of the Jungle.
- The survival aspect is difficult initially, but once you are set up, it is realistic in some ways. I like the ""macronutrient"" aspect, rather than just ""food"". You can't ONLY live off of one food type and expect maximum health.
- Crafting system is interesting and fun.

CONS:
- The story may provide direction, but it also means that there's no point in making a big, long-term base. I made two of them in my 20ish hours of gameplay, and they only served to slow me down, force me to constantly return to the same location. Survival Mode is probably the only time that it's worth building an extensive base.
- Despite the added variety since I played it pre-release, to TRULY get the Amazon immersion, I feel there isn't nearly enough variety in fauna and flora.
- The hardest part is not getting surprised and bitten by something venomous. I found the hostile tribe easy to handle, and there aren't many animals that can hunt you, and they aren't difficult to scare off or kill either.
- Optimization could use some improvement. I was averaging 30 fps on medium settings with a GTX 1060 with some stuttering at times.
- Towards the end of the story, things kinda drag. There are two endings, and the bad ending is more interesting and intense than the good ending.
- Green. So much green. Really, it gets irritating after awhile.

In conclusion, Green Hell is a solid survival game. When compared to The Forest, which in my experience would be the closest comparison, Green Hell's focus on realistic survival rather than horror aspects serves in its favor. I hope to see more variety in the environment in future updates (or sequels), and perhaps some interaction between the animals and/or plants. I've never seen a jaguar take down a capybara, or a snake bite a tapir, or a parrot eating berries--all which would make the jungle feel alive on its own.

I've played many survival games. It's one of my favorite genres to play and after enjoying ""The Forest"" to it's full extent ever since it was out in early access during Alpha, still talking about The Forest here, I can say that Green Hell has a good standard to live up to. 
That being said, Green Hell is everything you wanted in a survival game. Challenging survival in an atmosphere that not only tests your ability to keep very aware of your surroundings and punishes you gravely if you fail to do so. 
You can play the game on various settings and if you're an experienced survival game player, then I'd recommend you play through the story on ""King of The Jungle"". It's challenging and holds a decent learning curve that'll be sure to kill you a handful of times before you realize just how careful you have to be.

The Story is amazing. A wonderful narrative with great voice acting and wonderful lore documents around the world to piece in the extra bits between the cutscenes of information that you're given. Enough is shown so you know what's going on but enough is needed to be discovered to truly see the full spectrum of what's going on.

TLDR: Great Story, great mechanics, great game..


Shouldn't:
Do not buy this game if you're wanting to pick up a survival game casually to enjoy in small portions of time here and there. This game requires you to have a good premise of survival game mechanics as well as a well-rounded perspective on crafting. It doesn't come with a crafting recipe book. You need to learn through experimenting with various things and finding already made things along the way.


Does it seem bias? Sure, I really want you to buy this game, but isn't that why you're reading this review? So you can find a reason to buy it? Do it. Love it.",1577997788,1578064216,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,314,6,1335,0,895,1593033306,,

22,Green Hell,60424496,english,"Green Hell has a lot of potential but needs to be more balanced. Having played multiple hours I would definitely recommend- but only for those who are happy to use the custom difficulty settings. 

On standard difficulty there is too much of a grind and it makes the game fall short of a fun experience. If the developers adjust the sanity and nutrition mechanics though i would be happy to highly recommend. 

Firstly the sanity mechanic: it is very annoying trying to enjoy the game play when you have a constant drone of negative voices in your head and while i agree its a interesting implimentation, it is way overdone and once the sanity meter falls below a certain level its near impossible to alter.

Secondly the food mechanic is too hard- having to constantly hunt and drink need to be toned down by about 50% as it seriously distracts from exploring or progressing the story line.

i do like the depth of the game, the farming and base building and once i used the custom settings to address these flaws I found the  story line very captivating. Its a beautiful looking game and has a lot of polish.

1. Multiplayer (apparently coming).

26,Green Hell,50295805,english,"Green Hell is Early Access done right. I picked this game up back in mid-November 2018. I've been relatively active in the Discussion Board community for this game as well as floating around the Discord community as well. 

The game is still Early Access and the single player story mode has not been implemented nor has the co-op mode present yet. Both are coming at or after full release. 

The game at this point is single player endless survival. This review is written at the time of v0.5.5 which is after the mud update. 

If you've played any of the other survival games that have been big or had looked promising when in Early Access (think The Forest, Stranded Deep), Green Hell seems to be a very happy blend of the two. Plenty of combat opportunity against the natives, big cats, and caimans while the environment is equally if not deadlier than the predators. 

This is not the ""lets chop down half the forest and build a massive walled off fortress compound. With the mud update, yes you can build some interesting homes, but it would get awfully repetitive to just build a massive system of modular structures. I have a fair-sized mud home with a few fire places, weapon rack, several storage bins, furnace, bed, shower, mud water filter, and so forth. I've also built an outer building for food drying. It took several hours to build both of the buildings due to food gathering and cooking, hygiene maintenance, supply gathering and dealing with a few threats.

As an Early Access player, I've had to restart my game a few times due to major changes and some issues with save files. I am currently using an older save file with no issues. The Developer team has been incredibly communicative with the community. I've personally made comments in Discord where members of the Dev team have reached out to me privately requesting my save file, so they can look at the issue. The Creepy Jar team has been doing a phenomenal job fixing existing issues while working to implement the next big update and get closer and closer to full release. 

I've put over 120 hours into this game. I'm pretty sure that I've done just about everything there is to currently do. Prior to the mud update, I didn't think I'd want to ""start over"" since I am not the best candidate for excessively grindy gaming, but I opted to. It was so rewarding. I have more than gotten my money's worth for this game. If I got a solid 20 hours of enjoyment, I'd have been happy. I have gotten way more than that. 

One final note that I think is important. When I started playing, I died repeatedly within the first 48 hours in game. As I started off, I began by darting through the jungle to race the daylight clock, *BAM*, I got tagged by a venomous snake. I couldn't find the needed materials to treat the venom wound. Dead. Started over again. I just couldn't get a camp and fire going. When dehydration was imminent, I opted to restart. Third time I figured would be a charm, however, I antagonized some locals (natives) and was murdered with extreme prejudice. I was at my wit's end. I logged off and discovered that my 2 hours of play time was up. The game was mine. Forever. Thank goodness it was. I went back in and operated on ""Naked and Afraid"" survival priorities and once I stuck to my order of operations based on the new prioritization I came up with, I was met with success. 

I can't wait to play through single player story mode and play some co-op with a friend.

Update: 12/29/19 I believe it's version 1.3.1

I've played through Story Mode and part way through, I spent quite a bit of time messing around with the farming, multi-level building and new modular & mud options. The story was excellent. Obviously for anyone who has spent as much time as some have with Early Access, it won't take long to get through the story as far as knowing locations and knowing how to cope with the general game mechanics. However, the story is still great and was worth going through it. If you're new, it will certainly add additional interest to the whole survival game play!

The new areas were exciting to visit too. I'm looking forward to starting a survival save file (once Co-Op is available) and see what the new areas look like in just the survival version. 

Love the farming, multi-level building and the new options with half walls, side doorways, etc. 

Creepy Jar continues to impress.

63,Green Hell,60538296,english,"Unfortunately, I start to get motion sick in a few minutes of playing.
It seems to be something to do with the FoV settings and the coloring of the objects.

Other than that, the game is similar to The Forest but with sickness and on a much higher difficulty.
Pros:
- Graphics are good for the price of the game.
- Seems like you can do and craft many things.
- Story seems like it might be good.

Cons:
- Too much work is needed to craft: requires too much materials and it takes too many minutes to build a campfire--as if I am trying to building one IRL...
- UI is a bit difficult/annoying to use (too many ""tabs"" to choose from)
- Too many sicknesses
- It seems like every animal has some sort of DoT effect (poison, etc.), which I will say--as a biologist--most animals don't product toxins, even the animals that rapidly evolve on isolated islands. 
- Most animals are harmful--again, this is false IRL as most animals will run or ignore you unless they plan to eat you...
- The player's view looks similar to what a GoPro video/image looks like--a bit bent/convex--which is difficult for people who easily get motion sickness.

I can't say much more since I only played a few minutes of the game.

[Advise to the developers:]
Learn some zoology and evolution or watch Planet Earth/Blue Planet because it seems like they want to make this game as realistic as possible (at least on the crafting). 
The animals in this game don't make any sense biologically in these ways (and more):
- Animals (including humans) will not attack another unless there is gain or if they are being threatened (unless they are curious). Running pass a animal in this game will result in it attacking you.
- Attacking another without gain is a huge risk to an individual (and potentially its own population) because there is a large chance that the individual will get hurt in the attack even if they win the battle. An animal that is hurt is less likely to survive and will not be competitive in many aspects such as reproduction. (This is termed as fitness.)
- Most animals do not produce toxins as it consumes energy/food to do so. Also, the species becomes evolutionarily restricted because has to protect itself from its own toxins and reproduction is only allowed with species that aren't affected by the toxins while being morphologically compatible. Therefore, toxin production is a ""double-edge sword"" and is uncommon.

Essentially, just think about it in terms of humans/yourself. 
Would you kill a large bear that is ignoring you, that you aren't going to eat, that will most likely end up with you dead or severely wounded in the middle of nowhere even if you had a gun with you? 
If you produced toxins, it's most likely because you are physically weaker than other species so provoking them by poisoning them is probably not a good idea as the poison probably won't kick in fast enough to save you.

The problem is, they forgot ""balanced"" means different things to different people and didn't put all the usual adjustable settings you find in pretty much every survival game. that is a very arrogant approach by the developers and does manage to make the game unenjoyable unless you agree with the developers on what is balanced :/

The one that annoyed me the most is day/time cycle being way too quick and debuffs triggering and increasing in severity too quickly. A person doesn't go from fully hydrated to delusional from thirst in half a day!

Yes, i can drop difficulty but that just stops thing attacking me and makes the game far too easy. That isn't a drop in difficulty, that is an increase in boredom. Slowing down the time cycle on the other hand would keep the difficulty but provide more time to get essential resources together.

As it is, I'm at the find some coconuts in the 5 mins of daytime so you don't go mad and die from dehydration stage... There is nothing interesting about walking around for 5 minutes wondering where all the coconuts went and then going mad and dying... well, there is i guess but it wears off quick!

Pros:
+Great story
+Cool environment - No idea how accurate it is though, would appreciate if someone could confirm/deny its accuracy
+Real satisfaction from building and crafting - Making even just a section of a shelter makes you feel great, ""look what I did, Ma!""
+Challenging - Take only what you need so it doesn't go to waste, work smarter not harder, and you're not a hero: vicious predators and tribesmen will end you without hesitation, if you want to fight be ready for an unforgiving one.

Mids:
*Very similar to The Forest in many mechanics. If you like The Forest that's a good thing, but if The Forest wasn't for you then this game might not be either. To clarify, this comparison is to the most recent version of The Forest, which is much higher quality than when it was in Beta.
*Predators are the dumbest thing I've ever seen, the Jaguar just screams repeatedly in rapid succession like a broken record and annihilates you regardless; predators should be challenging but this borders on stupid.

Cons: 
-A little rough around the edges - Some of the dialogue/subtitles are slightly incorrect, once in a great while there's a misspelling in text, and there's issues with the terrain clipping and allowing you to see the void under the map. The only other thing I've encountered was a bug that trapped a bunch of animals in place so even if they ran they were still running in place.

Would I buy it again: Yes!
Totally worth the price of admission if you like survival, story, or a challenge. The issues it has are insignificant compared to the rest of the game and you won't notice them much.

The level of detail and amount of wildlife in the Brazilian rain forest is absolutely insane.  I predicted the survival mode would be the best aspect of this game in a early access review and I was DEAD WRONG.

94,Green Hell,57674335,english,"At its core, Green Hell is an extremely frustrating game. I want to be really clear that I am not talking about the difficulty of the game, but the elements of gameplay that make it a painful slog to get through, rather than the fun but difficult experience it should be.

The inventory management is some of the worst I've ever experienced, with stacks of small items (each with their own expiration timer) that need to be moved, combined, or eaten one by one, in a way that means that most of your time spent with this game will be looking at the inventory. What's that, you need to carry a plank to build a garden bed? Better empty every last carefully curated item out of your bag and onto the ground, one by one (all 47 of them), just to make room to carry a plank ten metres. Oh, then once you've placed the plank, don't forget to go back and pick those 47 items back up, stopping in between to make sure you rotate and move their shapes so that they fit into the bag properly. I appreciate the driver for this may have been 'realism', but it has come at the cost of fun.

There are so many gameplay elements that could have been refined or improved to make them less tedious, without affecting difficulty at all. E.g. I've proven I know how to make arrows, why after the first one can't I just click on a recipe to make more, instead of having to painstakingly assemble each one through the menus for each of the components? Why isn't there just a button to 'eat oldest' when looking at a stack of food, or 'cook all raw meat' when facing a fire or drying rack? Why not just display the timer of the item closest to spoiling when looking at a stack of food? The list of possible improvements goes on...

Performance is also very poor for me, even on the lowest settings. Plenty of other games with graphics similar to this run without issue on my machine, so this is definitely down to poor optimisation.

The survival elements are fun, I was enjoying the story, and the many things to pick up, discover, hunt, and build are awesome, but wrestling with the inventory and crafting in this game has killed any enjoyment I was getting out of it. 

If I could have the survival elements of this game with the inventory, crafting, and building from The Forest I'd be in love.

5,Green Hell,60213283,english,"This is my first review for a game and I really enjoyed it. As others have said, the game at the beginning is very unforgiving and can be quite daunting. I played this a few months back and I died so many times (snake bites, insanity, food, parasites, piranha) I did get somewhat discouraged because it was so much more difficult than the other survival games out there (forest, long dark, etc.). But last month I decided I really wanted to play this and get used it  because the mechanics and support from the developers look amazing.
So I sat down and took some time  to understand the mechanics and wow was it worth it. My time is not accurate as I tend to leave my computer on without logging out, but it did get to a point where I could run through the jungle and based on sounds (snakes, spiders) could instantly react without getting affected.

For those that are just starting out. I would recommend finding/building a shelter to save at and then start experimenting. When you have no idea what to do, any sort of scratch or ailment can kill you relatively quickly, so once you find out what (X) does, eat or do whatever you can and then restart until you learn what works.

Pros
Very Immersive environment that looks absolutely incredible
Relatively intuitive crafting system
Diet mechanic is really cool and adds that much more to the realism

Cons

I really only had two major cons with this game: Inventory management (mixed with crafting) and food

Inventory management is terrible and as others have stated, it'd be nice to be able to put together recipes so once you've built something you can then auto build again if you have the materials because sifting through all of your inventory to find each piece can take forever. For example, you'll be making tons of fires and having to get the dried leaves, get the fire starter tool, build the fire...it gets tedious when you already have everything. It's also annoying to have to make space to carry larger items like wood planks

Food: It seems like the amount of food you need to eat to keep your diet balanced is excessive.

I want to play through the story mode again, but these these two factors alone creep up every time the idea pops in my head and I remind myself how much work it was. So instead of of spending most of my time playing the game (I get that it's a survival game) I spend a decent amount of it sifting through inventory and trying to find food on the way to the next objective

1. It is absolutely gorgeous. Dive into the ""green ocean"" from the comfort of your chair and just sometimes forget about the game, just spend some quality time watching your screen.
2. The cutscenes for the story mode are great. Just really great.
3. To support a team and a game that came from EA on schedule and promises more than the plenty there is already.

Overall a game more polished than many AAA, even when it was in EA.

It has a steep learning curve but is more than worth any effort put in it. If you own The Forest, you really own this game a go.

Great game that will keep you busy for longer than a season of Man vs Wild.

14,Green Hell,45279753,english,"Excellent, even though there are some bugs and its clearly still early access. What is done is of good quality and has been well thought out. 

The map is quite small, but it doesnt feel it until you have been playing for a while.

Id like to see an option to turn off the natives in survival mode and to see more plants, animals and a bigger map... but so far these developers seem very good. Excited to see what they come up with next... which is what early access should be like at its best.

EDIT: I can no longer recommend this game as the developers have removed tree re-spawning BUT keep adding more and more items that need trees to be cut down. You cannot even save this game without first cutting down trees to make a shelter- so there is no real choice about cutting down trees. 
They have also stopped allowing storage of items on the ground. It makes the game difficult to enjoy when you are forced to deforest a large area to make chests to store your supplies.

In my opinion this game has potential. It starts off sort of like a movie as in it goes for a slow build up before you think you know what is going on. For me the gameplay aspect is too much like other survival games that I have and play so it is not that different for me. 

Let's talk optimization for a minute which was kind of the main draw back for me. My system specs are as follows: RTX 2070, RYZEN 2700X OC, 500GB M.2, 2TB HDD, monitor is a 32"" 4K Samsung. Bottom line if you have anything close to these specs you should be able to run this at 1440 all maxed out for the most part and get somewhere between 50-60 frames. Let's run down all the settings I tried and the frames I was getting.
4K - ultra = 30-37fps
4K - med = 30-40fps
4K - low = 45-55fps
1440 - ultra = 35-40fps
1440 - med = 40-50fps
1440 - low = 50-60fps
1080 - ultra = 42-54fps
1080 - med = 45-60fps
1080 - low = 55-70fps

Obviously depending on your system you might average something different but for the most part I tinkered around for awhile and when I dropped down to 1080 it just was not that satisfying for me.

Although the first few hours into the game made me think I wouldn't like it (see ""Discovery/Searching below), this game ended up being surprisingly good! The key was coming across the first big main-story event which got me hooked.

Expect to die and learn from your mistakes to experience a really surprising story-line.

If you like slow-paced, yet tense game-play, I definitely recommend this!


[h1]Important Tip[/h1]
Some base items have the note ""Allow saving of the game"". This does [i]not[/i] mean that the game is saved once that is built. It means that you can [i]use[/i] that building to save the game. Knowing this would have saved me a few lost hours.

[h1]Farming / Base-Building[/h1]
It was recommended to me because I enjoyed Subnautica, with the reasons that crafting and farming is not overly mundane and repetitive. And I agree that both elements take only a secondary (albeit essential) role in this game. You never need excessive amount of farming, you can pretty much do it ""on-the-go"". Crafting/base-building is simple enough to not feel too much of a chore. Although the base-building [i]does[/i] need more manual interaction as in Subnautica where everything works with pretty much one click.

[h1]Survival[/h1]
The main difficulty in this game comes from the different types of resources you need. There are quite a few (sleep/energy, sanity & four types of nutrition) and you need to keep them all in check. This gets easier the more you play. Mainly because you get the hang of the mechanics and learn your way around the jungle.

Navigation is also a key part, and if careless you can get lost quickly. You will have to learn to navigate by compass. But this gets easier in the game fairly quickly.

There are also some hazards which can quickly get you killed, but once you learn how to deal with them it becomes a [i]lot[/i] easier.

[h1]Discovery & Searching[/h1]
What I [i]did not[/i] like in the game (also the reason why I almost abandoned the game mid-way) was the seemingly excessive searching. [b]However[/b] if this would not have been in the way, I would not have discovered some interesting/beautiful locations.

I have to admit that I needed to look up a walkthrough twice in the game. The reason for that is that you really need to keep your eyes peeled and can quickly miss an important interactive element in the game which is important to advance the story. I am glad that I only picked out the tiniest of information out of the walkthrough to get  me past my ""blocker"" because some elements are still left to chance and may have an impact on the ending. And I was really stunned by the ending. And now I want to play the game again :)

[h1]Story[/h1]
I went into the game without [i]any[/i] prior knowledge, the story took me by surprise and got me hooked. I can only recommend going in blind. It might very well turn out to be not what you expect.

To elaborate, it's a survival crafting game, and has the typical tropes of that genre. However, I do find that it's actually quite a bit more involved and interesting than most examples of the genre I have played. For example, it's not simply enough to find food to avoid starvation, you need to consume a regular variety of food to remain healthy, keeping a balance of carbohydrates, fats, proteins, and hydration. You won't starve to death eating just one thing, but you will find yourself running out of energy faster and having a worse maximum health. Since each of those categories requires you to do different things to secure access to them, it keeps the moment-to-moment gameplay of trying to survive more varied and more interesting than is typical. Since very few consumables can last and the amount the player character can carry is limited, stockpiling isn't a good option, so you can never make that aspect of gameplay ""obsolete"", you just need to get good at being aware of your surroundings.

It has a pretty robust crafting and construction mechanic too, generally leaning on the more plausible side. Narrow logs (harvested with a sharpened stone embedded in a stick) to drive into the ground, long sticks balanced between them, vines used to tie them together, palm fronds laid over them, etc. This is also a system that must be engaged with, as building beds will be necessary for rest and building shelters are necessary for protecting campfires from the rain. The game offers some more ""advanced"" building options, like making mud huts, but they're not really necessary unless you're trying to challenge yourself.

This isn't really much of a combat game, focusing as it does mostly on exploration and survival. Which isn't to say that there isn't some element of that. Dangerous predators are a rare but deadly encounter where running might be more dangerous than standing your ground with a bow or spear. There are some natives as well who don't take kindly to strangers in their territory and are also rare and even deadlier than the predators, but they're also entirely avoidable: you can hear them coming and are better served by slinking away through the underbrush until they pass than you are trying to take them on. The environment itself is the real danger here.

It has an open-ended survival mode, but I played through the story mode primarily. It took about 50 hours, and was pretty entertaining for that time. It took me a few attempts restarting at the beginning of the game before I got the hang of the survival mechanics and didn't end up putting myself into a death spiral. If you're starting out, I recommend you take a few days in-game around the starting area getting a feel for it and developing a good routine. Also, coconuts. Look at the trees, throw some rocks to knock a few down, get those early. Trust me, they'll be your best friend in the early game.

Having completely the story mode, I think I might jump back in and try survival, experiment a little. It was fun. :)",1575665402,1575665402,TRUE,1,0,0.523809552,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,1363,9,3388,0,3388,1579061314,,
98,Green Hell,59366608,english,"What can i say about this game...
Its supposed to be an amazon survival game.
AND IS HARD AS HELL!!
I mean, even I am playing on standard/normal mode and it feels like playing hard mode with how things are!
And then the story mode was added recently. The story is so wierd and confusing.
I am not going to say anything not to spoil it if anyone want to try it out.

I had been playing this game this whole week and I had to take a break as my emotions were overwhelming.
It made me rage.. it name me scared, it made me stressed, Mostly stressed.
I played this game using 7.1 headphones... and I almost had heart attack twice by jump scares i had...
This thing is way too intense.

For one, I was running fast on my way to an area I needed to go. Not only i get surprise attacks by rattle snakes hidden in the bushes...
I actually had a jump scare by a jaguar jumping on me out of nowhere which actually made me scream in fright.

Then later on I was minding my own business building my base area, and i was too focused when a native jump scares me by making a war cry to fight... Native appeared because I had my campfire on for too long.

I got too involved into this and the experience was an interesting one.
What I learned from this?
If you're too reckless in the jungle, it will come back and bite you.
Not even when sleeping you are safe... as you might get bottle worms in your skin.

13,Green Hell,59227901,english,"My conclusion after finishing the game would be recommend, but probably on sale.  I feel like it was well worth the $20 I paid.

Note: Everything below is based on story-mode, not survival.

So obviously the first comparison will be to 'The Forest' - which is accurate.  Many of the ways you build things, eat things, craft things, are all very similar to 'The Forest', minus a couple of changes here and there.  The big difference between the two is 'Green Hell' is primarily story-driven, while 'The Forest' has very little story and has the horror elements.

The story is actually very good, which I wasn't expecting for a survival game.  The story kept me engaged throughout the entirety of my play-through.  The story is well-written, well acted, and kept me guessing about what was really going on.

The survival elements are, mixed.  'The Forest' definitely did it better.  Don't get me wrong, it was still fun, I wouldn't have beaten it otherwise.  But there are so many little things that were poor design decisions.  Below are my list of cons (warning, it's long, but to me, the story and how that is incorporated into the exploration far outweighs the cons):

1) Most of the buildings you will never need or use (maybe you do in survival mode).  Why build a small shelter when you can build a hunting shelter for half the resources and it does the EXACT same thing?

2) There is little to no difference between the different tiers of equipment.  I went from a minimal stone axe to a regular axe, to an obsidian axe, and finally to an iron axe (which takes a lot of work).  It still took just as long to chop down trees, I still couldn't chop down bigger trees, it still deteriorate just as fast.  So what was the point?  Maybe it does more damage, but when you're fighting pumas, crocodiles, and natives, it's absurd to use melee when you can use the bow.  On a similar note, even damage doesn't matter with upgrades, as long as you get a headshot, you can take down every creature/human in one shot.  And obviously, this point contributes a lot to point #1.

3) Some people complain about crafting, and having to place the items every time.  Honestly this didn't bother me.  You aren't crafting often enough for it to become that irritating.

4) While it takes some survival elements more seriously than 'The Forest', like food is broken down into carbs, fats, and protein and you also have to address getting bit by rattlesnakes, getting parasites, staying clean, etc.  This element seems bizarre when you compare it to some other aspects that are insanely unrealistic.  Such as, with your bare hands, you can ""harvest"" a giant log into 5 sticks and a plank.  Amazing!

5) The days are way too short, making you have to either sleep a lot (causing you to need to consume more food and water) or you are doing a lot of things at night.  While the lighting is very realistic and well done, it is really irritating when the sun is coming up and down at 6am/5pm.  So you basically have 11 hours of decent lighting.

6) The rain is completely unpredictable.  Some weeks it will rain every other hour.  Then you'll have a full week without rain, then it will do nothing but rain for a week.  This is frustrating due to fires and torches going out when it is raining (obviously makes sense, but you can't see a damn thing at night without a torch).

7) The game look great, but performance isn't well optimized.  I got a playable 37fps average on a GTX 970 (high settings), but as soon as you pull out a torch or go near a fire at night, the FPS tanks to around 5.

TL;DR - The game IS good.  I thoroughly enjoyed probably 25 of the 27 hours I played.  The story is great, the exploration and mystery aspects are fun, and the survival elements are okay.  Most of the cons are minor annoyances, just things that I think people should know going in.",1575479382,1575479382,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,576,62,1698,0,1605,1590664484,,

BUT SO MUCH GODDAMN BETTER! Ah man I've never had so much fun consistantly FAILING to survive over and over and over. Now I'm probably a minority here, I love the Amazon Rainforest. Utterly fascinated, I read Napolean Chagonon's work on the Yanomami People for fun. Everything that made The Forest great has been supercharged here. You even get to fight the local tribesmen. They may not be cannibals (but you can be!). I've been wanting a game like this forever and now it's here.

I am also happy the creators chose to portray the indigenous tribes as misunderstood victims of circumstance, which they are. They're dangerous but why shouldn't they be? YOU are the one invading their land. These ancient cultures are like living time capsules; sneak peeks at the origins of us all ALL. In other words Rock Paper Shotgun OUTRIGHT LIED about how the natives are portrayed. They are portrayed not only with respect, the story is driven by an aesop about their real world struggles and the impact our world has on theirs (which is shrinking). I APPLUDE the developers effort for trying.

As others have pointed out, the balance factor when it comes to keeping up nutrients is in serious need of balancing. That death spiral is real. Missing just one element in a day will finish you off instantly. Sometimes staying alive is a matter of luck, whether or not a coconut spawns in your area.

32,Green Hell,59123464,english,"Survival games have become extremely popular over the last few years, which has led to an influx of titles that attempt to offer something new and challenging. Unfortunately most fail, which has led to suspicion of ""cashing in"" when new titles arrive on the market.

Green Hell has attempted a slightly different and much more realistic take on the genre, where micro-management is key to your success. And it's not bad, really!

You see, most survival games balance their challenge with food, water and odd dangers, such as mutant babies or zombies. They scale your consumption to ridiculous levels (gallons of fluids and kilos of food every day) to supposedly balance their gameplay. By doing so, they reduce the realism of the players adventure and inject frustration in how much of a need there is to gather nourishment over all else. It seems to be the 'go to' formula for the generic survival game... Not so in Green Hell.

There's pretty much everything you could want here. A large, sprawling rain forest that's been lovingly crafted in stunning detail (imagine Crysis on steroids). There's danger everywhere, from small parasites and insects to dangerous animals. The locals are also not happy you are in their territory, so inevitably they want to disrupt your progress (in small ways) and will even attempt to engage you in combat. Not enough to make it an irritation, but enough to have you on your toes and to raise your pulse. Even simple sounds can have you imagining the worst and set you on edge.

Sustenance is very well integrated, with not just water or food, but a complex mixture of hydration, protein, fats and carbohydrates that all need attention if you don't want to suffer exhaustion, starvation, or even go mad and start hearing voices. Eating some foods can directly affect your sanity, such as eating human flesh or creepy crawlies. Cooking homely foods can soothe your woes and restore your sanity. All of this adds a complex and rewarding mini-game in itself. Although it can make the early days very demanding, it is a refreshing take on human needs in this genre of game.

Crafting is also a real treat here. It's complex and hard work. There's no cutting down trees for 500 wood and spamming walls and items everywhere. Gathering is its own challenge, with weight issues and item availability being a core element to expansion of your home base should you decide to make one.

The list of craftables starts small, meaning you ideally need to explore to discover how to make something. You can, however, experiment with smaller recipes and stumble into their various schematics (which unlock once crafted). So common sense is also your friend here! A nice little touch (similar to Minecraft) that makes the game feel more like a simulator than a game.

Illness, injuries, parasites and other disabilities are also micro managed, with a knowledge of local herbs and plants essential to a speedy recovery. You need to consider your own hygiene. Being dirty makes a difference when eating or applying medicine. The consequence of which can be gross.

TLDR:
I'm still discovering many things as I play and am amazed at the love that's been put into the development of this game. It's truly a fantastic experience for anyone that's looking for a serious survival adventure that pushes your abilities of thought and reason. It's not for the feint of heart or the impatient. I'm not even sure it can be classed as a game. Simulator is a far more accurate description, but there is a story included (EA Tutorial, with the main story being added in v1.0 Official Release), which adds purpose.

54,Green Hell,59005470,english,"Green Hell is definitely a game I will consider one of my top favorites for single player survival games. Feels like a Far Cry 3 turned survival. The story mode is highly recommended, graphics are gorgeous, can have some stutter issues during the cut scenes which seems to be for loading from one scene to another, may just be me though. But actual game play runs smooth as butter. The story actually compliments the survival aspect as well which I found very surprising, I was expecting them to clash but planning ahead and stopping to rest when needed was actually a nice edge to spacing the story out for a longer first playthrough. 
Although, this is nit picking, I do have some cons, that you should consider if you are thinking about purchasing the game. Things become a little repetitive... I brought the game while it was on sale, I got 26hrs out of it playing through the story and abit of survival, I will probably focus more on survival and building myself a sort of fortress, but the building system while great, very similar to the forest. Materials needed just to build a single wall 2x2m (ish) can take a considerable amount of time. While this can definitely prelong the game lifespan, it can still grow abit weary and dull. And there is actually no real need to build a base, it is far more easier to just place multiple camps just to save. Everything else is really not needed, its hard to explain, but I think the devs need to figure out an endgame, something to motivate players into putting the time in to building a base, right now you can just run along, make a spear, kill make a fire, cook the meat, eat, sleep rinse and repeat. Having acouple days fun out of it, is plausible but you have to decide if the price is worth just acouple of days or if you are able to motivate yourself further to get your moneys worth. Its definitely a fun game, but 26hrs and I have got through the story and probably about 6ish hrs of survival mode included in that 26. There is multiple endings, but thats just it, endings, which you will probably have a recent save near to, that could easily change that without having to start all over. So replay value for story is stuck to about 30 minutes of loading an older save and just complete the last bit again but differently.

Overall very happy, and hope the devs add alot more in the future, definitely need some more building improvements to motivate actually building a base.",1575279332,1575279332,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,97,5,1719,0,1570,1587758576,,

[h1]Experience[/h1]
Green Hell turned out to be the survival game I've been looking towards to for almost a decade. It excelled my expectations. I purchased Green Hell while looking for a survival game that focused more on realism and immersion rather than the typical horror. After all, there haven't really been a good realistic survival game out there due to their incredibly difficulty of balancing. The immersion, exploration in combination with its game-mechanics and realism made Green Hell feel captivating and its gameplay incredibly fluent. Creepy Jar nailed it. I hope their dedication to this game continues with even more future updates, much like the cultivation update this november.

[h1]Green Hell[/h1]
I've gotten many amazing hours of entertainment playing Green Hell. It's fun to launch and play for thirty minutes and it becomes breathtaking when you completely lose yourself within its immersive rain forest for several hours. The world feels huge with its ambience yet extremely claustrophobic and the world has no mercy in making you lose your bearings. The storyline and its narrative is for you to discover and its free-roam will most likely be difficult for beginners and death is almost guaranteed. Decisions has ramifications, lack of awareness of your surroundings has dire consequences. Preperations are vital and is a fundamental element of the game. The enviroments and graphics are stunning. There's an amazing and thriving biodiversity ranging from insects, mammals, shrubs, flowers, herbs, trees and one of the biggest dangers of them all, microorganisms. All has their advantages and disadvantages for your survival. The experimentation of these will be your savior but may also guarantee your demise. Protein, fats, carbohydrates and your hydration plays a small part into you surviving. But in the end, your mental health is what will conclude the outcome of your survival.

The only threats being the very rare jaguar, annoying stationary rattlesnakes and of course tribals. The tribal AI could be optimized to be more competent. They will not cross water and will just stand there allowing you to shoot arrows at them while they dont react. The jaguar is great except a little unaware and perhaps should detect the player better. I often sneak up on them rather than them sneaking up on me. Rattlesnakes are good though and keep you on your toes listening for the sound because it can very well kill you if you dont have the proper stuff after a bite. I would love to see more buildings added and more foes. The anaconda would be a great, and scary addition that would add some more thrill and threat to the game. I definitely recommend the game as is though and im excited to see what the devs can add!",1575155297,1575155297,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,92,6,2280,0,1921,1586743127,,

The crawling noises get closer, so I move quickly and climb a high rock to hide on. I look down and see thru a moonlit clearing that the noise was just an armadillo. I laugh a little to myself, but suddenly a misstep and I fall off the rock, right onto a rattlesnake. Bitten and poisoned I reactively chuck my spear towards where I think the snake was. The tribals that were chanting go quiet and suddenly I hear the sounds of multiple people running through the bushes towards me. I'm poisoned and coming down with a fever, and being weaponless I'm in no condition to fight. I take off running blindly deeper into the jungle. Out of nowhere a god damn jaguar attacks me. It slices my legs but I manage to chuck a rock at its face and it runs off. Now I'm bleeding profusely and poisoned. I find an abandoned shelter and think I might be able to get what i need to patch myself up. A medicinal plant is only a few yards away, I run to it and pick the leaves. Underneath lies another rattlesnake and ends my suffering. I survived less than a day. God damn.

I think the last couple were the Metro Exodus, and the most recent two versions of Tomb Raider. I mean, I was really sold on this right from the opening scene. It's one of the first things I look for in a game. If you can't make it real enough to immerse me... well, chances are that you won't hold my interest for very long.

Once you've absorbed me, then I look for content, and this game appears that in spades. This is based on what I've seen so far, at the time of this review, and what I've read on the Steam Forum, and viewed on YouTube. I can't help but to think about Ark from time to time while playing, only without the Dinosaurs, but hey, we have lizards, snakes, spiders, etc.

There are many difficulty settings in the menu as to how you want to play this game. A little something for everyone. From [i]Tourist to Hardcore,[/i] you'll be able find one that fits you.

Fun and beautiful game. One of the best survival games EVER. Really makes you work for it and gives the survival feel to the max.

Havent played for long recently so dont know if this issue has been fixed. Some minor issues that need attending, i.e. the plants respawning in my buildings after I cleared them to build a camp. Quick and pretty easy to learn what you have to do. 

Super excited for the story mode.

Post Full Release Review:
Omg, Green Hell. This game lives up to its name. If you want a game that pushes the limits on how you play survival games, this is it. Not only is it one of the best survival game I have ever had the pleasure of playing, the storyline was worth the wait. I can't describe the feeling of finishing this, there are two endings and the 'bad' ending gave me chills. If you truly want an amazing game where your skills as a gamer are pushed to breaking but still have a storyline that draws you in and gives you many feelings, Green Hell is it.

45,Green Hell,44619892,english,"Fantastic game. This game SORT of reminds me of a mix of the Forest and Stranded Deep with its crafting and book menu, wrist watch with your stats and info, the tribes men like the cannibals etc. The really cool feature that really separates this game from those and others (to my knowledge) is its inspection mechanic where you check your legs and arms for leeches, wounds and all other kind of nasty stuff that happens to you out there.

I strongly suggest you start the game in easy mode so you can figure it all out and get the hang of it unless you want to play a pass out simulator and be awesome at dying over and over. 

On a side note, those textures and graphics are AMAZING! Crank this baby on epic settings with a sweet monitor and you will be amazed at just staring at the ground admiring the water flowing around.

A few additions I would like to see ingame:
More containers: Some place to put bones in would be nice and maybe add the ability to search for clay and use the campfire to make cups, bowls or even big jars.
Garden/Nursery: It would be cool to have some place where you could cultivate either mushrooms, plants or even small animals (E.I. Frogs, rats, larva, maggots, etc.)
Clothes making: Some plants can be used to make rope and even clothes (Hemp, Flax, Nettle) it would be cool to be able to gather that as well as animal skins and work with it.
Survival mode: I would love to have a mode where we have predators and sanity but without the mean men trying to kill us.

Green Hell at first seemed to be just a combination of The Forest and Stranded Deep; I have since come to the conclusion that I had judge this game too early. The survival genre has been given a gift by acquiring Green Hell on the lists of top survival games. So for the moment you have all been waiting for if you are still reading this review, here are the pros and cons.

Pros:
-Complex damage system: Instead of just having health you can be cut, bruised, bitten, infected, sick, and more. All of this having unique healing methods that you must learn and master yourself to stay alive.
-Health/Hunger/Thirst: Linking to the damage system it is impressive how well rounded and creative this system is. If you don't have a balanced and full diet you will not accomplish much or survive long, and if you encounter a parasite or infection/disease such as food poisoning you will have to combat it as you would in real life(Not just a temporary debuff to say a stamina stat)
-Beautiful Graphics: In a time of games being so demanding this game performs and is incredibly optomized. You don't need an 800 dollar gpu to enjoy what this game has to offer at a ""playable"" fps.

Cons
-Still Buggy: Don't make this why you won't play, really the only bugs I have come across besides map glitches and horrible hitboxes/combat with tribals would be death bugs, so don't die and you won't bug out
-You don't own this game: The fact you don't own this game is a con all on its own. It is truly a unique experience and a tough one at that.

Definitely a must have game, especially at this price for what it provides you.",1537743265,1574945117,TRUE,4,0,0.518248141,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,198,11,1631,0,541,1600527035,,

51,Green Hell,58005348,english,"I've put  thousand(s?) of hours into all kinds of survival games, and in terms of what I look for in a survival games Green Hell has it all. Great graphics, realistic environmental impacts (heat, thirst, starvation, infection etc), primal threats and fear, both the adrenaline fueled action of running for your life coupled with moments of pure gritted terror where you're pleading with the electronic Gods that you're able to sleep for a few hours without dying cold, alone and vomiting in a cave where you're body will never be found. 
And yet, every time I get about 30 minutes-1 hour into a game session I find myself getting bored and swapping to something else. I think part of the issue is that this world is incredibly intricate, but the map is relatively small, so the feeling of true wilderness is somewhat lost. 
By contrast games like The Long Dark (my favourite and a fairly close comparison), have vast areas of nothing but desolation, where you have to fight to find the scraps of survival and gathering enough resources to survive a day is an achievement in and of itself. This game isn't like that, resources are relatively plentiful, to the extent where it's fairly easy to gather enough resources to build shelters on a rust-esq scale (well ish).  

The best way i can describe it is that Green Hell is a sprint whereas The Long Dark is a marathon, both have there merits and pitfalls, but GH isn't a world I can get truly immersed into. 
Overall I think it's probably worth picking up and trying out, especially in a sale, maybe you'll find in here something I didn't.

74,Green Hell,50416759,english,"I bought Green Hell because I was  facinated by the idea to play in the jungle and learn the different plant and species and its usages to survive. I started with the ""story mode"" which is currently just a teaser but already makes a very good impression and I want more of it :)
Then in sandbox, I lerned the basics of the game. Created different outposts and traveled through the world to learn new notebook entries to build stuff and to see what else exists. During that phase, I died a LOT. You start to each all kinds of plants to see what happens. After some time, you know all of them. Same applies for animals. You also lern that there is a difference whether you eat it raw, cook it or roast it.
The natives / tribe member can be a challenge if you do not have the necessary bandages to cure your wounds afterwards. Later in the game, they got easier with Bow + Arrow and meanwhile metal armor etc. But until you reach that phase ... :)
After around 20 hours of gameplay, I had seen the world as it existed at that time. With the combat update, the world got larger and I played again for ~5 hours to see what happened. Similarly with the new mechanics of the mud update. But since sandbox does not offer any kind of goal, it became boring after a while. There is not much you need to learn then.
So I decidided the try out ""Challenges"" - and I have to say, they are real challenges! Meanwhile I finished the first three of them, but I needed a few attempts. In Challenges, you start from scratch but you have a limited time window in which you have to reach a goal (e.g. build a raft). So you start to collect food and stuff to build. Sometimes you miss some important ingedients (searching for stone for ages...) and sometimes you are simply unlucky and you are hit by two natives without bandages. Since you cannot save in Challenges, you must not make any mistakes - or you need to have the tools in your bag to fix yourself.
The game is still early access, but very well playable. I enjoyed it very much so far and wanted to write a review so that others can see whether this game might be for them as well.

This game easly leaves others in the Genre for dead. If you want a true survival game then this is it.

The only singular gripe i have is the frame rate, it needs work devs, apart from that I applaud what you have done.

So before i begin i just want to say that the attention of detail in this game is the best i've seen in any survival game and it really shows. the unique animations, the unique items, the unique locations, its all amazing. Now for my critique.

Pros: 
Way more realistic than many other survival games

Story and survival mode allows for different types of playstyles

NOT PERMADEATH!
unique little details

graphics are amazing

lots of content


Cons: 
Right now, the AI is really bad on a lot of animals (parrots will get stuck and fly in circles, bigger animals like tapirs and armodillos will crawl back to spawn almost immediately when hit with a axe or other melee.)

The tutorial on story mode is really bad, and sadly you need to play some story mode in order to learn how to craft anything in the game, and even so most of the crafting you just have to find out just buy putting random items together, just like the forest. i hate how there isnt any guidelines.

The map isnt very helpful. I get lost even when i have the map.(you could put a you are here icon) and you cant set a waypoint or label things.

Stamina is terribly thought out in this game as it is. i pass out so often and even in combat ill just fall asleep. there needs to be a better way than just sleeping and eating like 20 mushrooms.

No random map generation just makes it boring in the end, but hopefully in the future there will be more locations, a bigger map or random map generation.

Leeches will latch onto you every 5 seconds no matter if you slept on the ground, in a bed, or if you didnt sleep at all. and rain doesnt affect any of this, i've checked.


Do i think you should buy this game? Absolutely. These animators and game developers worked hard for this. Do i think there is room for improvement? Yes. Do i think this game can go far? Yes!

The game play mechanics are also great, and the story is structured in such a way as to feed you the mechanics bits at a time.  As you progress, you are always learning new techniques for survival.

The map is extensive, and keeps you wondering just where it might end. The gameplay can get repetitious, but it you take the game slow, and really live in the jungle, while slowly exploring and moving the story forward, its less repetitious because you spend time honing your survival craft.  By the end, the idea of survival is almost secondary as you become a seasoned veteran in handling the jungle.

The voice acting was awesome, and emotional.  [spoiler]The story was sad, and reflective of today's state of the world.[/spoiler]

Replay ability is questionable, as others have stated its the story gameplay and map discovery without the story.  Not bad for another go at survival, but without any goals or challenges, besides surviving the jungle, I'm not sure how much interest I'd have.

There is a challenge mode but I've yet to explore it.  It could offer some brief replay experiences.

18,Green Hell,48710396,english,"I've got mixed feelings about the game.  I still recommend it if you have a love for survival games and/or looking for a challenge (I.E. play it in Green Hell Mode).

On one hand, it's very fun and challenging when first starting out.  It takes a bit to get used to the different mechanics and has a little more micromanaging your personal health than other survival games.  Once you hit your stride though, it gets easier to keep your meters full while exploring the beautiful lush landscape that wants to rip your face off when you least expect it.  I'd say the playable area of the map is smaller than The Forest, but the devs are adding new areas and constantly updating the existing content.  It could very well become much, much larger when it's all said and done and I'm very excited for the story mode.

On the other hand, it's still in early access which means it has a way to go before it's finished.  The story mode is still in the works, so you're stuck playing in a survival sandbox mode.  Don't get me wrong, there's plenty to see and do, but you can easily explore the entire playable area in about 2 hours once you know where to go (Timed it on my 2nd game after a bug forced me to restart).

I've only encountered two bugs: 

1.  Sometimes you can't retrieve your spear after downing an animal with a throw, and if you harvest while it's still in the carcass, it can just vanish or get launched 10-30ft. in a random direction.

2.  DO NOT place anything down on the game's premade structures as items will vanish into thin air when you reload the save.  Sometimes, loading, quitting, then reloading the save fixes this, but I've never had it work for me.  Do yourself a favor if you purchase this game and just drop your stuff on the ground next to the structure, not on it or in it (I lost 4 hours of progress and a ton of useful items and resources to this bug, which forced me to restart).

A Little Advice: 

Do not mess with the natives, as they're a pain in the butt to deal with.  They often come in a group of 2 or more and can dodge, dart in and out and stab you, then dance away like drunken masters if you're not using a spear in melee.  They also use flanking tactics and will often back off and throw rocks or use a bow while the others have you occupied.  Avoid them if you're not carrying a spear and a bow, it's just not worth the hassle.

When possible, always make soup from any meat or bones you get.  Trust me, it makes keeping yourself healthy much easier.

Welcome to the Green Hell!


*UPDATE*

It's been a long time since my initial review.  The game has since seen its official release, so it's time I gave it a second look.

Again, this game gets a strong recommendation.  Most if not all of the issues I experienced during Early Access have been fixed.  Still some slight issues with objects being flung in random directions when looting or dropping, but not to the degree it once was.

The additional map areas, the water update, the tribal update, and farming were all welcome additions that only strengthened a solid foundation of what makes a survival game both fun and challenging.  Think the game is too easy?  Start it over in a harder setting and/or tweak some of the game's core systems to make it even harder.

Finally a finished story mode!  I've been so busy playing with the new systems and enjoying the game that I have yet to finish it;  It's so easy to get side-tracked! I've enjoyed what I've experienced so far, even though some of us(myself included) may find it heading in a very familiar direction.

Combat has been improved and the natives are no longer the apex human hunters they once were.  They're still a viable threat, but it's much easier to out think them and use the terrain to your advantage.  Still, it's best to avoid them whenever you can.

I would have rated this game a 6/10 while it was in early access.  Despite its issues, it was a solid game with a considerable amount of polish.  The full release with all its new content and continued updates would place Green Hell as a solid 8.5/10.",1549111103,1574180958,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,176,30,8353,0,1400,1574224761,,

So after play this game I have mixed feelings because game looks pretty good but story line need improve which not coming later. Natural this game is better than others survival which sometimes not including real line story but here after 20 minutes playing we dont know what we must to do. We have only one main goal but have no idea how to pass this so we must exploring full map and reveal new locations which unlock new dialog options.

WAS GOOD:
- Beautiful graphic with a lot of elements likes bugs, grass living fauna and flora,
- New things which I saw first time in this game like improved seal healing by using bandage or cut out sick skin where parasite worm,
- Interesting but slowly reveal story,
WAS BAD:
- Like in other survival games we must non stop eat, sleep and drink water. I know here times goes faster but I can't focus for reveal story or exploring map without prepare full backpack with water and food, food which must be different because we must care about fat, protein and carbon and each of them is improtant. Is good idea but upsetting,
- I found some bugs without searching them,

When you not playing with games like this can you give this game a little chance but a lot of things are the same like in the other survival games
6.5/10

POLSKI:

Mam mieszane uczucia po przegraniu tego tytułu. Fabuła chociaż jest to aby ją odkrywać należy zwiedzać całą mapę i często wracać w te same miejsca. Tylko tym sposobem odkrywamy nowe dialogi a  trochę czasu to zajmuję bo musimy jeść, pić i spać co uniemożliwia na początku oddalanie się zbyt daleko od obozowiska.

CO MI SIĘ PODOBAŁO ?:
- Piękna grafika z minimalistycznymi elementami otoczenia jak robaki, żyjąca fauna i flora ,
- Ciągłe zagrożenia w dużej mierze od pijawek czy węży a leczenie jest tutaj znacznie ciekawsze niż w innych tytułach. Można np. usunąć robaka gnieżdżącego się w naszym ciele igłą,
- Dobra ale ciągnąca się jak flaki z olejem historia,
CO JEST NIE ZBYT DOBRE ?:
- Niestety jak w innych tego typu grach. CIągle trzeba jeść, pić i spać co nie pozwala się skupić na rozgrywce a mamy co robić bo w końcu jest tutaj fabuła a bez wypełnionego po brzegi wodą i różnego rodzaju żywnością plecaku nie mamy po co się wybierać w las. To oczywiście dobry pomysł, że trzeba spożywać tłuszcze, białka itp. ale frustrujący,
- Znalazłem sporo bugów bo angażowania się w ich szukanie. Zwykle bardzo rzadko znajduję jakieś bugi w grach,

Jeśli nie grałeś w survivalu albo je lubisz możesz dać tej grze szanse. Niestety sporo jest tutaj tego samo co w innych tego typu grach.

38,Green Hell,55800970,english,"Cultivation Update: With the removal of Unity 3D Data Collection, meaning Green Hell is no longer violating GDPR, I will be updating my review.

Green Hell is a great addition to the survival genre of gaming with an interesting story to boot. A slightly increased difficulty is added into this style of survival by splitting hunger into three parts - Carbs, Fats and Protein. All foods have a variety of ways to eat them, each with their own boosts to these three different areas. While a banana may be all carbs, a coconut is mostly fat and an animal mostly protein. Keeping a balance of these three as well as keeping your water up can be a difficult challenge at the start, and even in the best of situations you may not be safe to journey for too long.

The atmosphere of the game is brilliant, be it the poisonous creatures hiding in the grass only to suddenly hiss or rattle at you out of nowhere or the distant chanting of a tribal warrior, Green Hell manages to keep you on your toes at all times, there is no simple walk through the woods in this game and you'd do well to remember that! Too easily can you find yourself in a comfortable position only to be slapped right out of it in a matter of seconds.

Combat can be difficult at times but easy at others. A steady hand and a keen eye for aiming will make encounters with aggressive tribesman or even wild animals a breeze as headshots are one shot kills on all enemies, however one mistake and you could be limping out of there with an infected wound or even multiple gashes that will very quickly kill you should you not have enough medical supplies.

The most challenging thing later in the game will be finding a source of wood (ironic, it being set in a jungle) to build your camp(s) with. I have not yet played the current patch (plant cultivation update) however before this, trees did not regrow and so you had a limited amount of trees to play with, a lot of which required long distance hauling if you wanted to build something fairly large. Perhaps this will change in the building/co-op update or perhaps this has even changed now.

39,Green Hell,55691016,english,"State Oktober 20. 2019, will update if i notice any change.

This game has 1 huge Problem: It violates GDPR and the devs ignore the matter entirely.
It has Unity3d Data-Collection on by default and you CAN NOT TURN IT OFF! You know the https connection when you start the game, that keeps running until you end the game? Dont tell me you did not know about that? No wonder since Creepy Jar does not tell you. This is ""Red Shell""-Level BS. 
For the record: https://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/8pud8b/psa_red_shell_spyware_holy_potatoes_were_in_space/
According to Unity the developer is resposible for presenting a choice the user, which they did not. Unity themselves openly admit collecting IP-Addresses, which is considered Personal Data according to GDPR.
Why Steam sells games, that violate EU law is beyond me, considering the finacial risk.

The game plays between 15 and 40 FPS on any setting.
The camera is not set on the axis but forward of it so when you look around the view swings on an arc. So everything on the screen when looking around crawls around the sides of the screen it is like looking in a round fishbowl.
This just made me feel sick to my stomach.
Tried changing view angle and all the settings no change from any setting.

Green Hell is a brutal survival game which is due to the fact that you're not trying to survive against a living enemy while shoving food and water in your mouth. The real enemy is the environment you're in.

Each time you eat something for the first time it's a gamble; is it safe or not? Each time you need to drink from a river you'll need to be prepared for the consequences. Rushing through the forest with little regard for footing can debilitate you or potentially kill you.

This is a game where every single detrimental effect you get needs to be counteracted as quickly as possible and the few natives you do encounter pose a relatively limited danger by comparison.

The one rather big downside to this game is the audio which tends to betray the positions of wildlife and in some cases is significantly louder than it should be.

i'm not used to give review about games in general but this game does deserve my review. to be honest with you all i find this game very intresting in some sort that the game take you really into it as if you were in the game, the game play is difficult at this (normal mode) but once you get used to it, it becomes a killer o f a game and the story mode is just incredible. i suggest to start the game and discover bits by bits and understand the game not fully but at at least a bit before starting the story mode because it's more fun and it takes you into it. that is just my opinion overall i'd give this game an 19/20 and i would recomend it to anyone.

It never feel boring in this time and you can realy build many things and buildings.

Negative Points: The sidequest story is unlogical and you never find out what realy happen with the second group on the island and the fighters of the drug cartel , some kind of bugs after load a safepoint in a basecamp lets idems disapear or duplicate them , a bug what lets the game stuck some time, if you would build a item with a banana leaf.

The Game is realy hard at the beginning and to easy at the middle of the game:If you get the Steel Body Armor you become unbreakable and you can easy kill every enemy animal, without a Body Armor you can die instant.

Usefull idems and food every time respawn at the same points in the game, after you leave the point and return 1-2 days later.

I go to the abandoned village with the dryer, and cut down a few banana trees behind it.

I build a fire
I cook something

The story is well written and sucked me in really well, however a lot of the time I was left a little confused even after the ending, but throughout the game it was interesting and exciting, A game that made me want to come back to it over and over again. Progress is slow at first as you being to explore the jungle, and when you find a new area it makes you excited to read all the notes and audio logs as you try and piece the story together, The game does force you to visit most of these locations to get the equipment to progress but find most of them is not to difficult as they are usually on the dirt road or along the river, with the rest being on the map. Along with that although I was not always sure on where I was going or what I was supposed to next a quick look at the note book would be enough to give me a hint without spoon feeding me. The calls to Mia (your wife) would often explain what to do next.

The survival elements of the game are some of the most interesting I have ever seen, Trying to not only provide yourself with the food and water but a mixture of Proteins, Fats, and carbs along with water, Which provides a perfect balance of being complicated enough to feel like real life but still simple enough that after about 5 -in game- days it felt like second nature and no longer slowed me from progressing along the plot. One minor concern, all the mushrooms are named unknown mushroom, and especially early game when I was looking for the mushroom that removed parasites and I struggle 2 of the different types apart, I can also partially understand the reason to not explain what each item does, but when I have an illness or I am about to die, I feel there should be a better alternative to just cramming everything into my mouth the I come into contact with, including mysterious snails -which to this day I still have no idea what they do- but this is a small problem and with the exception of that minor irritation its my favourite survival system ever by far.

I highly recommend this game to gamer's out there. 8/10

It's worth every penny you pay. The graphics are beautiful and amazing.
 
It's my first ever survival game and I am hooked.

It's just been a few hours into the game and it's a brilliant and beautiful game.

One of the most amazing audio theme track I have ever heard in a game.

As you start the game the first thing to do did is wear your headset and enjoy the theme song of the game.

It was a bit frustrating at first, as there are no hints, no specifics as to what to do and how to survive except a notebook which keeps getting updated as you try and do new things.

I haven't learned everything, I still have a lot to explore in-game. I have died many times and then learned along the way, Its not an easy game, Its pure survival and learning about how to protect yourself in the wilds.

I will re-write another review to this game after I finish it. 


[b]
For now I have a few request's for the Creepy Jar team,

I really want to see this game grow and have more potential in future, I request you guys to add in steam achievements and steam game cards to the game so it would boost popularity of the game in the steam market.

If possible please add steam achievements in the next update. 

It needs a hell lot of tweaking as it takes a toll on your graphic card and drops fps for no reason.

Waiting for the co-op mode as promised by you guys. 

I also request to give us players the option to save the game on the run, 
as its gets frustrating to replay everything from the previous save when you die. 

Other than that you guys have done a great job. 
Thank you for this wonderful adventure.

The world is quite large, the graphics, while sometimes Unity-store-based, are still gorgeous, and the gameplay is quite ingenious at times.  Most survival games do food-and-water.  Green Hell does Protein/Carbs/Fat as food and differentiates between Clean/Dirty/Unclean water.  You can get parasites, leeches, bites, venom, fevers, and more.  While I've put well over 100 hours into the game, I'm one of those base-building junkies who plays WAAAAY longer than most.  I have 500 hours in Conan Exiles and most of my characters in Elder Scrolls games are around 300 hours each.  So, with that in mind, I'd estimate that the story-based portion of the game is a solid 25-40 hours for most ""normal"" gamers, with tons more potential for weirdos like me.

And there's plenty more coming, like co-op and more structures and the like.  Please check out the developers Road Map on their site before joining the Discord and asking them questions directly.  Also, note, they do talk to fans directly... which is awesome.

All this for a mere 25 bucks?!

I wouldn't recommend this game to everyone.  Not everyone likes/appreciates this level of realism and difficulty.  But if you like these types of games... DEFINITELY give this game a try!  Without a doubt!  Green Hell and Die Young are my two indie survival gems of the year!

24,Green Hell,55810365,english,"This is a fun survival game, but it has several major problems. For one thing, all your stuff will constantly be destroyed by tribals. This wouldn't be such a problem if there was some functional way of preventing or discouraging their attacks. Instead of a functional deterrent, tribals can apparently teleport right into your house and smash things while your back is turned and you're ten meters away. I was once alerted to just such a sneak attack after walking around a large boulder next to my camp and suddenly half my house was debris from the six people attacking my stuff.

This might appeal to some people; there are gamers out there who enjoy having to start over from scratch every five minutes. However, it takes forever to build anything. What you can lose in seconds after blinking in the wrong spot will take you fifteen minutes to even begin rebuilding... and since resource requirements are so high and force you to venture out far, it means coming back to YET ANOTHER teleport assault that destroyed all your stuff. If this doesn't sound tedious to you, you might have a promising career in forensic accounting or as a law historian. My condoleances.

The tedium doesn't stop there, however. Leeches. Leeches everywhere. As soon as you touch an area that is designated as ""underbrush"", you stand a chance of being covered in leeches. This means that you will constantly be stopping and looking at all your limbs and clicking the leeches off. They have a minor, easily-ignored effect on gameplay, but leaving them on is still a bad idea. So while you're rebuilding all your stuff from magical teleporting suicidal tribals, carrying stacks of carefully unbalanced numbers of materials (you need four logs? You can carry three. You need six long sticks? You can carry five. They drop in twos. Enjoy your extra trips, sucker), you'll periodically have to drop everything and shake off more goddamn leeches.

Sounds tolerable despite how I'm making it sound? Congratulations, you've graduated to the final test of tediousness. Animal hazards. Never, ever run. For any reason. Ever. Venomous snakes and spiders and stingrays guarantee that if you aren't moving at a crawl you'll be dead. One bite is easy enough to manage, provided you have the resources to deal with it... but the fever means you'll pass out sooner rather than later. This can cause a sickness cascade that means you wake up dead. Avoidable if the correct resources spawn in convenient places in sufficient quantities, but that's trusting RNG to save your life. Oh, but that's fine! Just stockpile resources ahead of time, right?

Wrong. Unless you build a container (which are stupidly complex to build), resources can and will despawn. Wonderful. Okay, still manageable, right? WRONG BECAUSE TRIBALS TELEPORT AND BREAK YOUR SHIT WHEN YOU AREN'T LOOKING.

The entire thing is an exercise in frustration. You have every option given to you to establish a home base to help yourself survive, but the game practically forces you to be a nomad barely scraping by the entire time, constantly attacked by infinite numbers of tribals who don't seem to mind that one single man has killed hundreds of them and used their bones for armor, predators that can and will attack you through walls, and the single worst thing in the existence of anything: skin-worms.

The least frustrating way to play this game is to disable all of the pointless annoyances, which turns the game into a stupidly simple basebuilder survival game... with no point to playing after you've got a good thing going on, since that means no story mode.

That might sound like I'm simply making a bad decision, but you haven't played this game. The threats I've listed above? Easily avoidable. If you don't move quickly, audio cues alert you to nearby hazards, and you can deal with them very easily. One arrow to the face of a predator will kill it, and those jaguars stalk you nice and slow enough for you to shoot them. Even squads of tribals are easy to deal with; one stab with a sharp stick followed by backing off and they'll bleed out. Basic bone armor will keep you alive. None of the threats are that serious, they're just annoying.

That's the game in one word. Annoying. Which is a shame, because I really LOVE the basebuilding and survival aspects.

What a journey this was. Seriously, I never write reviews, but I just have to this time. I am blown away. This is easily one of the most beautiful, most fascinating, most immersive, most frightening, most heart-wrenching, most impactful and most rewarding games that I've EVER played. The story is flawless, not a single inconsistency or plot point out of place. The map and landscape is expertly crafted and full of little details to make it seem like reality. The crafting is well thought out and rewarding, and the survival gameplay is very smooth, immersive and not frustrating at all. Exploration is so rewarding. That feeling when you come across a new place and have that sense of awe, wonder and adventure. After I beat the story, I couldn't stop thinking about it for days. I couldn't focus at work, I couldn't play other games, it was just so deep. The games story and its message will stay with me for the rest of my life and that is priceless.

Avoid looking at story line or maps etc.  I looked up one thing on coconut mechanics because it was important, but otherwise I've enjoyed the game SOOO much more by keeping it all a mystery (made the mistake of seeing too much about The Forest).  The survival challenge is very fun (though i set Nutrient depletion at LOW, seemed too fast otherwise) and the jungle atmosphere is really well done.  The story is very interesting so far, some nice twists.  Enjoy!

52,Green Hell,55678658,english,"TL:DR: More polished game than i expected, an enjoyable 10-20 hour experience for a story runthrough. 7/10, with a bump to 8/10 considering that this game was made by a small team, probably on a shoe-string budget.

Mechanics: While i disliked the protein-fat-carb system at first, I came to enjoy it as time wore on, adding some additional dimensions to the usually simplistic calorie system used by these types of games. The inspection system is less impressive from a gameplay perspective; while i appreciate the added immersion in regards to wounds etc., it is just simply annoying to regularly have to stop and pick off leaches every 5 minutes. These slimy annoyants just keeps latching on, and there is no added enjoyment to the mechanic after the first few times. The mechanics (with the exception of the nutrition system, which admittedly can't be designed ""realistically"" in a game and still be fun) aspires to a more realistic take on survival in the jungle, and adds to the immersion. 

Difficulty: The game can be insanely difficult before you understand the basic mechanics and plants, but once you've gotten the grip on those it is too easy on the base difficulty. I died 3 times in the starting area of the game, and then didn't die a single time for the rest of the game.Once you get a bow and know what plants do what and how they look, the jungle is stuffed with food and medicine. I don't know if it is different on the harder settings, but the hostile natives were way too easy to avoid as they could be clearly heard singing from far away. Didn't have to fight a single one of them throughout the runthrough. 

Story: The amnesia story is a bit predictable at times, but there is a mild twist in the end. There are some logical loopholes to the story, but nothing major. Overall the story surprises on the positive side, while not doing anything outstanding.

Graphics: Graphics are a mixed bag, don't expect to be overwhelmed here. Lighting is used to good effect, but overall graphics are nothing to write home about, with animation that sometimes can be a bit robotic. This might be unfair however considering the indie-nature of the developer, and if taking that into consideration then the graphics work is quite impressive.

Bugs/QA: No bugs except a few graphical/animation glitches during my single run-through, so a good job there.

Audio: Not much to say here, audio is generally good. Music is barely used, but where it is it is well placed. I must say that i was surprised by the quality of the voice-acting, specifically by the lead, Jake. Mia, the main other voiced character, is OK, but not great. These ""single-A"" games usually does not have great voiceacting, which is why i was pleasantly surprised. 

Would recommend to fans of survival games.

54,Green Hell,55673417,english,"Despite all the bad things and lack of features that I'm going to say, the game is very good and fun, gave me some good hours of fun. If you like survival games buy it.

I didnt even played the story mode, couldnt skip the slow cutscenes and got me bored. So I went to the survival mode ""Welcome to the Jungle"" first to get the hang of things. The early hours were pretty frustrating, but the beauty and dynamics of the game made me want to learn and not give up on surviving in that forest. I have been reading the Official wiki and learning more and more.

On the 20th day I was already a master. I decided to restart in the ""King of the Jungle"" mode. I came to the conclusion that once you get the hang of the game, and get aware of the dangers of the forest, the game is easy regardless of the difficulty. My only challenge now was to make a very large base with lots of boxes, water supply, forge, etc. I'm on the 34th day, my base is huge in a good location, I've explored the whole map, and I can safely say these things:

• The game could have more content, we just have a few things to do.
• I think it arrived early on Steam, the devs should have done more stuff.
• I feel the map is small. You can cross it all in a few minutes with some energy mushrooms and food.
• Predators are challenging, but the crocodile should be much more faster and difficult to kill.
• I think it could have more game mechanics, it would be more challenging.
• Lack of basic constructions, there isnt anything to store Bamboo Sticks and Long Sticks.
• You can't craft a lot of things at once, and that's very boring. 
• I miss more animals, more fruits, more herbs, etc.
• The artificial intelligence of enemies is stupid, some animals too.
• Snakes should move, not stand still.
• A lot of stuff are ""Unknow"" thing. They should have a name once we know it.
• Some dangers aren't really a true danger... Venom wounds cures very fast and I never cared about fever.
• Some shorcuts to move stuff around (craft>backpack | backpack>box) would be nice.
• We have a door frame, but we don't have a door? Like, wtf? Same about windows.
• Something to keep our coconuts bowls would be nice too, currently they are all messy on the ground.
• We need a quiver for the arrows.
• Building is very simple.

While this game is amazing in many regards and does survival just right, I don't think it was ready for full release.

The first few hours of the game are amazing, you die constantly trying to figure out how to play this. Once you get it? It's rather simple! Once the games simple, you start searching for things to do as you are no longer in dire need of survival. Exploring is fun, for one time thing. Building? While I was excited for it, I soon learned that it's made horribly.

Building: Everything is red, ground not flat? Red, trying to place a little lower? Red. Trying to place a bed? Red. Simply building a small base is hell hole of its own.
Now while this game is called green hell, the usuable amount of green in it? Almost nothing, you quickly find that you are out of trees to work with and cant extend your base. So you move to bamboo, can't build anything with it, can't start fire, not usuable for barely anything. (And the building frame of bamboo is much smaller, so it gets a lot more red, non build zones.)

All of those large trees around you? Can't chop them down, not even with the best tools the game gives you. So you end up living in a forest, with plenty of trees, but zero usuable wood.

AI: The AI in this game is well, not... Smart? Water, any of the built in buildings, the AI just can't reach you.

I feel like the game needs a lot of work, however. Once that's done, it would make for one of the best survival games out there!",1570701622,1570701622,FALSE,226,21,0.848278344,33,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,119,5,871,0,671,1572008406,,

If you enjoy hard core survival, well Green Hell pretty much defines it now.  I can say this because it doesn't do much else BESIDES pure hardcore survival, there's nothing else to do besides staying alive one more day in the Amazon. The story mode gives you a compelling reason to, which so many other survival games lack.

You don't just have a food meter.  You have _three_ food meters. Proteins, Carbs, Fats.  So you can't just eat coconuts all day.  You MUST watch your feet frequently while you walk lest you step on a snake or anthill, which really can ruin the entire day if not lead to your death.  You will acquire leeches no matter how vigilant you are.  You get no notification they're there, you must proactively engage Inspect mode occasionally and remove them one by one.  Failure to do so has real consequences.

There's excellent immersion.  No UI. All pertinent health data is communicated through your wristwatch and everything you learn is recorded in a journal with sketches.  The excellent & beautiful graphics, esp water effects, also really help with immersion.

The crafting is done pretty much exactly like The Forest and that is a compliment.  The inventory system feels very organic and well-organized and you really become one with your pack, it's hard to describe.

Twitching dead [spoiler] cougars [/spoiler] or [spoiler] Tribe people [/spoiler] running in circles and the occasional stuck between stuff glitch.
[B] BUT THAT DOES NOT MEAN THE GAME IS BUGGY [/B]. The devs are very active and releasing hotfixes where necessary.

swimming
drowning

There's some stuff to say on the negative, like the fact that it doesn't feel it's worth the hassle to build most of the stuff available, as if around 40% of the recipes were kinda pointless OR redundant. But it also gives many way to tackle the environment too, so i dunno if it's good or bad.

I'm ok with the natives being hostile, but I was hoping that they would either wander off occasionally, or go to sleep so I could sneak in and out.

Since I bought the game, there have already been a couple of content patches, so the developers are still working on and adding to the game experience.",1570371560,1570547192,TRUE,31,2,0.765672088,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,157,4,9495,0,2931,1595220015,,

So frustrating at first to figure out how to keep alive for more than a few days, but once over that hump, the exploration, building, scenery, and discoveries are simply amazing and so rewarding. 

Sometimes it's even peaceful on a beautifully sunny Amazonian morning... until you go out to collect some bananas only to come face to face with with a jaguar waiting for you in your camp and getting mauled to death.

2,Green Hell,55068787,english,"Great survival game. The survival theme is challenging the story mode of the game is magnificent and the plot is very good. I recommend this game if you like survival. 
Developers (on discord) are very friendly and they look like they take into consideration what you, as player, have to say about the game, your opinions about it and practically anything you can say to improve the game.
Combat mechanics could be better though, but one big detail this game is about survival not fighting bots/NPCs
Graphics are very good, you'll be amazed by the rain, the foliage and the mud.
For now, is only single player (which sucks a lot at least for me) but by the end of 2019 and beginning of 2020 developers plan to implement multiplayer.

The game is very good, exploring is very good, the graphics will most certainly mesmerize you and the survival part against diseases, animals, parasites, foods and water will most certainly frustrate you at the beginning but make you ""fall in love"" once you manage to survive (and understand how to). 

Edited from here
A few cons to this game would be:
-Story line is short, you can do the whole story e like 10 to 20 hours;
-You have a lot of option to build, yet you can do story mode by just building fires to cook food, everything else you can find it on the map (I don´t really understand why developers spend so much time creating building;
-Once you learn how to survive (food, water and fighting mechanics), the game becomes very easy even on maximum difficulty;
-The maximum difficulty challenge would be (only) not getting yourself killed because once you're dead, you're dead, I mean, you have to start over;
-I would not recommend anyone to pay full price of this game, it's not worth it!
-Survival mode is just about that, survive in the jungle, but once again, the moment you learn about food, water and fighting, the game becomes pretty easy being the only difficulty not getting killed.

However the exploration of the jungle does become tiresome and once you have seen it all and gotten reasonably good at surviving, the game can become a bit pooring. Luckily it does require a lot of play time to get to unlock all recipies to craft metal weapons etc. So there is definitely many hours of play in the survival mode.

But I was so thrilled and excited to learn they released the full game and story mode, just as I was getting a bit tired of walking through the same jungle, over and over again.

And I most say the story is masterful!!
It is so good in it self that I got a little tear in my eyes when I saw the ending. 

The story of Jake and Mia is so deep and beaytiful.
The puzzles to solve the game quests so intertwined in the story that it is fucking obvios when you get it, but the story also throws you of the track the same time. I just love that, you really need to listen and read it all in the story to get the answers. 
After hours of searching the jungle, I had to resort to Google 2 times to get a clue to get the story rolling again.
But like a good book, this game is really hard to let go.. I just had to get to the ending and figure out if Jake.....

I think I will have fun with the challenges modes now.

survival mechanics - solid 5/7

very detailed enviornment and realistic charackter behavior - you do not know what plants are edible or can cure desease, you have to find out, 

crafting, self treatment and cooking is done by pulling the materials out of your backpack and puting them where they have to be (for example you have to take the bandage onto the right spot on your body if you are hurt, or you have to put the food manually onto the cooking spots of a fire)

building is done very immersive and you have to add every piece individually and in the right order (you cannot add the leaves for the roof if the foundation is not finished)


story telling and atmosphere - 5/7

deep and dark story which is not predictable and it will touch your heart, find out what happens by yourself

Its a great balance of challenge and relief that doesn't really go away like some survival games. Every time you go out into the jungle brings big risk and satisfying reward.

What I really want to focus on however is the story. I had no idea what to expect, going in completely blind. I am glad I did. The story isn't always consistent and there are points of weakness that are probably only present due to budget, but if you love immersion like I do... well lets just say it really grabbed me and didn't really let go. 

There were some moments that left me speechless. Some moments where I felt alone. And some moments where the true horror of events past and current were almost too much. This game doesn't hit you with cheap shocks or sudden violence, but a creeping discomfort that can rise up to existential horror that I have a feeling will stay with me for days. 

And yet, when I boot the game up again tomorrow and wander through the beautiful rendered jungle and go back into my newly learned patterns of survival... that may wash away again. And I will only have the birds and the capybara for company.

30,Green Hell,55433267,english,"tl;dr; - Amazone game, do recommend.

I had the game for some time and jumped into it right after finishing ""the Forest"". 
Comparing the two:
- Green Hell is slower paced, more focused on surviving the nature vs natives, Think Long Dark nature trying to kill you. Apply jungle.
- The story in Green Hell is much better done and told than in the Forest
- building is on par for two with game pace in mind. Having sticks storage is not mandatory but feels like a good quality of life boost.
- survival aspects are deeper in Green Hell and force you to forage more.
- sanity actually matters in Green Hell. And leeches are real issue in rain forest, trust me.

With all above in mind let me tell you how amazing the story is. It's so good I spent 36 hours over last 4 days playing it. Voice acting is great and tons of information is fed via text but this reading is well done and on point. What if I told you that in the beginning with the map  you will find THE book? I encourage you to go through all interactive story items as they fill in all possible gaps in the story. No spoon feeding though.
I sure did took my time to explore and never looked up the solutions. At some point I got stuck and walked past that damned ""gate item"" more times than I'm happy to admit. To the point that I set up a camp next to the location of said item for 4 in-game days going through brought in supplies while searching. And it was exciting, not bothersome. 

Some complain about time warp being to fast, but I assure you - it is paced with overall game experience and map size. You sure can get across the map in one day if you well fed, your backpack is empty and you have a good setup camp on the other side. You will have issues building said camp if you mule 50+ kg of rocks and sticks over rainforest for half a day. Unless you have that magic blue mushroom in you pocket to boost the stamina.

39,Green Hell,55416208,english,"I will be comparing Green Hell to the Forest quite a bit in this review, seeing as it's the best comparison I can make to other games I have played in the survival-genre.

I bought this game in Early Access because I expected it to be better than The Forest in terms of realism.
I played it for less than an hour just after buying it, it being clear to me, that it wasn't yet up to par and needed more time in development.

Now, after 1.0 came out, I decided to give it another go.

And I must say, I find it much, much better than The Forest. Not only in terms of story and writing, but also in terms of content.
Although you can't build intricate tree-houses and create a massive base in a span of a few days like The Forest, you instead deal with a hostile environment where, in order to survive, you have to get acquainted with wildlife, flora and a well-made crafting system.

In terms of story, the voice acting and dialogue is just superb in terms of authenticity and realism. 
The story and characters seem grounded in real life and you end up feeling empathetic to their situation which I didn't find to be the case in The Forest.
The story also has several endings, one of which made me clap as the credits started to roll.

Performance-wise, it took me a while to find a satisfying balance between looks and performance.
I run a Intel i7 8700 3.20 12-core CPU and a Geforce GTX 1060 6GB on a 144Hz monitor.

There is a decent tutorial to get you started that's tied with the story, but to truly overcome the challenges of the jungle, you'll have to get your hands dirty.

Speaking of getting your hands dirty, say you eat a piece of fruit with your filthy hands. Suddenly, you'll need another piece of fruit to satisfy the hunger of the growing number of parasites that have made their way inside your body, making survival increasingly difficult until you find a way to deal with them.
In order to do so, you'll be scouring the undergrowth for various mushrooms and other edibles to find out what'll help you dispose of the unwelcome guests ravaging your stomach.

This is what makes Green Hell stand out in comparison to games such as The Forest; mastering the environment through a mixture of experimentation and caution.

If you're looking for a game where survival quickly becomes menial and you really just want to build a huge base with your friends, go play The Forest or Rust. (As of writing this, the Green Hell developers are working on a co-op mode).
If you're looking for a game where survival is the key focus, and base-building and crafting is much more founded in reality, this is the game for you.",1570063616,1570063697,TRUE,10,2,0.612987816,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,381,8,1970,0,1401,1595715124,,

Mechanics wise this is one of the best survival games there is. 
The story was also absolutely great and a really nice addition to the otherwise very build focussed survival games.
But there's one thing that I didn't like about the story: there's no need for building large structures or entire bases. 
You just need your little palm leaves tent or a leaf bed to sleep and occasionally a little roof to save. It's not a bad thing to shift focus away from the core mechanics and focus on the story but a bit more....well...surviving would be a nice thing. The resources are scarce but not too bad so you always find the stuff you need even if it takes a few minutes.I like that you can't save in the pause menu. It adds to the survival part. One last great thing is the dialogues. They are simply AMAZING. So many emotions in the sequences, so much pain and sadness. It just adds up to the whole experience. Amazing!

All in all this is definitely an amazing game very much worth of the 20€ it costs. I highly recommend it to anyone who likes survival games. In my experience definitely a 7.7/10.

50,Green Hell,55398531,english,"Starting the game is becoming deeply repetitive and boring.

I start with no resource and always have to follow the same path: stone for basic tree cut, dry leaf for making fire, small house to be able to save the game for the first time.

In story mode at least I always start on the same place and I'm getting used to where stuff is. In survivor mode it's worse, because I always have to explore first. On one run I walked for over 10min without finding a single stone, therefore can't light fire, therefore...

As I look for resources or explore, time goes by, I get hungry, sick, insane, tired. If I don't get to the point of lighting fire, then I need to eat raw food, which makes me sick and insane even faster. I end up dying for some sickness or starvation or insanity makes it impossible to move on.

Things degrade too damn fast, before I can even get basic stuff crafted.

I think the game needs better balancing. Either make char more resistant to sickness and insanity so we can live longer and just live by with sub-sustainable condition, or let us start with some resources so we can start building quicker and choose what to build.

Also, these basic diseases in the game don't kill somebody in 2 days, as nobody dies for 2 days of starvation or gets insane in 2 days. There are ppl that survived plane crashes and lived alone for years, not getting insane to the point they can't even see anymore. In Brasil itself many ppl have starvation and have parasites and sickness most time in their lives ever since they are born and they live over 50 years.

Green Hell is 1 of only 2 games that have managed to suck me in and refuse to let go long after I've completed it, with its vibrant atmospheres, intuitive game play and deep, masterful storytelling.

The funny thing is, it's the [i]story[/i] I can't let go of.

I might be extremely partial to this aspect of the game because I experienced it on a blind run at normal difficulty.

No guides. No vids. Nada.

This, to me, spelled immersion – it was up to me to figure out what I was able to craft and how to use some of the stuff I found, not to mention where to go at some points.

[i]""Fuck, I'm dying of thirst. Why can't I just look up and open my mouth, and drink in the rain? Maybe I need to gather the rain... I do have coconut shells... What if I [spoiler]drag them out of my pack onto the ground?[/spoiler]""[/i]

Boom. That's some gratifying shit.

But I digress.

The story is no less brutal, and will have you questioning things the way you do at the end of a truly captivating movie.

The [i]way[/i] the story is delivered elevates it to a whole 'nother level, with narratives unfolding as you explore and leaving it to the player to piece together the information at times.

The journey can be pretty tough if you think you can just traipse around the Amazon rainforest all willy nilly – you will die a lot, so saving often is [strike]probably[/strike] a good idea. But if you're like me and don't mind a few (okay, [i][b]a lot[/b][/i] of) deaths – it's the survival/crafting genre, c'mon – I seriously encourage you to try running it blind, at least on your first play-through.

I'm one of those who don't normally write reviews, so I hope that adds credence to just how bad ass this game is.

I really hope that the blue mushrooms eventually have a psychadelic effect to it, I hope that the fishing rod becomes easier to use, idk I have huge problems with it, so I just shoot/spear my fish, keep my larva supplies high for the large fish trap.

I could go on and on, over all this game is more than just a pass time activity for me, it gets me thinking about the foundations of all we have today.

0,Green Hell,55234229,english,"A very good survival game, worth €21.

It's not perfect, the survival sandbox is very good, the challenges are nice, and the story is... debatable I guess, I personally loved it.

In this game you're thrown into the jungle and everything can kill you.
You have to learn how to survive on your own. You have to find food, learn where to find it easily, what you can eat, and what you can't. You can and have to experiment with crafting and cooking recipes. For hours and hours you just keep discovering new elements of the game.
There's a decent amount of structures you can build, and the wide array of tools makes sure that you can customise your base for the area you settled or the playstyle you prefer.
The flora and fauna are very rich and diverse for such a game, and I mean the usable part, not the visuals. That and the fact that potentially everything can kill you really gives back that jungle feeling.

[u]The Challenges[/u] are a nice addition and you do need experience to complete them... it's timed, so you can improve your playstyle if you want to... and the experience you get there translates into other modes as well.

[u]The Story[/u] is... stupid at first. It really annoyed me at the beginning, but you just gotta push through. In my opinion it's worth it.
There are at least 2 endings, I can tell you that much, since it's revealed even in the story. I've found both of them amazing. Everything is explained to you in the end, and it's not some mystical or sci-fi nonsense. And you don't have to grind through the whole game again to get the 2nd ending. You have 4 save slots and you can use them however you want it.
The cutscenes are just awesome. It looks great, sounds great, feels great. I'm not a fan of these dream scenes, but it was done well here, very well.


So one complaint I heard is that some people didn't like the ending. Understandable. It's not bad in quality, some people just expected/wanted something else afaik.

[u]Overall low difficulty.[/u]
- The enemies are mostly avoidable.
- Even if you have to fight, it's not that hard, and you can even cheese it.
- The preparation for fights are inexpensive, both initially, and keeping yourself prepared.
- Too many resources. Sadly it's not even a setting you can change.
This means that the only challenge for an experience player is permadeath, or self-imposed limitations.

[u]Clunky inventory system[/u], crafting, and picking up items is annoying.
They had really good ideas regarding these features, but it's just slow to use atm.
- Inventory always opens on middle tab, not the one you closed it on.
- No keys to switch between inventory tabs.
- You can't craft in series, because crafting has an animation that closes the crafting screen.
- You have to drag and drop every item one by one to the crafting screen, so no shift-click to move them, like in every other crafting game.
- No auto-arrange. Different items have different shapes, so the inventory management is kind of like a jigsaw puzzle. Even with an auto-arrange feature some people would not like it, but without that it's really tedious.
- The hitboxes or highlighting of items is just weird. You look at one item but your guy picks up another. Sometimes you can't even get the game to highlight an item for picking up. Fortunately you can grab and move/drag items in the world when your inventory is open.


Overall nothing game-breaking, but these problems can destroy some brain cells... and I can't afford to lose much more.

If The Long Dark is a marathon, then Green Hell is a sprint. Not because it has less content, but because it's more dense.
This game is not as brutal as The Forest; I feel the gameplay and story are much better, and more engaging in GH.

It is brutally still hard to stay alive, game mechanics eventually click in place after many deaths leaving you to manage, thirst, hunger, injury, shelter, threats, medicine, navigation.

If it was easy, it wouldn't be satisfying when eventually you start succeeding.

Story mode while a challenging and confusing ride, could be helped a little with better icons or map design. I say this rather frustrated at missing out on a key location and getting the ""bad ending"" and having to google if there even was a good one? 

I have a few friends and watched alot of streamers also no not know about clues or locations for the good story ending.

I believe this is due to bad level and map design towards the end of the game and way too much information to read.

Leaving the story mode nearly a great experience, but more disappointing in the execution towards the end.

I highly recommend this game for the jungle survival experience.

Survival mode gives the game more to do afterwards. Focusing on larger base building and crafting of iron tools and weapons etc.

Snakes don't move, they just sit on the ground, why? Add more than one kind of snake and make them move, or have them hanging in the trees. Only a few predators to look out for; caiman, pumas, jaguars, natives. These are the only ones that will chase you, everything else you can just avoid if you're careful in the dark; snakes, spiders, manta rays, poison frogs, ant hills. Still, many ways to die, so learning how to treat your injuries is very important.

Crafting is done very well overall. Unlock blueprints by finding the items scattered among the jungle, and increasing your crafting skills. Building structures is a bit more annoying. The flatter the surface the better, you can't build on hills or inclines reliably.

UPDATE REVIEW 17/09/2019

Simply it still feels like its in early access! dam shame :-(",1557941082,1568750199,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,213,4,538,0,115,1594336042,,
30,Green Hell,55153750,english,"Straight up one of my favorite games of all time. Be warned, though: Amongst the overflowing genre, this game is actually, fully and totally about survival, and survival only. It doesn't clutter the experience with skill trees, character progression or an overly mystic scenario. It won't sidetrack you by building a compound of structures or machinery. This is a hard game. You will die. You might find yourself with a great setup and then two unlucky missteps while roaming the wild will have you die within minutes. No matter how long you played it. You will be frustrated at times. There's A LOT of seemingly unfair problems you'll encounter. Rest assured, though, that there are solutions to every single one of them.

The biggest difference to other survival games, to me, is that in Green Hell, there's no escaping the danger. Yes, you will figure out the mechanics. Yes, you will learn how to secure your survival pretty predictably. But No, you won't be able to mitigate the threats to a level where things become trivial. Simpler, yes. Trivial, never. And this is what you need to enjoy in order to enjoy this game. Progression in Green Hell is largely skill-based: The game becomes easier because you grow more knowledgable, and thus act smarter. You gain that knowledge by failing, which, most likely, means by dying often. You'll not find the magical ""axe +7"" and suddenly fell trees with a single hit. You will not unlock new skills that make your nutrition intake last twice as long.

You will, however, find a rare opportunity to fully immerse yourself into a vibrant, gorgeous jungle world. Nothing will break your immersion – Green Hell will never force you to leave actual gameplay. Not for a skill tree, because there is none. Not for the inventory or crafting, because they are seamlessly embedded. Green Hell will never have you sidetracked, because you'll never happen build a giant compound of structures of complex machinery, like in most survival games. Everything you'll build will serve the purpose of surviving. It will make sense that you can build it, and it will make sense that you can acquire the resources with the tools at your disposal. Green Hell will never threaten your mental immersion, because everything  you will encounter and experience will make sense, without buying into some sort of alternate reality or fantasy scenario. You'll die due to thirst, hunger, food poisoning, poisonous wildlife, predatorial animals or aggressive tribesmen – every single time because you did something wrong. You didn't watch your step and walked into a rattlesnake. You left an open fire burning through the night and attracted the tribal warriors. You didn't plan ahead for the dry season and hadn't secured an alternate water source.

You will die often, but Green Hell will never kill you. Every death is avoidable. Any avoidance is always active by the player, never automated by any in-game-systems. You can never get careless, or you will die. In the beginning, dying will be plentiful. Even after some initial learning, you might find yourself with a great setup – and then two unlucky missteps while roaming the wild will have you die within minutes.

But once you've learned how to actively survive, you'll have a blast. It feels great roaming the jungle for a day, dodging seven rattlesnakes because you looked and listened carefully. Avoiding a run-in with the predatory wildlife because you knew how to retreat. Circumnavigating the tribal warriors undetected, because you recognized their presence early and moved nimbly.

Another day, you'll walk straight into a rattlesnake right after you fought off a puma while fleeing from the warrior tribe, and still manage to save yourself because you have learned exactly what to do in those critical situations. Then, after this stressful day, you'll find yourself back at camp, lying down on your log bed besides the campfire, knowing that, the way you set up your base, nothing bad will come to you – until next morning, when it all starts over again.

Not to even speak of the exhilaration when you, despite your best efforts, were ambushed by a group of four tribesmen, and managed to fight them off, patch up your wounds and make it safely to one of your secondary camps, where you found the life-saving food and water you stashed in preparation for the worst.",1568725123,1568725123,TRUE,32,1,0.78302747,2,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,206,8,3619,0,3065,1570818332,,

Hardest mode is called like a game Green hell and its not hard because you don't have real perma death and you can save up to 4 times so that is 1st major issue to be hardcore survival. Than catching animals is really easy ( both active and with traps ) and they re-spawn  on regular basis so there is no real danger of starving , also you are provided with map even on hardcore mode:-)  You have natives ( aka cannibals in The Forest)  too but they are easy to kill specially with bow, 1 arrow in head and boom and you can dodge their arrows easily.

Although the devs do update often enough - still the bugs I encountered left me feeling disappointed.

I stopped playing, but I will surely come back in about 6 months time when most of the issues has been attended too.

These are the two main things that put me off from playing Green Hell:

Stuff stops spawning - or at least it looks like it does. When you reload your save, there'd be multiple items in a spawn spot.
At one stage I had like 5 Cane Toads stuck on each other, and some weird bird glitches due to this.

Save system is somewhat broken. I lost give or take 5 hours worth of play. The game forces you to manually save. Sometimes it doesn't work. I discovered this the hard way.

The things I like:

It is a very beautiful game.
It performs very well.
I like the sinisterness of the story.
I played on Welcome to the Jungle difficulty (normal), and found it challenging but not to a point of frustration.

Green Hell is a great game. My suggestion is to give the devs time to fix up some more bugs.

42,Green Hell,55135790,english,"As someone who has played a great many survival games, I can confidently say that Green Hell is a unique game, and I consider it a gem. It's not unique because it is a survival game, but rather it is unique in its' execution, in its' setting and in its' story. These all set it apart from other survival games. To try to avoid rambling I'll just bullet point what I consider the most important bits.

Technical Aspects: 
-Visuals are above par for games of the genre, the game is frankly beautiful
-Excellent sound design in music and ambient sounds
-Good sized map
-Challenging survival aspects which are deeper than just ""eat, drink, sleep""

Gameplay:
-Excellent atmosphere, the game can be calming, stressful, awe inspiring, and at times fairly unnerving
-Phenomenal  level design, the world feels natural but varied making it very interesting to explore
-A fairly extensive list of crafting recipes
-An engaging story that I actually got truly invested in for a number of reasons
-A good balance between story, survival, and free exploration
-Excellent pacing, playing on 'Welcome to the Jungle' difficulty, I didn't feel that the game was too fast, nor too slow, unless I purposefully chose to rush or slow down
-The world feels alive, as if it already existed and you walked right in, not like the world was made just for you
-Survival is complex, at least relatively. Eating various things to keep different macro elements up, finding a reliable source of safe water, creating natural treatments and staying sane are all important and challenging
-Real threats, things can definitely kill you in this game, and don't expect too much warning about them in most cases

Things to consider:
-Combat is somewhat peculiar, while it is functional, this is simply not a game that is too focused on combat
-Saving is sparse, saving must be done with the use of calendars found in the world or specific structures, built or found. You can't just save through the menu.
-This game is hard! It's definitely not impossible, and if you're like me you'll enjoy the challenge, but this is not a game that tends to hold your hand.

Survival fans are likely to appreciate the fleshed out survival and crafting mechanics, those who love a good story will probably be taken by the one in Green Hell just as I was, and no matter who you are, it's hard not to be impressed with the rendering of the Amazon in Green Hell.

I have to say.

At the start it's pretty hard, as you have no clue how to do anything, what to eat or how to heal yourself. Through much frustration, and a few deaths you figure out how to survive, and can get good at it. But the enjoyment didn't stop for me there. These was still things to learn, and the story was compelling. 

Ignore the negative reviews from people who have only played an hour. If you invest some time in to this, you will get a lot from it. 

DON'T watch any spoiler videos or read the hints and tips on Wiki. learn as you go, figure things out on your own. that way it will be WAY more rewarding.

Now with full release I have completed the story mode , all i can say is WOW!   very interesting.  
Not going to spoil it for you but it was excellent.  

I still continue to play survival I I find this  extremely fun.
likes:  
great graphics , the water and ripples look great 
you can custom build all over the place 
creepy sounds  can get you on edge :)   survived a few tiger attacks  but they can be dangerous.
you need to explore to gain a larger build menu  which is nice 

Once you have figured out a few basics its not to hard except those tigers  
I still use a third party map  to find things  which I recommend 

negatives :
occasional glitch but dont not affect game play to much

47,Green Hell,55029646,english,"The Hero of my story is Arrowbutt, the Rainforest Capybara. You'll know soon enough..

Purchased this title today, with great hopes. My hopes got killed 8 times in 4 earthly hours of gameplay due to - 

1. Depletion of Carbs & Dehydration

2. Lack of proteins in my body in the Amazon Rainforest

3. Leeches, who apparently being 3 - 4 cm in length, sucked so much of my blood within half an in-game day, that I went bazinga & insanity killed me 3/8 times

4. Arrows - O dear - arrows are supposed to be Gods ammunition in such games, but my arrows couldn't kill Arrowbutt (the Capybara) in 3 clean hits & it ran away with 3 of my arrows in its butt, never to be found again.. along with my arrows..

5. What's with the time? Is Chronos a boss in this game somewhere? I chop down 3 palm trees to make a refuge & it is night already? Then the Leeches.. & no proteins.. & dehydration.. & no carbs & insanity etc. play Looney Tunes with me throughout the night & I wake up in the morning &.. I die.. Pretty sure body does not function like that. If I die when I wake up, I won't be waking up to see myself die.. duh! I'll die in my sleep.. never to wake up again

6. Constant stutters & lags

7. Crafting licks the 4 - holed ( 1 natural & 3 man made holes that I made) butt of the Capybara that ran off with 3 of my arrows in it.. Why do i need to craft my equipment one by one? I started crafting arrows at 8:00 am & by the time I crafted 10 - 12 arrows, it is 2:00 pm. Give a multi-crafting option. Here you'll show realism.. but not for Leeches.. & proteins.. & dehydration.. & carbs & insanity & time & Capybaras that don't die with 3 arrows in their butt..

Don't get me wrong developers.. the game has great potential. Very original idea & great graphics, but it needs to be player friendly as well. You cannot have realism in everything that kills me but in nothing that tends to keep me alive.

But, Developers also have provided a custom game mechanics section where you can toggle some of the features on or off according to how you perceive the reality should be.. to some extent. Those who feel the game should be something else, they can try this out, like i am.. 

I have asked Steam for a refund, but was denied refund as their refund policy says playtime should be less than 2 hours. So invest in this game wisely.. & if you see Arrowbutt when you play it, know that it was I who poked it 3 times..!",1568013967,1568570349,FALSE,4,13,0.447033316,7,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,90,8,347,0,255,1568021760,,

However cool this game may seem, just don't buy it.

Do yourself a favour.

It's really a waste of time for me to prove how TERRIBLE this game is but I will anyway:

Building anything is tedious.

You always get lost.

Going away from your home is such a worry.

Things required for the story mode are really difficult to find.

On the NORMAL DIFFICULTY the game is practically impossible to have fun with (you lose your energy stupidly quickly and your food and thirst decrease way too fast).

Some plants are really hard to find.

Bites from things are too lethal.

Snakes (which bite you) are hard to see.

NOTE:
Jokes aside,
Now that the game has released, it didn't really fix many of the issues. My main complaint is that the game is way to easy. For the first two-three hours, you may die to a rattlesnake or any of the spiders, but once you just learn to listen for the sounds you pretty much will never get bit again. The water mechanic is cool how you can get parasites from drinking unclean water, but once you learn that the red-ish mushrooms that grow near every water source kills your parasites, there is no consequence for drinking dirty water. Food is surprisingly abundant and the only annoying one to get is protein which is really easy once you figure out what to do. Any cuts or infections you get are incredible easy to heal and heal almost instantly with no penalty. The AI is brain dead and really easy to exploit as well.

The game needs better balance.",1556494287,1568439611,FALSE,0,0,0.484321654,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,43,11,1685,0,859,1588982196,,

The in-game minutes equal about 1.5-2 real-life seconds so your character's vitals reduce accordingly, which means fast, and it feels like a constant race against time to gather all the resources required to cook & feed, build a shelter & sleep (you're gonna need to build multiple shelters as you progress through the map), and recover from ailments lest your character faints on the ground and/or dies from exhaustion, venom, fever, food poisoning, parasites, etc. It's a positive in that it immerses you in the quest for survival but a negative in that it doesn't allow for much sightseeing and other time-wasting activities.

96,Green Hell,55058784,english,"I bought this game the first day out of Early Access because of the positive reviews and I've since sunk a fair amount of time into it. I've played through the story mode twice now (made it to the end twice, I've started over and died several times) on the basic (Welcome to the Jungle) difficulty, and I really, really love it. Without spoiling anything, there were certain points of the story that really blew me away and shook me.

The resource management can be a little tricky when you're first starting out. There isn't a basic, catch all ""FOOD"" need; if you don't know where to get things like clean water, carbs, and protein, you're going to have a very rough time of it. Once you understand which harvestables provide what resource, it gets a lot easier to manage your needs.

The crafting is really fun and interesting! You only start with a few crafting recipes but are able to learn more through leveling up your crafting skill (I like to think of it as becoming more confident in your abilities) and finding items and structures in the world that you can then build for yourself. In this way, exploration is incredibly rewarding. It's so much more satisfying than just finding a new map point and a few items to grab. 

One of the best things about this game to me is the ability to create your own difficulty. You can completely control what kind of threats you'll have to face, how quickly your resources deplete (or if they deplete at all!), and make your own gameplay experience.

You want a hard, grueling Survival experience where the whole jungle is out to get you and it's a race to keep your body fueled and functional enough to fight through it? You can have that!

You want to play a chill walk-through-the forest, base-building game without worrying about things like sleep, hunger, and dangerous predators? You can have that!

You want to play the game normally but just don't like snakes? You can have that too! You can turn the snakes off! There's literally a menu setting to disable snakes and spiders, how great is that?

This is a good, solid, enjoyable game with a fascinating story and an in-depth survival system that can be completely customized to your own desires without impacting the story at all.

5,Green Hell,55054301,english,"This game has so much going for it, I hope this isn't the end of development. 

Pros: 

I found myself creeping through the forest trying to identify every sound just to make sure I didn't get attacked by a predator or step too close to something poisonous. I can't think of another game that makes me so afraid of every sound. This is how you know you are immersed.

Constructing shelters is awesome, I especially loved making a mud-everything even if it meant burning dozens of campfires for enough ash to process the mud. There are a few hangups, which I'll mention below.

The jungle is pretty big with a lot to explore. Now I just run around trying to find a fun place to build a base and you can pretty much set up camp wherever you want. I like that a lot, though there are some issues I'll also mention below.

It is incredibly easy to make a few mistakes and die and I like that about this game. In my first play-through I swam across a river, got bitten by a piranha, and died from the wound after it got infected because I didn't know what to do about it. On the next play-through I got bitten by a snake and died because I again didn't know how to treat it. You do reach a point where you know how to deal with every kind of injury but that doesn't mean you are safe. My longest play-through ended when I decided I would try to kill a caimen with an axe after I ran out of arrows. I could have waited for it to bleed out, but I was feeling pretty cocky in my new armor.

The tribals are fun to encounter and have interesting AI. I always dread leaving my base and coming back to 5 of them sitting around my shelter. I usually get the first strike on them, which feels a little unfair, but they are still a challenge to deal with while preventing injuries. 

Cons: 

I don't like that there are so many choke points that lead into other areas. I've spent days trying to find the one little cave entrance or path that took me to another section of the map. I get that you have to familiarize yourself with unfamiliar terrain, but there is no intuitive way to cross areas, sometimes you just have to blindly follow every path you see until it finally leads to a new place.

My biggest gripe is how buggy shelter construction can be, and there are quite a few issues here. I built a shelter with the intention of putting up shed walls only to find that once I drug all that wood to the base and got the frame up, I couldn't build a wall because some environment asset prevented it. I have also had an extremely hard time building a shelter that is 2x2 because I need a combination of level ground and open space that seems to be impossible to find. You can build the frames, but you can't navigate the finished building because the frame sinks into the ground if terrains aren't the exact same height. The 1xwhatever shelters do work, but it's hard to place things inside which leads to another issue. It is also a giant pain building things like dryers indoors, the building asset areas interfere with putting items in some slots. Sometimes it works, sometimes you have to stand at a certain angle or be crouching and that is really annoying.

The leeches are massively annoying. It's like a mini-game trying to figure out which limb they are clinging to and they show back up every few minutes. They are so annoying I'll just be turning them off from now on. 

The bad part about encountering tribals is that they are pretty easy to take out in combat. Sometimes you get one or two that split off and try to get behind you, but after a few encounters you figure out how to kill them extremely easily. 5-1 encounters were not a problem at all later in the game, I could take out every one I saw without taking any damage.

Overall this game is great, though a little on the short side unless you are a completionist. I'm excited to see what co-op holds, but I expect that will be short lived as well.

It's really good, and I mean REALLY good. Now that they've added customisation for survival games it's been great!
The devs seemed to have listened to the playerbase, and that sure shows something. <3
Survival is realistic, needs are as realistic as it can be in a game too! (Obviously, a human can survive for weeks without food, and for days without sleep, which I know as a life-long insomniac, but that's hard to implement realistically into a game right?) The threats of the jungle are real, and unlike famous The Forest, they do feel real too. The aggressive natives can actually be found in their camps, or going about their daily business. Unfortunately for me though, in my last game they kept spawning in groups of five right under the cliff I decided to build upon....that was it with access to water.
Speaking of water, that's another nice aspect too! It's sometimes clear, sometimes muddy, when you dive you can't see shit just like irl, and the piranhas? Well, they're a nice surprise for sure! The forest is dense, just like you would expect, the vegetation is lush, you can easily find a lot of fruits, or none at all. Hunting has been done well, the traps are realistic and aiming for the head gives you a better chance at killing your prey (or opponent) than aiming for the body. They've added bleed damage to both npc and pc giving the whole thing another touch of realism.
And the building? Great I say! I can totally see how the parts are crafted and how it would make sense to build your shelter this way or that. Everything looks like it fits together and would hold even irl. Only downside to it is getting long sticks....so..many...long sticks... -.-' 

I could go on and on about this, but to make it short here, it's good... really is. And it fully satisfies my desire for a realistic survival game that doesn't build up on slaying endless loads of undead or cannibals.
The only things that stike me the wrong way a little was
a) the sound of water when walking through, it sounded like stepping in a puddle even when walking through a river. Not game breaking, but a bit odd.
b) they seemed to have decreased the range for rattlesnakes to start making sounds which makes it easier to walk into them unable to retreat in time.
c) I play my game with natives turned off, and for some reason I have yet to see even a single jaguar... Even though I have walked up and down almost the entire map there was none to be found. So that might be a bug.
d) the rain, though visible in the distance, isn't falling around the player. Which makes it feel as if we're walking with the sun shining above us and unaffected by the rain.

In my POV this game also offers a rock steady experience FPS-wise, stunning visuals & infotainment-value. 
I would set the game-time I would get out of it at around 100 hours, easy. Its settings can be adjusted for individual challenges (similar to the Long Dark), so you get the experience you want from it. 

The story itself was interesting & offered interesting moral choices etc. Even though the template is a bit simple (man + wife lost in the jungle-kinda thing). But it never feels simple, after the first surprises are over. Voice-acting is a bit meh, however. But no big deal, in this case.

There is a steady update-cycle to this IP, so Im expecting more goodies in the future! Excellent value for money, if you like the genre; Both for its story or its challenging game-play.

18,Green Hell,55046963,english,"This is an excellent survival game!  I initially played during early access, but the addition of the story mode was very welcome.  Story mode was very well done - it often feels tacked on in a survival game, or it just doesn't play very well, but I felt this one was very good - it pointed you in certain directions, but also let you play at your own pace, while serving as a good backdrop to the struggle of survival.  There were a few small surprises - the story wasn't quite as straightforward as I expected - but it never went into cheesy territory, which I honestly expected.  I think the thing that really made it good, imo, is that you never really met anyone friendly - you were always isolated and at risk - but you still had contact through the walkie-talkie, so the story wasn't tossed in the background while you did a million other things.   It was a good balance, which most other survival games with stories fail to achieve.

For the actual survival itself, I loved the different types of food required - fats, carbs, and protein. Each has logical sources (though I wish fats were a bit more common in certain food items, and that you could directly eat cooked marrow), and there are a few clever options.  Building is very basic - square blocks in only one material (mud), with only a couple different versions of walls (""shed"" - has a bit more room, wall with window, wall with door, and regular wall, all made out of mud) and no furniture besides beds and a storage chest.  No clue if they intend to add more, but if you want more complex building, this isn't the game for you.

Permadeath is an option, but not forced on you, which I really, really like.  I'm very tired of permadeath in survival games.  There are several difficulty options, including a (bare bones) customizable version.  I haven't played on the lower difficulties much, but the higher ones were mostly balanced well. 

There are several things I'd like, that I hope they add to the game.  More enemies, more animals, more flora, and I would love the ability to play the sandbox (not story mode, obviously) as a woman instead of a man (possibly unlock Mia as an option after story mode is finished with the good ending as a reward?)  I'd also like a few more options in the customizable difficulty level.  Co-op is coming, which I know a lot of people desperately want.

27,Green Hell,54542751,english,"As a player that finished finding every blueprint discovering every location and building everything that exists in the game soo far i will leave a review for those who are interested in this game

First impressions

Player needs: protein, carbohydrates, fats and hydration and sanity

The watch on your hand also shows compass + time + how much you need ones mentioned above

The game is not friendly to new players but you can chek the board notes on the tutorial for some information (however these notes do not pass to your notebook unless you discover things by yourself)

You don't know what to craft unless you chek wiki or you randomly put items and hope for the best

Players are able to build however you can't find a straight ground to build soo you got to expect your buildings will look weird no matter what

Tribal people will come and if you don't fight them they are most likely to destroy all of your camp (they destroyed all the things i made in mine more than once

You can cut down trees but it will always leave a stick upwards

After you visited the wiki around 50 times you will start to learn how to actually survive

Soo these are my first impressions soo far let me also add the bugs i found as well

-Even if you build a mud roof that is a fully covered roof you will notice rain on the ground and make you wonder why did you build a roof? is the roof even working? yes the roof is working and keeping things dry but they didn't fix the ground under roofs i gues and maybe allowing the player to build x2 floor buildings could fix the problem of seeing the ground rain

-Building problems also exist in the game since some buildings can be build in places but in order to add a material you must be under the world and since you can't actually go under the world you are unable to build this... i found this bug in fishing traps and when i was trying to build a mud wall soo since i couldn't build a mud wall because the material required had to be placed under the world i made many mud windows

-Here is a joke... eating human flesh is totally disgusting.. but eating human bones is totally fine right? soo why hunt animals when those tribal people come knocking at your door and you have a stack of 20 bones each time they visit?

-Overpowered traps... i can literally put down 10 killer traps and have 10 wild pigs ready to harvest anytime i am hungry soo here s your infinite meat source...

-The next one is spooky but i seen many times big rocks be throwed around while i was exploring the map and this is also funny cause it makes you wonder wtf was that????

-Infinite boiled coconuts..  when you boil something you will ask yourself... when does this spoil? well it never does... what i did to my game was making a room with 30 bowls filled with meat soup or bone soup and whenever i need to eat something i just pass by drink my 10 soups and then continue my adventures and like mentioned before you can place 10 traps and have infinite source of bones and meat for your boiled drinks

-Metal Arrows? wtf is that? soo far there is nothing i can't kill with a headshot with my normal arrows which are easy to make soo why bother making the metal ones

-My overpowered hands can break big stones into pieces and same goes for logs.. no requirements exist for harvesting those...

-Gravity is all around... when your player finds himself in the air its like he has those gravity boots that pull him to the ground everytime

-Wounds no diference... How does a piranha does the same wound as fire damage or falling damage?

-Dead animals never spoil (you can stack tons of dead animals to your base and harvest 
their meat when you need them.. its totally broken with fishes and also they make your game lag hard)

-Blueprints should exist about the cooking pot at least since the player can make things with Iron.. i mean i find hard to belive he is smart enough to create lots of things with Iron but he can't make a cooking pot or a Bidon (Metal Water Container) using Iron i mean Bidon is op and propably a player should not have more than 1 but cooking pot he could sure have more 
than 1 but they could be nerfed to hold 25 water while turtle shells to hold 20 water

-if a fish gets scared from under it then the fish will swim towards the sky

-Puting items on a ingame buildings (not your buildings) sometimes causes your items to fall through to the ground means the game first loads your items and then the buildings propably

-Fishing feels soo poor... and that is not just my opinion its the opinion of everyone who tryed it because it provides same fishes as the ones we find in traps or with spearfishing

-The game is having some animals overpowered... and why i say that? Turtles cover themselfs as long as they are attacked and they stand still untill you stop attacking... well i made my Archery / Spear / Blade skill all to 100 just by attacking that 1 turtle and i belive Three Banded Armadillo also has the same effect

I have nothing more to mention. The game is fun to play once you actually know what you are doing but as it is now people can abuse every bug to survive and that makes it boring i hope they fix the things i mentioned above and add more worthy opoments and maybe something underwater as well
Also what everyone will be impressed and say they did a good job is on the sanity when reaching too low even tho idk why tribal people should appear as shadows instead of something diferent.. i suggest the tribal people wouldn't appear and we would see Shadow people instead which would make more sence after all and cause more panic and make people more scared since shadows are all around the map

Idk if i should give a positive or a negative vote but i will give a negative for now because i have higher expectations from this game and i know they can do better

(the vote is about what the game is at the moment.. i want the people to know the truth of what they get and not giving them false hopes like things will get better because that is something we do not know)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As for the new update i love the part of 1 life only (BUT...!! let me add a big mistake over here... You actually added poison frogs which you can collect with E... These frogs keep moving and what happened is that 1 of them jumped infront of my coconut i wanted to collect and i picked up the frog instead... and that is how my only life ends because i died from  that... You actually added some moving execute player button around the map because none can cure 8 poison stacks that easy i can tell you by experience... and if some of you think that is fair? then why can't we also catch other small animals? like the normal toads as well? just get your S@@T together and remove the E button from the Dart Frog

41,Green Hell,55032156,english,"It took me 11 hours to complete story mode on normal difficulty (playing pretty much nonstop for a couple days) and I was surprised by the amount of storytelling there actually was, as in most of these games you don't really expect much meat beyond the survival itself. I think the story makes the rainforest feel particularly foreboding and claustrophobic, although it wasn't until the very end that I actually started running out of sanity. I'm a little disappointed that I was overly ballsy about travelling, so I'd recommend you don't rush too much and take your time travelling from point to point even on lesser difficulty. On normal mode the forest is definitely dangerous and you can easily find yourself running low on protein or water if you aren't careful, but there aren't actually that many enemies overall and you can sometimes make a decently mad dash to the next area you need to be in (provided maybe you're willing to reload a couple of times to get a rough idea of where you're heading). One issue I had was that I never felt the need to fully settle in one place because I was so motivated to keep going through the campaign. I only really ""settled"" in the first encampment area. I also started to find the [spoiler]ayahuasca[/spoiler] component extremely tedious and recommend always keeping the crap on hand because it became nothing more than a nuisance, frankly. That isn't to say, though, that I didn't have an awesome time being paranoid in the Amazon.

Overall I think the game is definitely worth full price and I even feel the 25USD is a bit modest for what feels like a very complete release compared to a lot of games. I am questioning how much replayability it has for me personally but I am looking forward to future updates and DLC content beyond mud building. I think there's a lot of potential for even more assets to be introduced and potentially a revved up co-op hardmode after that (I know net coding really sucks but with the right additions this could really be fun for two people).

Anyway! Blindly navigate the jungle and get scared in the darkness, taste test EVERYTHING and hope you don't die, take your time and just have fun with it!

*REAL survival- even on normal mode
*Great balance between survival and story

*Scary at times
*Good combat
*Good AI all around 
*Great sound (tribal voice acting especially)

Cons:
*Some minor lag on GTX 1080/60 fps/16GB RAM/1TB SSD
*Many minor bugs, but not game breaking
*Predictable AI most times-sometimes not
*Days/Nights too short-time runs too fast for such a slow paced game
*Nutrition requirements ridiculously high on normal story mode
*Unbelievable protagonists due mainly to character voice acting- I had no emotion for either.

67,Green Hell,55019487,english,"I couldn't decide whether to thumbs up or down and finally decided a thumbs down after the game released.

Pros: It's a very beautiful and fun survival game. The most beautiful out there. I played 32 hours just on survival mode during early access and had a blast. The sanity counter mixed with how you can injure and heal yourself adds another depth to survival games. I found the hunting/gathering fun but a little too easy as everything is so plentiful (although it is the Amazon..). 

Cons: The story was very short and predictable. There was only one twist that I saw coming and still fit into the cliche story. I finished the story in under 6 hours. It did not motivate you to delve into the survival aspect of the game at all. After being excited for the story to come out and waiting sooo long I was hoping for a lot more. And a lot more integration of the survival aspect of the game.
I was on the medium difficulty and didn't come across one big cat and ran into tribal people twice.  The fighting is very easy in this game as the AI stinks even when its 4v1. 

Overall, I'd like to see how it plays when the co op mode comes. If the co op mode is fun I might change my mind and give it a thumbs up if it can get me drawn in to play longer. If you like beautiful games and survival games, pick it up on a decent sale. I don't recommend buying it for the story. 32 hours played in survival and I can't seem to want to go back for more, for what that's worth.

69,Green Hell,55019091,english,"Picked this game up during early access and was very intrigued by the core concept and eagerly awaited the campaign.

Now it's here, and I'm not disappointed. 

Never before in a game have I ever felt this lost and vulnerable. ""I swear this is where I put my camp, I remember that tree over there. Must be here, right? Wait are those natives, crap I need to get out of here"" Pretty much sums up which is by far my best survival experience in gaming yet. 

This game does what many others fail miserably at, making exploration feel rewarding, I dont think a game has ever made me feel such a sense of accomplishment when it came to exploring. Trudging through endless bushes and snakes, and finally discovering something as simple as a broken boat felt like a huge accomplishment and step towards success. 

I didn't have a single violent encounter with natives, possibly because I was very meticulous with avoiding any contact whatsoever.  As soon as I was heading somewhere and I heard that tribal singing, I made a 180 and reconsidered my approach forward. But I was constantly on my toes. If you're out walking hear what sounds like a strange bird, yeah those are natives watching you and you need to reconsider fast.

The survival aspects were a constant reminder of how fragile you really are, you need to plan your trekking, do I have enough food or water, can I make it back in time before sunset, and so on. This game really pushed your senses to the limit and you need to be aware of your surroundings at all times. There was only one thing I feared more than tribal singing, and that was the rattle of a venomous snake

But I dont think I even once touched basebuilding. With the story mode you pretty much never have time to settle, you always need to be on the move and onto the next clue. Perhaps this could be more explored with the introduction of a multiplayer mode?

The story was so intriguing I had a hard time tearing myself away. It touches many contemporary aspects of the Amazon basin and the devastating effect of modern civilization, but also takes a dive in the emotional nature of humans. Only since Silent Hill 2 had a game managed to move me to tears. 

Can I recommend this game? Yes. Even if you're not a fan of survival gameplay the devs are gracious enough to allow you to fully customize your gameplay experience, all from disabling realistic needs, hostile tribes or damage all together. The game tells a story everyone needs to hear. 

My main negative point is the optimization. It's really heavy to run, and might disdain players with low-end specs to avoid this game altogether. My 1080ti + i9-9900K (5ghz over all cores, and my psu used a stable 400W during gameplay) managed to squeeze out a fluctuating 60-80fps. If there are anything the devs need to urgently address, it's the optimization. 

With an ending note, I can tell this was one of my most rewarding gaming experiences of all time. Finishing the game literally felt like getting out of that god forsaken jungle, that green hell, that will make you think, was it all worth it?

Couple complaints
* The game throws you right into the fire and makes you fend for yourself, giving you a brief tutorial that barely touches on the mechanics of the game. This can be considered good to some if you enjoy that sort of thing, but I cant personally say I enjoyed having to die 3-4 times before I started to understand how to handle certain things.

*The crafting system and building are not really utilized that much. There is little point to learn how to craft better then what you learn in the beginning as far tools go (metal tools are almost outright useless at the moment). Although the options are there, I find little reason to build anything outside of a small shelter and a campfire a couples times for the main story. I can not speak for survival, so it may very well feel better implemented.

Otherwise, the game is great and if they continue to develop this and iron out some of the current features, you can't go wrong.

The story is beautiful and 100% worth playing. At first glance, it seemed confusing and almost like the game wasn't going to guide me at all.

I say this as someone who has played similar survival games, so perhaps those experiences helped with certain decision making/exploration decisions. It can definitely be frustrating if you can't figure out how to progress to the next section of the story. A little bit of this is ok and keeps things interesting, but I definitely spent more time than I would have liked searching for certain things. The map is also a little annoying, as you essentially start with a partial section. This aspect improves as you progress in the story.

95,Green Hell,54447605,english,"Get ready for Coconut Juggling Musical Chairs! Wheeeee!

TL: DR: This game is the Canada of survival games. Just don't. Get The Forest. In that game, you can boil dirty river water with a large metal pot, no hokey flammable tiny coconuts required.

1 single thing perma-broke this game for me: You cannot collect and/or boil river water with a giant metal kitchen pot you find located in the 'caine camp. Nope, the game wants you to use much smaller magical coconuts that are magically impervious to fire, and they only want you to use rain, not the perfectly acceptable and very abundant river water. 50% of my game time is managing this awkward water system. I have tried making filters, making the banana leaf rain catchers, all kinds of different combos of things, but half my game time is juggling coconuts, even though I have a kitchen pot that holds 3x the water of a coconut. The game calls this realistic, but if this was realistic, then humans would have never made it off the savannah.

Look here is the bottom line, devs: If you bill your game as a, quote, ""REALISTIC SURVIVAL SIM"" and it has no basic crafting instructions, then when I find a gallon-water boiling pot, you had better let me collect and boil river water with that water boiling pot. I should not be using flammable coconut halves that hold a teaspoon of water. It is like having a working concrete mixer in-game, but the game instead forces you to use a flimsy stick and an old hollow stump nearby to mix the concrete. Why, just for the rustic feel of it? Um, nah, no thanks, game, that just isn't smart, and neither is your magical coconuts when I have a gigantic metal pot right HERE!

 I have all of the elements to DRINK SAFE WATER successfully IRL, meaning I have my 3 tinder (WTF why only 3?), wood, roaring fire, water access, tuna can, soup can, kitchen pot, coconut canteens, metal canteen from Jeep.........and I still cannot get clean water into my body and leave enough time in the day to do anything else. It defies logic.

LOGIC: I get a fire going from my tiny pouch that HOLDS 30 TINDER (not 3). I COLLECT DIRTY RIVER WATER WITH THE KITCHEN POT. I BOIL THE WATER IN THE KITCHEN POT. I POUR THE WATER INTO COCONUT CANTEENS I MADE. I skip the whole rain debacle, and skip the magical non-burning coconut husk. This kitchen pot method is done within 1 to 2 hours per day, leaving 80 to 95% of the day to hunt, trap, build, SURVIVE. I cannot describe this in any simpler terms, yet the game will not let me do these simple survival actions every other good survival game has. Why? Why not? Why is the crafting such a turd in this game, when the game comes out in less than a month? Why is juggling 30 coconuts the system the devs want you to use? Also, when I build a shelter with a water-tight roof, my inside fire goes out when it rains, and the floor shows water drops? WTF?

---------

 I do hope they sort all this out someday and get a better system than having to fill 30 coconuts with rain, and then transfer them to several canteens I carry, meanwhile that giant kitchen pot just sits there, unable to collect river water and just simply boil, yet I have magical coconuts that do not burn in a fire. It's a joke, really. I may play every week or so to check progress, but basically until this is fixed, I do not recommend. Instead I recommend The Forest, which mostly nails ""survival game"" definition. While The Forest also has minor problems, at least in that game you CAN COLLECT WATER WITH THE POT YOU FIND, YOU CAN BOIL WATER WITH THE POT YOU FIND, YOU CAN THEN POUR THAT WATER IN A CANTEEN YOU MAKE, AND THIS TAKES A FRACTION OF YOUR TIME FOR THAT DAY.

Also, what is a bidon? Nobody in the history of the world calls a camping/hiking water container a bidon. That is stupid and confusing, and like the coconut idiocy, it is likely just there to be contrary. It is a canteen. CANTEEN. FLASK is also acceptable. Bidon is a word not used by 99.9999999999999999% of the world.

As of now, with this broken water issue, this game is the Canada of survival games. Just don't. If I wanted to be really nice I would call it the French-Canada of survival games, but like Canada, it is the pale imitation of the real thing, with a major flaw visible and prominent.

For the time they took to add the campaign, it isn't really worth it, I'm sure I will not play this game for like 1 month or more and when I play it, it will not be very fun and  I will not enjoy it a lot.
They really need to add more realism into this game, as falling is very unrealistic, oh, and also without to mention that every wound in this game gets infected no matter what if you don't put bandages to it, I mean, why if you don't move and you don't do anything it infects? It's kinda annoying.

6,Green Hell,54994469,english,"This game is a bit of a puzzle to me. In this paragraph I will summarize my opinions on the game without spoilers, in the next I will spoil the game, so warning for that. I am reviewing this game from the perspective of the main story that was released at 1.0 launch. All in all, I think it would be an agreeable game at about half off and I think you'll enjoy it, but it comes with some big caveats. 

Now for the spoiler section of this review.

I do not understand why the devs put so much time and effort into a long building/crafting system when it is completely unnecessary. You can build mud houses, mud showers, craft metal tools and much more. But why? When the game starts and you are locked off in the smaller area of the map, it seems like you are going to be spending a lot of time preparing for expeditions and building small camps, but the moment the game lets you out of that area (through a really silly plot point), you start snowballing, and fast. I didn't have to build a single bed or camp from about 5-6 hours onwards. The game starts giving generously with food and pre-made camps, and I never encountered a situation where I suddenly needed to sit down and consider my moves. Why would anyone put in the massive amount of time to build a mud house, when it brings no benefits at all?  Why take time to build all these things when the very idea of the story is to move on constantly? I had to leave behind my base and I never saw it again, because the game simply kept going. It felt like I had wasted an enormous amount of time worrying about charcoal and iron and fireplaces when I really could've just ignored it.

The mystique of the opening hours of the game where survival was harsh and resources few evaporated, and the game became a sort of metroidvania-esque exploration game. The plot quickly begins centering around picking up certain tools that then allow you to enter other areas. This ultimately becomes the crux of the entire game, and you stop even caring about food, water, etc, as picking up these tools usually allows you into a new area, and every new area has at least two ""camps"" where there is a mountain of food. The game essentially throws off its own mechanics. The game world stops being dangerous the moment you understand what to do. I know that sounds redundant or obvious, but at one point I stopped bothering being afraid of the world ala the long dark, where you are constantly on edge because you only have so many ways to escape death. 

The story itself was pretty neat, and I enjoyed the little twists. It did drag on for quite a while though, especially with the constant content-blocks in the form of cliffs that had to be scaled and new equipment that had to be picked up. The ending was also quite a disappointment and seemed like it was shorter than the other ""endings"". 

I really don't know what to say in conclusion. I was really captured by the games spirit at the start, but at the end I found myself disillusioned and ready for the game to end, despite it desperately trying to squeeze an hour or more out of its meager late-game. I give this game, 5/10.",1567815078,1567815078,FALSE,20,1,0.642132998,2,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,639,55,684,0,679,1586714023,,

As I write this, I've only ever experienced 3 minor bugs and 0 crashes after 24 hours of game time. For an Early Access game, it's very stabile. Though on the highest settings in 1080p, my frames look to be between 30-40, but I kinda expect that from an Early Access game.

Currently only Survival mode is in the game, with a story mode planned for the full release.

A few things that can kill you are:
Going insane from not being able to pick those worms out from under your skin.
A jaguar ripping you to bloody ribbons.
Food poisoning.
Starvation.
Dehydration.
Lack of sleep.
Aggressively natives.
Your curiosity about deep water.

This is a game in which some real world survival methods can actually be applied. The dangers are realistic.

What you might find frustrating is how little the game tells you about what to do, but again, this is where real life survival strategies come in. Secure shelter, make a fire, secure food and water, follow roads or rivers. This might actually be what's also appealing. You must explore, learn the survival strategies and so on. You -will- fail as you learn.
You will need to have a diverse diet too! Fruits, meats, plants, insects, mushrooms, they're all required to keep your dietary need for the body's essentials up.

Gameplay
This game is not for everybody when it comes to the gameplay it will NOT hold your hand you have to figure out mostly everything on your own, you get a parasite? you have to figure out which mushroom will kill the parasite. The saving system is the only complaint that i have, you must build specific buildings to be able to save which i just dont like.

Story
The story mode on this game is wonderful without spoiling anything i just have to say that the story brings in alot of twists and turns and plenty of mystery.",1567791041,1567791041,TRUE,1,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,449,4,2522,0,531,1597369993,,
14,Green Hell,54990120,english,"My impression so far:

1. The story starts off good, then does some montage that makes no sense.
2. The sanity part of the game is nonsense. A few leaches doesn't make one go crazy.
3. The time shrink is too extreme, as well as the energy use. Make a palm-bed so worms don't get you, well that took the day and all your energy so you better take a 6 hour nap.
4. Food use is nonsense. while I like the idea of breaking down fats/carbs and protein. lack of them for a day will not cause blackouts and death.
5. Death spiral is way to easy to get into. Not enough carbs, no energy, can't collect, can't make a fire, can't cook, protein raw has parasites, pass-out, get worms, go crazy, die, all in one day.
6. Because of the time issues, you can get about 200 yards from your bed before you are half way through the day, half way done with energy and need to head back, and then you don't have energy to cook.

That all being said, reading the various topics out there, once you get past these few points, it becomes flip-flops to the absurdly easy, where a 40 foot fall can be bandaged like a minor burn.

Keep them eyes peeled. Onto zee review

I have only play a for a few hours since the new release and of course starting with story mode.  Although the story is a nice touch (and i love a good story) sadly the one you get is pretty meh, not totally soulless but for me personally, nothing to write a paragraph about either. What the story does well is create a backdrop of information for the survival mode which has long been awaited by those who have played only survival for however long in early access. With Mud building and a few other additions in content being added I had a few pleasent supprises whilst rediscovering how to survive in this game again :)

Sadly though as much as I do love this game there really isnt much replayability. No matter how many times you play through this you will always get to a point where you just simply dont have any challanges to face unless you just wanna be stupid and idk... pick up a poisoness frog and then fight a jaguar for what ever reason. Don't get me wrong what is there is great but at the same time... there really isnt all that much id say other than the story (cos i havnt played through it all yet) i would say there is about 10 hrs or so of stuff to keep you busy... after that you've pretty much seen all there is to see sadly.


Early Access Review DEC 2018: I have high hopes for this game. After playing a few hours it seems to have great potential. At the moment the one con that stands out to me is the combat which is pretty meh... but on the plus side there is almost a rouge like element to this game where as a player you will die (probably a lot) and as you continue to play you further your understanding of what you have to do to survive, which is well... pretty awesome :D",1545744768,1567781678,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,542,165,1181,0,432,1599056889,,

21,Green Hell,54986283,english,"The story set up is really interesting, but the survival mechanics are a little ridiculous and arcane. Once I had gotten through the story mini-tutorial area I lived for less than ten minutes. While it's realistic in that it's probably about the same amount of time I would live if I was dropped into the amazon unprepared in real life, it's not much fun for a game.

You start out with nothing, in my time alive I only ever found 3 small rocks, and it takes two to make a very weak knife. I made one that was enough to gather some sticks because I assumed I would need a fire later, and it broke very quickly(though to be fair, it lasted longer than a random rock probably should if you try to use it as a knife).  I had a hint in my notebook that I should boil water before drinking it - a fairly obvious hint - but without any help on how I'm supposed to manage that given that I have nothing to contain the water while boiling. Fortunately that particular problem never became a problem, I didn't live long enough.

I was avoiding some boars I saw, and I stumbled into a snake that bit me while I was trying to find a second small rock so I could make another knife, so I would be able to harvest plants(assuming I could find any, which I hadn't been able to), and died very shortly after that; though not before having a bunch of leeches attach to me right after. Supposedly there's some plant somewhere that helps keep poison out, but I have no idea what it even looks like, much less know how to find it or have anything to harvest it with. All I could do was hope that the poison was minor enough that I wouldn't die from it, as there was a note in my notebook saying you can sometimes survive poison. That hope was in vain.

The real problem is I didn't really learn anything from the experience, the next attempt is going to have the exact same thing happen and I'll still have no idea how to avoid it, survival seems futile. You don't really have enough time to figure anything out or craft anything before you're killed by something. It feels like it's missing more of a tutorial to give you the knowledge you need for the very basics of survival, like how to survive poison. I didn't even reach a point where I could count on finding the materials to craft a basic stone knife, small rocks are extremely rare.",1567769696,1567769696,FALSE,4,2,0.394713819,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,3272,26,43,0,43,1567764936,,

3.关于动植物的问题，既然在游戏的开头已经提出他们是动植物学家，那么他们也应该掌握了农耕以及种植的技巧，所以我在此建议，可以移植植物和圈养所用陷阱捕获的动物，以及让捕获的动物可以进行交配与繁衍。
4.再然后的建筑系统里面，我觉得可以让主角建造双层的建筑，以及船坞和码头。
5.对于资源的再生问题，例如树木的再生，应该适当加入，或者让玩家可以将树木的根部挖掘，腾出空地来让玩家进行建造。

I think there is still a lot of room for development in this tour .
First of all,we need to play online.We need friends' jokes and the joy of everyone to play together in a monotonous life.
Secondly,I think we can properly enrich the food system ,as well as the construction system.With regard to animals and plants,since they have been mentioned at the beginning of the game as animal and plant scientists,they should also master farming and planting skills,so I would like to suggest here.You can migrate plants and trap animals caught in captivity,as well as allow captured animals to mate and produce.
And then in the building system,I think the protagonist can build double-decker buildings,as well as shipyards and docks.
The regeneration of resources,such as the regeneration of trees.You should add properly,or allow the player to dig the roots of the tree and make room for the player to build.
Hope to enrich the animal system,although now more animals than before,but I hope to have a pleasant communication with more animals,and finally hope that the development team can get better and better.Because GREEN HELL is a great game,we can't hide its advantages.I have played a lot of survival games,but in my heart I thank GREEN HELL is a well-deserved king.

Zatím chybí příběh, ale i tak nás vývojáři seznamuji s konceptem formou výzev nebo přežití. Jste v džungli sám a potřebujete přežít = klasika. Potkáváte divokou zvěř a domorodce = normálka. Co bych ale chtěla vypíchnout, tak je systém craftění. Dokud neobjevíte určitou věc, tak ji nemůžete vytvořit, což dává smysl. Není zde návod, jak vytvořit například vodní nádrž, dokud ji nenajdete v kempu a neprohlídnete si, z čeho a jak je to vyrobené. V knížce nemáte hned uvedeno, že můžete postavit pec na dřevěné uhlí, dokud nedržíte v ruce poprvé bahno. Což se mi líbí. Trochu mi vadí, že není moc čas na nic, protože rychle ubývají živiny a energie potřebné pro zdraví hlavní postavy. Tedy neděláte ve hře nic jiného, než že začnete něco craftit a pak dva dny hledáte jídlo a pití, které velmi rychle shnije, když ho nesníte, a tak tedy hledáte znovu. Tím pádem jste v situaci, že pořád jenom něco hledáte a nemáte čas zkoumat, stavět a nacházet. Mapa je také v celku malá. Když se rozhodnete tedy nebudovat tábor, ale chodit, máte mapu projitou skutečně za dvě hoďky a pak už vlastně nevíte, co dál. Já mám tu hru ráda, protože mě pohltí svoji atmosférou, ale je pravda, že po méně, jak 50ti hodinách už nevím, co ve hře dál zkoumat, objevovat, vymýšlet a přežívat. Možná bych doporučila ostatním hráčům počkat na plnou verzi s příběhem. Také bych vytkla, že je to singleplayer.


It is difficult to comprehensively evaluate something that is still under development. But I can definitely get away from what is already. Nice graphics, excellent soundtrack and voices or sounds in the game. The story is missing yet, but the developers are still introducing the concept in the form of challenges or survival. You are alone in the jungle and need to survive = classic. You meet wildlife and natives = normal. What I would like to puncture is the craft system. Until you discover a thing, you can't create it, which makes sense. There is no instructions on how to create a water tank, for example, until you find it in the campsite and see what it is made of. You do not immediately mention in your book that you can build a charcoal furnace until you hold mud for the first time. Which I like. It bothers me a little that there is not much time for anything, because the nutrients and energy needed for the main character's health are declining rapidly. So you do nothing in the game other than to start crafting and then for two days you are looking for food and drink that will rot quickly if you don't eat it, so you are looking again. So you are in a situation where you are always looking for something and you do not have time to explore, build and find. The map is also quite small. So if you decide not to build a camp, but to walk, you have a map actually passed in two hours and then you really do not know what to do next. I like the game, because it engulfs me with its atmosphere, but it is true that after less than 50 hours I no longer know what to explore, discover, invent and survive in the game. Maybe I would recommend other players to wait for the full version of the story. I would also say it's a single player.",1567454256,1567454256,TRUE,24,0,0.739130437,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,19,9,9463,0,2662,1594321821,,

55,Green Hell,50069674,english,"Finally a game that not only resembles but actually compedes with Stranded II (the Survivalist mod). There has been a lot of ""survival"" games that honestly don't do much more than make you look for food and avoid predators/zombies. This game already puts them to shame. So, in short:
+ Beautiful graphics
+ Amazing realism to the survival aspect (!)
+ The mental health implementation is very good! The voices are disturping as hell, very well done. If anything, a few visual hallucinations would be nice - just some blurryness or change of light intensity or the like. EDIT: ignore the last part. The game does contain ... something visual :). 
+ Crafting systems are nice; one of them requires self-thinking (smaller stuff like axes), the other require that you find ""blueprints"" IE seeing it build somewhere. Larger stuff like snare traps.  

- You can't choose a game mode just without the indigenous people. Maybe that's just me wanting that. EDIT: this feature is coming up with the full release.
- You get quite a couple of notification icons that are not explained. I didn't get why my health kept declining that fast, and why I had to eat so much. I had a stomach icon with a number on it. 20-something. I thought it was the number of days I had gone without fullfilling my macronutrients. Seems like it was the number of parasites. Yuck. 

? Some people complain about having to watch your macronutrients. I like that idea, although I think it shouldn't be necessary to fill all three up at once. If you're eating a lot of protein and fats for a few days and then change to protein and carbohydrates, then the body should still be fine. So, good idea, I like it as it is, but a little flexibility would make it great. 
? The inventory system. I personally like that you have to move things around yourself - as in real life, you can package more stuff when you think about how to put it instead of just throwing it in there.

My first experience with the easy mode: 
I didn't recognize the eat-able plants at first. I didn't know where the ""clean"" water was. I couldn't cook the meat I'd found because I hadn't had the time to make a shelter for the fire, and it's a fucking rainforest, of course the rain will put the fire out. So I got food poisoning. Got dehydrated. Drank the dirty water in desperation. Got parasites. Collapsed because of lack of energy, in the mud. Woke up with worms. I could see the disgusting fucker dug into my skin, draining my sanity. Started hearing voices. I dug out the worm with a bone needle, and then wrapped up the open wound. The food poisoning was gone. I'd just found some coconuts. But I died anyway, because fuck parasites.

84,Green Hell,54665593,english,"Survival games have become extremely popular over the last few years, which has led to an influx of titles that attempt to offer something new and challenging. Unfortunately most fail, which has led to suspicion of ""cashing in"" when new titles arrive on the market.

Green Hell has attempted a slightly different and much more realistic take on the genre, where micro-management is key to your success. And it's not bad, really!

You see, most survival games balance their challenge with food, water and odd dangers, such as mutant babies or zombies. They scale your consumption to ridiculous levels (gallons of fluids and kilos of food every day) to supposedly balance their gameplay. By doing so, they reduce the realism of the players adventure and inject frustration in how much of a need there is to gather nourishment over all else. It seems to be the 'go to' formula for the generic survival game... Not so in Green Hell.
 
There's pretty much everything you could want here. A large, sprawling rain forest that's been lovingly crafted in stunning detail (imagine Crysis on steroids). There's danger everywhere, from small parasites and insects to dangerous animals. The locals are also not happy you are in their territory, so inevitably they want to disrupt your progress (in small ways) and will even attempt to engage you in combat. Not enough to make it an irritation, but enough to have you on your toes and to raise your pulse. Even simple sounds can have you imagining the worst and set you on edge.

Sustenance is very well integrated, with not just water or food, but a complex mixture of hydration, protein, fats and carbohydrates that all need attention if you don't want to suffer exhaustion, starvation, or even go mad and start hearing voices. Eating some foods can directly affect your sanity, such as eating human flesh or creepy crawlies. Cooking homely foods can soothe your woes and restore your sanity. All of this adds a complex and rewarding mini-game in itself. Although it can make the early days very demanding, it is a refreshing take on human needs in this genre of game.

Crafting is also a real treat here. It's complex and hard work. There's no cutting down trees for 500 wood and spamming walls and items everywhere. Gathering is its own challenge, with weight issues and item availability being a core element to expansion of your home base should you decide to make one.

The list of craftables starts small, meaning you ideally need to explore to discover how to make something. You can, however, experiment with smaller recipes and stumble into their various schematics (which unlock once crafted). So common sense is also your friend here! A nice little touch (similar to Minecraft) that makes the game feel more like a simulator than a game.

Illness, injuries, parasites and other disabilities are also micro managed, with a knowledge of local herbs and plants essential to a speedy recovery. You need to consider your own hygiene. Being dirty makes a difference when eating or applying medicine. The consequence of which can be gross.

[b]TLDR:[/b]
I'm still discovering many things as I play and am amazed at the love that's been put into the development of this game. It's truly a fantastic experience for anyone that's looking for a serious survival adventure that pushes your abilities of thought and reason. It's not for the feint of heart or the impatient. I'm not even sure it can be classed as a game. Simulator is a far more accurate description, but there is a story included (EA Tutorial, with the main story being added in v1.0 Official Release), which adds purpose.

Why? Because so far, I've tried different games on EA (Early Access) and this is The one that by far really got me keepping playing it these days -
 So far because it does get you involve in something totally different... It's not friendly in the beginning, the way you could be really exposed, the way I see it, on real life to the same overwhelming situation; and so, most of us frankly we won't make it at it at all...
In a total misunderstanding situation where everything matters around you, Can or not be used to craft and fabricate something useful...but it's definetly worth it to explore and if so you still have time but not only surviving...the beuty in nature it's represented on this game.

The building is a little ""bugged"" (EDIT: after the mud update, it got a LOT better), and as the story mode is not yet released, it gets a little ""monotonus"" after a while, just exploring, hunting, and building bases around the map. Still PLENTY better than the other survival games available these days. Looking forward to the full release!

Man, i wish someone would make a more realistic survival game, without enemies, so all you do is to try to survive when you are lost in the wild... If i put it on the easiest difficulty setting, it turns off the tribes, and it becomes more like a survival game, and without the FPS elements - but id really like to see a game with more difficult hunting and fishing, so you really need to work for your food, and not just go hunting for 1 minute to get some meat. More complex nutrients would also be nice, like B vitamins helps with energy levels, and vitamin C helps with immune system, and calsium helps with nerve related stuff, and maybe increases consentration and/or reaction time or something... Vitamin A helps with the eyes and sight...

Oh, and a GOOD MAP EDITOR!!! Thats what these games need, so you can build your home town, and have a plethora of wildlife to put in at certain areas, to match your home town... Maybe have different biomes as DLC, like Scandinavian looking mountains and forests and animals in one pack, and African in another...

22,Green Hell,48584836,english,"I am 46 years old. (This review is intended for adults) The survival element and the graphics effects in Green Hell is an amazingly realistic experience playing in ""Welcome to the Jungle"" or medium difficulty setting. I have personally been lost in the same environment twice in the same Amazonian Jungle. I barely survived the ordeal and swore ""NEVER AGAIN"". That was in 1999 in French Guyana. In the game - especially the insanity element, the emerging panic and the constant quest for finding food while slowly starving  is very realistic and and reminds me of my own adventure: A friend and I ventured 2 days past the last outpost only carrying shotguns, rice and medicine believing we could live off the land... BIG MISTAKE... after 4 days we had been eating only a King Fisher bird, 1 small piranha palm tree marrow and lots of rice of course. We were stalked while canooing by an adult jaguar (ca. 110kg adult average) .. we saw its footprints and heard it scream like a cat on steroids and jump around few tens of meters away but never saw it. Although we had been catious to clean our water we got sick after 7 days in the jungle.. my friend got painful fungus infection in the ears, fingers and feet and me a killer fever that rose to an incredible 40,5. We barely made it back to the hospital in St. Laurent alive. (I got intravenous penicilline for 2 hours at the hospital.) The constant buggery of insects were driving us mad and we constantly had to check for ants and termites in our pants. We eventually found out that smoking our own clothes and tying pants and shirts to wrists and ankles, helped keep most of the bugs away. Or the termites that ate our carbet (bivouak) so that our hammocks crashed to the ground in the middle of the night. Before we left the Foreign Legion asked us to please inform them about our intended route ""Why?"" ""So that we know where to look if or when you go missing.""

Then there's the game. I've played The Forest. Rust. Stranded Deep and Subnautica. It shares elements with the genre, but it's the first that really immerses you in the feeling of knowing nothing. You have to discover everything (resist the urge to look online) you can make. Find blueprints scattered around the map to learn traps and other items.

You need to manage micro nutrients, craft healing items from plants and animals you find and battle or avoid natives. On top of this you have to manage your mental state. You can literally descend into madness and die in this game. It's somewhat disturbing.

I've been playing Green Hell for 30hrs the past 3 days and oh man! This game amazing... You feel like you're literally in the middle of amazon rainforest
You need to manage all the supplies, your nutrition, your sanity level, your health (fever, rashes, food poisoning, etc etc), animal threats (snakes, spiders, hostile Amazonian native tribes and other predators like leopards, crocodiles, piranhas, etc etc)
You're given nothing but a backpack to fill whatever you want. I've played many other Survival games like 7D2D, Rust, Long Dark, Minecraft, etc etc.. but this one's very realistic and very tough. One wrong step you take in your survival, the next moment you feel the effect... Dehydration, Infected wounds, predators, poisonous plants, allergies, hunger, staying unhygienic  etc etc, pretty much anything can kill you at any moment... 

You can even die of Insanity by doing Sanity costing uncomfortable jobs like eating uncooked food or Sleeping on floor..
And you can't save your game whenever you can too.. you need to gather resources, setup camp and only then you can save..
The number of days you could stay alive is displayed in pause menu 😕
One can try survive in normal mode but damn... no chance you can survive in ""Green Hell"" mode for too long... 
This is hardcore survival and very challenging...

It's still in Beta on steam  though and the game is releasing for PC, PS4 and Xbox in September, 2019.
There's an interesting Story mode too but it releases with Full release, only prologue in playable as a tutorial for now..
Only Survival mode and challenges are available for now..

It also has a sanity system that will keep you on your feet. Recipes are discovered when you pick up an item for it. The game is far from perfect and it still has a few bugs and overall performance to work out but its still pretty damn good. A good grab for survival game fans.

For the devs:
- Can't figure out how to throw spears, even changed the keybinding and everything, this makes farming for animals really hard, since I wold have to make arrows for this.
- Construction outlines look blocky and pixelated.
- Natives find you or go explore two days in, maybe give survivors in normal mode atleast four or five days to settle down.
- Cant figure out how to catch a damn fish, tried to spear but it cant reach, water is too deep for me to stand still and spear them. and the ones that I could find weren't interactable. (lost so much sanity because I couldn't catch a fish for a fish bone.
- Says that I can cover some wounds like venemous bites with bandages and it would be preferable to add a plant with anti venom properties, it did not let me bandage without the addative.

Beginning the tutorial, I realized this game is already fucking annoying as shit to play 3 seconds in when I attempted to hop off a rock platform, only to instantly break my ankles 2 inches off the ground and suffer an insta kill. Upon noticing this, I realize ""ok sure dropping two inches to the ground kills me? wont make that mistake again."" and restarted the tutorial.

after making it through almost all the way through the tutorial, this bulls*it fall damage abomination kills met yet again when I literally safely drop onto a rock once again 2 inches off the ground, except this time I didnt jump beforehand. After clicking restart, i'm met with the start of the tutorial, and once again have to replay a 8 minute sequence all over again.

The game has massive potential, I really hope they deliver on a good story. It's a bit of stretch, but for me, it's the next best thing since Boiling Point.

Proton runs great until either alt-tabbing or cut scene, then mouse plays up. It either works in game menu or world, but not both. To fix, alt tab while in game menu and you get your cursor working. Alt tab while in world and the look function starts behaving again. Once the intro has finished, there shouldn't be any cut scenes, so if you don't alt tab, it should be solid

But there are a few... Problems.
The game CHUGS in an awful way. Averaging around 40-50 fps, and hiccupping all the while. While this is understandable on my outdated 780, it isn't as understandable on a friends' 2080, which also suffered from poor frame rate.
The instability. It KSOD'ed mine, which meant I had a 15 minute reboot cycle. Not fun. And less than an hour of gameplay in, which means that I'd be spending around 1/3 of my time rebooting my pc. This hurts.
The tutorial... I get that a tutorial might be necessary. And I get the desire to have a game that doesn't tell you how to do everything. But I don't want to gather nuts to feed my character for the tutorial, just to be ignored about ""finding nutrition"" until I eat two of the three candy bars you're given at the start.

 Also, I find the game to be a little bit to hard and unforgiving. It is very hard to get anything done, such as building shelters or even cooking food because you are always contracting some kind of disease, or having to keep your energy levels up by eating and drinking all the time. 
So, this game has great potential to be a really good game, but they should relax the amount of time between contracting diseases and having to eat so often since these things become annoying really fast and take something away from the game. I did manage to get to the point I could build shelters, but only after dying a lot and having to restart...which I really dislike doing in a game because it interrupts the flow and therefore the fun of the game. Waiting for the game to restart every time you die is a drag.  

The game does have both a story mode and a survival mode. I ended up having to play in survival (hard) mode because story mode is not complete and you can only go so far in it.

I made an axe, and constructed a simple shelter outside the cave,  which allowed me to save my progress. I then made a bamboo spear and with practice I was able to down some small animals. Two banana trees nearby provided much needed nutrients! I kept an eye on my watch, and checked my nutritional needs regularly. Water was an issue here, but after I harvested some coconut shells, I was able to boil water and make it drinkable! I built some other amenities and explored the area near and far. I set up a couple of other save sites in advantageous locations so as to facilitate easy travel, and to begin alternative camp sites. I had encountered Natives a couple of times and avoided them, but I was wounded badly in a later attack and had to convalesce. Fortunately I had crafted some ash bandages earlier! I was forced to move my main base after one awful horrifying attack by a raiding group of natives. I managed to slay four from the refuge of my cave,( they will not enter caves), with my bow and arrow. I wish I had crafted more arrows but alas I ran out of ammunition and had to make a run for it as they were going to starve me out! I ran, and ran, and I could hear them howling as they chased me. They moved faster than me and knew the area well. I tried to zig zag to avoid their arrows which whizzed past my head.Finally I hid in the brush below a small rise and they ran past!

Jeesh, I've never seen such a bad tutorial before. The devs dragged it out so much I nearly gave up before playing the game. They barely teach you anything in the tutorial and instead chose to make it into a shallow relationship simulator. The narrative of conversations was small talk at best and completely unnessesary to teaching the player the basics. 10% tutorial 90% waste of time. I recommend everyone skip the tutorial and just google how to play the game. It will save you an hour of your life. 

For example: Once you have been taught that ""T "" is to use your radio , that should be it. Instead you are continually pressing T to answer each part of the convo (that literally doesnt benefit you in any way) throughout the tutorial. Super pointless. Setting the scene for story mode should not be part of a tutorial.

[strike] “We plan to stay in EA stage for about 3 months.” [/strike] [b] We have decided to move from Unity 2017 to Unity 2018 (the engine used to make the game), in order to bring a better looking and more optimized experience. This will also help us realize the full potential of the story mode, add a massive map expansion, new enemies, implement your feedback and more.

Our new release date is for Summer 2019 [/b]

[h1] What is the current state of the Early Access version? [/h1]
“The game is completely playable right now. All mechanics of the sandbox included in the release of survival mode in Early Access. We will grow upon this further over the coming months, but this is our starting blueprint.

Content and features:

GREEN HELL is an Open World Survival Simulator set in the uncharted unique setting of the Amazonian rainforest.

You are left alone in the jungle without any food or equipment, trying to survive.

On this journey, you won’t get any help from the outside world. Equipped only with your bare hands you’ll have to learn actual survival techniques to build shelters, make tools, and craft weapons in order to hunt and defend yourself. Constantly threatened by the jungle you’ll fight with both wild animals and [strike] tropical sicknesses [/strike]  [b] teleporting rainforest men appearing out of nowhere to attack you or destroy your buildings. They even unlocked Mass Teleport, but get stuck on almost every tree stump :-). [/b] 


GAME PILLARS

REALISTIC SURVIVAL SIM
• Use of true survival techniques (including starting fires, camp building, [b] animal traps construction [/b] ) 
Please ignore the fact that animal traps don't catch animals, but sometimes spawn prey in them when you enter the sector. But the building process is really very realistic. 

• Sourcing and composing objects allowing survival (including weapons and tools)
In principle a great thing, but the Craftskill is very badly implemented, which leads to senseless Grinding and unrealistic qualities. An example:

[b] Bone armour vs. metal armour. [/b]

Bones are easy to find without much effort and if you make some bone armor you will become better at it and the quality of the items will increase. Ok.

If you make your first armadillo or metal armor now, you'll find that despite the high crafting level, the new items have very little quality. So they break faster and the metal armor doesn't provide as much protection as the bone armor. (Where, as I said, you can reach a quality of 95% very quickly.)

The other metal items don't have any improvements to their wood / stone counterparts. The arrows with the metal tips do no more harm than the carved wooden arrows. Redundancy of the finest. Keyword: Water filter.

• Food sourcing (hunting, cropping) 

Bananas, coconuts and animals always appear in the same places. 

• [b] Wound [/b] , [i] disease and other injuries [/i] treatment, depending on the situation
There are different types of wounds. I don't know what is meant by disease. I have never had any other injuries like an arrow in my arm or a broken leg. Actually, an ash bandage is always the solution. Unless you have once again walked through the rattlesnakes. But those are then also wounds .... 

AMAZONIAN RAINFOREST SETTING
[b] Amazonian rainforest is the richest natural environment in the world. Exotically breathtaking, spectacular, multicolored, full of tones and sounds but mortal, deadly, uncompromising for the ignorant. [/b]

• Part of the Amazonian rainforest as a map of the world for the setting
Not very big, but full of tones and sounds. Unfortunately, the most animal noises are not caused by their originators. 

• The richness of plants and multitude of animal species (mammals, reptiles, birds, and insects)
Noah would had a simple job with this multitude! :D (mammals: 8, reptiles: 5, birds: 2 + 1 color variation + a bat model for the night , insects: 6, if you count spiders, and some fish)

• [strike] Simulation of animals natural occurrence and behavior [/strike]
The animals run their fixed routes and spawn again and again in the same places. In the abandoned camp you will be overrun by Capybaras! They are also endless.

Pros:
I thought the game was great for an early access title.  I had a lot of fun with it. Rain will put out your campfire! 

Contra:
With the water update it lost a lot of performance, with the combat update the fun disappeared.

The human traps are obsolete. The Punji style barbed trap is constantly triggered by big stones, crabs, mice and frogs appearing out of nowhere.  The big cat triggers 6 of them and keeps running towards you. The natives can also trigger many of them. They don't even limp.

You have to place the arrow trap right next to your house wall to trigger it when they attack your camp. Otherwise there is a great danger that they will simply appear in the middle of your camp next to your campfire and chill or cut everything short and small.

Unfortunately, there is very little insight into the current progress. But the last big updates didn't convince me. 

Clay huts are useless. They break when the bad men scratch them with their stone knives.

Despite the metal update, I can't make a machete. I can't repair them either and nothing. Very sad.

The new Ai behaviors were a joke (New AI Behaviors – Patrols and destroying construction.), what about the animals ?

I still haven't found the new aquatic plants.

Trust me on this: If you enjoy crafting/survival type games this should definitely be on your radar.
The game draws many comparisons to The Forest in the sense that you're alone in a rain forest and have many crafting mechanics at your disposal to manipulate the environment around you. Animal traps, mud building, bamboo/stick buildings, as well as many other things. The challenge mode is quite difficult. The wildlife are abundant (spiders, snakes, alligators, etc.)

PROS
Beautiful graphics with good atmosphere and scenery
Clever crafting method where you can explore by combining things to see what you can craft
Lots of different animals and fish to hunt, catch, and harvest
Farming materials isn't boring. Nice animations for things like chopping trees and hunting can be exciting
I like that you have to pick leeches off your body and can get burns, scratches, and other wounds like poisoned
This game is challenging. Not easy to stay alive unless you stay in one area and even then...
CONS
Challening... Food and water meter drains quickly. Like waaay too fast in my opinion.
Weapons are kind of useless for hunting except for the spear.. Would like to see more weapons
When throwing a spear its clunky and can be hard to hit your target.
OVERALL
Great game especially for being early access. After about 50hrs i can finally survive no problem on any difficulty.

-Very beautiful and runs quite smoothly considering it's not fully optimised yet (frame drops), thanks to the amazing Unity Engine. 
-Co-op mode coming Spring 2019 according to the roadmap which had been respected so far.
-The story mode is not live yet, but the tutorial does its teasing job very well and I'm now hyped to discover what's coming next. 
-The difficulty has been reworked and I didn't find the game extremely hard as many reviewers said at launch.
-Very interesting gameplay mechanics and high quality sounds and music.
-The Forest players should enjoy it too.

86,Green Hell,50518444,english,"LOVE this game.  So much about it is wonderfully done, the Dev's work endlessly to keep this game going.  Still might be Early access but Such wonderful work done thus far!  I think they have already listened to what their player base is saying about the game.

I originally bought this game X2 so my daughter and I could play together, since it is marked as a MULTIPLAYER, but we have been playing more so WHO can survive the longest.  Recently Husband has obtained it too after watching us play and struggle though the game.  

+ Graphics are just outstanding.  Very visually Pleasing, really makes you feel like your there!
+ Sounds are on point, really makes you feel part of the environment as you walk though, caves, water, animals, etc.  Sound is really key to playing this game.  Listen closely.
+ Crafting is great, you can do some stuff yourself other recipes you have to find!  So it encourages you to explore.
+ Survival - Eating is a bit insane early on, once you find balance, your good!  You really have to keep an eye on your health, from fevers, poisons, parasites, abrasions, and so forth.  Sleep is a must unless you want to find yourself face down in the mud. 
+ even being in EA there is VERY few bugs, I have found only 1 maybe 2.  but thus far it doesn't effect game play.

+/- Storage system for the BIN is a bit off, maybe even more storage stuff maybe I just haven't found a recipe for it but a thing to store stones large Rocks, maybe weave a basket for such items, along with storage for coconuts, herbs, and other misc. items found.  Not like the bin but something only for those particular things?  I think you should be able to stack more in a bin then your backpack.  Feathers only stacking to 6, Also maybe a quiver for arrows to hang on the backpack would be great as well.  But those are just ideas.  
-  I find myself destroying a bunch of materials, like leaves, palm leaves, banana leaves, sticks, small sticks.  They seem to respawn too quickly and cover everything, its hard to keep eyes open around you when things grow with in a day. 

I am hoping the DEVS will add the female to choose to play, mix the story lines or maybe, after this one is done, do a sequel as the female lead.

First time in GREEN HELL, I woke up after the tutorial, with a great story line I can not wait to play when finished.  
I found myself in the middle of NOWHERE, nothing but green all around me.  Found a stick and some stones made myself an axe and headed out to find some water.  When it was finally found, I started to wash the mud off, I was surprised from behind, didn't hear or see a thing but a furry of claws... Leopard got me.  Took me a moment as the death screen announced how I had perished.  
Started up again.  Quite a few deaths, then learned to save, Currently I have made it to day 23 without a death, but that does not mean it will not happen soon, taken a while to get to that point but there is much to explore and see still.",1557178933,1557178933,TRUE,1,0,0.505074024,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,154,6,4931,0,1575,1590985212,,

[h1]Yes[/h1]

However, [i]the game has a few flaws you should be aware of.[/i]

[u]Reasons to get this game[/u]
Do not expect to come into this game as a pro. It will kick your ass with the learning curve until you know what you're doing. From there, it will probably be smooth sailing. I liked this challenge, it makes accomplishments feel just like that. 

Things aren't immediately explained to you. You do not start out knowing what most things do. There is a lot of fauna that have certain characteristics that are both beneficial and detrimental to your well being. Its up to you to figure out what they are.

The survival aspects are brutal. You don't get that scrape patched? Too bad. Its infected and you could die. Weren't watching where you were going and got bitten by a rattlesnake? Hope you like the feeling of venom.

[u]Reasons not to get the game (yet)[/u]
The optimization is pretty horrid or absent. I have a Ryzen 1600 OC'd to 3.8GHz with a GTX 980 and the game gets 16 FPS at times. Those on reddit have said the devs have not made efforts to optimize yet being EA, but its bad. This makes the combat system... unbearable at times.

The combat system is new for me. The more I play the more I don't really dig it. Headshots are instant-kills with spears to the head, and can bleed out enemies fairly easy. But arrows to the head do almost nothing. I hate it.

Resources are sporadic. It takes time to go out and find exactly what you're looking for. Its hard to amass supplies and live comfortably for a while until you are already familiar with the game.

I [b]hate[/b] that some recipes are gate-locked. You may discover them at any time but until you do, you simply do not have access to them. Starting a new save?

If you want a game where you can just jump right in and be top of the dogs, learn new crafts right away and feel invincible.... then you have come to the wrong game. This game takes skill, patience, hard work, focus and a big tolerance.

Its even better then what you can imagine, all the craftables, all the food recipes, all the animals, traps, weapons, hunts, dangers, health issues and much much more.

It attempts to be realistic, but every five steps you get some disease and your nutrients deplete rapidly, which just makes it tedious imho. Visually it is appealing to me, but the gameplay seems very unintuitive and laggy. Crafting is a bit weird to me aswell, because you can ""harvest"" big rocks to acquire smaller ones, instead of smashing them, for instance. There is no multiplayer or co-op, which I also find dissappointing. 
It seems to me, that the devs have not been supporting the project as much as they could have over the last months, even though the game sold well and content was announced, but then postponed.

1. More Plants encyclopedia, yes the animal too
2. Eating insects / bugs is one of survival key in the jungle
3. Add Slingshots, idk why you missed this one
4. Seeds to open farm options
5. Rope ladder
6. Option to build brige
7. TREE HOUSE (LOL)
8. Should have muscle/body development to run faster / hit harder

--What i don't like in current--
1. Stats dropping
2. Fire ended too quick
3. Building is harder with dead tree can't be cleared

A price tag of 20$ for a game that is early access is to much to ask for in this condition.

Being unable to kill lizards with a machete is a joke.

The gathering system sucks.

This game isn't ready for a full release and wont be until they fix alot of things and improve the overall gameplay in this game.

To anyone that wants this game buy it now before full release and save yourself money because i wager they will bump its price up.

As someone who had played The forest on/off for years from early access till now i have seen it get better over the years and it is worth the 20$ but this game not in a long shot folks.

I'm learning to build and to create better weapons and tools so sustain a life in the jungle. Snakes, spiders, natives, infections bee's etc. etc. are all a huge factor when trying to survive.

I'm writing this because I feel that if you want a true survival game where you have to find dry leaves and make a handrill and practically feel yourself blowing to create that ember for your fire? I promise you won't go wrong.

I'ts like if Stranded deep and The Forest had a baby. Both Solid survival games. but I believe this one captures it a little more true to the point. Getting mud on you, drinking dirty water can cause parasites in your stomach, Vomiting, exhaustion. All really do play a huge role in this game.

69,Green Hell,49943426,english,"I regret buying this. If I had stayed under two hours I would've refunded it. EDIT: Reinstalled it to give it another shot since I'm stuck with it. This game has potential but the current iteration is hot garbage. Food poisoning is a death sentence. Once you become ""dehydrated"" you have literal seconds to live as your health drains away. You can't even dig a fucking hole in the ground, line it with leaves and drink rain water. Apparently this PhD anthropologist who has made at least one prior excursion into the rain forest is too goddamn dumb to sit down, turn his head to the sky and open his mouth to catch the rain. HOT. GARBAGE.

The closest comparison is obviously The Forest. I think this looks and sounds better, and the small snippet of the story mode I got to play had some actual voice acting that was done well enough. My issue is that at this stage of development the devs have made some bad choices that result in a feeling of arbitrary punishment rather than immersive gameplay.

The whole nutrition system is needlessly complicated for the sake of being needlessly complicated and/or adding another way to punish you for giving them your money. It's not a simple issue of eating and drinking - you have to monitor hydration, protein intake, fat intake, and carb intake. You don't do this in your normal day-to-day existence as a real person and you get along well enough, but for some reason the people making this game think it's fun to micromanage macronutrients. Further, from what I can tell, your health drops if you're need meeting minimums on protein/fat/carbs. Apparently the devs have never heard of the Atkins diet or fat free dairy products. This by itself is so stupid it took me right out of the immersion they've clearly taken pains to try and build.

I have less issue with dehydration causing health damage. You'll die in about 3 days with no water, versus 30 days with no food (devs: that means zero calories, not zero of a specific type of calorie). What's really dumb is that nearly all the water you find is either ""unsafe""(?) or dirty (riddled with parasites). Now, there are ways to clean/purify this dangerous water but you have to hunt them down in order for the blueprint to be added to your buildable workstations list. You don't know everything available to you from the start, like in The Forest, and you can't just figure it out yourself like you can with crafting weapons through trial and error. This is dumb. Their official wiki leads me to believe there are other non-crafted ways to deal with this issue but those depend on you A) knowing they exist, B) knowing where to find them, and C) figuring out the boneheaded design logic in how they've been implemented. I found a bamboo water filter at a boat dock - yay! I used my little bidon(??) canteen to dump dirty water into the top - yay! But for some inexplicable reason the vessel that was sufficient to convey water into the filter was insufficient to sit at the bottom of the filter and receive the same water minus parasites. This is a glaring oversight if not outright stupid. 

You have to micromanage your inventory. You're required to move things around inside your pack on your own in order to accommodate the large, sometimes massive, items you find. This would be slightly less irritating if after consuming something like an herb or a fruit it didn't still say ""Unknown fruit"" while telling you the carb count and any other effects. I know where this scores on the glycemic index but I don't know what the fuck it's called? Really? And I realize I'm in a jungle but come on, wtf are you doing with mushrooms I picked off a tree stump ""spoiling"" in 24 hours (if not less)? Do you think leaving a pizza out over night renders it unfit for human consumption you goons?

I found some iron veins which was intriguing. After I played another hour I actually laughed when I imagined how poorly thought out the whole forging process is going to be. Again, you can eat something and know the grams of protein you've just ingested but not what it's called. You can use a ""bidon"" to dump water into a filter but not collect that same water in the ""bidon"" you just used. Now imagine the pants-on-head reasoning these guys use to design a system where you're mining iron ore (!) out of caves with stone tools (!!) and have to construct a forge out of mud and bones to make yourself... what, exactly? A fucking broadsword? What part of this jungle has a forge made out of mud and bones for me to go look at so I can recreate it back at my shitty base that has 18 piles of ash because I'm too stupid to make an actual fire pit?

Honestly not much of a reviewer, as I'm sure you will notice as you (probably won't) read my upcoming, convoluted, yet relatively short rant. I just think this game takes the real-realism and actually implements it in a way that's sincerely fun. Well, fun if you are a sadistic piece of masochist poop and love to die a lot by random things that you didn't even know you could die from in a game kinda fun.

The mechanics seem very well thought out and logical. On top of that... it's absolutely gorgeous. If the worms don't make you go insane first, you will be panicking because you will constantly be trying your best to find a way to cure your rash or fever from venom(OOO a big rock! go to pick up rock and instead run face first into that rattlesnake hiding in the bush -.-) and then end up getting your face mauled off by a leopard q.q

Multiplayer would be neat, but after playing this for a while I'm really excited for how the campaign is going to play out. Always a fan of the Psychological genre, especially if it's in a seriously brutal survival setting. This game just screams solo challenge to me. More akin to The Long Dark without the temperature factor since you will be battling the environment more than anything else.

I would say more, but I don't want to rant (more than already I have) and this is just one mans opinion ^.^

Originally i said that this game was not recommended but now that some more time has been spent on the game I can say that enough changes have been made to make it worth a punt now.

The game is pretty and the survival mechanics are for the most part pretty good. Being able to build is nice although i do have some complaints.

Not being able to build things until you have seen them already built is ok for certain structures but things like the log bed shouldn't need to be sought out individually. If I have learned how to build a Bamboo frame I'm pretty sure that I could work out how to build a bed using the same method so that I didn't have to sleep in a pile of leaves anymore.

Leeches are WAAAYYY too common and do far too much damage over time. 

Player food and water requirements are unbalanced. A human can survive on water alone for weeks. In Green hell if you don't eat a full steak dinner with a litre of Evian every 4 hours you will eventually die. 

Tribals are annoying. They sing constantly, spawn randomly and attack you on site. This is just not good game design. I know my last review mocked the devs for copying The Forest but the ONE thing they didn't copy was the one thing they should have. Natives should have patrol routes and not be immediately hostile, they shouldn't spawn out of thin air right next to your camp. 

The story mode intro is pointless and not very well made. The omnipresent girlfriend whose face you are never allowed to see is voice acted by someone with about as much interest as Donald Trump reading an Auto-cue. Everything that the intro teaches you could be explained in about 1 minute during normal play. 

Anyway all gripes asside, I can see that assuming the devs don't wildly deviate from the current trajectory this game will be fun to play once they get the survival mechanics more balanced.",1536166443,1553762418,TRUE,0,0,0.338732958,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,185,27,1045,0,70,1595778678,,

Edit: I stopped playing this game a few months ago because of optimization issues.

95,Green Hell,44691907,english,"Don't be fooled by the trailer, there is only a small portion (tutorial) that is voice acted and done that well (it was really well done though).  I was looking forward to investing hours into this and really surviving in the hot and humid amazon.  After what I currently have(like 8-9 hours), I feel like I've done most of what there is to do in the current survival-only state of the game.  I've wondered around, up and down dirt roads to places that I'm not allowed to go yet.  I found a little cluster-f@#! of the bad guys, which is definitely a no-go with the current state of pvp.  

To get blueprints to make things, you have to find them in the world.  They're at static locations, but without even a rudimentary in-game map, you end up going in circles and ""exploring"" the same area over and over again in search of hopefully something new to craft or another objective to accomplish.  After you set up a few traps, make a spear, and crack open a few coconuts you're pretty well set on the survival side of things.  Use bones for needles, find some bandage plants, and eat misc fruits and meats to your heart's content and drink coconut water or water that they catch when it rains.  It's pretty straight-forward.  The novelty wears off after a short time, as you don't even have the option to build like walls or anything that would give you a grind to build a big base.  At least not that I know of.  I've seen several walls without getting a blueprint.  From my experience there are 2 lean-to and 1 mound-style premade shelters that you can plop down and fill up with resources to make.  

For $20 I can't recommend the game where it is.  The movement also feels sandpaper-y which is an annoyance even though it's still playable.  In an open-ended survival game like this, I was expecting many more hours for $20 before losing all interest.  I'm sure there's more trees and vegetation I could find in the map, maybe a hidden alcove of water or two, but nothing substantial enough that it makes me want to start the game and delve in for a gaming session.  

Looking forward to development, though, as the inventory, crafting, and storyline thus far have all caught my attention.

Original:  Sep 11 2018.  Edit January 3 2019:  

I have NEVER in ALL my recent gaming (past 5 years at least)  gone into a game and thought ""What in the holy fuck is this movement?""  and it has happened EVERY time I log into this one.  

Re-downloaded because of new water area.  Movement is still so disgustingly sand-papery that I instantly uninstalled again.  Pathetic.  I turned every possible graphics setting on the lowest possible option and it's horrible.  I mean just look at the ground as you move.  It's like it's maxed out to 30fps.  So displeasing to the eye that I absolutely will not play this (story-mode, full-release, or otherwise) until this movement is fixed.  It legitimately used to give me headaches playing this.  And I will not repeat that experience becuase  the developers can't find a way to make their character move smoothly. IT'S 2019!  CHARACTERS HAVE MOVED SMOOTHLY SINCE THE DAWN OF GAMES!  GET IT RIGHT!  Absolutely do not recommend.  It's really just a remake of a remake of a remake of a remake of survival games, wtih nothing truly new to it in any way.  Diseases?  (ARK, most RPG's, etc.)  Predators?  (ARK, most RPG's, Far Cry, etc.)  Cannibal headhunting locals? (HELLO WHAT A TROPE).  I could ALMOST give it another chance, but the MOVEMENT.  Just please don't waste your money.  It feels like I'm playing on a ps1 game's fps.

Further Edit:
Saw promising update that mentioned making textures take up less of graphics memory.  Still runs at (what looks like) 30fps on lowest settings w/ 980ti and i7-7700k.  Simply look at the base of a tree and walk around it, and the frames are SO BAD it legitimately causes headaches.  

I will never re-download this, and I can't dislike/not recommend it enough.

The game is early access, but i think it's too early access to charge people so much for it. There are some quite heavy bugs in it. 
I built up a camp, finally learned how to keep me fed and healthy, had a nice bed with roof on top... then i wanted to explore more... i explored for 2 hours without saving (you can only save at the shelter/camp), and when i got back, i tried to save, but a weird animation (water splashing) appeared and i couldn't use the right-click or 'E'-button.

16,Green Hell,49258763,english,"After playing SCUM, Dying light, subnautica, the forest, Ark and more, I can say, Green Hell is a challenge and it's worth playing already. The latest updates pushed the game further into the right direction.
Quick overview:

Pro:
- Textures of plants, animals and native people are fantastic ! (yet, the terrain will need improvements)
- the complexity of risk in the jungle, the plants and stuff you need to cook, the recipes to heal or treat problems, is quite realistic, and once you master it somewhat, you get a rush ;-)
- the way you find blueprints to build things, is exciting, and I love the ideas (waterfilter made of nature, and many more...)
- You sit in a cave, next to a fire, night outside preparing your food and medicine, while tribesmen are chanting outside, and you feel the excitement of danger... 

Con / To be worked on, since it's early access:
- AI for animals and natives needs improvements. they get stuck (but the devs are working on it, the last patches did wonders)
- the terrain looks very cheap compared to the rest of the vegetation (but that's ok, as long as those textures will be added at some point)
- the amount of things to build, after unlocking it by discovery, is already good. But it will need more, and more animals.
- item placement (building) also needs work (sometimes you need to aim 1m away, to mark an object to grab it or built it, e.g. frame, binding points)

@Devs:
In the end, it would be great, if all the work and expertise we put into the character, would pay off in a way, that e.g. we can decide ourselves (even during storyline), to enjoy an awesome self-built camp with loads of blueprints to manifest, that would feel like a huge reward and achievement. You can even put stuff on top of that with the storyline, but please leave room for people to go different ways of playing it. 
Give people purpose in the game by enabling them to have long-term achievements that show and are felt, too. Don't let it become a ""played 5 days, now it's boring"" ;-)
Thanks.

Verdict:
The game is already fun to play, and since the devs are active and add good content, it justified the price for me.

19,Green Hell,49230287,english,"So having played Long Dark and The Forest - I feel like this sits nicely between the two. 

The tutorial is worth doing for understanding the mechanics but the 'story' is so, so bad. Cringe inducing. Please for the love of story telling find a youtube guide or something and 'play along'. 

Crafting/gathering is similar to The Forest, as is construction. Nothing fancy but it works without breaking immersion. 

My only bug bear so far is the health/nutrient/fatigue system. I found my character needing to sleep twice a day, and at times refusing to do things like ""start a fire"" because he was tired. Which was a problem because I was dehydrated and needed to boil water, and ended up dying shortly after his 'power nap'. He also really wanted protein earlier but it wouldn't 'show me' how to make a fishing spear...so I just kept trying random combos or seeing if I needed to catch one by hand to 'learn' the recipe. The nutrient thing should be more of a buff system than a punishment. Two days without meat shouldn't cripple you. 

Its also still buggy, I got glitched harvesting an animal with a full backpack - and then found out that sleeping doesn't save your game. Which is NUTS. If its capable of saving your game, and you sleep in it, just go ahead and autosave me.  Bit of an exasperated quit. 

Keep an eye on it, but unless your a die hard fan of this game type and will put up with bugs/WIP mechanics etc...maybe wait.

Green Hell is a realistic survival sim set in the amazonian rainforest. All other so called 'survival' games just ain't that. Green Hell is the real survival sim with complexity and depth. It often gets compared to The Forest, which I also really enjoy(ed), but the comparison is very superficial. The Forest simply doesn't have the focus on realistic survival and is not a sim.

24,Green Hell,49149272,english,"Great game but very similar to The Forest.  I personally loved The Forest so, for me, this is actually a major plus.  I think the only complaint I have is how often the character seems to need food and water.  Theoretically, a person can survive for approximately 3 days without water and about a week without food (I read that somewhere).  The main character appears to be a diabetic who swallowed a crate of dessicants. He seems to need food and water every twenty seconds.  I'm playing on the ""Walk in the Park"" setting and I need to shove food and water in this dude's face CONTINUOUSLY!  I know we're treating about 45 minutes(or less) of real time as a day of game time but I think they really need to relax that requirement slightly.  Other than that, it's a fun simulator that tries to be as realistic as possible.  The items you combine look like they came from the items you used, things break, animals and parasites bite, etc.  I can't wait for the story mode to come out.  If you're looking for the next The Forest, look no further, you've found it.  That's a good thing.

Also if you don't discover a bed recipe and make one you can't save sleeping on an abandond bag does nothing (As far I I can see)

So the game clearly some work to do but I think it is really nice. It's a darn sight better than any other survivle game I can think of. Very Nice.

EDIT: I've contacted a Dev and confirmed this is a bug. You're meant to know how to sharpen a rock when you pick up a rock and other things like that.

Game is really nice, one of the best survival games out there. There is a bit of an end game currently where once you find an area that has some pigs you can set up a ""pig farn"" and just camp it. hopefully soon they will add a relitively complex base building system so I have a reason to go out and risk my life for resources. Some basic farming would be nice too, Meat is too easy to get in relation to Carbohydrates and healing items.

Edit 2: I found out the bug that broke crafting was caused by playing out the whole tutorial, Just skip it if you perfer the game actually function. 

Now that I've had more time to get into the game one of my main requests would me a more complex stat system kinda like Scum has. I really like this games simple building system and I do like the constant state of vulnerabilty; no matter how strong you are 1 snake or jauguar can and will kill you! I do think the game absolutely needs more content to sate the player's appetite after they have established a small base. Once you have food and water the game becomes kinda mundane, Perhaps add in some procedurally generated variant of the map with random loot, Just as an optional gametype mind you because at the current moment after you have visited the 10 or so points of interest on the current map and leveled your simple stats up to a level that suits your there is quite literally nothing to do, Keep in mind this particular flaw is present in *all* games of this genre and I in no way mean this as something super negative.",1550562264,1550732764,TRUE,1,0,0.444444418,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,339,96,3372,0,1346,1586668429,,

No option for motion blur or V-sync, no customisable framerate lock, no option to turn down/off the camera wobble.

44,Green Hell,49037437,english,"An excellent survival game, stunning graphics, great mechanics, great design. I enjoy this game, I tried the game on other graphical settings, at least the other one's that are provided. The game still looks like it's running on a medium high on low, it runs really well on High, I tried this game on two different pc's. A pc with a 1060 6gb and another with an RTX 2080Ti. It ran well on a 1060 with barely noticeable drops, went from 70fps to 60fps. Sometimes it would drop to 40 but it's not a problem when your invested in searching and surviving, unless you're looking for it. On the RTX 2080Ti, it ran from 150fps and would drop to 140 but stood smooth throughout the entire play through. Onto the gameplay, the aspect of survival this game has is much like a real life situation, the sanity mechanic is really nice. It makes the player question their own sanity whilst playing. Sanity in this game can and will kill you if you don't manage it. Surprisingly it's easy to manage the sanity as long as you eat, take leeches off, heal cuts and scratches, sleep, and sit by the fire for a bit, although. The fire will cause unwanted attention to the player from the local tribes. Crafting is also really cool and easy to understand and remember. When you have so many trees and plants around you crafting is a breeze. This game has a lot of potential, with a little more optimization for the framerate and graphics, I feel people will like this game even more than they do now. Hopefully multiplayer is added, it would be better to survive with more than one person.

46,Green Hell,49030149,english,"So after the latest update, and reading many posts, I have played 23 in-game days. Once I settled at the island, 35w-26s, I built a small camp already knowing building anything in this game is not needed, other than, what is needed to survive. A medium shelter for saving and sleep, a couple of dryers for meat with cover from rain, and a few water collectors. There literally is no reason to build anything else which makes all other content such as water purifier, weapon rack, and any other structures absolutely pointless. I did build a small fire just to test the AI on this island and what do you know...tribe spawned in the middle of the island proving there is no point in traps. I did however build many traps as this game, once you understand the mechanics, is really Really boring and building traps gave me at least something to do other than be a food and stick gatherer. I littered the island with traps of all kinds and a few at each entrance of the island, on and off the island. I found that the traps are pretty worthless also. Mice, spiders, lizards, turtles set off the traps...really a spider and mouse set off stick traps that big enough that only large beings would set off. A lizard maybe?...Not...And the bow trap, don't even get me started...Worthless...even though it was funny watching it actually work on a tribesman for once.

CONCLUSION: There is really no point in Alot of content in this game. Needs to survive are minimal to say the least. Gathering food is the only point of this game in the end other than a little building for saving/sleeping, rain cover for dryers, water collectors for dry season. All other content is a waste of time accept for the occasional small fire when first starting. This Game, once understood, has very little to offer and becomes Very boring quickly. 

END GAME: Gather to eat... which I think my character would be around 600 lbs. by now as all I do after about 17 in-game days is gather and eat. If you understand how to ""cycle"" meat on the dryers and find fruits, which is also easy, and have a a few water collectors...Game Over.

1- Crafting system is pain in the ass. Couldn't you just make a system like ARK Evolved? To build a simple fucking campfire shouldn't be this hard. IF YOU ARE EXPERIENCED It's taking 4-5 real life minutes to build a campfire, imagine if you are not experienced.
2- Game doesn't inform you clearly about crafting. For example, if you haven't found a stone by luck, then you can't see ""stone knife"" on the notepad. At the beginning I thought there was no weapon.
3- To save the game, you have to build a shelter. But still, the game doesn't save even if you use the shelter. I've used the shelter and closed the game, when I rejoined I wasn't at the spot I saved.
4- The character getting hungry very quickly. And your game is all about running and trying find food, which is almost impossible. running 1.5-2 minutes to find a fruit(if you are lucky) and it doesn't even recover enough hunger.

- The craft side is very very lacking
- The native enemy is bugy, sometimes they only stand there let us to kill

- U can eat HUMAN MEAT !! Even thought i never try, my little heart cant accept it
- I know clean water is very easy when u have a lot.. lot.. lot of coconuts.. Yet, its better if the game add some water collector at early games...  Not that filter stuff but the one that can collect water from rain... 
- The animals really can run, and its fast.... The Jaguar always run after few hits from me.. what a coward
- Fish trap is almost useless, the heck .. its take  a day to trap a fish, and if we harvest them all the leftover meat spoiled before cooked,  so i try to let them in the trap and take the fish when needed.... but, when i come back to get the fish, they are gone...
- Animal trap is the best tools, suggest to build this early because they can give u meat every few hours.
- Coconuts are our best friend... really... the best....
- The story is short,its still EA i know, but still sometimes i m bored because there not much to do...
- Sanity management is not easy, we need nuts, and the nuts is very rare.... the easiest method is sleep, but sleep in this game is like a trap, sometimes we wake up and greeted by Leech, or some native that attacking.

Some negatives (not game breaking)
-Game is not optimized yet, will get slower when you're playing a longer game
-Sometimes it's a bit clunky, for example spears and arrows will sometimes bounce off invisible barriers. Combat feels clunky overall
-Natives will bug out frequently (walking into a rock wall while singing :p) until attacked
-At this stage survival mode isn't incredibly rewarding, gets a bit boring after a while. Will probably change though. 
-Don't really like traps, I would prefer them catching prey over time instead of having to walk some distance away and

You start the game in an absolutely stunning jungle setting with interactive dialogue between your character and one other which also guides you through a brief tutorial.  This sets the story for what I imagine if going to be a wild ride as the game is further developed.  From the moment the interaction and brief tutorial is over, you're dropped into the jungle to be left to your own devices.  To survive, you will need to battle hunger, nutrition, thirst, parasites, Amazonian Tribes, and more.  This game makes you work hard for your survival instead of holding your hand throughout the game.  Almost everything you will need to figure out or discover on your own through trial, error and exploration.  Is this mushroom safe to eat? Well, there's only one way to find out, but do you really want to take the chance?

The graphics of this game are some of the best out there.  The quality of immersion is I've experienced playing this is not something I usually experience.  At the time of this review I have 4.5 hours, but that's more than enough to know this game is a winner.  I will be putting many more hours in for sure.

Still want to have some action, but also interaction with indians would be great...may help them so they help you...some might be agressive but should not be all of them.
My comment like this since I game to relax from work, etc. and not to get stressed too much;)
But absolutely great. Concrats to the developer.

>After 20hrs of enjoying this great game
...But to the developers things to fix:
- spawn of food and ressources is too random and just spawning!!
Figured out that instead of starving and running around, just reload until there is plenty of food?!;) Not the sense of such a game and close to a big BUG.
Sometimes you can cross all map and not find 1 banana...sometimes there are 50+ just around..
I think everything in this game just spawns random at certain places, player has no influence and not even buildings have to these spawns.
-  Indians, me like to interact and talk to them or try to get in contact.
Not just as now sneak around them or just kill them!? No sense to me.
- Indians should have villages...and maybe pathes were they go hunting...right now just spawn..even at your sleeping place, so just build more than one;)
- Again food, there should be some sort of planting...for fruits, funghis, etc. or at least sort of a  rythm of spwan of them...so you know where to go to find something.
- the eals...ok think there are in amazonas, but why not just put dirt or a plant on the skin to prevent...getting annoying every few minutes to peal them off.

Still great game for an Alpha and hopefully getting much better and more interesting.

11,Green Hell,48376583,english,"the first thing i will say about this game is that it is literally the hardest game ive ever seen in my life. i can do better surviving in a real rain forest in real life than i can in this unbearably difficult game. even on the easiest diffuculty (which turns off nearly every aspect of the game so its as easy as it gets) is impossible to overcome without a long period of dying repeatedly and memorizing the locations of resources so u can find them fast enough to get set up and be able to avoid death. even so much as making a campfire is hard to do without dying first as even that takes ages to do. another issue is that this game is trying to be realistic but you pass out if u go like 10 in game hours without sleep, u die of dehydration after about a day and a half without water, and u need a ridiculous amount of food very very often in order to stay alive. again, this was on the easiest difficulty with stats draining the slowest. 

aside from the out of this world difficulty the game is decent. crafting is unique and makes sense. there is quite a few options for things to make. despite being so early on in development there is quite a bit to keep u busy since it takes so long to do anything so u will get about 20-30 hours of gameplay from what i can tell so far depending on how quickly u learn the game. the graphics are great and i love the scenery. the sound is good as well. plenty of background noise made by the local animals which makes sense.

overall this is a great game with much more potential than most survival games and it could easily pass the forest one day. i do not reccomend this game at this time because this game is too difficult for casual players to be able to enjoy it.",1547697929,1547697929,FALSE,2,4,0.379339218,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,96,9,1773,0,483,1581529974,,

13,Green Hell,48285213,english,"TL;DR Interesting survival game that has nice mechanics, crafting, exploring and hunting. Story isn't finished yet but it seemed interesting. Great potential.

As a lover of survival genre this game is a good one by far. The small part of the playable story seemed interesting. Now, there are some cons in this game. I have i7-8700K, 1070 Ti and 16 gigs of RAM but only get 35-65fps on medium. There are no other quality options than resolution and very low, low, medium, high and very high. There is no borderless window at all.

[b] Graphics [/b]
Another good looking game.

[b] Mechanics [/b]
Now, this game brings new mechanics to the genre. I like the way you need to check your bodyparts (arms and legs) for rashes, bites and leeches. Vomiting, passing out, manually applying bandages, taking out leeches... Very nice.

[b] Sounds [/b]
Overall great sounds that you need to count on while traveling through the woods. You need to hear where the threats are or otherwise you're going to have a bad time. Some sounds are not directional though so you can't pinpoint where they are coming from.

[b] Environment [/b]
It rains a bit too often in the game. I don't mind rain at all, but it will extinguish your campfire (if it's under the sky) and your cookings won't finish. It's not a huge deal but it rains frequently (every 5 to 10mins?). I'd rather have a longer lasting rain that happens less often.

[b] Items/Crafting [/b]
There's a nice variety of different craftable items. You can craft traps, arrows, torches, axes etc.
Items do break really fast though (edit: your crafting skill goes up the more you craft, at low skill level items break really fast). It's not hard to craft basic axes but even bone axes and obsidian axes break fast.

[b] Energy/Food/Water [/b]
One annoying thing is that when your energy is getting low and you're trying to start a fire it takes a lot of energy to use the hand drill. If you don't have enough energy you can't make a fire. Of course you can just sleep for a while but I think hand drill uses a bit too much energy. Drinking and eating has some variety to them. You need to do it often though but I like that you need to get proteins and other things from different foods. For example, meat gives you protein but won't fill your vitamins.

[b] Building [/b]
Building is fine but placing them can be annoying since you can only place them on flat ground. Let's say you find a nice spot near the river. Let's build something here? Nope. If the ground is even a bit steep you can't place on it. There's no snap either. Also, if you're making a campfire in an area that doesn't have a lot of big stones.. It's gonna take a long time to finish it since you need to find 12 big stones and you can only carry them one by one.

[b] Pros [/b]
+ Looks good
+ Sounds nice
+ Crafting
+ Exploring and hunting
+ Nice variety of animals and critters

- Optimization
- Story is unfinished
- Placing buildings

Beware, this is not a 'walk in the park' although there is a (not too easy) difficulty level of that name. (out of three levels and a planned story mode)

There are many different ways to lose the battle against mother nature: jaguars, pumas, caimans, piranhas, sting rays, snakes, scorpions, spiders, wasps, ants, intestinal parasites, carnivorous worms that make you mad, food poisoning, starvation, dehydration, natives. I have probably forgotten a few.
Chances are that anacondas will also be added.

In addition, the developers stay on track with their planned road map.

I look forward to the next updates of this very immersive game.

For the people who expect co-op: when the Single Person game is finished in the spring of 2019, there will be a DLC in which you can resist the dangers of the jungle together with someone else.

I can understand that maybe the one who wrote it may not be a native speaker, which explains the weird usage of words that won't usually be used in a given situation, but it was such a stark contrast to the smooth voice acting that it just felt so off that I lost the drive to continue playing after the tutorial was over.

The story itself is good enough, nothing stellar, but enough of the mysterious ""into the unknown"" intrigue to make me wonder what will happen next. But the extremely awkward way the two (supposed to be lovers) characters interact with each other, exacerbated by the ungodly amount of exposition in the dialogue, really took me out of the immersion.

The game itself looks amazing, and I can't wait to play more of it as soon as I recover from the second-hand social awkwardness.

If this keeps up and the rest of story mode will be like this, all I hope for is skippable dialogue.

I would recommend this game to everyone who likes survival games. This game is in its early stages and the only thing I don't like is some of the animations and the animal sounds. It sounds like they are just repeating after eachother all the time, but I think that is something they'll change in the near future. This is a good game and in a year or two this will be
a fantastic game. Creepy Jar, good luck to you and thank you for giving me a good game :)",1545802297,1545802297,TRUE,5,0,0.529579818,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,259,29,1000,0,653,1594433972,,

56,Green Hell,47809659,english,"I have never ALT+F4'd from a game so fast and LOVED every second that drove me to fear-quitting.

A friend bought me this for Christmas because of my love for The Forest.  While I agree that the games are similar, I want to note right now that if you like the Forest primarily for the building aspect, this game is far more survival based than building based in its present state.  You will not get the same building enjoyment out of it (and in my opinion, the setting is a lot less forgiving for sprawling bases), though their roadmap suggests more building overhauls are coming in the future.

Now I like a challenge and I suck at survival games, so I enjoy this regardless of the lack of robust building features.  I am still very early in, though, so I haven't seen much of the blueprints that you discover from exploring.  This review will likely get editted when I have more time in it.  But as the game presently stands, I already feel like this was worth my friend's money.  

I spent 20 minutes trying to figure out how to build a fire in the tutorial since I went in almost completely blind at the game's mechanics; I was laughing my butt off in voice chat with my friends because of how dense I was.  This game has some very complex systems detailed in the game's summary that have a steep learning curve, but it adds such immense flavor to the game once you start learning how to use them.  Let's not even get started on trying to maintain them!  The challenge kept me up for a full night and then some as I heavily researched game mechanics for my next session.

The graphics are absolutely gorgeous even before I poked around in Reshade.  The ambience is stunning, though the intro music will blast your ears with an intense flute solo that may have you cranking down the in-game volume quickly.  I recommend adjusting it so that you don't lose out on the rest of the experience once in game.  There are few graphic controls outside the boot-up options which disappoint me, though definitely not game breaking and I expect them to come later as the option is grayed out at present.  I have run into a few crashes, nothing outside of the ordinary for early access--it's frustrating at worst, but nothing has destroyed the experience for me.

I can't speak much for the combat because the predatorial animals kicked my butt and I shrieked a little too loudly when the natives appeared.  I can say that the passive animals take some chasing to kill but it's quite satisfying, and the crafting system is very robust.

What storyline is available seems both amusing and interesting, and I look forward to story mode being released because I love me some lore.  A co-op option is also slated for spring 2019 on their roadmap, which is a major factor as to why I am interested in continuing to support this game; I love me some co-op survival horror (like my army of dads group in the Forest).

There is a small modding community as a third party with ModAPI, a Patreon-run program for games made in Unity.  At the moment there are only a few mods up that are mostly for flavor, but I'm interested to see if a modding community flourishes the longer the game is up.

TL;DR, don't go in expecting it to be The Forest (despite its similarities) if you got directed here from it.  It's not.  It's a more survival-based game that, in my opinion, is very worth it, if not refreshing, if you like a challenge.",1545753761,1545754287,TRUE,35,4,0.797472298,1,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,65,5,7642,0,922,1595477525,,

Survival is a common genre in games but some hold that title loosely, Green Hell does not!

In Green Hell you can expect to be challenged by leeches, parasites, infected cuts and food poisoning as well as the exciting fights with larger predators and natives and much more; this well rounded gameplay creates a truly great survival experience that I would recommend to any fans of the genre!

I don't have much experience in survival games as a lot of people but I did play some. This game so far is beating my aspects on all other games that I've played. The game feels alive with all the lush life going on in the word. Also I love the realism with diseases and injury. It does need some tweaking on damage location; I do wish there was one for chest area. 
I like the hunting system so far but I have a feeling that the animals need to be more difficult to hunt, it's a bit too easy so far. I notice there will be fixes on AI and more enemies. I hope they continue on with this and add more.
If you like survival and realism without the zombie horror survival, I would recommend this. You can spend most of the time just enjoying the enviroment.

Survival mode:

Stranded here... Though I'm not sure where here is. 
It's a beautiful but deadly place. Even the earth it's self seems to want me dead, providing shelter for worms until they 
burrow into my skin. 
Am I crazy? Maybe a little... But I cut the bastard clean out of my arm. 

Trying to find out where I am, and more importantly find a way out. Wandering, I managed to make my way across several abandoned settlements. Though I don't know that abandoned is the right word. There is a sense of loss all around them. Good tools, useful to me now, but no sign of anyone.
Did they escape this hell? Or did they fall victim to it? 

I had a run in with one of the locals... He's dead. When I came upon him he was singing, seemingly cheerfully. But when I waved and said hello he stood up and his entire demeanor changed... Violent. Was he a canible? Was I tresspassing? Did I make myself a threat? I'm not sure, but the end result is a body of one of the inhabitants and my blood staining the ground as well. Hope these leaves and vine will hold me together.

It's been a few days, since my run in. Not really sure how long exactly, I used to forget what day of the week it was when I was home, why start tracking now. All that's important is making it to tomorrow and I'm happy to report my wound seems to have healed nicely. I have been able to avoid the locals as they sing and don't seem very perceptive of far off movement. 

I was able to fashon some rudimentary tools, and build myself a quite little hide away, a fresh one away from the loss of others. Though every day I am plagued by leaches, and the constant struggle for substance. 
Good thing this watch is solar powered and helps keep track of dietary needs. A fun gift from back home that is now invaluable. 

On a hunt for food today I heard something that makes me think I may not be the only one hunting. I swear if the plants don't poison me, the locals don't kill me or I don't starve to death then, what ever is lurking might be the end. Maybe it's just in my mind. Regardless I must push on. I can't get to comfortable in one spot, that's how they'll find me.

Not sure how long I've been hear, here? I can't think straight. These logs are about all I've got any more. Sometimes I sit near the hunters... Just to hear them sing. A risk of life for a little reminder of simpler times, a different life. Some companionship through this hell. But who would wish that on anyone. I must be going mad.

I hear them, at night, in the distance. Playing music on thier wooden instruments. The voices tell me to give up, but the sounds of the locals surviving helps me to press on.  Some day I'll find my way out of this maze of rock, and trees, this beautifull but decieving Green Hell.

Allowing you to patch up an arm or a leg is so much better than merely swallowing some pills or pressing on a bandage in your inventory. Overall this is game plays similar to ‘The Forest’; however, Green Hell has superior graphics and more advanced gameplay mechanics.

If you have the time and patience to learn and make all the survival items you need to stay barely alive then this game is for you..  I don't have much patience for this type of survival enviroment so I only played a little over 4hrs then I just said f it.

It's very easy to lose track where you are and how to get back to your base. Food is scarce and the wild game is so allusive that its practically impossible to catch them for meat unless you craft traps and can wait for animals to get snared in them before you die of starvation.  I mean your basically in a small world of where your camped out and thats pretty much where you need to stay or you lose track and cant find it nd all that crafting is lost unless you come accross it later on by accident.  There is no map although you do get a compass but what the use of a compass without a map and landmarks look all the same.  Yeah the creators of this game really want to make so difficult so I guess they can say they have the toughest survival game out there because they don't take into consideration the player wants and needs to enjoy this game while at the same time making it a challenge.

While there's nothing to do currently beyond just the survival mode, the game's enjoyable enough that I was able to play for almost a full in-game month before running out of things to explore. It's also fairly intuitive - I rarely felt as though I needed outside help to figure out what I was supposed to be doing, building or eating, unlike a LOT of other survival games.

The world is visually lush and feels alive and vibrant, and unlike most games in the genre you're in no danger of depleting your resources by staying in one spot for too long; something that would realistically never happen to you in a territory as vast and full of wildlife as the amazon. My one main complaint aside from some standard early-access niggles (like NPCs getting stuck walking into rocks) is that there's currently no way to find out if something is actively harmful for you to eat before doing so. This means that if you're on the brink of death and find an unfamiliar food item, the only way to find out if it will keep you alive is to eat it, which generally then screws you over completely by giving you massive amounts of food poisoning and making you vomit your guts out repeatedly until you die. Some sort of in-game ability to research this information would be ideal, and in fact seems to be planned, so I can't really get too mad about it.

16,Green Hell,45797422,english,"As a former SERE and outdoor survival instructor, I have to say this is one of the better survival games I have played to date. It’s always a challenge to capture the reality of a survival situation and find that balance where diet and health impact your abilities. This game handles the diet issue well by implementing a protein, carb, fat monitor and health issues are covered by various ailments from scratches to poisonous bites. It doesn’t stop there; each ailment can be attended to by various medicinal plants and first aid techniques. Actions have a big effect on stamina requiring you to find a safe dry place to sleep. A common flaw I find amongst most survival games is shelter building and how easy they make it. Chopping down trees and carrying heavy logs through a jungle is not a one-day event, especially on a limited diet. Although at this stage in the build I find shelter building too easy on the stamina, I like that shelter building is modular and recipes can be learned by examining other man-made objects in the jungle.

My computer is on the low end of graphics, still running a 6 series, this game plays on high graphics without issue and is graphically a beautiful game. I enjoy the rain in this game as it is an element you need to plan around. In this game, insects are an issue and I hope they develop that more into the rain cycles, i.e. harder to sleep when weather is clear due to flying insects.

As an early release, this game has already surpassed other titles I’ve played in the survival genre and I’m always looking for the next best survival game. At this stage it has many similar elements as other titles, but I think the crafting (ability to discover designs by trial and error), inventory management (can visually move things around in your bag to make room, good use of animal parts) and the macro diet system (prevents the effects of protein poisoning), give it a leading edge. Having spent time teaching survival in Costa Rica, I think this game captures the important elements of survival or appears to have them implemented in the future. My only suggestions would be more bugs (especially the flying annoying kind, offer natural repellants, smoke etc.), tree snakes and sleep should be constantly interrupted and not good sleep. If there is one thing I do not like about this game, it’s the tarps. I am constantly encountering tarps that can not be taken and used. It’s a rainforest, obviously tarps can not only keep you dry but collect rainwater in all the plastic 50-gallon drums laying around but that’s okay, I’ll use my coconuts or build an elaborate filter out of bamboo.

19,Green Hell,44816775,english,"EDIT: Latest release is quite buggy.  This needs to be fixed as before when you died in early versions you blamed yourself, now its too often a bugged out process (e.g. placed bandages won't apply, laggy lag lag when getting attack --> to death, inventory randomly decides to drop everything of a type etc).  In this state, I'm parking it.  

Also, with the additional animals it has now become way too easy to survive and way to easy to die through a stupid death.  -1 Like.

---------

For those who are familiar with my 15 minute review / burns, I am using this as an example of why I do that.

Straight off the bat, crap name.  'Green Hell' doesnt represent what's going on here in anyway.

There are certain deal breakers in gaming; Affordance, Feedback and Glorious Productivity to name a few key ones I rate.  This game has an awful jump.  It's nigh fecktwaddle. But rather than quit and post my usual rinse, there was a lot here to encourage further play.  Infact, whilst everyone knows jump is best, in this game I thought - 'Maybe jump is so shocking we are not supposed to'

Everything other than jump is pretty faboo and engaging. The environment quickly grabs you and keeping yourself alive is pretty visceral. The story mode at this point is merely a tutorial - let that wash before your quit and refund.  Go ahead and try to survive.

Very quickly survival mode the game explodes into life.  It's hard, scary, intuitive and against other survial mechanics all at the same time. It feels like you are really trying to survive and with each death, you blame your stupid first-world self for dying rather than the game.

Within those first few deaths you learn that this game rewards roleplay in that, if you were in the Amazon how would you really survive.  Great threat elements, Scum like dietry attention, threat elements and a daily / hourly grind to stay alive.

I love it.

If you really, really want a survival game / want to be a Bear Gryillers wannabe do this:-

1) Get the game & install
2) Play and ignore jump & 15 minute 'Story' mode
3) try not to follow-through in survival mode

So back to the name choice, which is pants-cat, its more 'Paradise Lost' / 'Forever Green' / 'Lost and Scared'

20,Green Hell,45782939,english,"Just got green hell a few days ago,  im a huge fan of Survival games, reminds me of playing the forest with the lonesomeness of the long dark. Its still in development and im excited to see the end product of the game! Few things i noticed in the game could use some changes. 

The Ai of the tribals. Alot of times i find them walking into trees. And while in groups there challenging solo fights with them is lacking. If there running throught the forest i dont think they should be singing its nice for a heads up but makes avoiding them way to easy. Making them more sneaky and camouflaged. With more ranged choices (blowgun sling throwing spear) would make players less likely to engage them and make them more of a preditor then a nuisance.

Modern structures - The drug den was a nice touch but to me in a survial setting i would want to use everything i can find.  seeing gasoline for the generators, lanterns for light. Tarps for coverage, And duct tape that could be used for make shift bandages our cordage and not being able to interact with them is frustraging. With some of the wreckage i think being able to use scrap metal ( from plane wreckage jeep etc..) for improvised tools would be a nice improvment if they are going to be in the jungle i feel like we should be able to use them otherwise i feel like its a kick in the face if your living in a palm tree shack and you cant make use of whats already there. Having the armed guards there could balance it making it harder to aquire and bringing a new enime into the game. Maybe using the walkie talky on a diffrent frequency to spy on them our distract them? Id hate to see guns im the game though i like the primitive approach.

Health-I noticed damage when falling but no sprains our breaks. Using a splint system would be nice! And make it a challenge if your running from something and stumble down a hill. The leaf bandages are a nice touch i think using fire to cauterize open wounds to avoid bleeding out would be a little more realistic then wraping a leaf over a jaguar wound. Some tribes use ants to bite and seal wounds as well could be a nice primitive addition to the game! 

Food- smoking our salting would be nice to use the fact i can leave raw meat open on a rack for 3 days in a jungle and still eat it is less believable bugs would lay eggs and it would attract animals. Maybe incorporating a fire under the rack so its more tedious would even it out and bring some realism. 
Berries would be a nice addition to the game to for carbs and water source! Also having durability on coconut shells after 1 hour of game play my campsite was littered with them making water to easy to aquire. 

Weather- soaked in rain in a pair of shorts and a t shirt in a leaf hut, we should be freezing at night and sweeting while going through the thick under brush. Maybe incorporating animal furs as a warmth option our hot stones from a fire put in your shelter to keep warm while it rains. 

All and all i love this game just a few suggestions but either way very excited for the end product i will be recommending this game to friends! Keep up the great work!",1542043521,1542043521,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,96,1,7853,0,1492,1588777022,,

31,Green Hell,45710654,english,"Green Hell. The name itself drives it in you that this game is truly harsh. Having played games like The Long Dark before, I was expecting a harsh experience in this game and it did not disappoint. 

There are a lot of things that can be compared with various ""survival"" genre games like the usual hunger/thirst/exhaustion meters, but this game takes it to a different level with you having to mind your own nutrition! Fats, carbs, proteins, hydration and sleep are your main things to mind in maintaining your overall health. It doesn't stop there, however. Like Stranded Deep, The Long Dark, The Flame in the Flood, there are various ""conditions"" that affect your health, like various wounds, food poisoning, etc. to make the harsh experience of Green Hell just that: HELL.

I realize I put in a lot of various cons in, but I feel the pros outweigh these right now as this game is in Early Access and I hope a lot of these issues will be remedied/improved upon to make this game truly great. I would recommend this game only to those with a LOT of patience. This game does NOT hold you by the hand AT ALL.

Pros:
Lush atmosphere, plenty of beautiful landscapes
Crafting/building
Sandbox
Notebook carries info on crafting, plants, ailments and their cures
Many different animals to prey - or be preyed upon by!
Insects are a thing! Not to just be ignored
Multiplayer is intended to be part of the final release of the game
Interesting inventory management scheme (a backpack!)
Many different tools to use
Rain is useful and not just pretty to listen to and see!
Dry/wet seasons
Traps, snares, bows, spears, knives, axes, even your fists can be used to hunt with!
Sleep is a THING. You have to mind not only when you sleep, but WHERE and HOW.

Cons:
Lots of minor bugs (at time of this review)
No item placement system
No swimming (yet!)
No clothes to craft/maintain
Smallish world to roam in
Natives are all aggressive - not passive
Many crafting recipes are only obtained through raiding of native settlements

Now, with that known, I can easily say that this is the best survival game I've played thus far. Usually I get bored with them after about 5 to 10 hours, but after 12 hours or so, I still have the desire to play this one more. I have so many plans, so many things I wish to accomplish..and this is just in basic survival mode. Anyway, lets get on with the positives and negatives. 

POSITIVES:
+ Super immersive
+ Doesn't get dull. 
+ Nice envinronment and graphics. 
+ LOTS to do. 
+ Intutive crafting system. 
+ Nice tutorial (shows signs of a promising story mode)
+ Stable - not a single crash.

NEGATIVES: 
- Too many snakes (only slightly too many. A 15% reduction would be good). 
- Too few bandages (again, only slightly. a 5 to 10% increase would be good). 
- Runs like garbage - but hey, it's early access. At least it's stable.
- Poor hit detection - don't try to crack open a coconut in your shelter unless you want to bring the whole thing down.
- Loading times are a bit longer than I'd like, but not bad. 
- Too many animals in general. It's way too easy to hunt for larger game becasue they seem to be everywhere. 

Seems like I'm nit picking, right? It's true, but I had to point these things out.

This got me out of the immersion all time. Whenever when I'm walking or running, when I try to find a cure, a crafting method, I'm getting back to the immersion context. 

I'm such a kind of dissapointed about the gameplay mechanics, I got in it, I learned how to handle, maybe this time you spent clicking a shortcut key, moving around your mouse pointer for inspecting your left and right arms and legs could be some short of realistic time, ok, but honestly I get bored with it. 

Currently I can not recommend this game till I get trapped with the history mode, mean while, surviving near to 20 days in easy mode (I never play in easy, I use to play at max but I got bored too playing in hard mode) you will get trapped in a rutine that got you more focus in just survive day by day than in explore.

           ~Pros~ 
      - The graphics are really good for this type of game and its one of the biggest reason why i bought it , everything looks really nice.
      - The building system is nice actually, its different than the forest which i like dearly. 
      - The ""demo"" of the story its really catchy and i cannot wait for the rest of the story to finish , it really draws you in after a moment of playing it. 
      - I like survival games that are a little hard to play, until you figure things out you will most likely die to hunger , infection , food poisoning, etc.
      
            ~Cons~ 
      - There are certain glitches here and there, that  can get pretty annoying.
  (Example) I keep trying to look at my watch to see how my stats are doing and sometimes it glitches out my weapon and i can't hit anything even if i destroy it and build a new one. It will let me pick up small stones and sticks , but not a big stone or stick. It requires me to quit and log back into my saved game until fixed , around 2-3 times doign this, and than i can continue till it happens again.
     - I cannot find thatch worth sh*t , I get lucky and find bird nests here and there to actually start my fire.
     - Where the F*ck are the Nuts xD , i searched all around my shelter and cannot find any for the life of me , but dont worry you will find a spider on the ground waiting to F*ck your sh*t up.
     - I wish we could build something where you can find your shelter , I can't go to far or i wont be able to find where the Hell i put it.

Contrary to it's inspiration The Forest, Green Hell puts survival in the spotlight. Even a slight untreated scratch can kill you.
Have you ever wanted to camp out in the Amazonian rainforest? Well now you can! Build yourself a nice modular shelter on a cliff overlooking the famous riverbank! Stuff it with meat racks, fires, beds, wood storage and whatnot! The atmosphere is spot on!

Biggest fun factor in this game is, I think, the persistence of items. Take a rock and put it somewhere - it's gonna remain there forever and ever. Bring a lot of coconuts to your shelter - they ain't going nowhere. Place a coconut bowl down on the ground - it's gonna catch rainwater for you.

Watch out for nutrients - you need proteins, carbs, fats and water, and they all play a vital role in maintaining your health and strength.
Watch out what you eat - not everything is healthy!
Craft a lot! Primitive survival tools, many shelter types, hand drills for making fires, knives, axes, spears, bows, stone blades, traps, water collectors and filters!

The game is solid from day one, but not without bugs and some game-ruining issues that will surely get fixed.

96,Green Hell,45367458,english,"Hi guy's,
Just purchased the Green Hell survival game and my personal opinion is that its great strategy sim game and been playing it for 18 hours on and off in recent weeks.And especially on my Laptop Intel 7th gen core i7 1080 GTX Nvidia 2 gb chip system. 
And the game is for a good a time challenge depending on what you do in game in a unforgiving jungle environment with all aspects of the Amazon jungle, tribe cannibals/ parasites/ dehydration/ hunger/ hunting/ and Sickness also posioning for eating wrong foods or meat age expired.

I know the game is still in early access play stage of game development and still getting updated i hope!. 
And hope it get finally finished so there's no hickups and no bugs.

For just for feed back i thinks its a great game and should be a detailed graphic VR game also wouldn't that be cool!. Anyway! It reminds me of other games like Life is feudal crossed with Kingdom come deliverance single player.
 
The things i think with my own opinion if they are still in early stage of development, is add more fruit & berry's in trees, and caiman crocodiles and anaconda's under lilly's or somthin. 
Prehaps for extra's the well known disgusting parasite THE BOT FLY, and to fend off the grub in your skin magot laying insect is use plant sap of a tree or somethin that you rub on your self. yuk!
And i realies i honestly don't know how big the game is in kilometres but need a map for shore, however unexplored territory fogness on. 

Walking in the dark at night with hunger and dehydration fast disappearing quickly it gets very hard. Prehaps to fast tho!.
""But thats the chellange of the game hey!""

Most of it is positve with the in game experience.

Only a couple bugs, had fish bone pick's freeze on face of the bag when opened, yeah... stuck in backpack in white not red high lighted squars in raw material crafting department in bag case when right click only when 6 days in virtual world. 
And Head hunters jump up to attack you while running towards you they stall in the air drain graphic speed or lag preformance only for very short peroid of time.
Bow arrows hang out side the bag like they dont fit when in side the bag when is opened but doesn't affect the game tho. Only number of bow arrows. Example, but have 6 in bag but only use two sort of thing.
When bow arrow item age expiry limit is met, they don't drop on ground and disappear like other tools do.

Other then that its work's realy well. Because it's in early access mod still, those bugs should be fix anyway already by now.
Looking forward to when its finished.

Great game!

0,Green Hell,45342183,english,"This is a tremendous solo survival game with unique systems and a lot of polish for just entering early access about two months ago.  Compared to say the Forest this game launched with more content, more polish and better mechanics all around which gets me excited about its future.

The learning curve is steep and I suggest completing the tutorial as otherwise you won't last long.  Even then don't expect to have a good handle on the game until you've got about 5-8 hours of solid survival experience.  There are many different ways to die and some of them are unavoidable like leaches and worms.  With practice you'll get used to nipping things in the bud but the feeling of scarcity in all things stays with you even when you've got a pretty nice camp built up.

The AI is fairly docile and gives you a chance to build up over a few days before they actively seek you out, and there are parts of the map you can utilize if you want to stay clear of them.  For now the AI is mostly a secondary concern but they are planning on adding more AI threats before full release.

As far as the roadmap and the EA experience so far it's been good.  I've owned the game about a month and already had two pretty big updates.  The ""animal update"" that just pushed is tremendous.  The effort put into the sounds and modelling creates such an immersive experience.  The jungle is a scary place at times and wildlife is everywhere.  Compared to a game like SCUM that looks great but feels completely empty at times I much prefer Green Hell's atmosphere.

Graphics and performance are solid.  I have an i5 6600k at 4.4ghz and a RX 480 8GB with 16GB ram and a Evo SSD: I run it at 1440p on medium just fine.  This game does not have the micro stutters when looking at the ground that so many EA titles suffer from.  Game looks great on medium IMO.   The sheer variety of textures and terrain makes things look good.  It feels and looks like a living Jungle.  The animations for firing starting and skinning and building are OK right now.  It's probably an area they will improve slowly as they get towards launch.

Fun survival game but quite limited at the moment. Really enjoyed playing and exploring but after only 25 hours I seem to have come to a point where I'm doing the same thing over and over.
Once you have established a base and set yourself up for food and water, there isn’t really much to do apart from wander around killing natives.
Now, knowing the map and mechanics, I'm sure I could accomplish this in only a few hours. Looking at the devs road map we will be waiting a while for more significant changes.

One thing that would MASSIVELY open up gameplay to a new level is an adjustment to the newly implemented 'modular building'. As it is now, you are extremely limited to the placement of structures. I have found it very difficult to find any areas where the land is suitably clear as well as having flat enough ground to build anything meaningful. By that I mean more than just a few roofs / bed / cooking area. 
If this mechanic was adjusted; to the style of Dayz Mod's modular building for example, free placement of and with the ability to raise and lower structures with stacking would open up the game to a new level. 

Allowing people freedom in this way would make countless more hours of gameplay possible, inspire creativity and hype, add a new gameplay style and more enjoyment - breaking up the monotonicity of the game so far. At the moment the game doesn’t really have any replay value.  

For example there are 2 main types of structure the 'square hut' with a roof and the 'shed' basically a lean to. I was disappointed to find out I couldn’t build a bridge over the water because of placement issues. The structures themselves could have a ton of different uses only limited by imagination.... and the devs.

Really hope this feature gets added/changed as it would be an amazing game as it is now with this change.

21,Green Hell,44515053,english,"Only played it for a few hours but I can honestly say: This game is frickin' AWESOME!!!

Combine these games together and you got this game:
- The Long Dark - Day One: Garry's Incident - The Forest - Fire Watch

Survival with dangerous elements like:
- fall damage - snake bites - leaches - hunger in a threeway (proteins, carbs and fats) - thirst - need for sleep - food poisioning - wild life (I met the Jaguar and died, there was no escape)

Explore:
- abandoned bases with useful stuff - meeting the locals (always ends in death for me so far) - finding different types of food but above all: clean drinking water

Crafting:
- getting equipment like a knife or an axe... - making a bed - making a shelter - making traps

This survival game is fun, even when you fail. The first part is the tutorial. I got myself in a situation with food poisioning and then the survival part kicks in with that one save, resulting me starting over and over and over with food poisioning when I died (failed) But that is okay.
Learning curve is present, not too complex but not like: ""Aha!"" but more like: ""Hmm... Okay..."" Catch my drift?

Controls are unadjustable but ""Early Access"" - I got used to it so, not a bad thing... Controlling your character is okay.
Beautiful graphics, surroundings, sound effects... I AM IN A JUNGLE!!! :D
It's non-liniear... Well the story is liniear I think, but the way how you get there is all upon you. And without knowledge about how to do things, or not yet because you have to learn it first or better said, unlock it, makes it a hard journey.

UPDATE: I learned how to trigger the SAVE POINT - very nice, just a shelter, you built that and you can sleep and save your progress (if there is any)

UPDATE: I learned how to get fresh drinking water: Collect rainwater with either a pan or use the coconut shells. It's not much, but if you have an area with over 50 coconut shells with fresh water to drink, I think it's a WIN WIN!

Oh the rattlesnakes man, I always react too late and I got the venom in me and died. This game is frickin' hardcore man!!! So for my first 2 hours of playing this game, I died out of dehydration and snake bites.

UPDATE: But after playing some more hours, I learned how to cure yourself from having a worm in your arm, you use a splinter of a bone (which you get after harvesting a bone), open your arm, get the worm out and then use a bandage on the wound.

Haven't learned yet how to cure myself from snakebites or foodpoisoning. I think you need to make a tea from certain herbs and plants, but haven't learned it yet so, I don't know...

The backpack is well organized, compartiments for tools, food, storage for other supplies... Very nicely done!

Now back to the knowledge: The note book / menu system. Everything is in there to have some control over things. Like crafting and inspecting your body for injuries, leaches (and removal of them), checking out recipes (if you have unlocked them, by getting some of the key resources) and eating. I still have a little trouble using that system, it is kinda weird, like I open my backpack and then I can inspect myself but have to close the backpack after accessing the inspection modus because it's overlapping some of the menu features.
Took me a while to figure out how to make the bandages, like the notebook gave me the recipe but it wasn't kickin' in. Then when I thought ""Ah fuck it, I am going to do something else"" then BOOM!! A notification that I just learned a recipe. Maybe it's only in the beginning that it's so slow, who knows.
But I am having a blast with this game, surely going to play more of it, it's nice and hard, challenging...

Oh another thing I should share which I was absolutely blown away: When you look at the ground, it's dry. When it rains, it becomes wet. Not right away, but you can see that the dirt is getting saturated with the rainwater. And when it stops raining, you see it drying up. The effect was absolutely awesome! I did not expected that! So much details.
Another detail: Fish in ponds. No generic thing, no loops, the fish is like (alive and sentient), so realistic!

The encounters with the locals was funny. One moment I am cursing away because I let myself become bitten again by a rattlesnake, I hear a man singing in my ears. VERY LOUD. AS IF HE WAS STANDING RIGHT BEHIND ME. But he wasn't, he was actually two stone throws away. I think on that part, this game needs some improvements there. Like I jumped almost from my chair when I heard that loud voice singing in my ear. And when I found him, I was dead because the singing guy was not friendly. And all in the sudden, I crave for chicken, because man oh man, that tribe person sounded like a chicken!!!

33,Green Hell,45223666,english,"i know, i know - why a review after ""only"" 10 hours in this game, i know .. but hear me out:

because those ten hours up until now are enough for the following review, which sets it off in the right way right from the start, if you ask me.
well - even for EA there's so much content already in this game it's astonishing - never had a problem with a major bug or something alike, here and there a missing texture for one or two seconds while doing stuff while holding a weapon .. but that's it really.
never had a crash or btd, so everthing runs fine with great and stable performance, no lags, not a single freeze.
the graphics are absolutely STUNNING (playing on >only< high, not even very high), never have i seen such a detail in textures in a game - it's just simply beautiful (except the falling rain that's not sooo good, but i hope this will get improved).
the roadmap looks very promising, the tutorial in the beginning makes you hungry for the story mode - definitely looking forward to coop down the line, gonna be great surviving together.

the only critique from me is that it needs to be balanced and/or nerved here and there - i. e. the healing time for injuries should be longer, so that you really have to be careful if you don't want to find yourself resting in your shelter for a good few days or that leeches should be more rare than they are now, but therefore a little more challenging to get rid of. also would like to see fractures in the game and generally a slightly more in-depth medical system would be awesome. food poisoning ist waaay too overkill at the moment, please balance that out - it's the only thing that killed me a few times by now in matter of a few hours of vomiting and not really having the chance to recover, more subtle and longer lasting with the same devastating effects would be nice - also if you could force yourself to vomit if you accidentally ate the wrong thing to prevent it altogether.

onward:
i'm pretty sure there's a lot planned in case of more (and hopefully lots more smaller and ambient) animals (monkeys pleaseeee!) and plants/fruits/vegetables, there should be a huge variety of different plants and animals (as the rainforest is known for) to provide you food, also the ability to grow your own ""crops"" could fit very well in my opinion.

the map as it is now is already gorgeous and huge, and it lets you feel that intensely while you're running through thick fog and forest with dense undergrowth, every corner of the map provides a new area to explore, and you constantly get the feeling of ""oh nice, i've never been here before"". and as seen in the roadmap there's an expansion or two planned in the future to make it even bigger - bloody amazing.
i really like the concept of unlocking new structures and ""devices"" to build only after you've found it somewhere else, i. e. in a camp of the indogenous people where you copy their technology - that's effing brilliant.
speaking of natives in the jungle, they should be way more rare and harder to beat, but at the same time not so aggressive and more hesitant to attack, maybe even working more through traps to harm you instead of straight up attacking you. i think i read something about more different tribes to be added in the future, really liking that - would be great if they had different ""personalities"" so that one tribe is more friendly towards you, even sharing food or letting you visit their camps, and others way more hostile, maybe even with war between the different tribes, there's so much possibility here it's amazing.
the AI is good (reminding me of The Forest), because it is unpredicatble and not to be carelessly messed with. they go through their own day, hunting, just roaming around or sitting together and singing, which makes for really creepy encounters when the only thing you hear in a jungle night is the natives singing very far in the distance, sends shivers down the body everytime - but if you attack them or get too close to them, they will get aggressive, either retreating and coming back with reinforcements or engaging you either with a bow or a more meele style weapons in closer engangements - that get's tougher the more there are of course, being nailed with arrows from a far while having to deal with one or two tribesmen up close makes things pretty messy and not too easy to deal with tbh. (the realistic amount of damage you can take plays out its full advantage in such a situation, you mustn't overestimate the amount of injuries you can handle, its not call of duty - thank god for that).
while we're at new ideas, maybe also for weapons - a blow pipe for example would fit very well, and you can have different projectiles, maybe with poison to shoot down monkeys from the trees or something like that. also to be able to steal from the tribes, weapons, food, etc. would fit in well.

oh wow .. so that went a bit far in terms of a review if you think about buying this game - sorry for that.

but maybe it IS more of a review hidden in there as it would seem .. because as obvious i'm very excited about this game and it's immense potential and hopefully bright future, and that is a review indeed i'd say.
so, should you try it? - absolutely yes, IF you are not hungry for immediate action and fast pace 24/7. as it is now - and it'll hopefully stay that way! - it is what it promises to be: a very unforgiving and harsh survival game, even on ""normal"" difficulty. there will be days where you're out exploring new territories and discovering new stuff or fighting a big angry cat or a group of tribesmen on patrol - and there will be days where you're just sorting out your inventory while sitting by the fire, collecting firewood, building and expanding your ""base"", collecting stones from the nearby river, hunting for lizards, birds or small game in the undergrowth of the rainforest, setting up different traps for animals, spearfishing in a clear-blue lagoon, collecting fruits and herbs, cooking your food, preserving the meat or chopping down trees of different sizes to provide ressources for everyday's life and death in the jungle.

It looks beautiful and they've really managed to capture a stunning rainforest look and feel. None of the survival mechanics I came across were revolutionary, but they were all smart and really well implemented. The Story mode also seems to hold genuine promise once the developers have properly added that to the game. 

I am writing this review for more casual survival players like me and the Story mode is currently only just a 30min taster of the final game though. And the Survival mode is punishingly difficult. As in, if you get bitten by a rattle snake early in a run, but don't have any access to the required meds, you're done for. I guess that's like real life eh... Certainly for more casual surivalists like myself I would recommend waiting until the full release with the Story mode completed.

My favorite base genre, in case anyone missed it, would be survival games. The setting and manner of which can be varied and even non-specific ...and sometimes are (aren't??) Anyways.. I tend to play a lot of survival games, or a lot of games in survival mode at least. Which lead me to this game and through digital devolution to writing my newest review.

GREEN HELL

This is in early release, but what they have so far, does not play as if it were early release (IMHO). They have creatively and thoughtfully incorporated a nice little tutorial for the game into what I can only describe as an introduction to the ""apparently"" very dramatic story mode to follow at some point before or at full release of the game. Personally, and I know I probably speak almost exclusively for myself here, I would rather see full story mode come out when the game is released in full, so the story does not get spoiled, watered down or even completely ruined by constant required wipe and replay due to bugs in world saves, and other such nasty things. So I like this game a lot with the short time I have been able to put into it so far. It has features that harken back to other well remembered survival games but this game is by no means unoriginal. There are features and genre twists that will really spark some debates in the forums I believe, but I won't go into any of that here. Instead, I have given you my unwanted opinions and now shall give you my pro's and con's so you can decide.

PRO's
* Best overall graphics for any survival game of 2018 (so far still get a few months left)
* If the tutorial/story intro is any indicator of what to expect then the story mode should be incredible!
* The various 'stats', 'states', 'levels' and 'conditions' that exist and need to be monitored add a very accomplished sense of realism to the survival aspect of this game.
* I will RE-review this game if it changes when I get further into it, but so far I am glad to see that it does not appear to turn into a BS game as you progress (BS means Bullet Survival .. Although I think disguising a single player FPS as a survival game is the other BS *lol*)
* This really is a beautiful game. The rainforest setting is done extremely well and not just from a visual standpoint. The ambience is at times distracting and unsettling or once in a while it will almost seem serene and peaceful.
* The realism, but not overstated or given the steroid treatment either. You can die of starvation and dehydration but in the rainforest there are as many ways to nourish your body as there are ways to lose the light of life in your eyes like blowing out a candle. Lions and tigers and bears, oh my! Well, no, but at some point you will encounter big cats, wild boars, I don't know if they are in this game or not (yet) but the Amazon does have bragging rights to one of the world's largest Crocodile species. I believe it is the Black Crocodile.

CON's
* I am no expert on snakes of the Amazon, but I always thought that most species down there were tree dwelling and there seem to be an inordinate number of rattlesnakes sitting in the middle of the trails. A whole lot of boars running around at random too. I never saw a single ape or monkey species nor single large cat. Now the big cats of the Amazon are rare to be sure, so not seeing one in the few hours i played is no great surprise. Monkeys on the other hand are everywhere down there. You have a better chance of throwing a rock and accidentally hitting a monkey than hitting a tree down there! Okay I may be exaggerating that point.
* Crafting system (IMHO) is FAR too easy. Resources are far too plentiful. On all difficulty levels.
* The tutorial was good and entertaining and educational and did what it was meant for very well, but if the STORY mode of the game continues on in the same ""Now go do this"" direction, then that will be way too linear for my tastes. I amn really hoping it will remain somewhat open.

I know this is a really short and somewhat limited review, especially coming from an old windbag like me, but this game is very much in early access so I have learned to give these dev's a fair bit of slack on their hard work when they are taking the risk of letting us opionated game junkies near their pet projects before they are done.

Overall, I recommend this game at this point for sure.

I looked it up the next week and couldn't stop watching videos on it - the following weekend I bought it. For the $23CAD I paid for it, it has INCREDIBLE entertainment value for it's price. I would HIGHLY recommend. I've heard people compare it to ""The Forest"" but more hardcore. The micromanaging is on point, and I can't peel myself away from the game. 
Once you get the learning curve, and without spoiling anything, and ""unlock"" everything currently available in the EA, it's easy to play the day away. 
Tell me where else you can spend $20-$25 for the amount of hours in entertainment you get out of this game. Highly recommended!

The graphics are really good, and I am not sure how big the EA Map is at all. But the parts I have seen are fun and make sense.
The tutorial ( which is really the intro / tutorial for the story mode ) is really well done. It does make you wonder where the story mode will go. 

Gameplay. That's where it's weird. It's a hard game. An amazingly fun hard game. I ve died several times in my limited play time so far. But then I figured out stuffz.  Now I know how it works pretty much, but that really only helps once you have basic things.  It's very easy to die in the jungle before you get some much needed basics going. Which is good. 
Other weirdness. It kind of wants to be scary even at this EA point, but it's not. Tho' it has an jungle based not pleased to see you tribe of people ( whom you can eat and craft stuffz from! ) it's not like the Forest at all. It's not scary either. Maybe it's just the girly side of me, but HUGE parts of the Forest creep me out. This does not creep me out. My only fears here are  being eaten by a wild animal if I dont defend myself well, which happens... Or being killed by one or two of these locals, which also happens. 

So overall, another survival genre game. Well done and makes sense both in the beginning and believable in survival mode. The enemy is not some weird creepies, but the actual environment and denizens both human and animal. The only drawback is it's another EA. So as always only time will tell if it's a winner.

For now tho'. It gets a Bushi likes!! If your into the survival, it's worth a try.

My goodness the environment is gorgeous. It is maddeningly missing a mouse sensitivity adjuster, and you're immediately forced to get used to their built-in mouse speed. There's also no control over the motion blur, so it may cause some people to get motion sickness. The learning curve would be hard, but the tutorial (part 1 of the story) made it simple to get the hang of everything in a fun way. The story was short (still in development), but fun. The inventory system is nice, using both weight requirements (or move slowly), and a physical space requirement within your backpack. The crafting is a lot like The Forest, and is easy. There are some more complicated crafting ideas (protein infused soups??) that were not apparent to me, like crafting improved bandages. Finding the bandage plant is sometimes hard, but when you find them you get enough supply. Fighting was basic, and again uses the same system/AI feeling as The Forest. The maggots in the wound thing was gross. The leeches are annoying. Catching toads with the silly stone trap was funny. Definitely needs more things to craft, which I assume there will be by the time they release the rest of the main story. Building things is identical to The Forest - you run out pick up logs/sticks and plop them in the transparant building until complete. I'm sure more complex buildings are coming. Find the lagoon with the waterfall, it was awesome. I experienced the majority of the game within 3 hours, and there's no reason to play again, unless I do one of the challenges, but I think I'd rather wait for the main story/campaign to come out.

1,Green Hell,44937742,english,"I am only going to focus on two points that set Green Hell apart from other survival games. First, the realism here is brilliant executed. This is most strongly reflected by things like examining your limbs to find injuries, water sources being divided into clean, unsafe and dirty, and how certain plants and mushrooms have to be cooked before being eaten or risk being poisoned. However, some of the tiny, realistic details are simply superb, stuff like: showing goosebumps on the characters skin in the morning when its cool; being able to harvest maggots or larvae from rotten meat or fruit; and how the leaves of some plants seem to have a slight transpancy when the sunlight shines on them. 

The second things that makes Green Hell stands apart from most survival games is how it creates an interesting dichotomy where the jungle is both your tormentor and your savior. Sarcity is a common theme in most survival games, but here water, food, and even medicine are easily acquired once you know how to obtained them. In other games this would trivialized the experiences, but here literally everything is trying to kill, infest, or eat you. It really embodies the Red Queen effect, where ""it takes all the running you can do, to keep in the same place."" This offers a much more dynamic feeling than found in most survival games and helps keep you on your toes even late game when you are decked out. So, if you are looking for a slow-burn survival game, you may want to look elsewhere. But, if you want to be bitten by a rattlesnack while running from a swarm of bees on your trip to collect herbs to treat your food poisoning, then this is the game for you.",1537910543,1537910543,TRUE,1,0,0.523809552,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,158,4,1944,0,1292,1575768945,,
2,Green Hell,44936574,english,"First I would preface this review by saying this is an Alpha and as such it's hardly done. And to be frank I would be very disappointed if it was. Despite some minor gameplay controls/schemes that take some getting used to and figuring out (IMO part of this games charm) it is very well put together and the development team is on the spot with updates and feedback frequently.

        I am just beginning to scratch the surface on this beautiful looking game and I can hardly wait to dig further. And when new content arrives I feel it could only enrich the whole experience. This game is not meant to be easy. You will die, probably many times to differing things. The key is learning and remembering and frustrating as it may be, soldiering on and trying again. Don't know what that unknown edible does? Only way to find out is to try eating it and be prepared to deal with the (possible) consequences. Crafting is intuitive and requires some items to be found in game before they can be 'unlocked'. The who and where is up to you to discover and the voice acting is top notch.

       The crafting is similar to The Forest but seems better somehow, more intuitive. And managing your health and wellness seems closer to The Long Dark, but with added complexity sewn into it by balancing macronutrients like proteins, carbs, fats and hydration. Eating a non-balanced diet will eventually lead to deficiencies that will have drastic consequences etc..

       The scenery is amazing and quite fully fleshed out. There will frequently be times where you may not be able to see ten feet in front of you due to the dense foliage. Listening is key as well, I recommend ample volume and your full attention you will not be disappointed. 
       Difficulty settings seem rightly set, and I would recommend your first couple of attempts be done on 'easy', which can be pretty unforgiving in it's own right, and you had best be prepared and set to take on the higher settings.

       Recently released roadmap indicates two player co-op is planned for the near future which I think would make this great game even better.

       If I had to list some cons, perhaps it would be little things, like how and in what one collects water from a river or pond. Since as of this writing you cannot fill a coconut half or a pot with water directly, you have to fill a canteen and then empty it into the respective containers. Tribesman AI seems pretty legit, though their pathing could use a little work in regards to some minor terrain features. Another would be the somewhat clunky feeling of the game's story intro/tutorial but I am sure it could be polished fairly easily and I look forward to exploring more of the story when it is add in full to the release.

       To sum up, all in all a pretty tasty game and a steal at $22.79 CAD. I am wary when it comes to EA titles I support now given several burns in the past. I am happy to say that when I took a chance on this one and dove in I had the same good feeling I had about 7 Days to Die back when it was new on the store (regardless how you feel it's aged and more recently etc.. fact remains that game was massively improved over it's initial release) and I was very pleased with how that game seemed to grow into it's own and become more than playable in it's own right.

5,Green Hell,44927281,english,"The first time I played this game I died at day 2 - I fell down a cliff, got bruises which got infected and died.
The next time I died was when I got stung by a scorpion and didn’t know how to fight the venom.
When I finally figured out what I need to do for the bandage I got bitten by a snake and then while searching for tobacco I got stung by TWO MORE.

I was so happy when I got to live to day 10 and … got THREE worms in single night and died of loss of sanity because I couldn’t get them out.

I’ve never been this happy to die so many times in a game. Why?

Because this time I die not because I can’t jump at the right time, or click something fast enough or just because I can’t kill a boss.

I die because I don’t know how to survive. With every gameplay, every death, I learn new things.
What to eat, what to avoid, how to not get eaten by a jaguar how to cook soup and how to not get worms. With every gameplay I know more and more about what to do first and where to go at the beginning.

I figured out how to manage my stats to know that at the end of the day I’ll still have enough energy to make a fire or a shelter. I figured out when to sleep and when to work and the trill when I figured out that the times when it’s darkest is when it’s right before dusk and right before dawn and that you can build or hunt perfectly fine at midnight cause the moon is high.

These are the reasons why I love the game, why I play. 
Because this is just early access and there will be more things I’ll get to learn as the game goes for the full release.
I know there will be updates where something happens and I’ll have no idea what to do and I’ll die.

9,Green Hell,44914396,english,"My first impressions were: ""Wowza, this is one lush environment!"", ""Wait, why does the frame rate get so choppy in the tent?"" and ""Oh great, how do I get rid of parasites?"". Despite some odd choppiness (1080p w/a 1080 GTX) issues and wildly swinging FPS (sometimes down to 35, settings on high and shadows on low), this game had enough to keep me engaged for the 50 hours I sunk into it. 

In the beginning, the game is daunting--every fruit and nut you find is ""unknown"" and you quickly get over your trepidation as the hunger meters deplete. Yes, I said ""meters"". In Green Hell, you'll have to manage thirst, carbs, fats, and proteins as well as sleep. After a couple brutal slogs, hopping from coconut to coconut, I finally realized I could throw rocks at snakes! But, then I got mauled by a jaguar. So it goes in the jungle, where every nap is followed by worm infestations and every stroll comes with a handful of unwanted passengers (leeches). You'll stumble into snakes (and get poisoned), walk over Goliath spiders (and get poisoned), get jabbed by scorpions in caves (and get poisoned) all the while desperately trying to cure dysentery from drinking river water...

And then, you read the Wiki. Green Hell provides zero help when it comes to identifying flora and fauna, and hands you an in-game notebook which is used only to track new crafting discoveries (objects, not food) that you bump into at various native camps and abandoned structures. Find a camp, kill the natives, learn how to make a smoker! Unfortunately, once you get the hang of the basics--edibles, tools and remedies--you'll quickly discover that 70% of the game's content is meaningless. 

There are several different flavors of axes and spears, for example, but there doesn't seem to be much variation in terms of damage output. Once you track down some obsidian, you'll render all other types moot. There are no stats for us number-crunchers associated with the various blades, axes, bows and spears, so you'll just end up picking obsidian and running with it. I was also bummed that you can't make obsidian+bamboo axes and spears. Bamboo is pretty. 

Food-wise, it's all about the magic of coconuts. Drink their juice, crack them apart for their meat (carbs & fats) and then wear the two shells like a bra and go traipsing around the jungle high on mushrooms! Or, drop them on the ground when it rains and gather rain water. Find enough coconuts (which are plentiful) and you'll have yourself one hell of a watering hole. The orange fruits are edible, so are bananas (obvs) and the little glowy/brown mushrooms. If you stay away from everything else, you'll be golden. Rattlesnakes are everywhere, and dumber than posts. Lob a rock at one and you'll see just how intimidating they are! After staring it down for a minute and realizing it's not going to attack you, chuck another rock and you have dinner.

The natives scared the hell out of me initially, with their happy-go-lucky tribal songs, but once you realize you can snipe them from a distance as they stand there scanning the horizon... Whatever. The jaguar, if you run into its awkwardly looping growl, is just about the only predator to be feared in Green Hell.

After 50 hours, I'd scoured the map and discovered all the crafting recipes but found that most of it was pretty useless. A set of 20 coconut shells laying on the ground was more effective at keeping me hydrated than a fancy water purifier and it rained more often than the purifier could purify. A basic campfire worked just as well as an elaborate one requiring 20 big stones, the small hut kept me just as cozy as the medium sized hut for 1/3 the materials, a smoker takes 12 hrs to smoke 4 pieces of meat that last 3 days when you can just BBQ on the go, and I tended to hole up at an abandoned fishing village which already sported a hammock! Ultimately, the mechanics need some tuning. All this stuff and no reason to use any of it made for a rather lackluster experience.

But, it's an early-access game! The atmospherics are gorgeous, but there are still numerous bugs being sorted out--the worst of which have to do with using the bow. Your arrow shows up as an item you can interact with while cocked in the bow, sometimes your arrows get oddly deflected by hit boxes that shouldn't be there, sometimes your bow entirely bugs out leaving white tracers in the air and sometimes you can't even load it despite having more arrows in your bag! Nevertheless, I had loads of fun mapping out the territory (oddly all in the SW quadrant of the map) and managing my coconut bowl farm.

1. Tone down the INSANITY factor. WAY DOWN !!!
2. Add a way to SAVE progress

Day 1: I arrive in Green Hell, gather sticks and stones and experiment with what I can craft early in the game. Eat a mushroom and puke my guts out, bit by snake, leaches on body..........dead!

Start again taking not what I did last time and this is what makes the game excellent. Unlike The Forest, all crafting is not necessarily given at the beginning. You either gain the knowledge through experiment or discovery; certain items are edible some aren't. Sure many people have posted online various ways of creating items but I found the discovery element frustrating and enjoyable. 

The graphics are excellent, especially catching sunrise and sunsets at the right viewpoints. I haven't discovered any in game issues as of yet but my expextations are managed by the fact it is early release. What the devs have to do now is maintain the hype by releasing the story and expanding the content of the survival mode,

As for multiplayer, I'm not a huge fan unless it is PvE. Nothing ruins a game more than PvP as it is never fair on those entering the game for the first time. As long as it is an option though then that would be the best way of managing all players requirements.

After a few updates and fixes, the devs have done a great job making this a supurb survival game.

I had spent the first 3 or so hours struggling hard, then the next 3 adjusting and learning alot of the rest of the features as well as slowly getting out of my comfort zone and exploring more, the final 3 were exploring the rest of the map, crafting everything I can, and killing off the hostile tribesman. I practically discovered everything within 9 hours, but it was easier for me when I started because I watched some Youtubers play. This game has ALOT of potential, what I would like to see out of the game is a far more vast world, by that I mean LARGE. This map felt large, at first, until I explored it corner to corner. By adding more craftables, more things to worry about, decreasing the spawn rates of natural resources (fruits, nuts, fish, scorpions, healing herbs, etc) would make this game far more realistic and dangerous, because I was able to stay in one location and just rely on the resources respawning after an in-game day or so. My only true complaint is that the indigenous tribe's camps are very meager, I felt like I had more than them, which I actually did. Also the damn worms, I literally dealt with 13 or more worms throughout my final playthrough and it got too repetitive and annoying. Anyways this is a fantastic game for those that love survival (especially a challenge), and for that love to explore nature-type of enviroments, this game will keep you on edge until your skills exceed a certian level. 8.5/10, with some touching up, this game can easily become 9.5 or 10/10.",1537588238,1537588399,TRUE,1,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,82,10,1523,0,588,1585000309,,

I think it is really easy to see that Creepy Jar is pushing updates foward according to the community feedback. Most minor bugs that i have seen and read about seem to get fixed every few days. 

As per the game itself:

Tropical forest survivor instinct will kick in. The Green Hell will not hold your hand and show you how to survive, at least not in the Pre Release. You will have a short tutorial that will basically show you how to start a fire. So until the update 1.0 is launched and hopefully you get to have a little bit more help on how to survive, you will be on your own. You will die....a lot. Until you realize what does what (other then if you go on google and just look tips and tricks). It was a real pain for me to even remain hydrated properly until i realized [spoiler]that you can drop a coconut shell on the ground and it will fill with fresh water when it gets rainy. [/spoiler] Or even dying from a fever because well.. you go to sleep with one and never wake up. This game made me rage. i felt like i was going no where restarting it over and over again after just a few minutes of survival but everytime just a few minute more...and more...and more. You come to discorver what to craft, where to go and places to avoid. you start understanding the terrain and the different way to adapt to the tropical forest. Needless to say, if you are someone that does not enjoy having to restart over and over again, you might want to wait for the full release of the game as the tutorial might help you a little bit more. 

Story wise: The story definitely captured me. even if we are talking about maybe 20min or gameplay, you get submerged really quickly. i was so thrown off when i saw the ""no story mode"" yet, but the tutorial makes me eger to see more. 

Incoming Co-Op? : Yes, they have announced an incoming Co-Op mode once the Story is fully optimized. No date or ETA avalaible at the moment but Creepy Jar is at first glance really involved in making the community happy, so i expect a Co-Op mode to come out sooner rather then later. 

Like i said, it will be frustrating at the begining. From hallutination due to insanity to digging worms out of your leg with a fish bone, this game has it all to please survival type gamers. It will make you cringe as you try all kind of ways to treat your wounds from sadistic to higly inteligent manners. 

All in all, this is an highly promiting game and one of the onlyy games i own that i will crack the shop page daily looking for updates and they come.... Often! So keep up the amazing work Creepy Jar. We are counting on you!

66,Green Hell,44773255,english,"I bought this game expecting a real good time. One of my friends had bought it and they hugely recommended it, so I thought, what the hell. 

Now let me just say- the game is great. At least, what they have. It was super fun while it lasted, the concepts were amazing, and it was pretty difficult, but not to the point where it makes you rage about how hard it is to find food. Graphics were amazing as well, and so was most of the sound. 

The problem with this game is the early access. I had read a lot of the reviews, and it seemed that there would be a lot of time for gameplay and it would be comepletely worth playing at least for 3 hours. This was just wrong to me. After buying the game and starting a new story, it took me 45 minutes to complete this tutorial story before saying that there would be more coming. I really thought I would get more story, and I was damn enjoying it too. There were a few problems where I couldn't hear the dialouge and the sound bugged out a bit, but still - I was having a ton of fun. When I got to the end of the story, it asked me if I wanted to play in survival, so I thought that might be pretty fun. 
I was wrong.
The survival difficulty amps it up a crap ton from the story mode - you actually need to find food (it's provided for you in the beginning of the story) and same with water, as all the water around you is dirty. From what I can tell, there are only a couple different ways to get water, and you have to figure out how to do it pretty fast. It's pretty hard, even though I had it on normal difficulty. It kind of reaches the point where you're like, ""Oh, would you look at that- I have to find some medicine for my 16 parasites, and my food poisoning. Great!"" and then you spend 30 minutes looking for this medicine and almost die in the process. 

I really can't wait for the full release or more updates to the story, and I would love to recommend this game, but I'm sorry- at the current spot this game is in I just can't recommend it. It just isn't worth my 20$ at the moment.",1537132401,1537132401,FALSE,5,7,0.440608352,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,16,2,183,0,69,1538857365,,

This is a proper survival game. The jungle is huge and pretty much everything in it is a threat. There is jaguars, leeches, parasites, natives and much more. Through the game you will also learn what you shouldn't eat, what you should eat and more.

The game is also very realistic.
For example when you have eaten a coconut. You can cut it in half and put the coconut on the ground. When it rains the coconuts will have water in them. So basically you can use coconut leftovers as a water supply. This for me is a good example of how dedicated the developers are to make the game as good and realistic as possible. There is also much more cool features like that, but you have to discover them yourselves. I recommend playing this game like you would IRL.
Imagine that you are in this jungle for real, and make your decisions from that. I find it more fun and satisfying that way.


Super hard
As a begginer I recommend starting the game on easy. You will most likely die very fast if you play it on normal or any higher. Start on easy, learn the games differnet mechanics and when you feel your'e up for a big challenge, PLAY NORMAL.
Don't get me wrong, easy is very hard but normal I would say is close to how it would be in real life.

 Being in early access it seems pretty polished except for the fact there is no story mode yet, however you get the tutorial that follows the story for about the first 20mins of gameplay.  Comparing it to another survival game like 'The Forest' it has it's own unique qualities that really work for Green Hell, making it not ""just another survival game."" 
 Gameplay wise this game shapes up to be what it wanted to be or even better in my opinion. So far the inventory and crafting system is simple and sweet, and it also brings a new feature in where you can inspect yourself (arms and legs) for infections or cuts to apply medical treatment to (crafting bandages for wounds, Collecting certain plants to treat you if you are poisoned etc.) The combat is exceptional from what I've played and seen so far, with blocking mechanics, enemy weak points, very well done hit/slash/stab etc. animations and responsiveness or hit registration is on point.

Gameplay- 9-10

-beautiful graphics
-interesting teaser of the story that will be coming out once the game is finished

-bugs (expected with the game being early access) such as the herb to cure fevers ends up causing the opposite. 
-losing health when being asleep (no fevers, diseases, etc.) didn't make sense to me.

3,Green Hell,44701614,english,"I loved this game for the first 2 or 3 days playing it. However, after figuring out the game mechanics and getting a home base set up the game becomes extremely boring. Water is very easy to collect with coconuts and fish is very plentiful and easy to catch. The big gerbil looking thing are very easy to kill for meat. I have crafted everything available. Items like the bamboo smoker and grill make loading up on food easy. I have explored all over and after you go to the known ""loot"" spots there is anything left to see really. The available loot like chips, juice, peanuts, and a rusty machete is pretty much all there is...like literally.... that’s it. 

The game is fantastic but after mastering the survival part and exploring for about a day....it leaves you without much to do and in the constant cycle of cook, eat, rain, drink, sleep, remove leech. A great start for an early access but anxious for more.

The success of this game greatly depends on how much it gets developed. The small preview of the story is fantastic, and I know that will make things interesting. I just hope the game comes to full release soon instead of later or never like a lot of early release games.

4,Green Hell,44699012,english,"Early Access Review: 
I wanted to take the time and leave a review. I'm currently at about 33 hours into the game and I did pay for the product. 
Disclaimer: From the point that the game was released I saw a lot of negative reviews and most of them had to do with folks who could not live more than a few days without going insane in the game not literally. 

I've seen many people cover the story so I won't. The tutorial that is driven through the first part of the story was plenty to help you get going. I found it enjoyable so far. Currently, I am on day 10 of survival. I've died many times by some of the following: getting rash and getting a fever and not handling it, mauled by a jaguar, killed by tribesman, rattlesnake bite and not treating the wound, and I went insane once before I knew how to remove worms. After dying to some cause you learn how to avoid that, and you live longer, and the process continues. 

I have a fairly decent system with a single GPU, and I have not experienced any issues with optimization or slow downs, etc which I saw some people describe in their negative reviews.

Pros: 
Nice graphics, with believable physics (not perfect physics)
The sounds are clear and everything can be determined what direction the sound is coming from
The controls are responsive and fairly easy to adapt to
The crafting system is fairly easy and kind of fun to discover recipes (though some require you to find something first)

Con:
There is a learning curve that may be too difficult for some players
There are currently still items that are not used in recipes
No Skins - I would like to see the use of the animal skins as harvestable and useable items in future recipes - currently if you kill a Jaguar, you only get bones, and meat. (Keep in mind that my animal harvesting is not very high and if this is already in the game than I will update this later)

Overall - I feel that this game is worth the $20, and while there is still a lot of room for improvement, just keep in mind this is Early Access.",1536763780,1536763780,TRUE,4,2,0.545454562,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,128,10,6033,0,4461,1586492998,,

Simply amazed at how good this is, especially for an EA.

This is my first review, probly noob, plz no bully.

PROs
+ Stunning(!!!) visuals. I'm playing with the graphics on high with a gtx1060, and the surrounds are GORGEOUS to take in. Sometimes I just stop and stare, it is impressive. Possibly the strongest feature of the game; it makes other survival games look ugly.
+ Immersive. Despite the occasional stutter, it runs smooth and truly draws you in. The surround sound helps give you this feeling alot with the constant jungle noises all around. There is the odd glitch (particularly when you pick up certain objects and drop them straight away), but overall, it is good. Very good imho for an EA.
+ Rewarding. Make no mistake, as many others have said it is a CHALLENGE. You will die. Alot. But that only makes it more of an achievement when you learn how to survive a bit longer next time, especially when you craft something new for the first time (like a spear). Pro tip, make coconuts your friend.

CONs
- The initial taste of story mode (which you must complete before you can have a crack at survival mode) is too short. I liked it, but it's over too quickly. 
- The female character is annoying. I couldn't help thinking she was a massive idiot for a reason all who play this game likely know. 10/10 would trade her in for native indian qt.
- Irritating radio interplay. Why do I have to press and hold 'T' EVERY TIME I WANNA TALK?!?! Just initiate the convo and let it roll more than two sentences, or better yet, give us the option to ignore the overconfident, foolish lass. I would lmao
- Difficult. I'll say that again, this game is difficult. Sometimes brutally so. Get ready to be pwned by the jungle repeatedly. While I learned to enjoy the challenge, another reviewer mentioned it seems impossible to survive longer than 3 days without going insane and/or dying - he may be right!
(edit - I've since figured out how to save the game and can now survive longer than 3 days. He was wrong).
Still, the whole point of the game is to struggle to survive by yourself in the Amazon, so.... It should be bloody hard. And it is.

25,Green Hell,44674899,english,"9-11-2018:
This game is what I wanted from The Forest or Stranded Deep, any survival game really.
No mutants, but real human natives (or halluzinations of them if your brain can't handle the jungle ^^).
Fair yet deadly puss', and if you're not carful running around or running away (which happens from time to time) a rattle noodle's biting you in your ankle; and if you're prepared you can even survive that!
And because the game doesn't want you to get bored and wants you to keep moving, you catch leeches and worms by the hour, which is - well - not boring.

I started and stayed on hard difficulty, which isn't too bad/hard after the 2nd day or as soon as you've build something to sleep and some shelter for your fire.
(Managed even to come back after I became a cannibal on the very first day! :D)
Just remember: everything can and wants to kill you.
You just have to kill it first! ;)

I haven't encountered many bugs or 'EA-stuff', only things like reaching a spot which leads into the void of pixels, catapulting myself into the air as I cut down some herbs, a second arrow on your bow, if you pick up stuff while your bow's equipped, from one moment to another a skewed GUI (however still working and everything visible and interactable), and the biggest bug/issue I had was, if you drag something out or in your inventory, holding the thing still on your cursor, but then close the inventory (either because you brainfart like me or get attacked and you panic), then the item's gone, vanished, poof...
Not so bad if it's a stick or rock, kinda bad if it's your last bandage or only anti venom... :/

Before I recap, just a few points/features I like, and some I don't
Like:
- looking on your body (or rather arms and legs) to look for and treat injuries/critters
- the (rather tame) leeches, cause even tho they don't hurt you, they can make you insane and stop you from health regen
- shots and thorws aren't spot on
- the whole experience mechanic
- going insane! :D
- bone marrow soup <3
- I'm only happy when it rains
- crossing fingers everytime I go to bed
- Murphy's Law

Not so like (nitpicks included ;P):
- inventory separeted in x-many food and material slots; can't pack the whole sack full with only foods or sticks etc
- can't pick uo stuff while carring logs or long sticks
- no No-HUD option (yet?)
- repawn timers too short (on hard difficulty)
- noodles and stingers always on the same place and too static
- honey not useable as ointment (yet?)
- bees live in a wasp nest...
- panther don't go for tapirs or capybaras instead if you cross them while you go (do not run! else puss thinks prey wants to play) for your live
- fish swim through rocks but spear can't go through rocks :(
- natives are m'kayin ninjas! they make absolutely no sound when they're closing in on you (tapir does; maybe too chubby)
- tobacco not a bandage itself, needs the yellow flower whatchamacallit
- unknown botany still unknown even after it's pretty well known 
- bit confusing to find out if you need to combine or 'harvest' to get the thing you want (took me forever to find out how to make bone needles, went for fish bone instead, or at least tried to)
- on that note, bone needels get consumed after you poke yourself a bit (kinda get fish bones, but bone needles?!)
- can't really build all the bamboo stuff everywhere (as long as you aren't a real trooper, who runs with bamboo logs upon logs from one end of the map to the other)
- nights too bright/torches unnecessary
- can't use barrels/jugs and other stuff from camps (yet?)
- can't carry weapons/tools in pack

But all on all, beautiful, cool and challenging game and the only downside for me now is, that after running around for 16h, there isn't too much more to see or do, yet.

The story is basically just a prologue and tutorial level at this point, so I'm really just reviewing the survival mode of the game.


PROS:

No zombies.

Great atmosphere, looks very nice.

You can save your game whenever you want, but only at shelters you've built. This is a nice middle ground.

Decently challenging as soon as you let one little thing get away from you (parasites, infections, lack of a macronutrient), but easy to keep it together if you're doing things carefully.

The world seems large, interesting, and mysterious. Despite being a trackless jungle, there are interesting landmarks you'll run across.


CONS:

Not well optimized yet (Unity, folks).

Sometimes the difficulty feels contrived (you really shouldn't need to eat a whole peccary, five bananas, and three coconuts every day to survive), but it's not so far off that it's ridiculous. This is hard to get right in a survival game anyway. If you made resources as scarce as they really would be, then you could get away with realistic food needs. But then the game could get more frustrating. Instead, they've made resources far more abundant than in reality, but along with that, made you require much more to survive as well.

It is not obvious what things you *can* do to survive. I'm not saying the game should tell you *what* to do, but if you don't somehow divine that you *can* make a medicinal mushroom soup in a coconut bowl or pick a worm out of your arm with a bone needle (which you have to make), how are you going to just guess to do those things? Maybe I missed a tutorial somewhere, but I occasionally had to look up the things it was possible to do in the game.

In Green Hell you basically start off with nothing but the clothes on your back. You have to live off of the forest to survive. In the beginning it is quite challenging (in a good way) to survive.

This game is amazing, after the short tutorial which will lead on to the main story when it comes out, you're put in an endless survival mode, even on easy it is dark souls hard if you try sprinting around and going at it like any other survival game.

Already the game has been updated to fix some very minor bugs, i never encountered these but others obviously have.
The games forums are full of nice and easy to talk to people who all have the same vision for the game and wants it to succeed.

Id much prefer to support upcoming indie devs than those so called AAA loot box in your face companies who charge £60 for half a game and £120 for the actual experience.

Trust me even in how early green hell is you will sink a good few hours in to the game, it doesnt hold your hand and every turn could be your last.

It took me all this time to finally catch a break and learn to walk not sprint and to stay alive for 12 days and still going strong.

Already people have put in some great ideas in to the wishlist forum and the devs are listening and paying very close attention to their playerbase.

Watch this game it will go further than the forest and I whole heartly believe we are in for one hell of a journey with these devs.

Not to mention the others I've played on other platforms, ect. I will tell you now though, if you go in thinking this game is like any other survival game, you're wrong. It may have similarities, specifically to The Forest, but this is by far the hardest survival game I've played, and it's far more realistic than any of the others, I've only played a few hours and I'm in love, from the first time I was mauled horribly and died, to the time that I slowly died looking for that damn yellow plant while I was gushing blood from removing worms from my arms, I have never enjoyed a survival game this much. This is... One of the only Steam reviews I've ever written, and thats because I do want to give a small warning to anyone wanting to purchase this, it does feel incomplete, and you will feel completely hopeless the first time you play. If you're willing to get past that, I could not recomend this game more, if you have the $20 and like survival games, give it a shot, I'm extemely excited to see where this game goes in the future.

Small list of complaints:
   -I feel like the yellow plant used to heal is a little to... impossible to find, but that could just be I've been looking in the wrong places
   -The leeches are a LITTLE too frequent, sometimes it feels ridiculous
   -Finally, moving things in the inventory can be a little bothersom, if something is in a stack it should be able to be moved 
     as a stack, or seperated, sitting there moving 5 leaves into the same place is very annoying and more time consuming

88,Green Hell,44605713,english,"I have enjoyed what this early access title offers. It is a survival game like many others with a few unique twists on mechnics and a fresh location. In its current state, even on hard, it is probably one of the easiest survival game I have played. I found that the only challege this game has right now is the first 10 min of a new game where you might struggle to find stone to craft something to chop trees before you encounter something life threatening. Once you get past that the amount of resources and respawn rate is so generous that there is no challege at all.

The lack of certain things such as not being able to access a map or use charcoal to make your own as you explore makes navigation and exploration of the map (which does seem to be a good size) difficult and many players might not venture out to all the unique locations they have created. I also don't know why they don't have temp and wetness apart of the mechanics, it would add some depth there. If you had a need to stay dry, craft clothes, stay warm or not get too hot would really add to the enviroment they have started on. I think the more soaked your character is the more of a sanity drain it should have, currently there is so many things that increase your sanity the only reason you would ever go insane is if it was intentional.

Overall a good game, and if you enjoy survival games I think this belongs in your collection.

He'd do well to find a stockpile of anti depressants, anti psychotics and anti anxiety pills, but so far all he's found are some pain pills and tobacco leaves.

After 23 hours of playtime i can say i enjoyed it, a lot. It looks really pretty, its immersive, and the first couple of rounds its hard to master. Though recommending it or not depends on the further development for me. I didnt have the sanity issues so many people are complaining about (just remove those leeches and worms asap and you'll be golden), but imho the game as it is now is hopefully only the backbone of much more to come. The amount of crafting recipes, plants and wildlife is really small, and now that i collected most of them and set up camp i'm very quickly running out of things to do. It IS early access, just crossing my fingers for many more things to come on all fronts: exploring, wildlife, plantlife, recipes, mechanics,....

Sadly jet ur only able to play the ""Tutorial"" but leaving on a high note i defenetly wanna play the story...
Some might say ""just a other survivalgame like the forest"" well sure there are parallels but this game has 
a serious damn high standart already considering its only a Early Access... there was no problems like crashes or major bugs that really destroyed the game^^ well done

+ amazing Graphics / really nice textures
+ unique ideas like ""checking ur body for wounds ect."" 
+ nice crafting system
+ high quality sounds
+ stable gameplay with barly any lags / not one crash till now

- considering the jaguar being a lethal hunter beeing able to onehit kill him with a spear is way too easy
- the small fire burns down waaaaay too fast... its like 7seconds
- me beeing retarded and not finding back to my shelter would love to have some kinda indicator

Im really looking forward to play this game from a-z... well done for now developers well done!!

Now I just wanna tell u how I died the first time in this game... it left me laughting for about 10 mins...
I was building the second shelter at a lovely place with a waterfall and lots of parrots... then i got trolled
by one of the parrots that bugged himself below some treetrunks that i cut befor and now were laying 
around. when i stepped on one of the logs trying to kill that parrot, that bastard flew up in the sky 
launching me with him in the air... the rainforest looks awesome from above but the landing was little 
too hard and i died hahahahah #instantkarma

Crafting menu was fixed within 3-4 days which I consider pretty good response time. The landscape of the game is beautiful but the game is quite the grind.

Might still wait for several mechanics, all minor, to get worked out but THE GAME WORKS.  I've played significantly buggier final games with no patches here now years later. 
My biggest gripe: some of the audio is laughable like it was purchased from stock made in the 60s (kill a snake or listen to the tribes talk).

TOO EARLY FOR ACCESS 
I’ll give it a few days before requesting a refund but at the moment I feel like I just gave a developer and interest free loan.
Probably the last early access game I buy into without a month or two under their belts.

It is unplayable for me at the moment. Not because I am a snob who expects AAA quality from an early access but because it is actually unplayable. Its' a crafting/survival game and I am unable to access the crafting menu so I quite litterally cannot play it.

33,Green Hell,44558569,english,"DECENT BUT STILL IN EARLY ACCESS.

Overview:
after playing it for a few hours to get a feel for it and test some of the mechanics you can already tell this game is heading in the right direction. the density of the jungle, the various forms of wildlife, the dangerous indiginous tribes, and lighting are all very immersive and keeping you on your toes. having to constantly keep up with food and water on top of trying to hunt for food, hoping not to become hunted yourself, is truly felt in this survival game. 

Crafting and Wildlife:
the crafting in the game is straightforward and intuitive for the more basic tools, such as a spear and axe. as you progress in finding other items, such as fruit and seeds, you initially have no understanding of what it is and more importantly what it will do to you if you consume it. this leads to a decent mechanic of risk vs. reward in the struggle for survival. the opertunity for expanding the crafting of new tools and items is open for the developers to create more, and it makes me excited to see what they will add in the future. 
animals have a similar feel as the fruits and seeds where you don't entirely know what is friendly and what is foe. every bush that russels and every step maid by an animal puts you on high alert.

Issues noticed:
the minimum specs. required to play the game are a bit low-balled. i am running with a 6-core at 3.6 ghz and a gtx 1080ti, had it set to 2k resolution and medium quality settings and my gpu temps were up to 70+ degrees celcius. i tried running the game at 4k resolution on medium quality but it caused the game to crash. i believe there is some optimization needed to make the game run a bit smoother. render distance was also a bit of an issue but not so bad considering the thick foliage, animals, and lighting the game has to render in so i'll give that part a slide since its in early release.

one other small issue noticed was the npc's would seem to travel on a set path, making it somewhat easy to avoid them if you were planning on staying around in the area for a long period of time. again, this should be resolved with a couple of updates from the developers.

Overall:
THIS GAME HAS SOME SERIOUS POTENTIAL, BUT BE A BIT PATIENT. if you have not bought it yet i would wait and see what the developers do in terms of updates and what direction they are taking this game in. there is no telling if the developers decide to add in a ""buy to survive"" system where you essentially have to pay money for extra survival equipment or something crazy like what EA has done, but that shouldn't happen hopefully. 

P.S.
if the developers are reading this, i found it kinda cool how you have the mechanic of NOT having a map but only a compass and lat/lon coordinates. essentially making you take down coordinates and create a map beside you while playing. that lead my curiosity into wanting to find out what was on the other side of the hill or down in a valley.

the only thing i would add is possibly a way to add wood and/or bone armor for protection against animals or aggressive tribe folk. can't wait to see what will be added next.",1536018417,1536018417,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,19,1,435,0,334,1539467396,,

*It's $20. Not $60

In it's current state, I find it to be a very fun game. It doesn't ""break the mold"" in any sense, but it's very beautiful, and the jungle is very nicely done. 

Most of the negative comments I've seen are from people that maybe don't understand how Early Access works or from people that can't run the game well.

Yes, it's unfinished. Yes, it needs better optimization, not everyone has a beast of a computer. 

The game is very niche. If you don't like hardcore survival games, this isn't the game for you.
If you love survival games and learning all the different ways a game offers for you to die, you'll enjoy this.

41,Green Hell,44549887,english,"I love this game even for an early access its fantastic.
The game is what the title says hell i servived three days on hard so i though i better lower the difficulty, even on normall its a challenge. This is a true survival game as allways you start in a random location with nothing except a back pack and note book with no contents in either but as you progress you unlock crafting recepies and learn differnet properties of plants and foods.

You need to find food, water and materials off all sorts from wood too leaves, meat too nuts and even lava (grubs).
i really enjoy having to keep track of carbs ,fats and proteins it adds more immersion than just being hungry so you eat anything also i love the fact that you know nothing and the only way to learn is trial and error (is that plant edible yes great what about this one nope now im sick and have no clue how to cure it) great stuff.
Different plants have thier own properties from crafting bandages to herbal remedies for different ailments such as rashes, snake bites and food poisoning to name a few.
water is abundant but its dirty or full of parasites but through using your head its actually really easy to get clean safe water. Some food is easy to get by hunting or foraging. but certain foods are a little harder to find. (canabalism is and option but dont ok just dont).

you can do the intro if you like and learn some basics wich i advise you do as it gives a starting point. or just go straight into survival and see how you get on.

Pros: [list]
[*] Beautiful game. I kept a fairly solid 45 FPS whilst enjoying the lush, green landscape.
[*] Very tense. Hearing tribal singing and chanting, or the snarl of a jaguar definitely had me on edge and made me turn right the f**k around.
[*] Very fun, although I didn't find it all that challenging.
[*] Variety of wildlife. The game features different fish, birds, spiders, scorpions, snakes, capybaras, armadillos, jaguars etc. 
[*] The voice acting in the tutorial was promising. I could tell that the voice actors weren't native English speakers but they did a really good job, sounded very professional.  

Cons: [list]
[*] In need of some balancing here and there. 
[*] There are a fair few bugs I came across. For example, I reloaded a game after my character was nearly dead from a fever and when I loaded into my previous save, my character was lying on his side and couldn't stand up. I was sliding around on the floor before I had to restard the game.
[*] No options, really. Can't change controls or things like draw distance, which is irritating when pushes are popping into view a few metres away. Also when i eat fruit from bushes and walk away, the fruit reappears visually but when I get closer it disappears.

I'm not going to comment on the lack of story because it's Early Access, obviously. Looking forward to seeing how it develops, however. The end of tutorial definitely had me in high hopes. :)",1535914201,1535914201,TRUE,1,2,0.476190478,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,95,17,1935,0,585,1594159189,,

But as usual the 'early access' pops out with bugs and a not finished feel.  
The game really lacks a total tutoral for the simulator it wants to be. it teaches you the raw basic's and then you're on your own and at this point it feels like a trial and error game.  
The game really feels like Stranded Deep and The Forest had a baby and this is what's popped out.  

Now while the game looks great , it lacks a lil bit too. i literally feel the game is trying to kill you from the second you load in. 
I personally hate the 4 sections of health.  
The eating mechanics are dumb , you need to take care of Fats - Carbs - Protiens - and hydration.  
I feel all it really needs is system of that of Stranded Deep.  Simple , hungry ? eat.  Thirsty ? Drink.   i spend more time hunting down everything i need to stay alive than playing the game .   

Is it worth a buy -----  No  - Not right now , wait a few months and see if content improves.

63,Green Hell,44533034,english,"""Green Hell"", a very promising Open World Survival Sim, like ""Stranded Deep"" and ""The Forest"". Was a real nice surprise-find, thanks to ""The Forest"" streamer Farket (thx m8!). Big thanks and best luck wishes to Creepy Jar!

The game gave me the exact same vibe as ""The Forest"" gave me, back when I purchased it early access in 2014; Quite a polished product for early access. The setting, Amazonian rainforest, is very well designed; looking both  beautiful & realistic. On the basic level, player movement & control resembles that of ""The Forest"". However, when you explore the player management features (crafting, inventory mgt, nourishment, healing), you'll quickly discover that the devs implemented some refreshing and well working ideas. Overall, the framework of the game as it is now; for sure a rock-solid foundation for a great game!  

+ The interaction between the player and the world is impressively realistic.
+ Realistic inventory, based on weight -and- a size limitations.
+ Interesting crafting system
+ Nourishment is not simply hunger and thirst, but based on 4 stats (Hydration, Fats, Carbohydrates & Proteins)
+ Many different types of ""harm"", that all require semi-realistic approaches to heal. Via a radial menu, you need to inspect your limbs, individually , for any affliction and deal with it appropriately. Example: a wound only needs a bandage, but it can quickly become infected, thus requiring an anti-septic bandage of sorts. And then there are leeches, bloat-flies, snakebites, etc. etc. Very interesting approach and (so far) balanced mechanics! (great concept! compliments for the devs!)
- Story wise, there is not that much (but more then I expected, given the fact the release was only recently)
- Enemy Hunter AI / behavior is a bit ""clunky"" as of yet

-/+There is quite a big chance that this game will follow the same development road as ""The Forest"", staying in early access for a longer time. This does not have to be an issue, as long as there are ~regular updates  that incrementally add new content. 
-/+ There is already a nice area to explore and get the feeling of the game setting. Fun Fact: as of yet, you can easily go out of bounds and inspect an ""under construction"" area of the map. Gives a hint of what can be expected with future releases! 

To conclude, for now; if you like ""Stranded Deep"" & ""The Forest"", have no doubt and add ""Green Hell"" to you library today. No matter what, a title that's worth it to add to your follow list!

THINGS I WOULD LIKE TO SEE ADDED: 
- A feature that allows you to mark your home base so that I would feel more confident venturing out into the outside world. 
-CRAFTABLE STORAGE (biggest thing)
-An easier way to learn more recipes. You essentially learn by trying out different items on your crafting menu.
-A little more common items to treat poison. Snakes are too common for these plants to be as uncommon as they are. 
-More carbs. 
-Some of these things may be abundant in other areas of the map, but I've hunkered down where I am in a dry cave with everything but carbs in abundance. 

Current state: 7.75/10 simply because there is little to teach us how to move throughout the game and the lack of the things mentioned above. If we are ranking early access games though, this game should be an 8.5 among them.

I went in to this game not keen on a storyline but wanted more after the mere 5 minute story (sneak peek), so I am looking forward to develpment of that aspect. 
As far as the survival mode (only current playable mode), it's a joke. You get thrown into the deep end with an unintuitive guide, some might hope that it will add to realism and your own knowledge of survival but its does not. You can't strip bark for kindling for example, you must find other preset means such as birds nests, which are few & far between. You can't sharpen sticks for primitive arrows, you need 2 feathers per arrow. The list goes on. 
If you're out of luck & can't meet ALL your macro requirements or start a fire, you'll inevitably go ""insane"". I almost immediately went insane after exploring on day 1 with fruit, coconuts, staying fully hydrated, nights sleep, 3 candy bars, a pack of chips, a day sleep, more fruit, coconuts & staying fully hydrated but yet proceeded to die from becoming insane.

I had high hopes for this game but I just cannot understand the reasoning behind this feature in such a realistic survival game, the tension ran high when I heard a jaguar & tarantulas crawling but it completely ruins the atmosphere when imaginary people kill you from becoming insane on day 2 & considering it's an intended feature I doubt it will change much.

Some interesting mechanics such as inspecting & healing yourself, and animations. Mechanics will hopefully all be fleshed out in the future.

Good Graphics

Great food/water system, as it addresses the different types of food a human actually needs to remain healthy.
Cons:
As of now, survival is impossible due to sanity system. I literally lose 20 sanity within 4 minutes despite founding shelter and fully satisfy my needs as well as remaining in the clear area. Only cooked meats and snacks give player sanity, which sucks because it makes finding fruits/nuts more of a burden than a benefit. When trying to hunt animals, you lose more sanity than you can gain from all of the meat you get. Also, sleeping a full 8 hours gives barely any sanity. In other words, players are bound to lose sanity and have to hold off hordes of natives i.e. which is impossible.
Stones....despite being one of the key material needed to survive there is a huge shortage of it, which is stupid considering that stone items have piss poor health.

 No matter how well you do in survival mode (post tutorial) you will go insane and die by day 2-3. This isn't early access it's a timed demo. I'm 100% aware of the risk of EA and I can afford the $19 expense but this isn't a game right now it's a 20-30 min experience. 

Just to verify it wasn't me overlooking something (after my 8th death by day 2) I even downloaded the trianer which gives access to dev controls so I set all levels (water, protiens, rest etc..) to 100%, no wounds or illness didn't do anything but gather wood and palm for about 20 mins making sure i didn't have leeches or any scratches, occasionally sitting by a fire to help sanity and still went insane and died. You can toggle everything in the trainer except sanity levels. Even GOD mode didn't stop insanity setting in so it seems hardwired. Even freezing time had no effect. 

Argue all you want about how being in a situation like that would be stressful, if the reality of the game currently is you can't survive for more than a couple days then what have we paid for? It makes gathering anything pointless. You're just as well off sitting on your butt where you spawn look at the scenery and letting the ""sanity timer"" run down.

20,Green Hell,44468718,english,"The graphics are quite good and I enjoy how thorough and complex the game is!

However, the inner gameplay tester in me is screaming about several things:
1) The difficulty seems VERY HIGH even on easy mode. I'm on my 7th attempt in survival mode and i have yet to make it past day two. It seems that ANY sort of infection or sickness beyond a common leach will kill your player in 2 hours or less (actual play time is about 6 minutes) leaving the player to desperately rush around to try to stay alive.
2) The controls feel a LITTLE clunky at times and require you to select either tool or materials in ver specific orders in order to achieve what you want. This could be smoothed out a little.
3) More could be done to explain what things are needed in order to survive. It's frustrating to get some condition and have no idea how to cure it. The notebook often does not provide enough information for the player to accurate figure out a cure to various ailments before they die... Either that or the spawn rate on said cures is too low.
4) The spawn rates on some items in the game have felt unnatural. I have had about 30 birds spawn around me and their noise was overwhelming. 

Now onto some positives!
1) The 'insanity' system is very cool! I was playing it at about 5am in a completely dark house when i started suffering from extreme insanity the first time and it was VERY creepy! I enjoyed it thoroughly how much it negatively affects gameplay!
2) Smooth transitions, nice environment and shadows, very real feel.

Short information about this game is that its based of the game ""The Forest"" but situated in the Amazon Rainforest (Chopping trees and fight off tribals) but with a twist where you have to do plenty of stuff just to survive all you learned from most survival game passes of to this game as a final chalenge with many addition from what the game it is based on including:
[list]
[*] Learning and memorizing various unknown plants and learn how to process them into something edible
[*] Get constrained by various invinsible enemies from amazon such as jungle fever, worm infection, and leeches
[*] Managing your nutrition which are split into: Carbs from plants, Protein from meat, and Fats from nuts and some fatty meat and failing to fill up those needs only makes it easier for you to get killed or infected. Things such as soup made out of bones can be a lifesaver.
[*] Drinking water just doesnt go as easy as ""Drink it from a stream"" everytime you desperately drank a natural source, you risks getting various aquatic diseases ranging from diarrhea, to parasitic infection, or even dysentry
[*] Those dangerous plants that would otherwise kill you, may become your allies in fighting those diseases once you learned how to process them
[*] You have to manage your stamina and fatigue, running around and hitting things will lead to exhaustion that can lead you to get weaker, which may even lead you to dying of hypothermia because you are too weak to even start a fire (Which who are new to this game might experience)
[*] You have to watch your step as there are many danger on the foot of the jungle waiting to get you ranging from jungle ants, wasps, piranhas, rattlesnakes, traps set by natives, big jungle cats, and bird-eating tarantula
[*] There are sanity checks that screams of voices from inside your head and trick you with optical illusion and schizoprenia. Losing your sanity is easy, but restoring it takes an acrobatic measure so you have to watch that too.
[*] Last to mention is that there are no zombies, but there are hostile natives with questionable intention but we haven't heard their stories yet.

The only gripe I have with this game is the performance. At any quality settings, I can see the game rendering textures as I walk. When I scroll, the game is choppy, and doesn't play smoothly. I tinkered with Nvidia settings a bit and nothing really made a difference. Perhaps motion blur or mouse smoothing can help this?

Intel i5-6600 3.3GHz
16GB DDR3 1866 RAM
Nvidia GTX 1060 6GB OC

36,Green Hell,44452721,english,"I would compare this game to The Long Dark in terms of how it's separated. You have the main story which is not available until full release. You have the survival mode which you are placed into the world to survive for as long as you can. It also has a challenges section where you can quickly jump into a game and complete the challenge you've chosen.

Survival mode in early access starts off by giving you a tutorial, or introduction of sorts to how the story mode is going to be played when it's fully released. From the brief introduction we've been given, it feels very similar to how firewatch is. The idea with talking on the radio, being given multiple options of things to say which will alter the response you get. The voice acting for this introduction is actually really good and professional sounding. This has me hyped for the full story mode release as I feel it's going to be great.

I believe I've traversed the majority of the game world and it's really nicely done. It's quite immersive and unique from every other game and they've done a great job in making it based on the Amazon Rainforest. I'm guessing that they will follow suit to The Forest and expand the game world throughout early access and make it much bigger. As far as the survival mode itself, it's fairly hardcore, in terms of obtaining supplies and keeping your necessities up such as food, hunger, protein, and so on. I do believe there's room for improvements and additions and I'm sure the developers will make the right changes.

Diving deeper into the other systems in the game, the medical system is really simple to use and is actually pretty cool. Again, could use some tweaks for balance and such, but it's really well done and different to other survival games. The crafting and building system is really simple to use and there's a good few items in-game as of now that you can discover to build. I'm sure they'll add more as they progress through early access. The inventory system is also very neat and easy to use, which is a huge plus for me. Every new thing you discover, plants, items, crafting receipes and such that you've discovered will show up on your notebook for future use. There's also a skill level section where you can view your current level in certain areas, like archery for example.

Yes the game does has it's issues, but it's early access. Every game in early access always has issues, and that's the point in developers putting their games through it. So we can get an early look into how the game plays and give our input on bugs and suggestions on how the final product should be. The developers at Creepy Jar seem really interested in what we say and I have no doubt that they will succeed in making this a great game.

This game has a lot of potential. I'd definitely recommend anyone interested in a unique and fun survival game to purchase this game and at least give it a shot.

There were not many animals, only a few small pig-like creatures, to which one of them threw a rock axe and it ran like nothing hahah.

but anyway. the game looks amazing. the tutorial part which is the beginning of the story was really cool. i enjoyed it and love that you have dialogue options to choose from. the end of the tutorial had me sad cause the story picked up and i really wanted to know what happened next but thats when it ends and your put into the survival aspect of the game. combat is a little tricky at the momment, when you try to stab the warriors with a spear they jump back every single time, so you gotta run up on them and get closer than what you would like to. currently the notebook is framed right for me, the text and pictures seems to be enlarged so it cuts off image and text and cant read what it says all the way, which is fine. cause again. literally day one of EA. bugs are expected. one thing that i would love to have is when you die, that it tells you how you died or all the things that were effecting your health. 
the survival is fun and always have you moving cause your character is constantly thirsty it seems like, but thanks to some good coconuts you can easily fill up on clean water.

I am all for early access games but for a 20 minute poor tutorial with little things to do for £15.49 seems a bit on the expensive side.

Seems rather strange as I've seen the pre-release videos from content creators who have managed to adjust it without an issue but this definitely needs work.

As for the game itself, at first glance its visually spectacular and immersive and the pre-story tutorial looks very intriguing to say the least, so I'm looking forward for that. In terms of general performance, all is well for myself, with it boasting good FPS and great performance so far.

Rain also ripples in the water and ground which is a nice effect. Gameplay wise, i found it somewhat difficult on normal. Especially trying to figure out how to remove fevers, parasites and venom from your system quickly before you die (i know once i figure out what materials, plants i need, it will be easier). You are also battleling your hydration waayyy to much. Seems to me like it runs out too quickly. But that doesnt mean the game isnt fun tho, because i enjoyed it. But one major problem i have tho is that the native hunter's voices are pretty dam loud. WIth a headset on, i almost shat myself when i heard one scream and chant in my left ear as i sat in a pitch black room as he chased me down lmao. Some other grunts your player does are loud. Especially the one at the beginning when he drops the crate of beans on the floor. At the moment, the only audio settings ive found are just a master volume slider.
