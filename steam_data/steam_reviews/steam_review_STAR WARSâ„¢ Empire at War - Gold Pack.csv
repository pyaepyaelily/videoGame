76,STARWARS Empireat War GoldPack,11368270,english,"The best Star Wars RTS ever and one of the best Star Wars game overall.  It also comes with [i]The Forces of Corruption[/i] Expansion. Great campaign, gameplay and space battles are particularly awesome.

The vanilla game is pretty fun (yes the graphics may not be the most impressive but the gameplay is still pretty fun).  In terms of audio, it sounds like a Star Wars game, enough said (the game makes the rather bold choice not to use too much of John Williams' soundtrack but the soundtrack is actually quite solid). 

In terms of gameplay itself, starting of simple,you have basic skirmish mode which is typical for most RTSs. Nothing too much to explain here. Where the game really shines is the Campaign and Galactic Conquest mode. 

For campaign, you pick either the Rebels or Empire (or in Forces of Corruption, the Zahn Consortium) and play through a story based campaign with objectives. It's essentially meant as a tutorial or beginner friendly Galactic Conquest mode but it's still great fun where you (for the Rebels and Empire) play basically from the founding of the Rebellion right up to the Battle of Yavin. 

The main Galactic Conquest mode is essentially the campaign but no hand holding and open ended. This is probably how you will spend most of your time playing the game. Like the campaign, it's split between the empire management and recruiting units on the Galactic map and then the remainder is spent fighting actual battles. 

In terms of the battles itself, the space battles are definitely more fun than ground with the ability to target capital ship subsystems, stop retreats into hyperspace (as the Empire), use ion cannons (as the rebels) and more. Ground isn't bad, it's just less fun compared to space. That being said, it hella satisfying bringing down 5 AT-ATs from orbit and setting them on the rebel base or watching Darth Vader tank an entire rebel army. 

Last but certainly not least, this game is pretty replayable as is but it would be criminal not to mention the fantastic modding community for this game which is still very active. With some mods literally turning the game into a new one from enhancements to the base game to changing the era or even universe of the game, there's plenty to do once you're done with vanilla. It's also pretty easy to install mods thanks to Steam Workshop.

This is an amazing game on it's own. A classic Petroglyph RTS from 2005. BUT- This game really shines in its community and modding groups. Pro tip for getting into those- READ THE FULL DESCRIPTIONS.

Don't ask questions that are already in the FAQ. that's a quick way of killing mod dev response times or just altogether kill community interaction. they wrote the description to help you. they don't owe you anything.

I have tried, but it's just never happened.

The Empire on the other hand is like a dream come true. You nearly cannot be stopped as the Empire. If you want to throw a ton of AT-ATs down at the Rebels, go right ahead, just beware of Snow Speeders. If you wanna dominate space battles with Darth Vader's Super Star Destroyer, go right ahead.

So, I've played empire at war for almost 100 hours so it's about time I do a review. I've only had for a small amount of time, but within that time, I've had a lot of fun! I received the game for approximately £5 so bare that in mind while reading this review. All of the modes were played in Single player, see further down for multiplayer review.

In case your not sure what Star Wars: Empire at War (and it's additional ""Forces of Corruption™"" content) is, it is a tactical space and ground battle game within the Star Wars galaxy. There's 3 mains modes.

The first mode is Campaign, where you either follow the harsh fist of the Galactic Empire, the hopeful revolt of the Rebellion or the fierce Criminal Underworld*, as you attempt to capture the galaxy against the powerful opposing forces; depending on your current team. You follow a (weak) story-line and follow orders to best achieve galactic conquest. They have some unique missions, such as the opening breakout for the Zann Consortium* or the attack on the pirate base with Boba Fett. But most of the story is just capturing as many planets with some story behind it. But overall a less demanding story-line can still be fun due to the extremely entertaining game play.
*All Zann Consortium References can only be accessed with additional content, already added within the Empire at War: Gold Pack.

The second, most common, mode is Galactic Conquest. Galactic conquest is the main means on the game and follows the same game play as the campaign and some key features of it is used in the third mode. Galactic Conquest is where you start of with a few planets owned by you, either the Empire, Rebellion or Zann Consortium; where'd you then build up your fleet and ground forces and set off into other planets, pillaging them and ruling over them. Once a new planet is captured you'd then use it to upgrade your fleet with better space stations, building mines (to create more money), or to add more variations of bases. This is only three things you can do among MANY other things. You'd then meet the Opposing side, also attempting to take over planets to create a stronger army. Where you'd then fight until only you stand and you are the only leader on the galaxy. Galactic Conquest does take a while to finish depending on the map but is highly replayable due to the many maps, different tactics and different sides you can use.

Unlike Galactic Conquest (GC)', the third mode, Skirmish is a lot shorter and can end between 7min-20min depending on skill level. Skirmish strictly takes the ground and space battles from them and makes them into a game mode within itself. Where you play against an AI in a 1v1 space or ground combat. For this review I will be using the Space Skirmish as an example but can easily be translated to ground combat (e.g. Space station = Base) . Each side has one space station and goes to find mines across the map to capture to gain an income, where you then spend it on upgrading your station, purchasing more troops to defend those mines or giving tech upgrades to make your side stronger in specific ways. Once your side is strong enough you can attack the other space station to win the match. It's a simple game mode that is amazing to play with or without friends!

Multiplayer Empire at War is EVEN better! You and your friends can all play together to fight against each other or AI in skirmish, 1v1 in an intense battle of Campaign or just mess around in the lobby. Multiplayer in Empire at War will keep you playing for weeks, months, (possibly) years longer! You don't even need to have steam friends, you can find constantly active lobbies in Multiplayer just waiting for you to join.

Beside from the default game, the strongest part of the game is not the game itself, but the mods. Mods are the biggest reason EAW has such an active player base. From Thrawn's Revenge to Republic at War, mods can keep you going for years. Mods are multiplayer friendly-ish (they can bug out occasionally) They are amazingly entertaining. They have two game modes to choose from, Skirmish and Conquest. Mods have new ships, new maps, new field commands and so much more! Due to there being a large modding community for Star Wars: Empire at War, there are lots of mods to choose from, and more coming out, even though this game is over a decade old.

Another amazing thing about Star Wars: Empire at War is that the base game is very low specs, you don't need a geforce PC, decked out with water cooling and LEDs that can power the hubble telescope, a laptop from 2006 works fine. (Tried and tested by yours truly.) Mods might get laggy depending on the quality of the entities. The main thing to look out for is the ""pop cap"" or population capacity. if the population capacity reaches too high on space battles the higher the chance it'll lag.

A Review of the Galactic Empire
The Galactic Empire is mine, and the majority of my friend's, favourite choice. it's amazing to see a star destroyer emerge out of hyperspace out of the dark vacuum of space, accompanied with 2 others as they deploy the tie fighters, bombers and interceptors to crush the rebellion. The empire starts of just like the rebels with an equal amount of planets (varying on which map you use). They have such unique ships as the Interdictor-class Star Destroyer capable of stopping the opposing forces from retreating or sending in reinforcements. The other unique space vessel they have is, of course, the Death Star. Capable of destroying any space station, ship or planet with a single blow. So the power of the Empire can get to your head, but it's fun, and generally the easiest team to get a grip on.

A Review of the Rebel Alliance
The Rebel Alliance is a lot more self controlled compared to the Empire's way of conquering. While the Empire has large destroyers capable of carrying how many tie fighters, The rebel alliance has to purchase each squadron separately allowing you to control the amount of forces going into one area at once. The rebels are generally a lot weaker than the empire, but with the use of the many heroes given to you early game, such as Luke Skywalker or Han Solo, you are able to conquer the skies, but are more even on the ground, still needing support from heroes, that easily sway the tides of battles. They also have the ability to scout ahead using C3-PO and R2-D2 and steal blueprints for more ships and tech upgrades among other things. The rebels are harder to understand but can be used effectively in certain situations if used correctly.

A Review of the Criminal Underworld/Zann Consortium
I know a lot less about them but have recently used them in preparation for this review and also because i was bored. The main strength of the Underworld is that they have the ability to make planets corrupt, allowing them to create an income off other planets including the opposing force(s). If they would like to go around a planet to invade someone. They would have to corrupt the blocking planet, then bribe them to pass through. They also have powerful ships that can deal lots of damage but work best in numbers.

In conclusion, this is one of the best star wars game to date and is worth getting if it's on sale, I feel as if £15.49 (or what ever currency it is for you) is too much, but if you like space, tactics and star wars then get this as soon as you have the money! I can't recommend this enough. I've literally written this huge review for it due to my love and respect for a game made in 2006. And you've got to realise, there's gotta be a reason it's worth this much money (that's still not that much) for a game almost 15 years old. (by the time I'm writing this)

TL;DR: This game is really fun in single player and multiplayer and the mods are perfect to change the entire experience. Also game = very good.

Amazing game. Get the Thrawn's Revenge mod from the workshop if you want a modern star wars strategy game. I have hit 200 hours in a little over 2 months of playing on and off, and I will probably hit 1000 sometime next year. I can't get enough, and the team behind Thrawn's Revenge are completely overhauling the mod constantly to make it extremely fun to play consistently. 

The campaign is amazing in TR. It is much more complex than the base game campaign, while not being too complicated that new players might be put off. This is my first ever strategy game, and I immediately got into it and understood the gameplay and mechanics. Very easy to learn, and very rewarding to master. 

The skirmish mode is great as well. Me and my friends have put dozens of hours into playing skirmish mode together against each other and against bots. It is a very fun experience overall. The only problem is many maps from TR will cause the entire lobby to get a desynchronization error and make you restart your entire match. With some people, I will play 90% of games with no problems, but some friends I cannot even play a full match without being desynced. If you are having desync problems, try Bespin or Shameless Ad. Those usually do not cause many problems for me. 

I cannot recommend this game enough.",1597612205,1597612205,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,85,1,16771,1671,12089,1601947639

17,STARWARS Empireat War GoldPack,74401744,english,"Truly an amazing game. Here's how I think of it.

Graphics: 7/10 
The graphics can be changed with certain mods such as Empire at War Remake: Galactic Civil War (highly recommend this mod) but overall in the vanilla version, graphics are pretty average for 2006. The graphics almost remind me of Age of Mythology.

Space Gameplay: 10/10
Space gameplay is simply amazing, best thing in the game. I can't define how spectacular the battles are when a star destroyer goes up against an MC-80 or a massive group of TIEs against a bunch of X-Wings. The only thing that I might change is the population limit, it's kind of small.

Land Gameplay: 6/10
For a game that is solely based on Space-to-land combat, they require more emphasis on land battles for sure. Land battles are very average for a game and don't really do anything different. The major problem is that you can't place buildings ANYWHERE on the map except where they are already made (or where the turret pads are). I never really do land battles because of these reasons.

Music/Sound: 10/10
Sounds are pretty standard, but the scores are incredible! The theme of the Zann Consortium is simply incredible in the expansion. The rest of the sound is pretty well done for the age of the game, but the dialogue in the campaign is a bit off.

Story: 9/10
The story of the game is a bit basic in the campaign, nothing special. However, the gameplay and timings throughout the story are good. I wouldn't consider this game to be a story game at all.


Overall, I would absolutely recommend this game, the space battles outweigh everything else. My favorite game to date.

The build limit for the player in combat can be annoying on land and in space. The enemy can overwhelm in sheer numbers and you can never deploy at the full force. You can only send smaller waves of reinforcements when units are destroyed. Yeah some immersion game breaking logic for sure, but seeing all the Star Wars stuff in action is cool.

Empire at War is a good game, it's fun. I was initially intimidated by all the descriptions so I turned it away and didn't look back for around a year. Biggest fucking mistake right there, after watching some people play EaW I eventually got into it and boy was i pleased.

While the Graphics are clearly dated, the modding community (like alot of modding communities) attempt to fix the present game's short-comings. For example, the Empire at War remake overhauls the game's visuals and make it seem modern and fresh again.

But honestly if you are a hardcore Legends fan or even just a Legends fan in general- you are likely a big nerd in Space Warfare and I gotta say, a modded EaW definitely scratches that itch.

Star Wars: Empire at War is a RTS which places you in full scale galactic combat. You can try comply with the plot of the films, and bring the republic to their knees, or you can become the empire and stretch your cruel and oppressive regime galaxy-wide. Or, better yet, you can use the Forces of Corruption DLC to put yourself in the shoes of a edgy pirate whose troops are definitely not wildly overpowered. Every day- Ingame, this isn't EA- credits are added to your balance. You can use it to fortify planets or build both space and land troops to continue conquering.

The battles are diverse as well, dozens of different maps with strategic gameplay elements and ability for your ships which can turn the tide of battle. The battles still remain fresh for me, even after countless hundreds of hours. And, while the AI can make extremely faulty calls, at times, it is still fun to play against if you have no friends. Also, like me. The ships are well balanced, and you can try to strategically siege the enemy's weakpoints, or you can build an army of 75 x-wing squadrons and outpace the enemy at the cost of only loyal citizens lives.

[b]10 / 10[/b]
[i]Would buy again, multiple times over.[/i]

Empire at War is a unique twist on the RTS genre that incorporates many beloved features found in other classic Star Wars games. It takes place in the original Star Wars Expanded Universe continuity canon, what more can I say.

[i]Pros and Cons at the bottom[/i]

The galactic conquest mode can be a relaxing empire builder at easier difficulties. Against harder opponents however, it can be grueling and last for days, requiring quick planning and proper strategies as you fight to dominate the galaxy and eliminate your opponent.

Its skirmish mode is faster paced and focused on strategical map awareness. Even against all odds, the tides can turn easily with implementation of wiser strategies and level thinking.

The expansion, Forces of Corruption adds a criminal faction with a neat feature called corruption. Some may find it annoying to face this faction in multiplayer, but I like it. It adds another layer of strategy to the game.

I remember playing it and modding it well before I had Steam and still play it to this day.
Some of my fondest memories with it are of sitting down and having a tense galactic conquest match with a friend over the better portion of a day.

With a very active modding community this game has many possibilities for different play styles and strategies. It is a very easy game to tweak with the excellent use of XML files if you want to have your own hand at it or further customize an existing mod to you and your friends' liking in multiplayer.

[b]Pros:[/b]
-Inexpensive
-Engaging gameplay
-Lots of mods
-Active multiplayer
-Strategy matters
-Great addition to the EU lore

[b]Cons:[/b]
-Unfortunate game breaking multiplayer de-syncs occasionally, as with many other RTS games, this is a possibility.
-Poor performance in bigger Conquests for multi core machines. There are workarounds, and good single core performance helps.

[b]Tips:[/b]
-Run in windowed mode
-Don't Alt-Tab while loading anything
-For multi core processors, use task manager to make game run in real time (priority) on a single core (affinity)
-save often (every 5 to 15 minutes) for long multiplayer matches in case of de-sync

96,STARWARS Empireat War GoldPack,73054889,english,"Empire At War is one of those games where you can truly have fun whilst being challenged strategically.

 Single Player alone allows for a large variety of gameplay that can easily take up hours (even days) of time, in this game that is in no way bad I assure you. 
Even against the AI at its easiest, a strong challenge is presented. Since playing the game, I myself have become much better versed in both Space and Land combat strategy. 

I have not yet experienced Multiplayer in this game, so I cannot comment on it. However, if the game handles anything like how it does in Single Player then I have very little doubt that you would have an amazing time.

I bought this game during the May 4th Star Wars sale so I am much more inclined to feel that what I got was worth the money, but after experiencing the game I would be just as willing to pay the standard full price of the game. 

In terms of the Steam Workshop, mods such as Thrawn's Revenge and Fall of The Republic offer a much more diverse experience as opposed to the limitations of the base game which only provides The Galactic Civil War Era (but is in no way any less fun I assure you) 

Fall of The Republic: Adds an amazing Clone Wars based experience to the game and is completely free. It adds its own unit variants and acts as its own separate game in the subsection Forces of Corruption. I have very little experience in downloading mods but the process for Fall of The Republic through using Steam Workshop was extremely easy and I recommend it. It does take its toll in term of CPU (Central Processing Unit) loads and If you don't have a gaming PC then definitely stick to the smaller scale battles. 

Thrawn's Revenge: Does not add AS much but is certainly worth the download regardless, it doesn't take as big of a toll on the CPU as Fall of The Republic and is no less fun. It adds a much more immersive experience onto the base game (still using Forces of Corruption).

Overall if I were to give this game a rating out of 10 parsecs
9/10
The reason it isn't an initial 10/10 is because the base game does not come with Clone Wars content, but with Fall of The Republic added on it is an immediate 10.

I've got hundreds and hundreds of hours in this game. I would love a modern remaster, but the game still does hold up pretty well. It suffers a bit from the same issues most early 3D RTS games suffer from, like weird pathing issues, bad AI, and slow pace compared to direct predecessors like CnC and Starcraft. But it's certainly worth playing in singleplayer.

Multiplayer is a completely different story. The game is not balanced, and I question if it was ever intended to be. Each faction has something that they're overwhelmingly good at doing, and it makes multiplayer games completely not fun. They went for a Starcraft-inspired asymmetrical system with the three factions, but, in my opinion, failed miserably. I tried finding a mod that would help deal with balance issues, but was unsuccessful.

I doubt this'll ever get remastered, but it's definitely a dream of mine. Update the engine and rebalance everything, and you'll have a perfect 10/10.

78,STARWARS Empireat War GoldPack,72097460,english,"Star Wars is a franchise that lends itself to many genres due to its content and themes. Real Time Strategy seems like a natural fit, after all it has War in the name and RTS games tend to focus around conflict. However we have something truly special with this game, in fact I’ve come to love many other RTS games over the years but none have ever replaced this game as my absolute favorite RTS.

This game by default has two diverse and unique factions with a third added on later as DLC forming a truly unique trinity of gameplay with each group bringing their own playstyle and mechanics. Each team has unique hero’s and units and technology to make them feel grounded in the Star Wars universe but also balanced in regards to gameplay.

The foucus for the game is essentially controlling the vast Star Wars universe and all your favorite planets are included for you to conquer, liberate or extort. Controlling hyperlanes and systems to gain resources to help you expand your factions dominance across the stars.

Invading a planet consist of two phases the first being space combat. This is the most enjoyable aspect of the game by far. You’ll never grow tired of bringing a star Destroyer out from hyper space to attack an enemy fleet or watching X-Wings fly in formation to intercept Tie Fighters so your Y-Wings can pull off a bombing run on an imperial cruiser. It really captures the feeling of the Star Wars universe and it’s truly enjoyable to engage in combat with other ships as your target individual components on them from Engines to Hanger Bays to disrupt the enemy in different ways.

The second phase is ground battle which for most hasn’t been the most enjoyable when compared to the games space battles but I think it’s truly an enjoyable part of the experience, each battlefield is unique and designed around the planet you are invading or defending and offers everything from difficult terrain or maybe native inhabitants to help or fight against you. Slowly conquer different command points to call in reinforcements and secure the area entirely. The unites like with space range and differe with each faction bringing different gameplay mechanics and strategies to the player.

Both of these phases also allow you to enjoy everything in a cinematic mode that mimics the films so you can enjoy your AT-ATs as they stomp around planet side or maybe get a good look at Boba Fett’s Slave 1 unleashing a Sonic Imploder into a group of A-Wings, so satisfying by the way.

Different campaigns add more of a narrative drive experience while Galactic Conquest is your Sand-Box to the Star Wars galaxy. 

Couple all that with the sound design of an E-11 or AT-ST walking around with the beautiful Star Wars Score we have come to love and you really have yourself a complete package for not only one of the best RTS games Avalible but also one of the best Star Wars Games ever made.

All in all it’s a fantastic game with a great community that loves and supports it. Some Mods for this game completely change it into a Clone Wars game and some just add more units to enhance the experience, the range is very impressive and shows just how much the community enjoys this game.

If you love Star Wars and RTS games you have no reason not to own this game.

28,STARWARS Empireat War GoldPack,71979681,english,"This is easily one of my favorite Star Wars games, and games in general. Great graphics, although they are a bit dated after all this time. The game play really makes me feel like I'm in one of those movies. The units are great, as are the special abilities for units. Taking control of planets in space and land give you the ability to build Space Stations (in space obviously), as well as ground structures. These allow you to build individual units on each planet. The more planets you hold, the stronger you get, and the more units you can make (there's a unit cap, which I HATE). 

You can control some of your favorite SW characters in battle, from Luke and Han, to Vader and The Emperor. Each with their own special abilities. 

The addition of The Zann Consoritum in the Forces Of Corruption expansion allows you to build all new ships, production buildings (ground) and units.

Now for the bad part. The Zann Consortium is EXTREMELY OVERPOWERED! I mean it's just absurd. They have units called ""Defilers"" corrupt planets, Corrupting a planet gives you certain bonuses, such as providing a one time bonus to credits, access to bonus units, etc. But the thing that REALLY bugs me, is that after Zann has corrupted a planet, they can send a Defiler to blow up your ground buildings. And they can create as many as they want, as fast as they want, and just keep doing this over and over. Now, you CAN use certain units of your own to REMOVE the corruption. But sometimes that has consequences. One mode of corruption is called ""Corrupt Militia"", which is fine in itself, BUT, if you use your unit to ""Remove Corruption"", it causes ALL YOUR UNITS to vacate the planet. That being said, there are only a few planets where that is an option, and if you're quick, you can just put troops back on the planet, and in orbit, to reclaim it. But you still lose all your ground base buildings that you've built, and your space station. Which then have to be rebuilt. But keep in mind, there is NO COOL DOWN on the production of Defilers, if they can afford it, they can pump them out like clones. No other faction has the ability to corrupt, or to blow up ground buildings. Which makes Zann Consortium EXTREMELY OP'd. 

Well, despite all that, I still love the game. Although If you want to play as Empire or Rebellion, I'd suggest playing the BASE GAME, not the expansion. But the base game is missing a number of units that Forces Of Corruption has, for the Rebels and Empire. Hope this helps you decided whether to buy this, this is my first review on Steam, so I tried to put as much into it as I could think of.

It's truly amazing how modders are still active and keep the game feeling fresh, most notably Thrawn's Revenge, Fall of the Republic, Republic at War, Awakening of the Rebellion , ReMake etc. 

As an old game, it has faults too. This game was optimized for single core CPUs and as such it is not optimized for multithreaded CPUs and it can run pretty badly occasionally, but most of the time it runs great. Vanilla EaW and FoC are imo worth playing only if you wish to run through the campaigns, which are fun (despite Zann campaign being a bit annoying at some parts, lore and gameplay -wise). After that, pick your favourite Star Wars era, download a mod for it and game on

PS. Old school EaW players remember the save game bug which caused you not being able to save, amazingly that was fixed by a dev patch 11 years after release in 2017, which also restored multiplayer.

88,STARWARS Empireat War GoldPack,71668825,english,"Positives:
Base building on the planets from the star wars series is fun.  The expansion pack gives a bit more customization options and I enjoy that.
Star wars (duh)
Each faction plays very different from one another (rebels vs empire vs zann consortium)
Galactic conquest is a fun experience and a rather simplistic version of games such as Stellaris and other 4x strategy
Skirmish is a good time if you have friends that also have the game.  The base building mechanics in space and land are unique in skirmish vs conquest
Natives on each of the planets provide a unique twist to encounters

Negatives:
Balancing issues - Zann consortium is overpowered at times and very annoying
Graphics definitely feel a little dated now, but it runs great

Summary: Fantastic game if you're a fan of star wars, battles, and base building.  For instance, if you enjoy games such as Total War, Civ, Stellaris + Star Wars, this is an easy purchase.  It's a bit dated now but it is probably the best star wars game I've played outside of Knights of the Old Republic.

P.s. my steam hours on this game do not represent the time I spent on this game wayyyy back in the day (we're talking hundreds if not thousands of hours)

Old game, but still popular with over 1k generally playing it at all times on the evenings. Probably because there really ain't any official new Star Wars RTS on the market, and definitely not any as good. 

Disney's management of Star Wars is questionable (they are garbage imo, or rather EA is garbage since we are talking about games here), but I respect the revival of BFII and EaW multiplayer a lot. If you didn't know, they released a update to fix the broken multiplayer function caused by Gamespy closing about a year ago. A wonderful thing, and they added Steam Workshop which allows easy access to mods which this game is not short of. Previously Moddb was the main site for mods and still is very active. Due to this revival I do have -one small amount of respect for Disney, and I hold Petroyglyph in high regard and sincerely hope they get to make a new ""EaW II"" some day which they have showed interest in.

The game
A extremely fun SW RTS game with no equal. The graphics may not be up to today's standards but the gameplay is as good as ever. Fight battles on land and space. Either in small single-game skirmishes, or in the Galactic Conquest where you fight over the entire (or a part) of the Galaxy with or without other objectives and goals. The game also comes with 3 campaigns: Empire, Rebels and Connsortium. The third only being in FoC, so you can't start the Empire or Rebel compaign in FoC. Likewise you cant start the Connsortium campaign in EaW.  

The units are fun and you can find most of the vehicles and troops found in the original trilogy with other fun additions for a even larger amount of variety, balance and enjoyment. Rebel/Stormtrooper infantry, AT-ATs, AT-STs, Speeders, Hoovercraft, Snow Speeders and of course Hero units. Equiped with unique abilities, enhanced weapons or even lightsabers and the force. How, or if to use these is entirely up to you.

Mods
I mentioned mods earlier and here are 2 mods I personally enjoy and hold in high esteem.

36,STARWARS Empireat War GoldPack,34876424,english,"I'm blown away that the support for this amazing game has returned. This is not only one of the best stratagy games I've ever played, its also the only game I know of that allows RTS combat in both space born engagements and land engagements. Not to mention it has a pretty good campaign in both the DLC (which is more or less a totaly new game) Forces of Corruption, and the base game Empire at War. The Forces of Corruption DLC campaign follows the story of Tybr Zann a underworld consortium leader and Empire at War, the story of the Rebellion through episodes 4 to 6 (and a bit before episode 4). 

TLDR : Its a fantastic game that now has mutliplayer and workshop mods. Its totally worth the price and I own both the actual box set from 2008 and the steam version. I have sunk countless hours into the base game and more than I wish to admit into the countless mods produced by the community.

This is one of if not the best scifi RTS ever created.

Only titans like Supreme Commander and Starcraft can even come close to how invested this community is in the game.

Its a game thats grown to be maintained by it's own fans, just like Supreme Commander and the love for it shows.

System by system, build up your infrastructure, planetary forces, and space forces. Easy to pick up and highly replayable. [/h1]

[h1] Galactic Conquest [/h1]
Central to the Empire At War experience, Galactic Conquest is all about expanding your influence throughout the galaxy. Choose from several Galactic Conquest scenarios, tweak the settings to your liking, and hop right in. Core gameplay then revolves around upgrading your systems in the form of space and planetary structures, building up your forces, and attacking/defending systems. Each faction has its own pool of unique units with their own strengths and weaknesses, with factions unlocking more powerful units as a session progresses through the acquisition of technology.

When two opposing forces meet in the space of a system or on the planet of a system, a battle occurs. Battles are tactical in nature and pit you and whatever units you brought with you against whatever the enemy has on hand. When battling on planets, you will vie over strategic points across the landscape that increase the maximum units you can have at once when captured, as well as resource points. If you are defending, you must defeat the enemy and protect your structures. If you are attacking, you must defeat the enemy and destroy their structures. Battles in space typically offer more freedom of movement for obvious reasons (though also featuring their own unique ""terrain"" in the form of asteroid fields and nebulae). Just like planetary battles, you must defeat the enemy while also attacking/defending structures and resource points.

[h1] Skirmish [/h1]
Skirmish allows you to engage in singular battles of your specification. Choose from numerous battle maps of the planetary and space variety, tweak the settings to your liking, choose a faction, and have at it. Each faction starts with an approximately equal advantage and has access to essentially every unit and technology in the game.

[h1] Accessibility [/h1]
Empire At War strikes a dashing balance between simplicity and complexity that many grand strategy games fail to accomplish. The UI is not overwhelming nor are the statistics overbearing. Empire At War is easy to pick up, but offers a surprising amount of depth for those seeking true mastery of the game.

Multiplayer is supported for both Galactic Conquest and Skirmish.

13,STARWARS Empireat War GoldPack,70806696,english,"Been playing this game for years and its very easy to get the hang off but difficult to master. Balance between the three factions is fine in skirmish with each approaching combat very differently but in galactic conquest without mods its very unbalanced with the consortium being stupidly powerful and flat out annoying in the hands of the a.i and the empire dominating in space combat once you get the second death star and the executor ssd you have to physically try to lose otherwise you steamroll everything, this leaves the rebels as the weaker of the 3 factions because they dont have the military might of the empire or the control over the galaxy that the consortium do.

As a few reviews have said this game becomes a whole different beast with mods and while the base game is very fun and great it is improved with mods, my fave one being republic at war which changes the factions to the republic and the separatists, i would honestly reccommend buying this for the vast amount of mods you can try alone but play the base game first as the ai is abit easy in the base game and most mods tend to improve on the ai


Sidenote as i feel its worth a mention but the pathfinding for the larger ships in space battles is honestly terrible at times so be wary you may have to path courses for ships manually and hope the pathfinding doesnt hurt itself tying to follow your orders.

Forces of corruption adds in a ton of new units, mechanics, heroes and locations. And finally with this game being older it's got a huge library of fleshed out mods that will keep the game fresh even after hundreds of hours of gameplay.

Don't let my steam hours fool you, I bought this game on disc back when it first released and probably have a couple thousand hours logged over the years which also goes to show that it was worth buying again on steam years later to keep playing it.

Some personal favorite mods that I recommend playing once you have gotten the hang of the game include Awakening of the Rebellion, The Clone Wars Mod (if you are a fan of the TV show), Republic at War, and the Canon Mod. They are all fun and they all fix some gameplay elements that were lacking in the game. Also, there is working multiplayer in this game, so you can play with your friends.

And not only does this game receive a massive amount of fan support, but it's technically a 2 for 1 deal even without sales or discounts. The game features 2 core modes of game play: Space and Ground combat, and with ground combat the ships you have in orbit matter (at least some of the time). I won't go into detail because its 5 in the morning and there are plenty of guides and other comments that go into way more detail than I care to since I'm probably going to bed, waking up at 12 mid-day, having dessert for morning food (I can't remember the word wtf) and getting pimp slapped for the heck of it... but at least this game is fantastic. If I could give more than a 10/10 this comment would be too long and wouldn't fit on the screen. Buy this game, on discount or such who cares. It's worth every penny ESPECIALLY the FoC (Forces of Corruption) DLC that most mods use to format with. Buy, play it, slowly rub your elbows against it, I'm not too picky ( video the elbows though, I have the urge to splurge) and goodnight from some random moron who at 756 hours played still hasn't gotten his fill of Star Wars RTS.

Now the mods, the mods bring this game back to a 7/10, there are so many options and themes, it's fantastic. The units are more diverse and the gameplay functions have changed. I love it, but unfortunately it does get quite boring after 10 or so hours of gameplay, and you will rarely ever finish a Galactic Conquest as the game becomes monotonous.

Whereas the vanilla may be fairly limited and may grow a little stale over time, the Workshop Mod community is more than capable of adding the right type of spice to your gaming experience.

18,STARWARS Empireat War GoldPack,69015910,english,"In my opinion, a big part of what made many old LucasArts games like Battlefront II, Knights of the Old Republic, and Republic Commando so beloved in the eyes of fans is that the developer's vision for what they wanted these games to be wasn't far off from fan's fantasies of what those type of Star Wars games should look like. The shared vision between developers and fans is the bedrock of their acclaim and has enabled these games to stand the test of time.

Empire at War is no different. You want a real time strategy Star Wars game? How about one where you take control of either the Empire or the Rebel Alliance and wage a galaxy spanning conflict in space and planetside where you have to build your fleets and armies from the ground up and are able to directly take command in each and every battle? Might sound a bit long winded when I explain it, but it's also something you might've dreamed of as a child that you never really thought could be real. Turns out it's been around for almost 15 years now, and on top of all of that, the game has developed a strong modding community intent on taking that vision to the next level.

It's not all sunshine and rainbows though. Land battles are frustrating and tedious compared to their orbital counterparts and the frustratingly low unit cap in the base game feels incredibly limiting. Even though the unit cap was likely a necessary concession for the game to run on the hardware of its day, it's one of the few signs of this game's age that's apparent in its design. Fortunately, many mods remove the unit cap and allow you to bypass land battles entirely so you can focus on the space combat that this game just absolutely nails.

Evasive maneuvers<--

Cons: 

for a 2006 game:

-Interface is 0/10, was it done in 1990s?

-Animations are 0/10 You know the ships here they don't move, '""breathe"" if you will when idle, land mode animations are beyond gay, especially infantry ones. Shame, Dawn of War was made in 2004 and has million times better animations.

-Forces of Corruption music is disgusting and there is no option to separate it from the John Williams' original.

-The whole ""Syndicate"" shit is so lame and unbalanced! 

-""Superweapons"" are a joke!

-In skirmish mode the players of each team must choose the same faction.

-Units are unbalanced, especially the rebel ""capital ship destroyer"" fish-ship mc30 with its stupid radial blast ability, Rebel ships are much stronger than the imperial ones because of the shields and their ability to boost them, and torpedo launchers, also imperials don't have ""capital ship destroyer"".

Pros: 

-Multiplayer servers still work.

-In the original game's space battles the music very well fits into the gameplay.

-When you play 4 vs 4, the scale of  space battle somewhat resembles the space battles from the movies.

-In skirmish mode the players of each team share the same space station.

-Only requires ~4 gb of disk space.

What is should have been: the variety of units from FoC in the original game, without FoC music, without land battles, space only. Syndicate as a faction is unneeded.

I recommend it because it is the C&C-like Star Wars game and the best strategy in the franchise.",1588864483,1589116936,TRUE,0,1,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,54,18,339,0,73,1589116805

You don't even need to leave the steam app :) My favorite thing about this game is the space battles. The graphics, sounds, and just general gameplay is incredible and I would definently recommend. This is by far the best star-wars or even space game out there right now. Overall this is an amazing game.. the one thing that I do warn you about is that at first, the game IS HARD!!!

13,STARWARS Empireat War GoldPack,68769047,english,"Star Wars Empire at War is one of the best Star Wars RTS games. It is an interesting change from past games such as STAR WARS Rebellion and STAR WARS Galactic Battlegrounds.
Star Wars fans will love this game a lot. It has a familiar and accurate galaxy map, with planetary bonuses which make sense. Some of the included planets are also surprising.

The graphics are quite good. Turn up the resolution and detail and it does look nice for a 2006 game. Even if you turn the graphics and resolution down, the game still looks nice and runs great even on older machines. 
The soundtrack is also top notch, and the voice acting isn't bad considering they didn't get any of the original actors.

The single player campaigns were interesting, but there is not much difficulty as strategy can be fairly basic. The AI of this game is not great and easily defeatable in my opinion, but it's not retarded and it's not frustrating, which is a good balance overall. The online play was also nice, but the online design could have been better and there was some lag.

This game makes for both ground-based and space-based warfare, and there are 3 categories of gameplay: galactic, space, and ground. 

Galactic is easy and intuitive, and while there are options that you might rather have, there is little to complain about in what's there.

Space is really fun and way better than the space battles in SW Galactic Battlegrounds. Some people might wish they could do more specific stuff, but there's enough strategy for it to be interesting and fun, and the cool feature of targeting fire to certain critical points is immersive. 

Land is very different from most traditional RTS games. You have to capture reinforcement points so that you can bring in troops from your fleet. You don't create units, you bring in units you made on the galactic map. You can build a few structures like turrets, but only at certain specific points. It is still fun and tactical to play, even if it's a bit rudimentary and is lacking all the options of normal RTS games. 

These 3 types of gameplay create a unique experience, which befits a scenario of galactic conquest with pre-made space fleets. None of them are spectacular, but they all mesh in such a way that the minor lackings of each type don't matter, because each is just a part of a whole galactic war. You make units on planets you conquered in the galactic map, and make buildings on them to create specific unit. You command your resources and unit distribution from these bases, and the space and land battles are merely specific tactical confrontations. 

Everything makes sense and blends well as a galactic war, which makes the gameplay varied and intriguing, continuous, and galaxy spanning, and it's a fantastic immersive experience for great fun.
This game is amazing and both strategy fans and Star Wars fans will love it.",1588908849,1588908849,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,501,93,104782,0,104782,1588583028

46,STARWARS Empireat War GoldPack,68700663,english,"Get. This. Game. It's on sale right now for a little bit longer, and goes on sale occasionally, so you can pick it up for fairly cheap. If you don't read past this point, know that the mods for this game on the Steam workshop are amazing (I specifically enjoy the Empire at War Expanded mods Thrawn's Revenge and Fall of the Republic so kudos to that mod team) and easily make this game worth the price tag.

The game itself is designed well as a RTS with both high level strategy and low level control of units in battles. It came out in 2006, and the base game shows that age in terms of graphics, UI, and keybindings. If you want to play through the galactic civil war experienced in the original trilogy, the base game will bring all the nostalgia and the expansion, Force of Corruption (included in the Gold Pack here on Steam) is a Legends story involving a third faction the Zann Consortium (Scum and Villainy). It has Galactic Conquest where you take over the galaxy system by system, buiding your army/fleet in a RTS/4X style game. The game also features a skirmish mode that allows you go up against the AI or other players on both Land and Space.

I don't really play the base game though. The Steam Workshop has a number of great mods available that redesign the game, add new mechanics, units, heroes, and more to play out all your favorite Star Wars scenarios. I highly recommend anyone thinking about buying this game to do so and check out the mods available if the base game doesn't appeal to you. Many of the mods also completely overhaul and upgrade the graphics and textures, so if the original graphics are the only reason you're not buying it, then these mods will solve that problem.

Get. This. Game. and mod it up! Shout-out to the mod team behind the Empire at War Expanded mods! Thanks for making this game amazing!

I would spend days after school or during the summer playing it by myself and always having fun doing so. I remember the hardpoint system for bigger ships being one of the biggest features that never failed to please, and it was so satisfying to destroy them and watch chunks of ships fall off or see that weapon feature disappear from the ship completely, with the engines always being a main target if you wanted to keep them from escaping or slowing them down.

The only problem I've had is the 3rd faction that appears in the Forces of Corruption expansion, the Consortium, when it comes to the galactic conquest mode. The faction is the main feature of the expansion, but the units can easily become overpowered and wipe all of yours out quickly. I also didn't like that you couldn't turn them off in GC, but if you gun for them first you can get rid of them, but make sure you have a strategy for how to take them out first.

Only other downside I had with the game is a lack of a built-in mapmaker/level designer, not even a separate exe for one (that I ever found, anyway). This didn't hinder the experience, but I feel it would have just made it even better.

31,STARWARS Empireat War GoldPack,68473620,english,"Made an honest, 32 hour effort (normal difficulty), to like this game. Tried playing various game modes, across several top rated mods, but the problems are probably too deep to fix. Conceptually, it has a lot of promise: integrating a strategic conquest perspective with tactical space and land battles. The game drips with Star Wars theme and is quite immersive. Unfortunately, the gameplay just fell short for me. 

The strategic layer runs in real time, which would be fine if it were possible to issue every type of command while the game is paused. Lore and realism aside, it's frustrating not to have more information about enemy planets and forces. Without that information, there are few interesting strategic decisions. Every game I can think of in this space (e.g., the Total War series, Paradox games) provides more visibility of the opposition. The campaign quickly descends into a series of rapid fire attacks by the AI, ruining the strategic aspect of the gameplay.

The land battles are fun enough to play but mostly uncompelling. The forces of nature (cyclones, rancors) and the involvement of the indigenous population are interesting ideas but ultimately miss their mark.

The space battles are fun to watch but not fun to play, at least for me. The pace is too fast to make interesting decisions. Once the engagement starts, I feel like I lose all agency, and everything descends into chaos. When I win I feel like it was luck. I've watched players on Youtube execute battles flawlessly, but I was unable to develop that skill.

basicly there are 3 games in one,  a galactic conquest mode, where you manage and conquer planets, a ground combat mode and a space fleet combat mode.
in  campaign or galactic conquest mode you manage everything and can decide weather to fight land or space battles, with the troops/ships you have on a specific planet to defend when the enemy attack
in skirmish mode you can build units, skirmishes are ether space or land combat.

while the base game is about 15 years old and does look a bit dated there are many mods adding extra units and updating the graphics.

My very first strategy game. It may be old but still good to have and play if people consider themselves Star wars nerds (Sorry if anyone gets offended reading this) but again star wars empire at war is a good star wars game I have so far.

[h1]SITH CODE:[/h1]
Peace is a lie, There is only Passion,
Through Passion I gain Strength,
Through Strength I gain Power,
Through Power I gain Victory,
Through Victory My Chains are Broken,
The Force shall set me free...

There is no Peace There is Anger,
There is no Fear There is power,
There is no Death,There is immortality,
There is no Weakness,There is the Dark Side...

I am the heart of the Darkness,
I know no Fear,
I instill Fear in my Enemy's,
I am the Destroyer of Worlds,
I feel the power of the Dark Side.
I am the fire of hate,

All the Universe bows before me...
I pledge Myself to the Darkness,
I have found True life In the death of the Light,
I know the true Power of the Dark Side,
I AM SITH......

Expansion: A fun, albeit imbalanced expansion, Forces of Corruption adds plenty of cool content from the original Star Wars Expanded Universe (with a new story), to create a fun, though buggy and laggy expansion (which is likely coupled with it's six-month development time).

-land battles suck
-galactic conquest mode is cool in theory but is very grindy imo and has way too many long meaningless land battles
    -if you try to sim battles in that mode you almost always take way more losses then you 
    should
-story mode is decent but feels lacking

Overall this game is no Starcraft II, but it's fun to play. For a Star Wars fan like me it's a blast. I personally rate this game as a 9/10, but if I'm being objective maybe for like 6.5/10.

Of the base game, the ground combat is easily the weakest spot, ranging from simplistic graphics, unit pathfinding to balance. Even in mods, pathfinding and unit behaviour is still an issue - space units will plot odd ways or simply do odd things without you giving an order. You need to get used to that or else you won't have much fun.

But the imbalance of the game make it lost all the fun.

Rebel is very easy to play.
They have fast moving infantry and heroes.
So capturing building and area is easier than Empire.
They have vehicle that can deal high AoE damage.
Wiping out Empire soldiers is easy task.
Their hero ,Chewbacca ,can steal ANY vehicle from Empire side.
That include the AT-AT walker you would have to go through trouble to create one if you're Empire.
They can steal it in a heart beat ,and use it to defense their base by placing it beside repairing bay.
That AT-AT walker almost become immortal.
(And can crush ANY Sith lord trying to attack your base)

Empire ,have slow walking Storm Troopers.
Their vehicle will keep getting stolen by the Barbaric Fur ball.
The Sith lords ,are Melee with slow movement.
Not to mention their skills are close range.
Darth Vader got a skill to crush enemy vehicle (Single target).
But it will take some time to completely destroy the targeted vehicle.
And in that period ,he's a sitting duck.... or standing duck. Your call.
He also has this skill to kill enemy infantry around him immediately.
But the range isn't wide to kill so many in a single use. 
....Did I mentioned Rebel are fast walking and Sith are slow walker?
Trying to catch retreating enemy into the skill range is not an easy task.

Without his skills ,he'll slowly attack enemy one by one.
In case that the enemy is willing to let him attack them.
If they run ,he won't be able to kill a single person.

The main game is fairly average in many of its aspects.

It is fun to exert your power across the galaxy as the Empire, which provides an easy way for new players to have fun, while the Rebellion is a lot more of a challenge.

If you are looking for a good RTS, this isnt it. the game is incredibly simple and doesnt require all that much in terms of troop management, clicks/second, or strategy on the same scale as Age of Empires or Starcraft.

It is a fun Star Wars game to spend 40hrs on and I'd recommend it if it is on sale 

5/10

73,STARWARS Empireat War GoldPack,64139420,english,"Star Wars: Empire at War is fucking amazing and I come back to it every few years because it's not only the best Star Wars RTS ever made, but pretty far up there in terms of RTS quality in general. The only ""bad"" part is the expansion, and I'll get to that later.

To keep it basic, the game has three components: The Space battles, the Land battles, and, if you're playing Galactic Conquest, the galaxy where you can build individual units.

Space battles are fucking awesome. The combat is rock-paper-scissors and you can target the individual components of ships and pieces will actually get blown off of them as it takes damage. You have these huge fleet movements with tons of ships shooting away at each other and fighters zipping around and blowing stuff up and it all looks visually amazing, there's even a button that lets you enter a dynamic camera mode that will zoom between units you have selected so you can literally see what it's like for individual fighters in a dogfight or take an overhead above a frigate you have that's shooting other frigates.

Land battles are also okay, but not quite as standout amazing as space battles. The combat on land is also rock-paper-scissors except the balance is kinda fucked in a few ways, and it only gets worse with the expansions. Counters here are more based on a traditional RTS rather than purely counter-based, where just because a unit is a counter doesn't mean it's effective, it means it is cost-effective. To show this with an example, the Empire can build suicide-bombing tanks that can run over infantry, and sure anti-tank infantry can blow them up, but if they're not careful these tanks will get right into their infantry blob and re-enact the Tiannenmen Square Massacre. Higher-tier units are also insanely overpowered, and Rebels in general don't really get any basic unit that can remotely be on equal footing with AT-ATs which are not only incredibly powerful against pretty much everything but can also poop out two squads of stormtroopers each for free. The whole game is really kinda slated in favor of the Empire except for very early-game because Rebels get basically the same units except better versions up until mid-late game.

Galactic Conquest is pretty awesome. You capture planets, earn credits by building stuff on those planets, build structures to make units, defend planets, research technology, and crush your opponents. Additionally, another cool thing that this system has is that individual planets almost always have planet bonuses for owning them. These are usually quite powerful and can be anything from making your infantry have more health, to making your tanks reflect blasters, or even to giving you the ability to create exclusive units on that planet that can be built nowhere else, or in the case of space, you can only build capital ships like Imperial Star Destroyers or Mon-Calamari Cruisers on certain planets, giving some places extra strategic value for your unit composition. It's a really interesting, fun system and I like it a lot. 



And now for the jank. I kinda love the Forces of Corruption expansion but it has a ton of huge issues that break the game. To start with the Consortium faction is busted out the fucking ass so bad that if you try to play them in multiplayer people will kick you from the game. Literally every unit these guys have is horrifically fucking busted in every way, a big example being THEIR BASIC INFANTRY getting one cheap, simple upgrade called Disruptors that lets them KILL EVERYTHING incredibly easily and regardless of unit counters or type. You can kill fucking AT-ATs with 2 units of these things let alone squads. They also get shit like the Canderous Assault Tanks and Destroyer Droids that are so fucking busted that you can quite literally just never lose a single planet once you unlock them in Galactic Conquest by just spamming them. They counter everything, produce quickly and in large numbers from the garrison system and are FAST and capture points meaning that nowhere is safe from these things. In space the Consortium is even more ridiculously busted with their bombers being so strong that they just win against the fighters and corvettes of every other faction, the things that are supposed to counter said bombers. Also they, uniquely, use a weapon type called mass drivers that are basically old-fashioned bullets and they PIERCE SHIELDS meaning that they legitimately fucking break the game if you get enough ships that have these things. It doesn't even stop there, pretty much every single one of their units in space has an ability that is very nearly game-breaking up to their capital ships, one of which, while cool as hell, is literally a giant railgun which has projectiles that pierce shields completely and do stupid amounts of damage, and the other one is more powerful than a Star Destroyer but thankfully doesn't spawn infinite fighters like that thing does. In Galactic Conquest they're even worse. The Consortium is a crime syndicate so they can corrupt local officials on planets and spread corruption that gives them full vision of everything that is built on that planet including free passage at an incredibly light credit cost, but the actual benefits for corrupting things can be anything from gaining technology (such as the previously mentioned disruptors) to removing the local/loyalist population that will help some factions on planets. Also the thing that gets income for every other faction, mining stations, are unbuildable by the Consortium, and instead they can build Palaces that are mining stations but stronger except they're a required building and are limited to 1 per planet, meaning their average income per planet is WAY higher than any other faction and they don't have to compromise being able to defend it like everybody else does since they HAVE to take the palace to build anything else. The Forces of Corruption campaign is awesome though I definitely recommend it.

Star Wars: Empire at War is a fun if rather simplistic RTS. It has an Imperial and an Alliance campaign in the base game, with a third faction being available to play as in the expansion. You play both land and space battles, moving from one objective to the next as you try to capture spawn points, similar to Company of Heroes. It's enjoyable, but I'll admit it gets repetitive. My favorite thing to do is play Skirmish battles as the Empire so I can use Star Destroyers, because Star Destroyers are the best Star Wars ships, don't @ me. There's also a fun Empire campaign level where you're just playing Palpatine going around zapping everyone. Generally I guess the Empire is more fun to play, is the point I'm making, and is arguably easier too, which makes sense. It's not one of the best Star Wars games out there, or one of the best strategy games/RTS's out there, but it's decent at both, so it's worth trying out if you like either of those things.",1582058440,1582058481,TRUE,1,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,1695,59,183,0,183,1582057848

+ Different factions have unique qualities that help each to stand out & prevent the game from feeling too stagnant
+ Graphics are certainly dated & uninspired, but holds up better than most games from the time of release
+ Healthy modding community if one feels the inclination

- Lackluster & general incompetent AI
- Visuals don't appear too bad for the time of release, but they only hold up so well to modern eyes

For a game that came out almost 14 years now, It's amazing.  the amount of different types of units is great, even better if you use the force of corruption DLC. The game also includes a tech system.

The rebels rely on stealing the empires tech. surprisingly the rebels can actually go beyond the empire in tech , which of course is weird. but if it wasn't like that, the empire would win easily as the rebels are a little weaker then them until you get to tech 4 when you unlock the mon calamari cruiser to build ( needs level 4 space station and can only be build on some planets just like the imperiel star destroyer).

-Fall of the Republic (just released in beta, it is the Clone Wars varient from the same creator of Thrawn's Revenge)
-Yodenmod (not as good quality but it easily has the largest ship count of any mod)

73,STARWARS Empireat War GoldPack,62821670,english,"Empire at War is one of a handful of RTS games set in the Star Wars universe, and is to my knowledge is the most recent [side note: imagine if Westwood Studios was still around to make one of their own. Damn you, EA.].
As an RTS game, Empire at War is pretty good out of the box. There are two battle modes: space and land. Of the two, space battles are definitely much more enjoyable. These modes can be played in either skirmish mode or galactic conquest. For those unsure of what that is, think of Total War but real time instead of turn based: at the macro level, you manage your faction, building units and structures, and using the units you construct you defend your planets and conquer your enemies in battles you can either personally command or auto resolve. 
The base game also includes campaigns for both the Empire and the Rebels. 
This version comes with the Forces of Corruption expansion, which adds a third faction, the Consortium, and a new campaign where you play as them, as well as more maps and more units for the existing factions. 
Story wise, the base game is set prior to the Battle of Yavin, and the expansion is set after it, going from the immediate aftermath of it to after the Battle of Endor. The game also uses (and takes place in) the pre-Disney Expanded Universe.

Empire at War is a good game out of the box, but what makes it worth getting is the massive and still quite active mod scene. Numerous mods, some of which are VERY high quality, exist. From simple mods that add a unit or two to total conversions that move the game to other points in the Star Wars timeline and even into other universes to a straight up rework of the entire game, there is no shortage of fan generated content to support this game, even 14 years after its initial release. 

Strongly recommended for anyone who likes both Star Wars and RTS games.",1580596240,1580596240,TRUE,34,0,0.761691868,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,120,13,3224,0,2849,1590199157

This game is still doing really well over a decade later, and that's due to other star wars fans like me who have kept the community of this game alive through AMAZING mods in practically every era in Star Wars. You can spend countless hours playing this game because there's a limitless amount of great mods for this game as well as the base experience that has some pretty fun campaigns. The mod support for this game has done the impossible and have really tested how far this game can go, making it more beautiful than whatever I could have imagined. I highly recommend you check out these mods if you have or are getting this game- Awakening of the Rebellion, Republic at War, and check out a youtuber and his teams amazing mods also, his name on youtube is CoreyLoses and he and his team have done phenomenal work in outstanding mods such as Thrawn's Revenge and there newest release of a Clone Wars Mod called Fall of the Republic.

38,STARWARS Empireat War GoldPack,62670854,english,"Ah, the early 2000's. At time when RTS ruled supreme. This game is a somewhat niche little gem, that has got a lot of good things going for it.

First of all, I have played a lot of different strategy games. From Rise of Nations, Age of Empires, Rise of Legends, Command & Conquer, Age of Mythology, Dawn of War, Company of Heroes, Cossacks to the Total War franchise and Europa Universalis, Victoria, Crusader Kings, Hearts of Iron, Stellaris (Okay I think you catch the drift). My point being, I know a good RTS game when I play one. And this is it. By God, has this game aged well.

Now mind you, it is from 2006, and I actually think that is Forces of Corruption. If I recall correctly, the basegame is actually from 2004... So the graphics, well they are not fantastic. They hold up well enough for its age I would say though, and graphics are not everything.

My favourite part about this game is galactic conquest and space battles. Galactic conquest is much like a Star Wars version of the total war campaign setup. You build armies and fleets, manage different planets, invade and defend. Simple, and fun. Much simpler than say, Europa Universalis, but that's okay.

Space battles are epic in scale and Star Wars-esque as all hell. Epic lasers firing about.... Just too epic. Not much to say.
Land battles are okay enough, enough that I enjoy it, but it doesn't hold a candle to the space battles in my opinion.

Another great thing about this game, is that it has a load of great mods. Especially the Republic at War, Clone Wars, and Empire at War: Remake mods are good takers!

This game isn't perfect, but a game doesn't have to be perfect to be awesome. And this game is indeed awesome. Just buy it :)

P.S. We really REALLY need a sequel to this. A Star Wars strategy game? That's just an idea that is too awesome not to expand further upon!

97,STARWARS Empireat War GoldPack,62532683,english,"The base game is a fun old game that I've played for years with space tactical combat that feels very true to EU canon and realism, but not without flaws.  For one, the AI is just too stupid to ever provide a challenge, though perhaps that can be rectified via mods.  More importantly though, the balance is very much only balanced ""from a certain point of view"", which makes PvP kind of broken.  Essentially Rebellion utterly dominates in some areas and Empire utterly dominates in others, leading to a theoretical overall balance but imbalance in specifics.  In general, the Empire rules space and the Rebellion rules the land, but then the Empire gets the death star and just blows up the land(and you'll never kill the death star if it's protected by Executor), and that's why Empire wins just about every time my brother and me play.  Again, hoping for good mods to fix it, and my brother is actually working on some.

But then there's the expansion, which certainly adds some fun EU material like Nightsisters and Thrawn, but it also adds a faction called The Zann Consortion, which is basically Black Sun only for some reason they didn't want to actually use Black Sun, and somehow this criminal organization is more powerful than either the Empire or the Rebellion(how THAT would have existed without us hearing about it before is anyone's guess), and this faction is basically a terrible Mary Sue of a faction.  Any coolness it has just comes from being overpowered, and god is it overpowered, totally ruining any semblance of balance.  You could basically completely disable their units' special abilities and they'd still win 2 to 1 against rebellion or empire, and that's only the beginning.

Still comes recommended from me, but I'll admit that may largely be nostalgia and my massive Star Wars obsession, but I do think that if it can be balanced it would be a playable game even today.",1580157179,1580157179,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,14,1,755,0,724,1580162777

76,STARWARS Empireat War GoldPack,62155983,english,"An absolute classic game, period. I honestly would consider this amazing if I hated Star Wars. Yes, the game is quite old and some mechanics are bad, etc. Overall, though, this game is good as is AND has one of the better modding communities out there (the Thrawn's Revenge mod is amazing); plus, it's pretty cheap. A must have for Star Wars and RTS gamers.

Pros:
Simply amazing space battle mechanics (vanilla is a bit boring in terms of ships at this point, but it's been a while)
Pretty okay graphics, all things considered
Easy to run on potatos (if you're okay with terrible graphics, which you should be if you play on a potato)
Lots of good mods
Easy to jump into casually
Multiplayer pvp is good

Cons:
Without the DLC, this game isn't that good. But you can't actually buy it standalone (I don't think). The only issue with that is you can't play the vanilla campaign (as the empire) with the good mechanics of the DLC (unless you use mods).
There are some lore issues with models and such (but this is a video game so that's expected)
Multiplayer player vs ai is a downside*

Here or there:
Ground combat is...I really can't say. It can be dull and grinding (if playing a campaign) but can also be engaging and tough. It really depends. Just expect a bit of a slog when it comes to ground forces. Many mods remedy this, but, obviously, I can't count that when it comes to a review. The mechanics are pretty good and the maps are actually quite good but the gameplay can be lacking. I think they are trying to both simulate an invasion and have traditional rts mechanics (fog of war, etc), along with the limits of the tech of the day, and it comes out feeling a bit less of good rts and good invasion.

*In a MP galactic conquest, planets not controlled by a player are ai controlled. To take these over, you have to, obviously, invade them. However, the game can't let one player have a battle against the ai while the other just sits there so it forces you into auto-resolve. This can be a fun killer because the auto-resolve mechanic tends to always yield greater casualties and lower success chances than when you fight it manually. I've lost fleets (and thus games) in MP simply because I got a bad roll.",1579557945,1579558125,TRUE,1,0,0.522293031,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,236,5,12835,0,11752,1587097917

61,STARWARS Empireat War GoldPack,22433339,english,"Star wars Empire at war is an RTS strategy game.
Due to the games' release in 2006, the graphics are slightly outdated but work perfectly.
Space battles are entertaining and work well.
Ground battles are okay. They work but could do with some improvement.

If the graphics are too poor for you, there are 2 mods I recommend from the steam workshop.
1- Star wars Expanded: Thrawn's Revenge. Which is a good expansion to the game but this requires the Forces of corruption expansion pack to function.

2- Star wars Empire at war Remake: Galactic Civil War. This is a graphical improvement mod which adds both new maps and units. It functions well but also requires the Forces of corruption expansion pack to work.

Both mods should run smoothly but frame rates do get choppy in large battles.


Apart from mods, the base game is fun featuring 2 campaigns (a third included in the F.O.C expansion). These add story to the game and are very fun. There is a galactic conquest mode, which is similar to campaign but without a story to follow and objectives to meet.
Alternatively there is is the skirmish mode which directly drops you into a ground battle where you explore the map, create units and research upgrades to gain the upper hand in combat.

Luckily, the modding community has not only given us fans sequel worthy content, hours of game play, more and varied units, cleaner looking battles and an overall refurbished and remastered gaming experience. If you haven't played this before, even if you're new to trying the original/vanilla game for the first time... you are in for a great treat. 
If you're skeptical or unsure on getting the game, then I recommend checking out youtube channel TheXPGamers. His playthroughs, seasonal campaigns, test runs of mods and general knowledge of patches and mod authors is extensive, entertaining and worth looking into. He also has a discord and twitch service to check out for more videos and community input. 
My personal experience: I am by no means a great player, but I love the game too damn much to set it down. It sucks you in; the vanilla game is (at the very least) canon and follows the original movies (episodes 4-6) and is amazing. My recommendation is this: get the original, play it, and then check out the mods once you've beaten the original and expansion.

It's a game I used to play a lot when I was a kid, and I like coming back to the game every now and then just to absorb the nostalgia. However, it's not a perfect game, and it's definitely not my favorite game from my childhood.

pros:
- nostalgic af
- first few hours of gameplay are addicting
- forces of corruption is even better than the base game
- mods available for this game are pretty good

cons:
- the game is only capable of using ONE core in your cpu. This means the game will still lag out even if you have a really good cpu that can do a million other things at once.
- if you play on easy, the game becomes too easy and repetitive after a certain point
- if you play on medium or hard, EVERY battle becomes tedious because the enemies become bullet sponges with larger armies that invade you more often. Because the enemy invades so much more, it becomes harder to get anything else done. I've always wanted to fight Darth Vader's Executor or the death star because it's fun to face a big ship and slowly destroy it, but as far as I know the empire will only build these on hard mode. :( Personally, I think the higher difficulties should've just increased the rate of credits that your enemies obtained. I have no problem destroying entire imperial fleets as long as every f***ing ship doesn't take another army to destroy. I think it'd be more fun just to mow through entire armadas. 

7/10 Still a pretty good game.

Id rather lose a save file (which I've never had a problem with) then take 5 minutes to save. 


Clunky glitchy, god awful. I Have 550 hours on this game. maybe a hundred of those were me being too tired to shut down the game properly at 4 am and just letting it idle.
No other RTS has given me this experience. The defense on multiple fronts, the ever pressing need for better weapons, the heartbreak that fills me when one of my capital ships detonate, all hands lost. it is just amazing. I've played maybe a half a dozen mods, conquered the galaxy repeatedly using various factions. its all just so darn good.
if you are a strategy nut, this game is a must. if you are a casual player who wants something they can come back to and play this is a must. if you enjoy the modding scene, this is a must.


Tips: don't auto resolve with ships in orbit, tech up before going on the offensive, build mines only on planets with a 50 or higher base income, and set a timer so you dont accidently play all night.
MODS: most mods can be installed by creating a mods folder in ypur corruption folder, and then click and dragging the mod you downloaded into the mods folder. took a few tries but i got it down, some mods are weird, but not usually worth the extra effort. uninstall mod by clicking and dragging the file out of the folder. i just saved mod authors like 60 comments with that i swear to god.
 MODS, as witnessed by moi
Republic At War (RAW) while well polished visually, it is unbalanced. Republic easy campaign is 20 hours at the least. Cis Hard campaign was 8. i kid you not this mod is not balance wise. 2019 update: Raw runs alot slower on older computers now, They added 2 early game medium cruisers to the republic side but both ships are still outmatched by basic sep ships)
Clone wars mod is like the 2008 series. crashes occasionally, but better than RAW
Clone wars sub-mod has great Land combat just like the 2003 cartoon, but space battles are meh.
Thrawns Revenge is pretty epic and very unique. exact opposite of RAW really. Very well balanced, but the visuals are not as good. granted unlike RAW this game isnt advertised as finished and gets a new beta in febuary of 2017
Rise of the Mandalorians is both interesting, stable, and pretty to look at. also has the BEST turrets on ships unlike in vanilla and many other mods (again, RAW) 
The Alliance and Battlefront mods seem like dumpsters, with so much content from so many creators that they lack stability. Alliance also has an annoying change to the way the camera works in space that ruins the top down atmosphere. overwrites your data folder for vanilla, thus requiring a load of fiddling to uninstall.
Awakening of the Rebellion runs ridiculously slowly on the piece of dirt i'm typing this on, however it makes the game slow paced and every purchase counts. If you ever wondered how warlords in third world countries wage war, AOR has you covered (apologies to the AOR staff for mistaking their mod with others.) 
Ultimate Corruption feels like an expansion. it balances ship strength and fighter complement by class (light cruiser, cruiser, heavy cruiser, battlecruiser) allowing for you to pick and choose what you like. adds loads of new ships, makes stations awesome, and utterly destroys x wings. 

in closing, this game is ok vanilla, but fan made content shines it to a gleam.
worth full price.

Several mods change the whole gameplay into an entirely new game basically and its insane how different they can make the game feel. I wish this game would get an official sequel (if only to allow the modding community to have even more to work with) but with how much love and effort is put into some of these overhaul mods it really does feel like a new game.

If you have never played this game, or havent played it since its release/without mods, i HIGHLY recommend picking it up and giving it a try. The mods alone make this game worth a buy.",1578103516,1578103516,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,209,3,17232,0,15011,1594178359

Amazing game, must have for all star wars and rts fans.
While the ground combat is lackluster and can easily become frustrating, the space combat and the galactic conquests modes make up for it enormously.
Add to the mix the extensive mod support and there's fun for hundreds and hundreds of hours.
Using mods you can go back to the old republic, and fight as the sith empire, mandalorians or old republic.
You can go to the clone wars, and fight off the cis as the republic or liberate systems for your consortium.
go into the (now legends) future, and fight as the new republic or the imperial remnant, among others.
But the mods don't just end here.
New units and balance to the civil war, improved graphics, enhanced gameplay...
Want other sci fi universes into the game? You can! Halo? Check! Stargate? Check! star trek? Check! All of them in a single mod? Double check!

A valid statement. One must be able to read an ally's strengths, so as to determine how to best use them. One must similarly be able to read his enemy's weaknesses, so as to determine how to best defeat him.

But what of friends?
There is no accepted answer, perhaps true friendship is so exceedingly rare. But I had formulated my own.
A friend need not be kept within sight or within reach. A friend must be allowed the freedom to find and follow his own path. If one is fortunate, those paths will for a time join.

Made before EA took over you can really feel that the game was made by developers that really loved what they were doing. The space battles was way beyond their time unmatched by any games at the time. Even though the Land Battles are lacking, the feel of star wars remains in every part.

The main reason to buy this game is the super dedicated modding community that still produces mods to this day. Mods such as the Remake mod, Thrawn's revange and Awakening of the rebbelion really makes the game feel fresh even after almost two decades.

Of course the graphics are pretty outdated but you can fix that easily with some mods from the steam workshop. The battle atmosphere and the variety of units are still awesome and worth being taken a look at.[/i]

[u]Singleplayer:[/u]
You can play the story of the Rebellion & of the Empire and a free game with the whole galaxy open to you.
Though the lore doesn't go too much in depth it's still fun and if you want more, there's also mods for that. ;)
The atmosphere of the Ground and Space Battles is very convincingly taking you straight into the fight and it's all about your tactical knowledge. On top of that you'll have to manage your planets.

[u]Multiplayer:[/u]
The Game might be old but there are still quite a lot of people playing it online, so you can easily play matches with others or your friends!
There are all the possibilities offered you might wish for in a real STAR WARS Battle in the several online modes.

[h1]Abilities & Miscellaneous[/h1]
You can upgrade your planets and your space stations after your wish. All the special characters such as Darth Vader or Boba Fett have their own special abilities which makes the battle even more exciting and unpredictable! Use your units skills wisely and you might also win seemingly hopeless situations. There are a lot of mods you can download to maximize your gameplay content and to enjoy the Game even longer..


[b]If you're just looking for a strategy game it might not be worth the full price for you, but if you like the space theme and STAR WARS this Game is a must have in your library.[/b]

the first game lacked a lot of depth to it that should have been there.  FOC expansion improved on that a great deal, but it still wasn't enough.  SO I enjoyed it as much as I could for about a year, then shelved it.

Then I read about the Mods ebing made for this game.  And the Mods truly revitalised this game for me.  The mods truly maketh this game a very new experience.
The biggest draw card for this game has always been the space combat.  Ground combat is a bit more lack lustre, but you just learn to run with it.

In time I hope a new and very modern version of this game shall one day be released.  but until then its the modding community at large that will continue to keep this game lurching on its feet, and continue to keep this game worthy of a close look at for casual realtime space and empire management (lite) gameplay.",1576994647,1576994647,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,119,1,6374,0,1201,1587617869

9,STARWARS Empireat War GoldPack,60079243,english,"A game that has never been replicated and never needs to be replicated, because mods.

Whoever had the simple idea of developing a Star Wars RTS with both space and land battles and then combining both in a Galactic Conquest mode which forces you to first gain space superiority over a planet, then land forces and invade the ground was a pretty big genius in 2006. The base games have plenty of flaws, from balancing issues to braindead AI, but this game was always just a template upon which modders could impose their will.

Therefore, here my recommended list of mods for this game, because thats the way it is really meant to be played:

1. Thrawn's Revenge. By far the most polished and well balanced EaW mod out there. It also introduces some new gameplay elements. This mod covers the Star Wars Legends timeline past Episode 6 all the way to 20-30 years after it. If you desire to play in the Rebel vs. Empire era of the base game, this is unfortunately not the mod for you. The devs are also currently developing a Clone Wars Era side-mod, which I know will be held to the same high standard, so look out for that if you care about sequel stuff.

2. Awakening of the Rebellion. If you DO desire to play the Rebel vs. Empire era, this is a mod you can check out, but be careful, it SIGNIFICANTLY changes the gameplay compared to the base game. There is 4 times the buildings and 6 times the units and trust me, you will get overwhelmed. Also lacks polish compared to Thrawn's Revenge.

3. Empire at War Remake. This mod is actually in alpha stages and only found on moddb.com, but it looks incredibly promising. Unlike the other two mods above it adheres more closely to the base games except well, it look absolutely stunning. Every unit is replaced by an incredibly highly detailed model, all the way down to animated turbolaser turrets! Gameplay is also slowed down significantly from the base games, with a Star Destroyer truly being able to take a minute-long pounding, just like a 1,6km long warship should be able to.

4. Republic at War. A mod I had a personal (albeit small, only helped with the german translation of some unit texts) hand in. If you need a Clone Wars fix, you can get it here, although similar to the base game it is a bit unbalanced and the AI is pretty bad. 

Overall the modding scene for this game is what really made it survive all the way into 2019 and its one of the best modding scenes of all time. Judged by itself its an okay-ish 6/10, pretty much only held up by its uniqueness, but with enabling this modding scene I have to bump it up to a [b]8/10[/b].",1576692189,1576692189,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,199,16,4997,0,2259,1581694637

55,STARWARS Empireat War GoldPack,59745793,english,"I'm a massive sucker for big space battles, probably due to Star Wars being my favourite franchise, so this game is great for me - it does both of those EXTREMELY well. There's a great amount of depth to the individual battles, with ships ranging from fighters to corvettes all the way up to capital ships all serving a purpose. What I particularly like is that the doctrines you see established in the films and expanded universe are all represented in the balancing of the different factions - the Rebellion relies on hit and run tactics and stays invested in things like fighters to try and take on Star Destroyers and stations. Inversely, the Empire follows the Tarkin Doctrine to a tee, pushing for heavily armed and shielded capital ships, but having more fragile and less effective single fighters.

This asymmetric strategy extends to the campaigns as well - in your efforts to conquer or liberate the galaxy, you'll gain new technologies and units through different means depending on your faction. The Alliance needs to be opportunistic and daring to win victories, while the Empire will quickly build up big fleets to try and encircle and trap the smaller Rebel forces.

With all of this said, the game does show its age from time to time - while lasers and turbolasers cut satisfyingly through space, some of the textures and models look a little outdated, and the other particles leave a fair bit to be desired. WITH THAT SAID, the Empire At War Remake mod is an excellent remedy to all of this - bringing the game up to a modern standard, and making engagements large and small a spectacle. Small balance tweaks are brought with the mod too, creating bigger opportunities for technologies like Ion Cannons to help a smaller fleet take on a larger one if they play it right.

At the end of the day, I can't recommend this game enough, especially with EaW-R installed. For the cheap prices you see it for on here, easily worth the buy.",1576208586,1576208586,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,119,4,3166,3,2438,1602089580

76,STARWARS Empireat War GoldPack,48228819,english,"Honestly one of the best RTS games out there (IMO). 

-INTRODUCTION-
This game was my childhood (in addition to Battlefront 1 and 2), and so of course there is some level of bias at play here, but the game is just fantastic. For a game that is more than 13 years old it still holds up to other RTS games (WITH MODS, i will speak of that in a little bit). 
I mean just the idea of the game is fantastic enough in itself, that you have an entire galaxy to play with, you choose your own faction and build fleets and armies, how you must establish control of the space above the planet before you can launch your own ground invasion, and with huge both space and land battles with the biggest dreadnoughts to the smallest individual fighter. In addition, the hardpoint system, not seen in many games before this rises the gameplay to another level, making battles even more strategic as you can target and destroy specific points of the ships like hangars, engines, guns and shields. 

-POSITIVES, NEGATIVES- 
Now that sounds all well and good, but how is the game really. Well for starters, the game was made in 2006, so the graphics are nothing to write home about, in fact they can look quite horrible at times (and that is putting it bluntly). The AI is alright, although you'll find that the unit AI can often mess up your thoroughly planned and impeccably perfect plans and strategies. The space battles are phenomenal, and it is probably the main part of this game, and definitely the most well executed gamemode. 
On the other hand, we have ground battles, the most tedious part of this game. They can be awesome, cool, and you will definitely have some battles you'll never forget, but with the weak AI, at points large maps and after a while boring gameplay, it is probably the weakest part of the game. Now let's move to the main reason for why you should buy this game.

-MODING-
With the addition of the Forces Of Corruption DLC, Petroglyph games introduced modding support, which is probably the only reason why the game is still alive.
Due to the game's great core gameplay and frankly just the idea of the game, the community has made a TON of just out-right mindblowing mods. Some of the many out there are the Clone Wars mod, which introduces an entire new era, (the clone wars :] ), and two new factions, a new galaxy and TONS of new maps, it is honestly a completely new game. Another amazing mod is the newly released Thrawns Revenge, a complete rework of the game, introducing multiple factions and an amazing new lighting engine, putting the graphics to modern standards. If you cant handle the early 2000s graphics, this is the mod for you. This mod also fixes a ton of problems from the main game, like ships being able to shoot at longer ranges, fixing the ground battles and making the AI seemingly a lot more complex and capable.

No, this isn't a Star Wars mod, though there are an abundance of purely excellent SW mods of awesome RTS games. This is a fun, immersive Star Wars experience. It's not perfect, but once you get the hang of the Rock, Paper, Scissors system and how certain units can dominate even the most terrifying ones, it's a blast. Space combat is absolute perfection.

My suggested mods for the Forces of Corruption expansion, they just make things even more enjoyable:
- Thrawn's Revenge (All Legends Eras played through an AWESOME campaign. Beautiful graphics remake)
- Lord Link's Model ReRig Pack (changes next to nothing from Vanilla FoC, simply makes the Eclipse buildable...for if you've played the campaign and wish you could use it in Galactic Conquest)
-z3r0x mod (What can I say? This is just fun. Adds a ton of planets from Legends and Canon, TONS of Legends ships, CIS droid armies and fleets for the Underworld, fixes the unbalanced Rebellion by giving them tons of Capital Ships so they can actually take on the Empire/Underworld; this mod even has a Galactic Conquest match with no Consortium for those of you who get sick of the Za-brokenn Consortium. Also, you can build the Eclipse! My only complaint is suddenly almost every ship type can only be built on certain planets: case in point, Death Star II can only be buildable over Endor, but aside from the sometimes annoying chore of finding which of the 68 planets can build Tie Fighters or B-Wings, this mod is amazing.

49,STARWARS Empireat War GoldPack,59124230,english,"SWEAW is my second most played game on Steam as of now, but let me first say that I've been playing the game since it's release in 2006 and there is no other game besides the 2001 reason I learned about modding and game scripting- Star Trek Bridge Commander- than this game, Star Wars Empire at War- that I am always coming back to. SWEAW is an amazing, authentic Star Wars experience and my personal favorite Star Wars game ever, and it flat out would be the best if it weren't for KOTOR or the Jedi Knight games. This game has that perfect mixology of elements that make a game infinitely replayable to me- Lots of content, realistic gameplay, and mod support. SWEAW without mods has near perfect gameplay, and while parts of the game do have their caveats- including the less polished ground gameplay- the game only improves greatly with a very active mod community. Just check out the Remake mod for this game, you will be blown away by the content and graphics fidelity closer to the new Battlefront games than the original release.

So let's get into it, why do I like this game so much? Let's star with graphics. The game in 2006 looked fantastic, especially the textures and modelling on larger ships in space. Today though they are serviceable but are much better with mods. Even without them though Star Destroyers look accurate and break apart satisfyingly and there's a good amount of PEW PEW to be had. Performance is decent for a game this old, even with breathtaking graphics in mods it still chugs along at a playable framerate with hundreds of units on the screen. Gameplay is really good. The best mode is the space skirmishes or the galactic map with the ground combat disabled with a script file. Unfortunately the ground combat isn't great as units don't follow pathing or directions correctly, and there's just something off and unfinished feeling with that mode. If you really enjoy Star Wars ground combat, this is usable but the Star Wars mod for Men at War is better. The real highlight of the game is the awesome space combat. While AI isn't the smartest thing ever it works pretty well and it can be a real treat to watch your favorite ships slug it out. Maps are more simple and battles take place in 2 dimensions but there's something really satisfying about being able to build a queue of ships and hyperspace them in anywhere when you need them.

There's a huge amount of replayability in this game as with most RTS games but this one is really worth the price tag. Mod support alone is massive and adds an incredible amount of content and missing units to the already large amount of ships and fighters in the base game and expansion. Modding is fully supported and since the game was updated to work with Steam workshop and Steam multiplayer it really has breathed a new life into the game. There's not just some skins and maps here, but full conversion mods available. There's no grind here as all the content is included in the purchase of the game and single expansion pack part of this Gold edition- I know right? You actually get all the content from the get go with your money!

Audio is decent for the time with a good selection of Star Wars theme music and lots of explosions and PEW PEW sounds, along with some good voice-overs. Controls are as expected in a RTS game, they work. Story outside of the galactic campaign's objectives are basically non-existent, but that really doesn't take away from the game as this is more of a 'you make the decisions and story' game through your own gameplay. It's fantastic for recreating your favorite canon and what-if scenarios especially with the included map editor.

I highly recommend this game and it should be a part of any Star Wars fan's library and anyone who enjoys a great RTS game with lots of potential. Grab this game at the next Steam sale if you haven't already!

  To begin, the best thing I can adamantly say about this game is the space battles. They are crown jewel of the game, very fun and engaging, although frustrating and repetitive at times due to several unbalances. *Cough* Zann Consortiun *Cough*
 Other than that, the game also has land battles, which to my very enlightened opinion, they are very frustrating, unfun, unbalanced, and an overall a bad time. It also doesn't help that the games visuals don't hold up very well. 
  Now on to the campaign/galactic conquest. For the most part, a good experience. Simply due to the fact that Space battles take the majority of battles in the campaign. Ground battles are there, but suffer from the problems I has listed before. The story in of its self isn't very good, as it doesn't make much sense when placed in the lore, (i.e., Rebels attacking Wayland) but the game offers some good fun.
 Overall, the game gets an eight out of ten, a good game in my personal opinion. It also has some amazing mods which I highly recommend,  Thrawn's Revenge being one of them.",1513876465,1575170445,TRUE,9,3,0.592633605,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,7,1,15585,33,10264,1601857954

Honestly a bit of luck is involved too lol.  I enjoy the challenge.

The mods are where the game shines.  I recommend the Republic at War mod for the Original Empire at War and the Thrawn's Revenge mod.

Unique concept - only starwars RTS of its type
Impressive voice acting
Adequate visual effects
Adequate hero mechanics
Immersive space battles

Cons:
Unimpressive land battles
Poor unit models
Lack of unique side missions
Lack of unit diversity

I would recommend to any RTS player to buy this game, but play only one campaign on vanilla. Download all three of the following mods: Imperial Civil War: Thrawn's Revenge (ICW), Awakening of the Rebellion (AoR), and Republic at War (The Clone Wars is an acceptable alternative for those who liked the TV series). These mods add a gigantic amount of content. AoR adds a bunch of unique missions, amazing unit models, and moving parts like turrets, flaps, etc. ICW is a mod for fans of Star Wars Legends, with extensive focus on the warlord factions and their characters. ICW has a unique progression system based on the Legends lore, wherein all the technology progression is based on historical eras, each era characterized by the leader of the Empire or its remnants. Republic at War is more of the movie perspective of the clone wars, with Venators and Lucrehulks a plenty, unique models for named Republic Army units, (212th Attack Battalion, 41st Siege Battalion, 327th Star Corps, etc) and unique models for the Jedi generals that lead them.",1574932319,1574932319,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,179,6,18161,0,10688,1586003359

56,STARWARS Empireat War GoldPack,58303706,english,"SW:EAW (GP) is a fantastic game. After losing and winning several campaigns and skirmishes, I can say I really like this game.

Gameplay: 9.5/10

The AI has a few issues, namely moving units inefficiently and spamming units. This takes a toll on your computer after about twenty minutes into a skirmish match, if it lasts that long. The AI loves to spam Acclamators, Assault Frigates Mk. II's, and Mon Calamari Cruisers. This does make for interesting battles, though. They put you on your toes at times and may really draw your attention for hours on end.

Graphics: 8/10

This game is over ten years old, and has held up okay. Some minor graphic glitches here and there, but otherwise, it looks great, and mods easily fix this issue.

Singleplayer: 9/10

As stated in the gameplay section, the AI has a few issues, but otherwise is a great experience. I do singeplayer to test my fleets, mostly.

Multiplayer: 8/10

Desyncs are commonplace in multiplayer, which sucks during campaigns. I'd recommend saving every five-or-so minutes if you can while in a campaign. Otherwise, multiplayer is great.

Modding: 10/10

The Steam Workshop and external websites make this game even better. Mods like RaW, Yodenmod, and many more mods make the game even more fun and refreshing. Of my 68 hours at time of review, probably 85% of those hours are from modded play. 

Overall, I'd say this game is 100% worth $20. This game is one of the best Star Wars games out there.",1574891824,1574891824,TRUE,1,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,115,7,4212,0,4130,1590370568

Usually I'm playing WWII RTS games or Space 4X and have yet to get into a Space RTS and this was a pleasant surprise. I'm not a huge Star Wars fan so I have a lot to learn about the pieces and what they can all do, but it's been fairly easy to pick up without any help.

Really enjoying the upgrades and strategy that goes along with some of the pieces like the MDU's with shields, learning how that all worked has helped tremendously with strategy. I did have a crash recently in a 3+ hour long game during a super weapon firing with the Remake mod, but otherwise things have been smooth.

I haven't even ventured into the space fights yet, can't wait to check that out. It's well worth the $ for sure, even if you're not into Star Wars, it's a fantastic strategy game and the graphics are (especially with the Remake mod) are damn good for how old this game is, especially considering so many 2019 games are going retro with their graphics anyway.

14,STARWARS Empireat War GoldPack,57402640,english,"To sum this game up:
Pros
+ Very nostalgic
+ Gives you a chance to command those massive space battles from the movies
+ You can decide the outcome of the war, for all those Empire fans who were disappointed when they somehow lost to the Rebel scum
+ Unique Units
+ Cool in-game functions such as orbital bombardment or commando raids
+ Amazing soundtrack
+ Modding community is amazing
+ Perfect length for Galactic conquest
+ Enemy AI is actually competent 
+ Technology/Research system is very cool as it represents the gear for it's appropriate time period

Cons
- Friendly AI can act pretty dumb from time to time
- Sometimes your units start moving on their own (The worst is the AT-AT as it moves on it's own, it's very slow, and it always manages to run right into Chewbacca and get captured)
- Graphics aren't the greatest, however that can be fixed with mods
- Not that many heroes
- Infantry fighting takes FOREVER 
- Not that many special units (This is slightly better in FOC)

89,STARWARS Empireat War GoldPack,57235944,english,"I would highly recommend this game. I am in partial to star wars so I will try no to be bias because of that.

HUD: simple but effective and easy to pick up. It makes you feel like a commander actually observing battles take place.

AI: Some times the AI has occasional bugs I have found and exploited but I do often remember the AI being very competitive and challenging during skirmish battles.

The story: it is built off of the good-ol' star wars EU stories. It makes you feel like you are actually taking part in something larger than a simple skywalker story. It feels like an actual campaign is what I am trying to say.

Gameplay: load times seem spotty and weird but that pales into comparison with how the game plays. Some things that I thoroughly enjoyed would be; Space battles and the special units used. Weak against/strong against unit index is a great way to base unit compatibility. The perks and special abilities that units have are simple, straight forward, and fun to use. Each ability is useful in its own way which is nice compared to other games I have played. I have played a few other RTS games that each unit has way too many abilities and they do not really explain well what they do. 

Another fun note that I want to put is the cinematic camera. I feel as though all RTS enthusiasts some times like to just watch their massive army absolutely demolish the enemy. Props to the devs for adding a big button that takes away the HUD and all distractions so you can just watch. 

I am trying to include things that I did not like but it is hard because this is an absolute gem. I would say that some heroes are ANNOYING AF. Han and Chewie can seriously get bent. I understand how each faction lacks in areas where as others they excel in though. Bottom line is that some heroes are OP and you can cheese the enemy to oblivion but I would not have it any other way.

The game play is top notch, I love the satisfying feeling of having a capital ship ready and when it almost looks like you have lost BAM, they are screwed.

There's a million ways to play this game, the soundtrack keeps you playing the game, its not incredible but its perfect for a Star Wars game.
         Personally the game shines through mods, unfortunately the 'This belongs in a museum' computer I have cant handle some mods, but it usually works, I suggest the cannon timeline mod, it adds so much and feels great to play.

The biggest hold backs for the base game (there are many, many mods out there that address these problems so if you feel like playing those, then this game is near flawless) is the limited number of units that can be on a map at a time.  On the ground, this is no issue since it would suck to be bouncing around thousands of units while lasers fly all about but then there are the space battles.  They do feel like you are leading a rather formidable armada into battle but only to a point.  Sure, you can have a huge death stack of units meeting  another fleet and slowly but surely warp in new ships whenever some fall, but you never get a Return of the Jedi feel of large fleets smashing into each other.  Other than that, the sound is amazing, the game still looks good for being nearly 10 years old, the AI is rather competent (except on Easy where they will routinely abandon planets to go attack with 44 X-Wings into a fleet of Star Destroyers covered by a picket of corvettes) and the campaign is actually fun oddly enough.

Strategically, try to use your faction's advantages to their fullest. Small rebel ground forces are impossible to stop or detect, and can raid and conquer poorly defended imperial worlds with ease. Imperial fleets are exceedingly powerful, get free fighters with their ships, and need to play mind games with a foe to ensure their many fronts become a liability. Also remember that taking a planet with a helpful ability is just as sound as taking one that you don't want your foes to have.

As Zann, Corruption allows you to move fleets past other planets' defenses, meaning you can ship forces behind enemy lines and exaggerate the too many fronts problems the empire has. Pay close attention to types of corruption, too; some kinds generate massive amounts of money. Use your superiority fighters, shield-ignoring mass drivers, and take care of your superweapons to stay ahead. If the Empire makes the Death Star II, you can permanently kill it with IG-88, and it'll also destroy any planet or fleet the death star is over. Darth Vader in the Executor can easily be ignored, and you should just attempt to take planets it isn't on rather than address it with weaker fleets. Take lots of bombers!

What makes SW:EAW so good for 2019 are the mods, literally no one plays the vanilla game anymore without mods.
PROS:
-very fun gameplay, lots of strategy involved, and in space combat there is probably more strategy than in any other rts scifi game i have ever seen.
-very fun, challenging, but not too hard galactic conquest mode where you conquer the galaxy on a massive scale, there are legit hundreds of things you have to watch out for: tech level, possible locations of enemy large fleets, order of conquering planets and keeping in mind their specialties (which most planets have), sizes, possible defences etc, unit buildings, defending your worlds, and a lot of other things
-with mods like the remake mod, thrawn's revenge, awakening of the rebbelion, yoden mod you can make the game feel like a sequel to the vanilla one, and the best of all: the devs for the listed mods are super active and will update them when they have the time to
CONS:
-bad vanilla graphics, but its saved by the fact the game is from 2005
-the unit lists for the vanilla game are quite limited and not so unique
-needs more legends content

overall, if you are a star wars fan who seeks epic strategy battles, and especially space battles, look no further than this classic

14,STARWARS Empireat War GoldPack,56220182,english,"The logged hours is a lie; I've put well over 1000+ hours into this game. As somewhat of an expert, I'll list the pros and cons of getting this, while being as unbiased as I can be with one of my personal favorite games of all time...I'll try, okay?

First off, this is absolutely a Real-Time Strategy (RTS) game first and foremost, and was made back when people actually cared about RTS games. It shows in the gameplay, the strategies you can come up with, and the formation of fleets/garrisons for your space/ground battles. Depending on which version you play, the factions change a bit. If you play the OG Empire at War, you have only the choice between the Empire or Rebellion. If you play the Forces of Corruption expansion, a third faction is added called the Zann Consortium, which helps to make the gameplay a bit less stale and more challenging, though it comes with its own set of problems if you play against the AI as either Empire or Rebellion.

There are two focus points for the game: space and ground combat. Space is where you get the majority of your fun from, as ground combat is a little bit lacking, and defenders have an overwhelming advantage against the poor schmucks on offense. Since my best advice for ground combat is to bring a large compliment of ground troops/vehicles and auto-resolve the conflict to minimize casualties on your side, I'll focus on space combat.

Space combat has several facets to it. Rather than a traditional rock-paper-scissors approach, the developers came up with a unique dynamic between each class of ship, allowing you to mix and match ships to create your ideal fleet composition. You are even able to build individual squadrons of fighters if you feel that the ones provided by your carriers/capital ships are not strong enough/numerous enough. Iconic Star Wars ships such as the Imperial-class Star Destroyer, the Mon Calamari MC80-class Star Cruiser, X-Wings, TIE Fighters and more are included, plus several ships that are not as well-known, but nevertheless fulfill a vital role in fleet composition. You can have as many ships as you are able to build in any single fleet, but there is a limit to how many you are able to deploy onto the battlefield when engaged in combat at any given time. There is also an overall population limit that is determined by the number of planets in your possession, that can also be increased by building and upgrading space stations on those same planets. Both space and ground, in this regard, have set build structure limits for how far you can upgrade space stations (space) and how many ground structures you can have on the planet (ground), usually based off of lore-related reasons (ex: Kessel is less of a planet but more of a planetoid, and does not have a lot of space for ground-based structures. As such, it has very few buildable structures planetside.) This prevents you from building endlessly and dragging the game on forever, something that I'll be covering in a bit.

Naturally everything costs money: ships, troops, vehicles, space stations, etc, so you'll need a stable income. Income is provided via planets in your possession, as well as any complete trade/hyperspace routes you control. Income can be increased on planets via mining facilities. Some planets produce extra income due to outside factors, usually lore-related (ex: Kessel has 2 or 3 ground slots, but due to spice mining has a very high credit production, so dedicating those slots to mining facilities drastically increases the already-high credit production, allowing that planet to produce more credits than another planet may with 3/4/5 build structures). Income is generated on a 'daily' basis: every 'day' that passes deposits credits into your account based off of the total income produced by all of your planets/mining facilities. This income is yours to do with as you please, and will accumulate as 'days' pass if you do not spend any before the end of the next 'day'.

As for in-game time? That's a bit of an issue, and one of the only things really holding this game back. Keep in mind, this was produced around 2006/2007, so there's a limit to what the game can do in terms of extension. The longer the game goes, the more prone it becomes to lagging, crashing, and other system-related issues. Unless you are running an absolute POS computer, this game should run fine for you with no issues until around Day 350. After that, all bets are off. The better your computer, the more likely you are able to push that to Day 400 or even a bit higher, but eventually the built-in system the game runs on will not be able to handle it, and start crashing repeatedly whenever you enter combat, making it unplayable. Again, because this was a game built back during the mid 2000's, it's got some limitations to it. That being said, it shines despite these limitations.

Alright, time for the Pros/Cons List - 

Pros:
-Genuine RTS game
-Based on Star Wars, with references to the lore found all throughout the game.
-Heroes for all factions included. FOC expansion adds new heroes.
-Campaign? It's got a little bit of campaign to go with it, but it's mostly for new players getting started and learning how the mechanics/controls work.
-Flexibility with fleet and garrison customization, allowing for a whole assortment of different playstyles to be utilized.
-Buildable Death Star
-Usable Death Star (yes you can blow up planets with this superweapon in the game, and it's not limited. ANY planet can be a target.)
-Killable Death Star (if you're not the Empire, and want it dead, there are ways to do it, though it'll cost you a Hero. Good news is that the Death Star can't be rebuilt once this option is taken: it's gone for good.)
-Pretty damn good replayability, which is rare nowadays.
-The Modding Community. This game has been out for over a decade, and has a dedicated following of die-hard EAW fans that are, to this day, providing new and exciting mod content that can be used with this game for fresh, fun experiences for those who have already beaten the regular game into the ground and are looking for something new to do with it.

Cons:
-Ground combat is clanky af, and heavily favors defenders. Just slap a large amount of troops/vehicles on the planet you want to take and auto-resolve the headache away.
-Dated graphics. Unless you get a mod pack for them, age has taken its toll. Still a pretty good game visually despite this.
-Dated system. As stated above, the higher that Day count clicks, the more likely you are to encounter in-game issues, nothing of which can be done about it, no matter what type of computer you use.
-Corruption mechanic in FOC. If the AI is given control of the Consortium in FOC, they will spam Corruption on your planets, forcing you to constantly drag your Heroes capable of removing Corruption across the galaxy to cleanse it, as well as costing you credits to purge it from your planets. Failure to do so allows the Consortium free passage through otherwise enemy-controlled territory, and they can send terrorists to blow up your ground bases, weakening your defenses as a result. Can get really annoying really fast for even a hardened veteran.


Overall, I would give this game a SOLID 9.0/10. Despite being aged and having very visible flaws, the fact that it's lasted over a decade and still has a dedicated following of fans that love the game and are willing to spend time and effort to make it even better is, IMHO, a testament to how good this game truly is.",1572659600,1572659600,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,69,5,31028,44,29285,1601781949

It has a mixture of strategic management and RTS tactical battles in a manner similar to total war, and I would absolutely recommend to any fans of that series or wider genre. Whilst old, this game combines good strategic gameplay with satisfying links to star wars lore. I wasn't particularly a star wars fan when i first started playing, I did so for the strategy, but I have become much more of a star wars fan as a result of my time in game.

Besides the base game and expansion, the continued success of empire at war really comes from the excellent community produced mods. There is something here to satisfy everyone. I personally strongly recommend AOTR above all others, although I would recommend getting a through grasp of the base game first since it adds a lot of depth and a steep learning curve to go with it. New mods are still coming out regularly alongside updates to the big popular classics.

In Forces of Corruption, you get the opportunity to play as the Criminal Underworld, or as the game calls them, The Zann Consortium (as well as the Rebels and the Empire).

EaW is basically Total War but in Star Wars. You build your fleets and ground armies and defend/attack planets. You can upgrade your tech level, unlocking new ships to build and new units to recruit. You even get to control iconic characters such as; Darth Vader, Darth Sidious/Emperor Palpatine, Admiral Ackbar (His Home One flagship) and Luke Skywalker (In his X-Wing). Other playable ""heroes"" include; Admiral Piett, Rogue Squadron and Admiral Thrawn.

But the strongest part of EaW is; The Modding Community. With modders like Corey Loses and his team making mods like Thrawn's Revenge and Fall of the Republic (Still not released as of 13th October 2019) the game really is flourishing. They expand on the game and add more mechanics to make a deeper experience. We also have mods like; Republic at War, Empire at War: Remake, Yodenmod and Battlefront Commander that makes the game really enjoyable in multiple playthroughs.

Overall, the game is really fun. The Modding Community really comes in clutch with EaW. But don't get me wrong, Empire at War is good even without mods, but it certainly helps.

 Ground battles

Ground battles are boring. They have no tactics except chase your enemy. Even if you destroy their base, there are bound to be some light speeders or infantry left which is annoying because then you have to look for them around the whole map. This issue isn't that bad because you can just auto resolve and you can win if there are only a small amount of speeders or troops left, But they feel underwhelming. Playing as rebels and are fighting the empire on its last planet? Find and destroy the enemy base then auto resolve. 

However other than that, I totally recommend this game. This is one of the best strategy games I've ever played especially because of the awesome mods for it.

2016 review: Looks great. Lots of cool mods on the internet. The campaigns are fun, and so is the Consortium campaign. You can use strategy, or spam stuff which is easier. The Consortium is overpowered though. Its super annoying when playing against the Consortium.
       The original Empire at War and the Forces of Corruption (FoC) addon are separate, which you can choose when you start the game. The original has the Rebel and Empire campaigns. FoC has the campaign for the Consortium. You can play single player modes on either version.
        Playing galactic conquest as Rebels or Empire is terrible. Easy difficulty is too easy, Medium is too hard. Both sides will not give you any breathing room. Consortium can go to your planet and take over your level 5 space station just by being there. WTF? Is this a bug? Their military power is around 95%, while yours is around 30% - 60% if you try on easy mode. I have no choice but to do auto-resolve with a very large force when attacking Consortium on land because they spam tanks and long range torpedoes which can wipe out anything you throw at them.
       You can control the super star destroyer, Executor, but only in galactic conquest. The icon looks like Darth Vader. In space, Vader is the Executor. On land Vader is himself ofcourse. You can use the 2nd Death Star which has the ability to destroy any enemy ship, but only in galactic conquest.

- Doesn't function - the two top-most game options ('Singleplayer' & 'Tutorial') on the start screen are unclickable. This is replicated for every screen, meaning that although the user can access the 'Multiplayer' tab, they cannot choose either of the options - 'Internet' or LAN.

To fix this bug, go to the the directory in which the game is installed (by default, 'C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Star Wars Empire at War\GameData') and run the Compatibility Troubleshooter on 'StarWarsG.exe'. That should fix it - if not, manually change the compatibility settings to Windows 7.

- When editing graphical settings an error appears requiring a restart of the game (although most settings that are changed are saved).


However, past the under-the-hood issues due to incompatibility with newer Windows OSs, the game itself is actually very compelling. 

For instance, it is surprisingly realistic regarding its Space Battle mechanics - the use of ion fields and gas clouds that hinder certain abilities of the ships passing through them helps push tactical gameplay over brute force.",1562404065,1570286876,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,25,3,59,0,6,1570286639

91,STARWARS Empireat War GoldPack,48633157,english,"I clicked possitive recommend for Empire at War, but I am actually on the fence about this game. It's fun to play the Empire, but not so fun to play the Rebellion.

Playing the Empire is what a conquest game should be. Build huge fleets, massive armies and conquer orbital systems and planet locals. The problem with the Rebellion is the raid fleets. Often times it's too costly to try and defeat Imperial fleets in orbit of Imperial controlled worlds, especially when there is an orbital ion cannon on that planet's surface. You might win but at a huge cost to your own fleet, and the Rebellion can't afford huge losses like the Empire can. So the Rebels can instead sneak three ground units onto the planet in what's called a ""raid fleet"". If you make smart use of building turrets and bacta healing stations on the ground, a small raid fleet can liberate a planet from a much larger force. But is it fun? It's much slower and tedious because you have to destroy the Empire's forces little by little. It's not fun playing the Rebellion because unless you're playing  on normal difficulty, you can't afford to throw your forces at the Empire and fight them head on. Instead you must slowly chip away at their larger resources little by little.

The other problem I have is the Rebellion and Empire can't face each other full force in space or ground battles. Each side has a max limit to how many units can enter battle and the rest of your forces can only join as reinforcements as your units are destroyed.

Lastly is the difficulty settings themselves. On ""normal"" it's much to easy and hard difficulty is much too difficult. I want to like this game because it's so close to being something great. It just doesn't do it for me.

And while this game may not have as advanced mechanics as many other top sci-fi space strategy titles, it definitely provides very immersive experience and very atmospheric battles, filled with units and heroes from the original trilogy (Emperial and Rebels) while having the original soundtrack playing in the background. Unlike many space strategies it also has land battles on the planet surfaces and while the game economy system is somewhat primitive the galactic conquest mode is as enjoyable as much as the skirmish mode, though I myself do prefer the latter. However it should be noted that some game mechanics can only truely manifest themselves in the galactic conquest, such as blowing planets with the Death Star. The FoC expansion provides interesting additional faction and some additional units and abilities. 
What really keeps this game popular is the Republic at War fan-made addon (available in the workshop), which features clone war era factions (Republic clones and Separatist droids) with many interesting units and locations.

You get space battles with iconic ships, and ground battles with the same.

Yes the game is outdated by this point in terms of graphics.
Yes the game can be a little weird here and there or rough.
But the most important thing is it is trying its best ok...

The mods for this game however are really what keep this game alive and will probably keep it alive for as long as steam exists. You can play the clone wars with the Republic at war mod, and fight as clones or droids. Or play with new units and improved graphics with the Empire at war Remake mod to the point it is a new game that was just released.

66,STARWARS Empireat War GoldPack,54134037,english,"Star Wars Empire at War can quite possibly be the best Star Wars RTS game or even Sci-Fi RTS game of all time and rightfully so. EAW brings about space and ground RTS in a very unique and pleasurable way. not only to Star Wars fans, but fans of RTS games. The game has a massive amount of units to command, great locations and maps to battle on, nice graphics (remember this is an old game) and beautiful music. Gameplay mechanics are very easy to understand and playing it is a joy. 

The main factions of EAW is the Rebellion and the Galactic Empire and another faction, the Zann Consortium, was added in the Forces of Corruption Expansion. You have command of many units from each faction such as your Stormtroopers, X-Wings, ATAT's and such but even some units from the expanded universe of Star Wars such as Tie Defenders and Dark Troopers. Alongside your main forces you have access to Heroes to join you on the field. The heroes are vast and very different from one another. You can have Darth Vader, Obi Wan, Luke and the Emperor, but also other heroes such as Tarkin, Piett and many more. Vehicle Heroes are what make the brute strength of your forces by having an enhanced ATAT or a Star Destroyer commanded by the best Admiral of the Empire or even have Red Squadron take on a multiple squadrons for Tie Fighters. 

The game has a great story which can be played from both sides and a very detailed galactic conquest campaigns which span from certain events in the Galactic Civil War such as the Outer rim, Hoth and the Rebel Uprising to complete domination of the Galaxy. Managing your forces and resources and which battalion should go where will make you feel like a real commander. There are also skirmish modes to create your own battles.

Music is great as it is Star Wars and the graphics are nice and clean, which is great considering how old this game is.The game has two areas of gameplay, On planet and Space. Each one is self explanatory with planet battles involving soldiers and vehicles and space battles involving star ships and capital ships.

But the area where I believe this game excels at is with the units and the amount of detail that was put into them. Soldiers have a cast amount of options and upgrades to them from training in the weather to weapon handling. Vehicles can be damaged and lose access to weapons and must be repaired. Star ships and Capital ships are the main attraction to detail. Each gun on a capital ship is seen and I mean EVERY GUN AND CANNON. You have missile launchers, proton torpedo launchers, concussion laucnhers, batteries, broadside cannons and such, each one firing and each one being able to be destroyed. Bridges, Shied Generators, hangers and such are part of each ship and have their own role to play. A Victory class Star Destroyer for example has around 20 hit points and critical areas which help the ship operate. Damaging its engines will slow it down and not allow it to retreat into hyperspace for example. A nice touch is that all major ships such as Star Destroyers and such have their own name so it adds a form of personality to each ship. 

The amount of lore in this game is just amazing. You will spend more time looking at the units that actually commanding them. If you are Star Wars fan you MUST get this and if you are a fan of RTS you MUST get this. 

Thanks to a great modding community, there are many mods for this game such as the Republic at war mod which converts the game to the clone wars where you can control the clones or the CIS. Mods which add more units and gameplay and better textures are always welcoming and make each playthrough a new and exciting one.",1563305493,1563305493,TRUE,7,0,0.578163743,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,53,22,3087,0,3087,1563281651

I started playing this game way back in 2008 on the family IMac. Haven’t stopped playing it since haha. I purchased the steam version a few weeks ago after losing the product key for my physical disks. I love the workshop mods and I extremely recommend checking those out if you can! 
Let’s get down to the review though haha. 
This is by far one of the best RTS games I have ever played to date. The fact that it’s also a Star Wars game is a big bonus to me. The game and units are very well made and balanced during gameplay. I love the fact that it has a battle camera for a cinematic experience if you get bored and just want to sit back for a bit. Also love how you can select a unit and follow them via the camera as well (press C with selected unit). Honestly in terms of graphics the game has aged pretty well, you can also download mods that enhance the graphics as well. But I find playing the original very charming as well. 
And honestly for the price you can’t beat it considering that the free workshop mods can give you hundreds of additional hours of story and campaign as well as new units, maps, and planets to explore! This game is a must have for any RTS or Star Wars fan. It’s a pretty basic RTS so it’s definitely good if you’re new to the genre as well. 
Hope this helps!
Thanks

My only complaints are some clunkiness and lack of polish in some spots, but the mods generally fix some of these things.

I think it has it's flaws(ground combat just isn't on as big of a scale as I'd like compared to the amazing space combat). But all and all I wish was that this game gets a successor in the future so that the mechanics in game can be expanded upon, especially the hard points on ships in space combat. 

Overall I believe that this game is great for any star wars fan that likes rts games as well, besides the mods for this game are great, many either expand the Galactic Civil War era or add the Clone Wars in one way or another

Playing in multiplayer is very fun in either of the two. Now that it has Workshop support, mods make the battles much more interesting by adding even more units, heroes, and reworking some of the in-game mechanics.

Notes:
 - Really enjoy the campaigns; if you've played Galactic Conquest on SW Battlefront II (2005), you'll notice some similarities.
 - When playing multiplayer matches with my friends, we do have issues sometimes, of someone's connection being lost randomly; I can't really say concretely if it was a bug in the game though.

The space battles are fantastic, with open options about how you want them to go. They can be quick some times (e.g. just charge everything you have at the enemy until they fall.) or can be drawn out and result in limited losses by use of sophisticated strategies  (easier in the FoC expansion). However, ground battles tend to be longer in the early game and very one sided in the late game due to the rebel speeders.

33,STARWARS Empireat War GoldPack,52190850,english,"""Hello, there!""

I will leave it to this game's store page to inform you about its details.  This review is more of an opinion/perspective - maybe a piece of the puzzle that will help you decide if you want to get the game.

Considering this game came out a number of years ago, I still find it quite enjoyable.  It's designed fairly well for the era of gaming it comes from.  The interface, learning curve, ability to play and RE-play the game is good.  It has a low level of complexity compared to current strategy games, so you can see this as a positive or negative.

Some of the downsides are:  (1) the ""computer players"" you face have inconsistent strategies (I wouldn't exactly call the computer-controlled factions ""A.I."" considering the year this was released) and they have the advantage of doing things rapidly because, well, it's all just executing variables, (2) controlling certain units can be problematic, both in the land and space battles - some follow commands better than others, (3) sometimes units do their own thing despite the instructions they are given.

Back to positive, this game has many of the Expanded Universe details incorporated into the game.  However, a person who doesn't like or understand ""Star Wars"" may not find the game as enjoyable.  Either way it really depends on whether or not you appreciate the ""retro"" aspects of the game - to each their own.",1561842463,1561842463,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,41,1,18933,0,16023,1600484213

59,STARWARS Empireat War GoldPack,52037962,english,"Tl;Dr: Good Strategy Game, Space good, Mods good, land battles bad. 8/10

Star Wars is often a series where its video game renditions come in 2 flavors, terrible, or fantastic. On the terrible end of the 
spectrum you find games such as [i] Star Wars Kinect [/i] and [i] Star Wars: The Clone Wars: Republic Heroes [/i], while on the excellent end of the spectrum you tend to find games such as the original [i] Star Wars Battlefront 2 [/i] and the [i] Lego Star Wars [/i] series.

This game falls definitely on the good side of that spectrum.

[The Overall]
This is because Empire at War is very much an excellent strategy game, with its highlights primarily being in the space battles and the modding community which has been around forever.

[Strategy]
The overall grand strategy elements are relatively simple, take the planets until your opponents are gone, but where the game truly shines tends to be in its battles, where tactical minds and proper decision making can make or break a battle at higher difficulties. Space Battles are probably the greatest highlight to be seen in this game, as they are a marvel to both watch and command.

Land battles tend to be where this game catches the most flak, and the flak is well deserved unfortunately. You will usually find yourself slogged down against any opponent when you are playing a land battle, and it is very difficult, even for some mods, to make the land battles entertaining. There are also certain units which are particularly unbalanced in land combat (The Rebel artillery comes to mind) although they aren't 100% broken.

[Graphics]
This is a game made in 2005ish, and looks the part, however there are a multitude of mods on the workshop which usually have graphical improvements as part of it, otherwise if you're not looking to mod it's definitely going to look like an older game.

[Story]
The basegame is incredibly light on story, and the campaigns for both sides are usually just little missions between your conquering of enemy planets, however the FOC expansion is definitely heavier on story in its campaign, and actually offers a pretty decent campaign experience, with unique missions that you wouldn't see in the basegame campaigns.

[Balancing]
The base-game is relatively balanced, I have not heard any particular rumblings about it or found any overpowered units off the top of my head (The Rebel Artillery tends to wipe out units, even ones meant to counter it, relatively quickly but that's it) and every unit tends to have a counterpart on the other side, making both sides feel similar, but also different as each unit gets slight quirks.

The FOC expansion however, introduced the Consortium, which is nearly broken. In the grand campaign they can undergo missions to get useful benefits on the planet. (Turning the locals to their side, getting new units, making money off of killed units in battle) The Consortium units also tend to have a lot more powerful traits when the proper tech is stolen, with bombers that can disappear on radar, fighters launching anti-fighter/corvette buzz droids, a self destructing destroyer, and a ship which can literally just steal the shield off of another ship.

While fun to play as, there's a reason there are several mods to remove the Consortium from the FOC expansion.

[Fun Factor]
I have played this game way too much, and can confirm I very much enjoy it. If you're looking for more than just being a tactician the game is light on much else, but I did find using the Ewok Suicide-Bombers to be very much enjoyable.

[Modding Scene]
If you're looking to escape the Rebels Vs. Empire scene, or just want an expansion, you'll find many mods on the workshop to accommodate your tastes.

The big 2 you will want to look at are: [i] Thrawn's Revenge [/i] and [i] Republic at War [/i], the first takes place in the (now legends) Imperial Civil War, featuring hero permadeath, unique units and campaign requirements, and sometimes even fleets that will try to third-party you. The second sets the game in the Clone Wars and is known for being incredibly hard (Although I believe they've been attempting to balance that) even on easy difficulty.

A couple others I enjoy are [i] The Clone Wars [/i] and [i] Battlefront Commander [/i], The Clone Wars takes more inspiration from the 2008 TV Show, and is probably the best in terms of Land Combat, meanwhile Battlefront Commander is a bit of an amalgamation of different mods that both expands the vanilla game, and also introduces the Clone Wars.

It's up to you on how you want to play this game, modded or unmodded, but you'll definitely find that certain mods can really truly improve the game.",1561823570,1561823610,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,146,3,20766,0,16765,1600826007

This game is rather like the original DOW or MOW games in that the vanilla game has some balancing issues. FOC's Zann Consortium is the worst offender of the factions. However, this is not an e-sport, so balance doesn't make or break the experience. I can testify that all factions are still a riot to play as despite the balance though. But the base game is not what gave me over 250 hours in this game.

There exists a HUGE library of mods for this game. Mods like Republic at War, Imperial Civil War, and Awakening of the Rebellion come to mind. These mods not only make the game more in-depth, with many more units for each faction and varied play styles, but also tend to give many new maps, bigger campaigns, and several improvements to gameplay and balance. There also exist mods like 1 credit 1 second for those who just want to show up the filthy rebels' doorstep with 12 Executor SSDs and a Death Star.

-Zann Consortium: Interesting, as it puts a spin on the typical 'command & conquer' style. Utilizing unique tech and abilities to make up for the more expensive units.

Multiplayer:
-If you can find another willing play, great. Though, I hear the Consortium is overpowered in multiplayer. ;)

I hopped on the Imperial side and started churning out soldiers and vehicles of war, every time I saw a new unit I googled it to get more information and lore on the thing. Aside from it showing you what various machines are used in the series - from the obscure to the common - it's also a very fun strategy game. You must manage the nation's internal struggles such as the economy and architectural management, aswell as have a formidible army and fleet. You gotta also plan ahead when you attack, because if your fleet gets decimated carrying a large army sent to attack a planet, then not only did you lose a large amount of troops and ships, but it will be a major setback in your future conquests and it leaves the planet the troops originated from wide open to conquest, giving the enemy a vital upper hand.

75,STARWARS Empireat War GoldPack,50883047,english,"One of my favorite games of all time. Back in 2008, I think, I got my hands on a CD containing the game prior to obtaining the steam version, and I played it for a really really long time.
While I personally favor the standard EaW without the FOC-Expansion, I must say that it's pretty much obligatory to buy the DLC - just because of the amount of fantastic mods one gets access to (shoutout to Republic At War).

SW:EAW(FOC) provides you with countless hours of game experience. Wether you want to hone the perfect ground based assault tactics, conquer the entire galaxy in a massive campaign or, simply, just want to experience some good 'ol Star Wars vibes, this game is my go-to for it.
The basis, EAW, is rock-solid, straightforward and very immersive. While other strategy games definitely add more to it with mechanics like harvesting special resources, obtaining diplomatic relationships, customizable units etc. and very well do many aspects even better, to me, SW:EAW sticks out because within it's borders, it allows you a lot of freedom to play around. 

Your primary objective is to get credits by any means necessary, in order to allow you to reinforce your army. Secondly, you are required to expand across the galaxy due to a max. population threshold. In the early stages of a campaign, this measure always creates a certain tension; you never know if your decision to unlock a certain unit, your assault on this specific planet and so on might just bite you in your butt a couple of minutes later.
The different properties of every planet are done in a simple, but, to me, great way.
The battles themselves are fun. Plain and simple. While I do think that in the original, some things might be a bit unbalanced (empire: 1 AT-AT for heavy firepower, 1 AT-AA as anti-air/rocket, SPM-Ats for Anti-Infantry and anything else for suppressive fire/advancing is the meta strategy I came up with to ensure victory in pretty much any cenario), there are still many options for the other fraction to retaliate and even push back your seemingly perfect assault/defense. 

The expansion pack, however, adds enough content that I would pretty much regard it as it's own game.
Honestly, I did not mess around with FOC as much as EAW (since on my original CD, the FOC-Expansion was corrupted, sadly), but it manages to add just the right amount of complexity (corruption, different means of gaining resources, a wonderfully creative concept of expanding your influence across the galaxy via requiring you at several occasions to complete mini-missions) which the original was lacking to make it better in any way - even if it's not as straightforward any longer.
The new units, campagnes and systems are brilliant. Even though the imbalance continues in the DLC (looking at your spaceships, Zann-Empire), personally, I think it's more than manageable - especially if you like a challenge from time to time.



All in all I have to say: I'm not a fan of strategy games, never was, probably never will be. But SW:EAW(FOC) is the exception to the rule. 
I definitely recommend buying, at any price given. Even without the workshops' mods to FOC, it is worth every penny and I never regretted buying.

-Control massive armies of iconic Star Wars units and wreck havoc on enemies
-Galactic Conquest modes provide every strategy fan's need, from unit management to planetary priority.
-Instant Action battles allow you to jump into single battles with up to 8 AI's on 3 different factions
-Vast Modding Community offers a millions of ways to spice up the game, from new maps to new units to entire gameplay overhauls.
-Includes Empire at War, with it's two campaigns that offer a brand new insight into the A New Hope era, and Forces of Corruption which brings in a brand new faction and a brand new campaign that expands the Star Wars universe in ways not often done before.

Cons
-Low Multiplayer community means you'll be stuck against AI most of the time
-Is not quite optimized for stronger hardware, and thus FPS lag and crashes can be frequent.

I actively look forward to playing this game often. I realize that I'm not super incredible at it, but when I complete a battle(especially a land battle, considering I'm so shit at them,)  I get really happy, and keep attempting to play more and more.

Losing a planet or battle too, though it can be demoralizing during certain cases, is not that problematic. As you play more, you realize that you can always gain this planet back, and perhaps its best to move your forces elsewhere and find a new strategy in order to defeat the Empire or Zann factions.

Mods are also amazing. Mods like Republic at War and Thrawn's Revenge are amazing, and give us new ways to look at the game, and how to play. I enjoy a game of the mod ""Awakening of the Rebellion"" as I have to play more tactically and think harder, which as a mod like ""Thrawn's Revenge"" lets me relax for a little bit, and screw around.

26,STARWARS Empireat War GoldPack,49064769,english,"When I first played this game I was a young lad. I was 'garbage' at it however, as the kids these days say. I actually had the CD copy of it. I always found one thing weird about it. Whenever I played it long enough, or tried to boot up the expansion Forces of Corruption, my computer went black and had to be hard rebooted. This was most frustrating. 
I gave the game a rest for a few years however and got back into it a few years ago. So I wanted to try it again now that it was on steam and had multiplayer, but was nervous to try it on a computer of my own. In case the black screen glitch came back again. But I did it, and it worked!
I wondered if it had something to do with the CD copy I owned so I went on the search for it. And one day while searching through my room, I found it! It took some hard work, but I did find it! 
Now it was a pain in the butt to install, between the two separate disks needed for the base game and expansion, but the access codes were the most annoying part. The weird thing however, when I put in the code for the expansion pack, I didn't notice at first or when I was younger was when you enter it in, Jabba the Hutt appears on screen being choked to death by a princess Leia 3D model. This was really weird and not what I was expecting upon entering this game, but I brushed it off. I was far too excited to get caught up in a weird image. George Lucas was a weird guy anyway so I figured he was putting it in as a joke. 
That's when I got hit with so much nostalgia it made me have to pee! I went to the bathroom and was excited to get back to the game, which had loaded in. All I missed was seeing the iconic Petroglyph logo pass by and LucasArts appear as the menu faded in. I was hit with a sweet yellow HUD and a sick rock beat that made me very excited to play the game! So I tried to jump into a match right away. 
When loading it up, I had three team options for skirmish and over a dozen maps, 6 maps for Galactic Conquest, and a unique story mode! So in order to better learn how the game worked, I wanted to try campaign. So I loaded it up and heard a booming voice yell ""Everyone, has a price."" 
I started off in a prison yard, with the story's pirate hero locked in a cell. No, not Watto or Jabba, but this white haired fellow named Tyber Zann. He was planning a breakout and a bounty hunter was on his way to end his life sent by none other than Jabba himself, but something happened when the hunter arrived. He was a completely naked sprite. This was weird thing to me as the hunter sounded like he was wearing a helmet with a robotic voice, but was just a naked human with very defined features I didn't know were available for 2006 games. It was nice however that I couldn't see anything gross and the hunter wasn't on screen for long. 
After this the game really took off. I got to conquer planets with my fleets and had a string of victories over weaker worlds owned by the crimelord Jabba. After taking him out of the picture and taking over his droid factories, I was moving onto the Empire. Which was odd to me as the Empire was being abnormally quiet to this growing threat. But I did weird find a glitch or an easter egg on the planet Yavin 4 on the land where I was battling on land and the Empire landed and I could see the Death Star 1 in orbit above the planet, but in space it had already been destroyed. It made the mission more challenging, but it was a fun time still facing the Empire and Rebellion in the same battle, something I'd never done before. And seeing them interact was entertaining. 
Back into space, Batropia, a planet I'd never heard of was the location of the next mission. The mission made me feel uncomfortable, we had to kidnap Princess Leia and hold her for ransom. Now I didn't mind the other missions involving slavery or whatnot as it is just random characters and a video game about Star Wars and messed up things happen often here, but why Princess Leia? We had never taken action against the Rebellion previously either. So this was my first battle against the canon protagonists. 
On the planet I found a burnt down forest. And a big rebel base atop it. With dead bears, animals and other animals I hadn't previously seen in any star wars stories or movies. This was also a side of the rebels I hadn't seen before. They were burning the forest and animals alive. All being overseen by the woman I was there to collect, Princess Leia. She was standing atop a float laughing as she watched the wildlife burn. This instantly made my mission make sense. She had to be stopped. We were the good guys in this story. The Rebellion were monsters. I was going to end this planet's suffering. 
I sent in IG-88 first to lay found some fire and cover my larger slower ships as they landed. But instead of IG88 being landed, it was a C3PO model. This was weird as it had IG88's voice, but that was it. There was no R2D2 or anything. Just a gold C3PO droid model. 
I was shaken by this as he had no gun and was quickly killed by the rebellion forces already closing on my landing site. So I tried bringing out Bossk, who again, was not himself. He was instead a womprat. 
""What the hell...."" I thought as I paused the game to collect my thoughts.
This game has to be broken or messing with me. Maybe my mind is messing with me. So I unpaused the game and saw the battle was apparently still going on even with me pressing pause! My base was burnt to the ground and the rebels were moving all over my landing zone and Leia was laughing as she pointed to me calling me a failure!
What the heck was going on here?!
So Tyber told me, ""we failed, but we will get her on her next route."" But as I looked back to the map, the entire planet I was previously on had imploded and turned to a floating cloud of dust on the galactic map. This was insane! They had burnt the planet to a crisp! But why?! That's when I saw the rebellion heading to their home base on Hoth, which had appeared on the map as a Fire Planet, such as Mustafar or Sullust. I was staying as far away as possible from that place. God knows how Hellish that landscape had to be for these sick and twisted Rebels to be here. 
Instead I moved onto the Empire as my target, but the planets on the map had seemingly disappeared.... What the... all that was left was Coruscant and Hoth, then Ryloth, my home base. The other 40 or so planets had all vanished! How could I complete this game when the map kept changing. And my only mission in the log now was ""Kill the Emperor.""
This was so confusing. Why had it skipped so many steps and done what seems to be an end game mission. But I wanted to beat it and have bragging rights over my friends to say I beat the disk copy of this legendary game so I went on and made a fleet to invade Coruscant.

My initial impression could scarcely have been more wrong!
Upon buying the game, and installing a mod or 2, I found myself spending countless hours completely engrossed by it.
Granted the vanilla game, (and Forces of Corruption expansion) while still very playable and enjoyable, DOES leave a lot to be desired... 
But the Empire at War modding community is as robust as it is amazing! With dozens of mods to choose from.. it's a game that has near infinite replay value.
There are simple empire/game tweak mods, as well as full conversion mods that make it feel like an entirely different game.

58,STARWARS Empireat War GoldPack,45890603,english,"Ok, I have put enough time into this game to give it a review that I think is pretty fair.

I have like 140 ish hours on here I probably spent 40 on vanilla, 70 On Thrawn's revenge, 20 on Republic at War, and 10 hours on AoTR and TCW mods. 

Vanilla is an experience, play it to learn the game but after beating the campaign or playing some galactic conquest try modding.

Thrawn's Revenge fixes my problems with the game and then some. The mod has no campaign but a 20 something year galactic conquest where you can play as many different Imperial warlord groups, the New Republic, The Empire, and The Hand of Thrawn. Ships are re-balanced, given more guns or fighter bays etc. Ground combat gets a lot of crap for being boring but this mod gives it some life. Getting to use multiple new units like Jedi Knights, many new vehicles and whatever the Hand of Thrawn gets makes teh ground combat ok.
I really think of this mod as a fixed version of EAW's issues, and it is from the New Republic era which is my favorite, so getting to use Wedge in the  [i]Lusankya[/i] or Luke Skywalker and Mara Jade as ground units is really fun.

There is sooo much I need to say, so buy this game, download a mod for whatever Era you like, play it and have a good time!

61,STARWARS Empireat War GoldPack,48693071,english,"Star Wars Empire at War isn't just an RTS game with the Star Wars name slapped on it. It truly is ambitous in what it sets out to do but unfortunately it doesn't quite excell at everything it does but it is a great game overall. 

The games core structure isn't played mission by mission on isolated maps like in most RTS campaigns. Instead you take over planets by either epic space battles or not so epic land battles via a huge conquest map filled with planets. 

This large scale map is very similiar to what's in Civilization or Total War games but in this case, when you make decisions on the map, like reinforcing units and building stuff, it all takes place in Real-time just like the battles so it adds a layer of tension not present in the standard TBS style Conquest ""Risk"" style maps seen in those other two games. You can be attacked at any time when building stuff.

In regards to how the space and land battles flow from this design, it dramatically changes the flow of gameplay that most people are used in RTS's. For instance, whatever land forces you have when you invade another planet that you got by building on planets that you already have conquered is what you will have for that invasion - there's no reinforcements or building more units on that planet's map after you invade.

 So you'll be limited to what you chose to invade with which adds a lot of tension and focus on more tactical play for ground invasions. You cannot just queue up more units from structures on the ground because you have limited resources to work with when you actually assault another planet in order to conquer it whether it's by space or by land. 

When getting to how both space and land battles work in tandem, if a planet has a space fleet of any kind or size guarding it (virtually all planets do), you'll first have to destroy the space fleet otherwise they'll just destroy all of your troop transports carrying your land forces before they land. 

it's a very dynamic element that still hasn't been seen in any modern RTS. 

When it comes to talking about the actual execution of both types of battles, space and land, one is more enjoyable than the other without a doubt. 

While both types of battles are balanced to a great degree, Space battles are more fun to play. They are a spectacle to watch and the gameplay is smooth.

Land battles are janky and not as responsive in comparison to the better executed Space battle.

Despite the fact that you get to see pretty cool hero Units like Darth Vader, Luke Skywalker on the ground duking it out with other well modeled star wars characters and units that we all love, the responsiveness, handling, and just overal feel of combat leaves a lot to be desired. Combat lacks the same punch and impact that the space battles offer and I feel that the units in space battles respond a lot faster to my commands. That's not to say that Land battles are incredibly laggy: they aren't. It's just that they lack the scope and overall polish that space battles do. 

Overall, Star Wars Empire at War has aged rather well, because with the exception of Homeworld Shipbreakers, there has been a drought of good RTS games and if you're looking for a good solo RTS experience, then this game will most likely satisfy you. 

+ Space Battles
+ Galactic Conquest Risk-like Map
+ It's Star Wars
+ Dynamic Flow of Engagement and Battle Structure

- Land Battles need more polishing

This is something of a spiritual successor to Rebellion. 
It is not Rebellion. 
There's planetary base building, but that's more just wait for money, wait for build time and then build the next level thing. 
There's a ground based RTS component which I'm pretty sure is just a straight up port of the doomed Star Wars: Force Commander and isn't particularly fun to play. (Especially because the Rebels can pull some straight up bull shit)
But the space RTS. Praise the Maker! It is exquisite. A true delight. The only flaw in Rebellion was the space combat simulator - if someone could put these two things together then you can have all my money. 

The Forces at War expansion adds a lot of fun stuff (like the Executor) but also adds a third faction, The Zann Consortium who are ridiculously overpowered to the point of breaking the game. 

So why am I giving this a positive review? Well because of the space combat for one thing, because I want to see a reboot of Rebellion for another. But worth mentioning is the mod scene for this game. The mods are incredible. Some of them are the equivalent of what War of the Chosen did for X-Com 2. Some of them make it an entirely different game. If the basic premise of Empire at War felt good but you hated the execution (ie me) then there exists a mod which will tickle your fancy.

A strategy game in every sense of the word, you'll build fleets to combat the enemy in space, then gather your ground forces to fight a ground war take control of the planet. The campaigns offer a fantastic story leading up to Episode IV, and the skirmishes offer a good deal more to play.

I can succesfully say in 1 hour, This is the only strategy game I have 0 clue what im doing. I know the bare, bones, basic controls but theres no ""A-move"" you have to manually click attack move, then right click. Even then your fleet of ships is inevidibly dead. This doesnt make it a bad game, but I have 0 clue of the controls explaind to me. I will say, for 2006, this looks excellent. 

However, I will give the controls a pass. This isnt your standard Relic RTS, the controls are a bit different and thats my issue. I cant transition into this game like any other RTS with knowlege of what im doing, then learn the armor types, weapon types, etc. Its just ""ah yes you press a button and hope for the best"" Playing medium AI on Galactic Conquest just yeilds more questions of whats going on. The AI will ram into your bases with a stack of ships whilst you think about ""wat do"" because you dont know what to do. After 1 hour though I've learned the basic amount of controls to say, succesfully, this game? I dont quite like the ground combat. You call down units from reinforcement points. That's it. Neat but. Still weird. The space combat was neat but it was ""whoever presses the power up button the most wins"" and most the time the AI slamming my ships with stacks, knowing full well what it was doing, crippled my production. 1 minor slip up, sent me back to the main menu to restart galactic conquest again. Again. Its not a bad game. I full well enjoyed everything in it. But its a very, basic, and entangled RTS. the controls are way different than any other RTS, and I came away still barely knowing what to do. I will revist this game another rainy day and attempt galactic conquest again. And no, Easy AI is for Panzys.

oh and as for game modes you have Skirmish, which pits your pre-built base against the AI's pre-built base. I didnt bother to go further than that. And then you have, ehm. Galactic Conquest. In which you hold, and attack sectors. I was too confused to go forward to learn how to attack more planets, or defend mine better so I just super stacked the standard Imperial Frigate, then swarmed the AI with the frigates ability to increase damage on its main attack, and millions of teensy TIE fighters. I can imagine with a friend this game would be fun. And seeing as its last update according to the console was 2017, and I saw internet games, Im going to go on a limb and say this is a passion project. Maybe not super passion. But the devs still somewhat care about it enough to make it work in 2017.

[list]
[*]Visuals were amazing at the time and are serviceable by today's standards. 
[*]The RTS components are on three levels. On the galactic scale, you manage the economy, unit construction, and positioning fleets and armies in a real-time environment. Planets have bonuses and strategic bonuses (and their locations). Then there are space battles and land battles. 
[*]There are story campaigns for the Empire, Rebellion, and a third faction in the expansion, known as the Consortium (space pirates).
[*]Instant action allows you to just battle in space or on land, as you destroy the opponent's base or space station. 
[*]In galactic conquest, there is more strategy involved, but it remains accessible. For instance, having bombers over a planet allows you do perform bombing runs in the land battle. There are different maps with different objectives and rules.
[*]There is a focus on macro-management. You command groups of units, rather than individual soliders or tanks. This makes the battles much easier to keep track of and unit stacks much easier to manage on the galactic map. 
[*]You don't have to gather specific resources, unlike other RTS games of its day. Instead you just use credits, which are awarded in many ways. Simple. 
[*]Instead of just targeting an enemy battleship, you can target specific components on the ship itself for a more tactical approach. Knocking out heavier guns or the shield generator first will turn the tide of battles. It also insures no one can just build large amounts of a single type of unit. Everything has a counter and it is all well-balanced. 
[*]Good unit variety without being stale, and without going overboard with too much (unlike Total War).
[*]Good learning curve.
[*]Great mod and community support. 
[/list]

Cons
[list] 
[*]The A.I. is not very good. The only thing the difficulty changes is how fast they get money and how many units they throw at you. On the galactic scale, the A.I. is pretty bad, while in space and on land, the A.I. has better performance. Overall most fun will be had against other players via LAN or online. 
[*]There are more units and weapons in this game than meet the eye, but you have to dive into the XML files to unlock the units that are already in the game. Things like Venator Star Destroyers, V-Wings, hidden additional weapons on various units that are deliberately turned off, etc are already there but were hidden away. 
[*]For people who are devoted to canon, many ships have fewer weapons than they should have, and this is probably because of system limitations and balance.

This is prolly my favourite Star Wars game ever. I remember coming home from Middle School back when this game was new and hopping on the computer to play with my friends at school in multiplayer stuff. Either killing eachother or killing the AI. It was good times.

Booted this game up again and it's still just as good 12 years later. I'm someone who really appreciated Star Wars' EU, and some of the vehicles and ships in this game turned out to be some of my favourite pieces of equipment in Star Wars (SPMAT's, Assault Frigate Mark II, The Eclipse, etc). The campaigns are great, dicking around with friends is great, and the game itself plays like butter. It's smooth, easy to learn, extremely interesting and rewarding to succeed in, and at times hilarious to fail in. 

To this day it's still my favourite RTS, even beating out classics like Age of Empires II. And hell some of the mods people have made for this game truly show how creative Star Wars fans can be, as well as their understanding of the Star Wars universe. 

Great game from a much better time. We'll never get memorable classic titles like this for Star Wars ever again. Thankfully it'll always be here for us to enjoy, where Disney-Lucasfilm can't touch it.

Pros-
Long gameplay, a single galactic conquest could take a couple days with breaks in between.
Multiplayer, since the shutdown of gamespy it's been difficult to play multiplayer but with programs like gameranger you still can and it is VERY enjoyable.
Battles, the battles are VERY fun but can sometimes get repetitive but thanks to the still active modding community and the DLC, this problem is solved.
The tactics and strategy aspect, I, personally, am in LOVE with strategy and tactics and this game is full of it. A corvette cant beat a star destroyer head on but put that corvette in a ambush like position and it might stand a chance!
Star Wars, must I really explain this part?
The unpaid DLC, the DLC is very enjoyable with new units and a new side. Insteading of running around with stormtroopers why not run around with stormtroopers AND giant robots!

Cons
Repeat, this game can get very boring since the gameplay is limited to half a dozen land and space units on each side so it gets boring. But thanks to modding and the DLC it can be fixed.
Modding on steam, its a bit annoying when installing mods on steam because you have to download the mod and find the steam folder and install it there them mess around the launch options. The community(including myself) has been BEGGING for a workshop integration for the game but there has been no luck...
The campaigns,The campaigns are a bit frustrating and boring and the story is trippy.
Unit size, the units are not realistic with its actual canon size. Boba Fett is half as large as an AT-ST, no matter how awesome you think he is.


However the cons are solvable with modding and the game itself is VERY  fun! I definitly recomend this to star wars fans and RTS fans!

This game is, truly, one of the best RTS games I have ever played. The whole idea of incorporating space and land units in order to attack you enemy really blended well together. Each faction has their own special abilities and specialised tactics  which, if you take advantage of them, can change the tide of the war. 

But if anything, the coolest part is building the death star... or destroying it. Plus with the FOC (forces of corruption) expansion, you can build the second death star and it targets capital ships and space stations.

So you better watch out admiral cause there are ships in sector 47, but it's no trap. it's the fate of the galaxy.

And as always...
May the force be with you ;-)

The game itself is fun if you like strategy games and I myself have had a lot of fun playing through both of their campaigns. Multiplayer was also added during May so you and your friends can easily make colossal space or lands battles, duking it out and just having a good time.
If you're like me and have no friends(or you only have one that also owns the game) you can launch up a galactic battle against each other, assuming you have the time.

The expansion that follows in this purchase brings in a new faction, new units, a new campaign and a new way of playing through the galaxy.

The new faction represents a criminal faction by the name of the Zann Connsortium. They got their own units and they corrupt the galaxy from piracy, kidnapping and other criminal acts.

32,STARWARS Empireat War GoldPack,12619525,english,"Star Wars: Empire at War is a real-time strategy game from Petroglyph and published by LucasArts, the best strategy game in Star Wars franchise. Gold Pack also include the expansion pack Star Wars: Empire at War - Forces of Corruption in one package.

Star Wars: Empire at War takes place before and to the event of Episode IV, to the Battle of Yavin, while the expansion pack, Star Wars: Empire at War - Forces of Corruption follows the underworld faction Tyber Zann with the Zann Consortium. Of course this is an expanded universe story, now called Star Wars Legends.

Star Wars: Empire at War gameplay is more like map conquest called galaxy conquest since this is the Star Wars galaxy, you start on a galactic map, establishes bases on planets like Coruscant, Tatooine or Naboo, build up armies and galactic fleet, then engage in space or ground battles on map in real epic battles. You get to command the Star Destroyer fleet with the Galactic Empire or squadrons of X-wing with the Rebel Alliance. This game can entertain you for many hours.

While Star Wars: Empire at War has great gameplay, the graphics are somewhat, inadequate for me. Kind of like, ugly, but at least has some detail. The effect are not that great too, except for the Death Star. The performance are great nevertheless.

The one of many greatest thing about this game is that there are many mods out there making this game even more interesting and fun, like Republic at War or Thrawn Revenge, try them.

The downside of this game is with the expansion pack, Star Wars: Empire at War - Forces of Corruption, it still have many minor bugs that left unfixed. Although the bugs won't hinder your gameplay at all, but it is somewhat annoying.

Very addicting game Star Wars: Empire at War is for strategy fans, you get to fight twice to capture a planet, a space battle and planetary battle. I recommend this.

Battles in Empire at War are anything but boring (with the exception of land battles, which can be dull at times, however, spamming a planet with troops and using auto-complete fixes the problem). Ships are mostly equal, and while battles are not exactly strategic (in my case), I think they are a star-destroyer load of fun!

Galactic conquest adds a new layer to the game. The varying factories and barracks you can build makes sure you have a tough time beating the rebels, empire, or both. The short skirmishes are somewhat easy, but multiplayer saves the day. I have never won a game of multiplayer skirmish.

Mods add yet another layer to the game. Developers are always attempting to make Empire at War look like a modern game, and mods like Thrawn's Revenge and the Clone Wars mod make sure you never run out of content. I personally check Mod Db every day for updates to the Empire at War Remake mod (looks awesome so far!)

I enjoy the challenge of this personally but id like to see that fixed one day, hopefully sooner than later. Other than that i love this game. You can always play as the constortium (You cant bug the game like ai does) to get around that problem and im not sure if the rebellion experiences the bug either. (Ive only recently played empire and constortium) I hope everyone who plays this game enjoys it and if you want a similar game to compare this to, id say empire total war or any of the total war games with the idea of currency, buying troops, controling territory or planets in this sense, its all very similar.

11,STARWARS Empireat War GoldPack,45440090,english," If you are a Star Wars fan and/or an RTS fan buy this game. This game and its dlc fufills the power trip of taking over the Star Wars galaxy as the classic factions (The rebel alliance and The Empire). The combat itself is split into to halves, space and ground battles. Space battles are what you'd fully expect from the Star Wars universe, X-Wings, Tie-fighters, Corellian Corvettes, Star Destroyers and the Death Star, the best thing is it's all well balanced. Ground battles are slighlty weaker and overall less refined mechanics but overall still a fufilling component of the game. 

The game has aged quite significantly although the core gameplay mechanics stil hold up well today and is virtually bug free. Replayability is encouraged through the use of different factions and different galactic conquest scenarios. Whilst not the most complex strategy game, its core gameplay elements do contain depth and are satisfying to master. 

I couldn't write this review without mentioning the additional lifespan and perigrination offered by a wide variety of overhaul mods, which I've had the pleasure of seeing develop over the years. They cater to all tastes; 
Do you want accurate ship representation, a much deeper economic and battle system? Try Pheonix Rising or Awakening of the Rebellion.
Do you want to play as the Clone Wars factions? Try 'The Clone Wars' or Republic at War.
Do you want crazy? Try ZeroXs mod or Yoden mod
Do you want a legends accurate post-Endor until the Caasmas Crisis galactic conquest scenario, with fully playable Imperial Warlord Factions including the Empire of the Hand? Do you want a comprehensive reskin of the UI, FX, unit models and the galactic map? Try Thrawns Revenge and get addicted to bringing a super star destroyer out of hyperspace right next to an enemy fleet and watching it decimate it. It's literally worth buying the gold pack just to experience this mod and thats no understatement.

- Space to ground combat
- Galactic Conquest
- One of the best modding communities out there with steam support

Cons:
- Optimization is sketchy (recently my game has become incredibly laggy in glactic conquest, my favourite mode) it seems a recent patch did this, and i hope it is fixed

As is true with almost anyone else who plays, i have to admit that the ground battles, while still fun, are inferior to space battles, because that's where it's at. From watching a single X-Wing squadron to directing your entire fleet, it feels SSOOOOO statisfying, at it's best when your tactical genius just MELTS the enemy like butter. 

Mods: IMO, not a must, but they make it way more fun. From simply tweaking fleet sizes to adding any large scale conflict from the Star Wars universe to date (We're talking from the Old Republic, through the Clone Wars, and,if you're into Disney cannon, you can go for First Order Vs Resistance OR New Republic Vs Imperial remnants and/or the Vong, if you read the books and/or just generaly prefer the old cannon, your choice). Mods will only increase the time you spend playing and wanting to play. Pick the right ones, and Hella fun times await...

Gameplay:
The game allows you to play as different factions. The Galactic Empire, The Rebel Alliance, and the Zann Consortium. Each has their strengths and weaknesses. The Rebels have a clear advantage with their fighters and ground units, the Empire has an advantage with their Stardestroyers and larger vessels, and the Zann Consortium has the corruption ability. My advice is to use all your abilities wisely and to remember their strengths and weaknesses. Even if you haven't played this game, you will still find this game fun and challenging.
Graphics:
It's fair to say that graphics have aged well, mainly with the ships. Modders keep improving on the original source material to make the game looking as polished as possible, so you will see these improvements if you look at them. When you look at these ships, with their original look however you'll see some flaws. First, with the ground units with their near-plastic like Rebels and Stormtroopers, I would it was a mistake. These graphics, however, do not affect the overall experience of the game itself. So don't worry about a thing; you'll find this game addictive even with plastic like stormtroopers and ground units.
Story:
There are multiple stories within each faction. The Rebels within the original are almost all in A New Hope, so it takes you inside the movie which cools if you think about it. The Empire, on the other hand, takes you into an alternate scenario which makes sure the Empire destroys the Rebellion and The Death Star is not destroyed. Finally the story of Tyber Zann in Forces of Corruption. Each story is unique to their faction, and when you play these campaign missions you will see that it all connects in the larger Star Wars universe. I personally enjoyed every single one of them; however, in my opinion, the Rebel campaign is the best and most satisfying.
Verdict:
With solid gameplay, amazing graphics within the space combat, and solid stories to top it all off. It is no wonder that Empire at War got so many good reviews. My final score is a whopping 10/10.

The story isnt much but its so good I over looked it other then the fact that some side info is giving to you about what happened in the movies between Revenge of the Sith and a New Hope or Winning as the Empirea and conquering the Galaxy. So I give this a 100/10 for this game and highly recommend it if you love star wars and enjoy stradgy games and commanding your troops or fleets against either an easy AI or one almost as smart as a human. It is really fun and I plan on putting more hours into this game despite its mulitplayer being taken offline. The AI still prove to be a fun challenge and I want to prove to be the best Commander out there where you actually have to think and mange your resources and troops instead of any of the games out there like the phone apps clash of clans or star wars commander. Those are nothing compared to this game. So what are you waiting for? Buy this game and tell your star wars friends about it. Hope to see and SW Empire at war 2 one day but Its only a dream but any way see you guys out there!

Empire at war is a marvellous strategy game, with a main story with three different difficulty levels, skirmish mode with dozens of maps either in space or on land, and a Galactic conquest mode that lets you choose your own story with different tech levels, amount of planets and a variety of challenges. In Easy mode you will encounter mostly slight resistance and next to no invasions at all, while in Hard you will be struck with everything they got. 

Sadly, the multiplayer feature is long-since gone (unless ad-hoc), but the AI is so well scripted that you won't have a dull moment fighting off those pesky cruisers and TIE-bombers raiding your space stations.

Enjoyable Star Wars themed RTS with interesting campaigns and game modes. [/h1]

Star Wars Empire at War: Gold Edition includes both the original game and the expansion “Forces of Corruption”; set during the Galactic Civil War (the Original Trilogy Era), the game offers three main game modes: Skirmish, Galactic Conquest and Campaign (the first two also available in multiplayer).

Skirmishes are similar to the classical RTS battles, except instead of sending your workers to collect resources, you gain a certain amount every second; this amount can be increased by controlling structures on the map with the infantry units you’re provided at the start of the battle. More and more powerful units can be recruited by researching technologies from your base, which you have to defend to avoid being defeated by the AI or the enemy player.
Skirmishes can be fought both on land and in space; while space skirmishes are truly exciting, giving you the possibility to command powerful ships like Darth Vader’s flagship, the Executor, and attempting very interesting manoeuvres, given the emptiness of space,  I found land skirmishes a bit annoying, for two main factors; the first one is given by the maps layout: most of them are in fact composed by long and tight passages, making manoeuvring large group of units very difficult; meanwhile, the other is caused by the AI behaviour and pathfinding: larger units, like the AT-AT or the Rancor, will have difficult times moving from one positions to another, and most of the time instead of moving they will start spinning endlessly on their position (a subtle reference to the infamous “I’ll try spinning, that’s a good trick” line?), or sometimes stand perfectly still when the enemy is firing at them from a few centimetres away.

The Galactic Conquest mode is instead a two (or three, in the expansion) player mode in which every human player or AI takes the role of one of the three main factions: the Galactic Empire, the Alliance to Restore the Republic, or the Zann Consortium (a criminal syndicate who, sadly, made its only appearance in this game). Each faction starts with a bunch of planets under its control: each planet can host a certain number of structures and troops, and provides resources and abilities to its owner; naturally each faction has its own structures and troops, with more advanced troops unlocked by technological research (also differing between the three factions). The goal of this mode is to control the whole galaxy by eliminating the other factions, fighting both space and land skirmishes on each of their planets. This is the mode I personally enjoyed the most, as it unites elements from RTS and 4X games.

Finally, the three Campaigns (one for each faction) are very similar to Galactic Conquest, with the only difference that, instead of simply conquering the whole galaxy, you have to complete certain missions (basically skirmishes with complex objectives) in order to unlock more planets to conquer. The two campaigns from the base game follow the events of the Galactic Civil war from approximately four or five years before Episode IV, up until the Battle of Yavin (ending of episode IV) from the perspective of the Alliance and the Empire, while the campaign from the expansion narrates the Zann Consortium rise to power in parallel to the Galactic Civil War (definitely the most interesting, and fun, of the three).

At the end of the day, Empire at War is a very enjoyable Star Wars themed RTS (the best of its kind, given the shallow competition), that is definitely recommended to any Star Wars fan, but that not adds any particular innovation to the genre, appearing less appealing to anyone who’s not particularly fond of the saga.",1532185067,1532185091,TRUE,9,0,0.645161331,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,149,6,1753,0,1753,1529578617

AI is extremely dimwitted and changing difficulty is just allowing the AI to cheat even more, The ships are laughably 'balanced' with each side having a generic ship type with no differences in game-play, ignore anything you know from the movies or books, its meaningless here. The graphics are worst than titles 5+ years older. The game takes forever to open, to change menus, to change settings, loading a map, placing a reinforcement, and even basic scrolling around the map. The space battles can maybe give you 3 hours of fun, but the land battles and terrible 'quests' are absolutely disastrous, with little to salvage. Even many of the sound effects/voices are generic.  

If you do still want to buy this game, at least buy the cd. That way you can sell it to another schmuck (""a foolish or contemptible person"") (a person who wastes money on low quality frivolous things) later, and at least recoup some of your wasted earnings.

ADDED:
Even with modding, I stand by what I said. Buy the cd so you can, after a few hours, sell it to someone else and get some of that wasted money back for a better game.

71,STARWARS Empireat War GoldPack,43468471,english,"Summary:
SW: Empire at War is a RTS/Grand Strategy game that was released in Mid 2000s. This game is older, but does hold up still pretty well. With the expansion, EAW has 3 factions (Rebellion, Empire, Zahn Consortium) all fighting for control of the galaxy. Each faction has their own strategies, units, and styles of warfare that come with them. There is a galactic conquest mode, skirmish mode, and a campaign for each faction. I personally find the Empire to be the most enjoyable storyline and prefer playing as the empire overall. 

Positives:

1) Galactic Conquest is an amazing addition to the game that does so much for the playability and replayability of the game. In this mode, you are literally fighting Grand Strategy and RTS to rule to galaxy and wipe out the other factions. I love this mode so much and really the reason I keep coming back to this game. 

2) Space battles are extremely fun and were set up amazingly. It looks amazing with lasers and turbolasers shooting everywhere, TIE fighters and X-Wings darting everywhere and engaging in dogfights, missiles going everywhere. It is a spectacle to behold and is at times a nailbiter. Especially when 2 large fleets engage each other or if your either defending or attacking a large space station. Especailly defending when you are fighting a numerically stronger force. Strategy becomes king in those situations and picking the right strategy can definitely help you fight off a numerically larger force no problem. There are also different unit abilities that can bolster or ruin an enemies strategy. For example: creating a 'sqaure formation' as the empire with SDs forming a square with two interdictor cruisers in the middle with Missile jamming fields practically negates one of the Rebeliions deadliest ships and one often used by the Rebel AI. 

3) Fighting on Ground is also just as entertaining. Some battles will literally turn into slug fests. WIth force strentgh being so nearly equal that it comes down to minute decisions rather than some giant strategic sweep. There is a wide array of units to from all sides that make it always a challenging fight. I do believe that the AI likes to spawn artillery though a bit too much. But then again I spawn a ton of AT-ATs to wipe out everything. 

4) The Heroes are strong but not OP. This is a huge plus in my book. They can play a role but don't dictate the battle which is a nice change of pace. 

5) There are so many different factors and strategies to use on teh galactic conquest map to knock out your enemies. For example, the Consortium's bribery is devastating to planetary defense. The Rebels are at disadvantage when it comes to space battles, but they can launch commando raids which can have deadly effect in the right hands. 

6) The battle maps are big enough to have room to play, but small enough to where a battle shouldn't take forever. 

7) Rebellion and Empire are pretty well balanced against each other. I belive the consortium is a bit overpower with thier ships. The aggressor destroyers are a pain to deal with. 

Negatives:

1) Consortium is a touch OP. Aggressor destoryers are have an insanely powerful gun that can smash through ships.

2) The AI has a tendency to spam ships and spam capital ships. So you can end up having to battle over 100 capital ships in one battle potentially. 

3) The AI also likes to attack with a giant fleet. After losing a few ships, retreats. Then like 30 seconds later its right back in the same place doing the same battle. Rinse and repeat that gets kind of annoying after awhile of that same madness again and again. 

4) I wish they had inserted the clone wars into this game. I think that would have been such an amazing expansion or game to play. Fighting empire and republic would have been amazing!

Overall:

I love EAW. Its a childhood classic to me and is still just as fun as it was back then as it is now. There are complaints, but they aren't game breaking. I also believe it could have done more, but that doesn't prevent it from being a good game. I would totally recommend this game. 10/10",1531329931,1531329931,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,199,8,14898,0,12238,1598033312

To see the entire galactic conflict start to finish?
To be able to even alter the history and take the fate of the galaxy into your own hands?
Empire at War is the best, be-all-end-all experience for that. TL;DR at the bottom.
PROS: 
>A large map and unit diversity that makes the galaxy feel alive, even with native units allied to one of the factions
>Many units for both sides, allowing a great deal of strategy
>Campaigns for all 3 playable factions with unique storylines that are well paced and have a good degree of replay value
>Replayability due to how varied the maps are and how many potential combinations of enemies you could think of
>Amazing modding community, which includes many eras of the canon and the extended universe
>Multiplayer servers are now back online, allowing you to play multiplayer without needing a proxy
CONS:
>Zahn Consortium is poorly balanced for the game, corruption and their playstyle leads to some balance issues.
>Graphics are fairly simple. Not a game-breaker but they are definitely old.
>The AI is a known cheater and a bit basic; on higher difficulties they'll often be able to swarm in many more ships than they should be able to produce and seem to always know where your weak point is. However their strategy itself isn't great so if you can survive a massive doomstack, you can probably beat it. 
--------
Overall I think the game is still fun despite the AI being a tad botched, and the multiplayer being introduced once again has let me sink even more time in this game with my friends. Being able to massacre Ewoks, destroy the death star with a surgical strike, and sell gungans into slavery, this game doesn't disappoint and offers an actual competent strategy game for the Star Wars Genre.

A real-time strategy and tactical conquest game, Star Wars: Empire at War had me at the cover art. I poured countless hours into this game that aren't logged on Steam. In fact, I think only the long-lost servers of X-Fire (R.I.P.) can really say how much of my life I happily wasted on this game. With that in mind, I have asked myself, ""Do I regret all of those lost hours?"" The answer is complicated.

It should be noted that both the base Star Wars Empire at War and the expansion Forces of Corruption are included in the Gold Pack. They can be played separately and are almost two completely different games.

[b]PROS[/b]

+ Star Wars! For a hard fan like myself, a video game can be carried purely on the fact that it focuses on the Star Wars universe, and having that instantly recognizable text on the box almost sells itself. More importantly, this is one of the few strategy games of the franchise, and certainly the best one (in my opinion) since Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds. Besides, you gotta admit that the classic sound of TIE Fighters just makes you want to play.

+ Pretty decent and entertaining single-player campaigns for each faction, but no real replay value, at least not for me.

+ The space battle format in my opinion is one the most well-executed in any strategy game. While battle does take place in three dimensions, the player views the battlefield from a top-down perspective. Space battles exclusively take place in orbit of the system's ""crown jewel"" if you will, and the backgrounds- while a little too distant- are visually pleasing and unique for each system.  Each system is unique in its layout, and there are different ""terrains"" for each system. These terrain can be home to hazards, such as asteroid fields- which constantly damage a ship- to gas clouds- which obscure ships hiding within from view.

+ All three factions (Galactic Empire, Rebel Alliance, and Zann Consortium) are all completely different from the other and demand fundamentally different strategies to seize victory against each opponent. This demands constant attention to the overall strategy and the tactics needed for every battle change a little each time.

+ The Death Star will be in range in 15 minutes!

+ Good news! This game enjoys extensive modding support. Thus, nearly every neutral and con can simply be modded-out!

[b]NEUTRALS[/b]

0 Can become repetative after a certain point. Normally I would list this as a con, but this only tends to happen towards the late-game in vanilla. If you have mods and a will to carry-on, it shouldn't get too dull.

0 Multiplayer is all but dead. I can't really fault a game as old as this one, though, so I'll squeeze it in here.

0 The graphics haven't aged terribly well in some places, particularly in Empire at War (not so much for Forces of Corruption).

[b]CONS[/b]

- Forces of Corruption is the most unbalanced game I have ever seen in my entire fucking life. Yes, FoC gives the Galactic Empire the Super Star Destroyer and implements the TIE Interceptor as the default fighter (all but matches the A-Wing squadron in a duel), and the Rebel Alliance gets the MC30 (torpedo boat that absolutely ruins the Empire), but the Zann Consortium is NOTORIOUSLY overpowered. I genuinely don't here possess the character limit to describe how bad- nay, HILARIOUS it is. I genuinely recommend that you go see for yourself, just Google ""Forces of Corruption unbalanced"". Seriously, look it up, it's a good chuckle.

- Multiplayer demanded that you create a new account or some nonsense. It was thoroughly annoying.

- No autosaves, which can bite you and strip away countless hours.

- Multiplayer campaign. This is actually one of the most entertaining games to play a multiplayer campaign on, but there are fundamental faults. First: You MUST do it all in one go, as you cannot save your progress and load it at another time, at least in my experience. From what I've seen, there MAYBE is a fix to this SOMEWHERE out there, but the base game typically makes it nearly impossible without some file manipulation or whatnot. Second: You MUST establish house rules because of the simple fact that if the Rebel Alliance kills the Emperor, the Galactic Empire loses automatically. I once played a game where this twat simply sent Han Solo and Chewbacca to bypass the orbiting fleet (Rebels can do this with a small enough force) on Coruscant and effectively assassinated the Emperor and ended the campaign. Third: Limited to only two players, which is disappointing given that there are three factions in Forces of Corruption. Fourth: Game does crash occasionally, and that means the campaign is over.

[b]TL;DR/CONCLUSION[/b]

Yes, I do regret the number of hours I put into this game. When I strip away my love for Star Wars and strategy games, what's left is an unfinished, poorly-balanced, and shallow game that was sadly abandoned like a blind puppy. Thankfully, the Steam community has taken it under its wing and vastly improved it into the solid beast it always could have been. I'm glad I have it, and I sometimes do come back to it, but I've gotten all that I really want out of it. The only role that it serves is to quench my thirst from time-to-time. But I simply won't be doing much beyond that.

Although the land combat in this game is mediocre (even bad at times) the game truly shines in its space combat. Each ship has systems such as a hanger or the shield generators and they can be destroyed if the enemy can pass your shields. This makes your ships more valuable in a firefight and losing these systems could cost you the battle.

The campaign is interesting enough to keep playing but it's not the main focus of the game. The most fun you'll get out of the game is playing through a galactic conquest or a skirmish with your friends.This game also has a large modding community with some of the best mods i have seen in a game.

25,STARWARS Empireat War GoldPack,43021030,english,"Ignore the 2 hours in-game, I've played both the base game and Forces of Corruption on disc since I was young, even before I had a Steam account.

This RTS is easily one of the best and one of the coolest. There are very few RTSs set in the Star Wars universe, but in my opinion, there doesn't need to be another one after this gem. I admit, I don't play much of the campaign, but that's because of the Galactic Conquest gamemode.
Galactic Conquest is fairly similar to that of Battlefronts 1 and 2 (The originals, obviously) in that you take control of one side or the other or the Zann Consortium in the Forces of Corruption, and conquer planets. In this, however, there are tech levels that allow you to build more and bigger units, including Star Destroyers, Mon Calamari Cruisers, and even the Death Star itself. There is some base building as you must build buildings to either buff your planet or build certain units, requiring players to make tactical decisions on where certain units would be needed for a front. This also applies in space, but on a lesser scale as you must only upgrade the stations. Massive fleets and armies can be built all throughout the galaxy, and features all of the units in the original films and even some from the EU.  Heroes are also included in skirmishes and the Galactic Conquest scenarios, and may change with tech upgrades. For example, in the Forces of Corruption expansion, once a certain tech level is reached, Vader will no longer be in his TIE Advanced, but instead in his Super Star Destroyer. The tech and units in this game are amazing, and it is fantastic seeing the ships and vehicles from the movies and books come to life. 
The gameplay itself is fairly similar to regular RTSs on land, but there are command posts and special buildings that can sometimes be captured on the field. In the GC, there are sometimes indigineous buildings that spawn civilians that'll help or harm your cause. This is not limited to humans, however, as even Jawas, Wampas, and Gungans are in game.
Space is, in my opinion, where this game prospers. Ships actually have hangar bays and spawn fighters or bombers, and all capital ships and stations have hardpoints which have different functions and can individually be damaged. 
Really, I can't sing enough praises for this game. I have spent probably thousands of hours in this game all together and plan to spend even more since workshop support and mods allow me to explore even more units, planets, and heroes and add a bit more of a challenge.",1529886999,1529886999,TRUE,21,2,0.713930309,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,437,48,1101,0,155,1597618808

I had originally bought and played it on disc when it came out, got this again in the Star Wars Steam bundle. This game looks Dated now, just been upgraded just enough to play on Win 10 and the Steam version provides updated online Multiplayer support.   The devs are the veteran coders from Westwood, who made the Command and Conquer series of games.  The Gold pack has the original Empire At War plus the expansion Forces of Corruption.  

Buy it in the Star Wars Steam bundle, or by itself when on sale.  Might be ok by itself for the right person that likes old RTS games.

When you're in Galactic Conquest, and it's paused, you are unable to move unit formations in a fleet until you unpause it. Just a minor annoyance, not even sure if it's a bug or not.

Honest score: 9/10 Very very fun, especially with mods. Just be weary about any AI's over easy in Galactic Conquest; They'll bombard you with attacks that hold like 30+ infantry or fighters or something mundane to defend against. Also, auto-resolve is horrible, don't trust it. You'll lose waaaaaaaaaay more than you would normally.

Around two years ago, I found the fantastic modding community on ModDB, and installed almost every mod on the site and played through them all.  When Petroglyph started updating this game again, I was so hyped, and the workshop has done wonderful things for the community.

If you want a slightly unbalanced (Consortium OP) RTS experience in the Star Wars Universe with a lot of references and decent gameplay, play the base game.
If you want some of the best experiences I've had in gaming with the huge amount of mods that overhaul, enhance, and make the game better, play any of the ones of the workshop.

1,STARWARS Empireat War GoldPack,41903434,english,"EARLY DISCLAIMER:
This game is in my favorites folder -I do not hate it, I like it.
BUT... my liking the game is WHY I must leave a negative review.. because there are things wrong with it that were never addressed -or simply made worse with updates (or in the *shudder* sequel game Balance of Power).
The game is playable. The game is enjoyable.
But this alone is not enough for a positive review.


Starting with the first EAW game:
It's fun, and the campaign on each side has its high and low spots (okay, so they have a little timeline issue where the emperor is killing Bothans for leaking secrets to the FIRST Death Star, but ah well).

Space combat is GREAT.... except for a few big issues:
1) missiles and torpedoes. 
They can pass through shields and damage or destroy hardpoints (such as your guns, or shield generators) directly... and once all a ship or station's hardpoints are gone... the ship or station is gone as well. This means that a few Y-Wings can turn an entire space station to dust, because missiles are not considered a special attack, nor are they limited in uses -they are a Y-Wing (or TIE Bomber) main attack.

2) ""Vehicle specials"".
Perhaps it's a nitpick, but the fact that a Corellian Corvette is ""weak to TIE Bombers"", but can outrun their torpedoes while blasting the bombers to dust leaves me saying, ""this ain't weak to no bombers""

3) You can't choose which vehicles start your fight
You brought in 20 star cruisers, 40 fighters, 40 bombers, and 50 ground vehicles thinking that the ground units would simply be deployed after the fighting.
...nope... they're your first wave of attack against 3 star destroyers and a space station... good luck, commander (oh, and naturally, the AI does not have this problem. As long as they have more than 20-25 units when they attack in space, all their attacking units will be space units)

Left the ground units behind this time?
Good. Now all your fighters drop in at once... against Star Destroyers and space stations (they'l do some damage, yeah, but they will take heavy losses.. kinda wish I'd been able to put in some bombers and cruisers.. you know.. ""command the fleet""?)


The single-battle setup has a nitpick issue:
You MUST play as the Empire fighting the rebels, or the rebels fighting the empire. There is no rebels vs rebels or empire vs empire and the limitation is aggravating

The campaign mode issues (AIs don't follow the rules):
In campaign mode, the AI is able to create facilities instantly, instantly create units, and create unitbeyond their tech level. 

It is also able to -while you are playing as the Empire- send in more ""sneak attack"" units than the player can, and send in units that break the ""size limit"" the player is restricted to (you want to send in a missile unit? Nope, gotta beat the station first, they're too big to sneak through.. unless you're me.. I can TOTALLY sneak missile units through).

The AI units are also able to have greater range and longer visibility than the player. The number of times I have had a missile unit taken out by another missile unit (despite having destroyed its scout counterparts) is enormous.

...stuff like this annoys me to no end, and it seems popular in RTS games (and the higher the ""difficulty"", the more rules the AI can break, it seems)


Ground combat:
In general -aside from the issue where the AI has longer range and visibility- can actually be fun... sometimes... though often for me it's tedious more than anything. The whole ""landing zone"" idea was.. well... to me it was stupid that ONLY infantry could hold the landing zone. You can have 15 AT-STs sitting on the landing zone and keeping all enemy units at bay.. but you WILL NOT have the landing zone... because they are not ""infantry"". You HAVE to use Stormtroopers... and if you don't.. you can't call in more units... or, if you retreat from battle, you won't SAVE those units, because you don't have possession of the landing zone.. even though the enemy can't get near it because you're at the landing zone.

....oh... and your units can't fire when they first land -so if an enemy unit gets close, you will be torn to shreds before you can move. Don't expect that to hold true for the AI units, though. They can move and fire as soon as they unload.

Then there is the whole idea that ""you only need to win in 1 city to capture the planet"".
It's a PLANET... there should be more than 1 place you can/need to win to control the ENTIRE planet... but they didn't put that in -and there's a reason for that... the ground combat gets real old REAL quick -especially with what was mentioned above.



Balance of Power:

Balance of Power added in some new units, a new faction, and made some nice changes (like enabling Empire vs Empire fighting in single battle).

Its campaign was decent -if not even cannon in the times of pre-Disney- but you can only play as the pirates -who are way OP in general- which is highly disappointing... you don't get to be the rebels dealing with the second Death Star.. or the Empire dealing with the pirates AND the Rebels.. the Death Star, Vader's Super Star Destroyer.. those are IN the game, but they never show up in the campaign (you do fight a SSD, just not the Executor). You can bypass planets by ""corrupting"" them, which also has secondary effects (such as preventing units from spawning, losing the planet if you remove the corruption, etc... so much for the BALANCE part of ""Balance of Power"").

It introduces and uses a host of new ships, including what may possibly be the most OP ship in the game.
You think I mean the Super Star Destroyer?
No.. that one is actually fairly balanced. It's incredibly powerful, yes, but incredibly slow, so large it has back weapons that can't target the same guy as front weapons, and can, in fact, be destroyed by a large contingent of A-Wings.

I'm talking about the Missile Corvette. It's as fast as a reqular Corvette -with the ability to boost its speed- but attacks with missiles, which (as with the previous game) bypass shields.
All you ever need when you play as the Rebellion.. is this ship. 6 of them can take out virtually anything, with hardly ever being touched in return... at least... that's true when the AI uses it... when you use them, you need a few more, because the gunners will suddenly understand that you shoot at where the ship is moving, not where it is now.



So.. the long and the short of it:
It's a fun game. It's a good game to see ships clobbering each other -especially when you hit the spacebar for cinematic view (which, sadly, you cannot control, so the best parts you tend to miss).

However, the balance in units and combat is way off, and the AI is constantly breaking the rules which the player is forced to abide by, which can make the game far less enjoyable than it ought to be.

This game... should.. be.. better. That's why my review is negative.. even though I like playing it and have it in my favorites folder.",1525691520,1526112318,FALSE,24,4,0.532513916,10,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,117,25,5417,0,3995,1599874578

If you're going to be playing story or skirmish story might be a few hours or more depending on how fast you go and skirmish should last 30-60 minutes if both sides are trying. Galactic conquest is a gamemode in which you fight for control of the galaxy, or depending on the map set up can be only a few planets (mods can also have their own maps that are different than vanilla maps and might not even have the vanilla maps in the modpack so be ready to adapt your playstyle) which might be very short from a few hours to a few days or weeks.

3) What can i get out of this? Well you have a story campaign for both the empire and the rebellion and zann consortium (pirate organization) however the zann consortium and in the forces of corruption dlc so if you want to play as them or have them ingame you have to load that instead of the base game, plus alot of and to be honest i would say most mods only run with forces of corruption so keep that in mind. Besides that you'll have the story (3 factions with empire and the rebellion stories tying into each other a little and the zann consortium story going a pretty different direction as it *based on what i remember* starts after the second death star has been destroyed) mode and with galactic conquest and skirmish which both can give you lots of enjoyment along side the story and on top of that mod support on steam has been added so using mods in much easier now along with that came multiplayer support back to the game allowing you to play with others!

All in all I love this game and if you enjoy star wars games and real time strategy games alike then i'd say you're going to like STAR WARS: Empire at War ( 10/10 rating in my personal opinion )",1525270345,1525270345,TRUE,8,0,0.637004495,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,62,1,16174,0,10698,1594320627

Pros: 
- Good campaign - Both EaW and FoC have a campaign that expands on the normal galactic conquest with a series of story events and characters.
- Fun gameplay - Rather simple for an RTS but with lots of subtleties that allow optimum unit usage like the space compass
- Galactic conquest - Hands down why most peple play the game. Controlling bases and fleets on dozens to hundreds of planets (with mods). Only made better with mods that deepen the economics, add additional planets and unique effects, and change the factions and unit rosters.
- Good performance without mods - Mode performance obviously depends on the mod, and the lack of optimization can hurt on lower-end systems.

Cons
- some balance issues in the expansion (can be fixed). Its argued the Consortium is op, mainly because of them making more money then everyone else. Mods exist, and I suggest them.
- expansion removes some depth from galactic conquest (can be fixed)
- Unit control are not precise, as the unit actually needs to turn/bank to get there
- graphics have minor issues in land, or some ship-to-ship clipping in space - somewhat fixed with the new patch adding some communit-made shaders.

Turn-based macro strategy map with real-time battles like the Total War series, but 10000x better. The 20-25 unit limit and reinforcement system ensure good, strategic battles where even if the Empire throws their entire navy at your one little garrison you can hold them off indefinitely with a solid tactical approach.

Hopefully the steam version will work a little better but the game has always had a lot of bugs, like incessant crashes , and installing the game and getting it running was a serious and painful ordeal. But it was worth it to complete the campaign and a galactic conquest map.

Forces of Corruption had license to create new extended universe content and their character Tyber Zann and his faction ""Zann Consortium"" really were quite interesting and a lot of fun to play, though a little OP with their corruption mechanic and replaying galactic conquest with Zann becomes tedious as you need to play certain mini-missions to establish corruption.

This game wasnt designed to be balanced. Reguardless of the fact that you can play as either the rebelion or the empire, the empire is noticably easier to win on a large galactic scale. As well as major advantages in space battles. 

AND IM NOT TALKING ABOUT BROKEN PROTOSS CARRIERS, ITS WAY WORSE THAN THAT. 

You could have your friend with the IQ level of JarJar Binks be the Empire and it doesnt matter if your Grand Admiral Thrawn Himself cause when your playing the rebels, You-sa about to be in some big do-do when the deathstar is completed 40 galactic days into the conquest and your still stuck on tech level 3 because C3PO is still in a scrap bin on cloud city and all you got out of him being stuck in cloud city scrap bin was an Assault Frigate Mk. II that you cant afford to make for another 3 galctic days and then offf! ""ENEMY FLEET APPROACHING"" after slamming on the pause button and hopping that luke is somwehere near the targeted system, and then searching for him for about a minute, you will realise that he is all the way on the other side of the fucking galaxy on Nal Hutta for whatever fucking reason, which reguardless of the deathstars slow hyperspace travel is still too far away for him to try and stop the deathstar from blowing up its target, so you pull your assets off the targeted system and watch as the Deathstar blows up bespin! there goes all your fucking pathetic economy because almost all of your tiny eco comes from that one planet for some reason... and c3p0 is still being put back together and your still stuck on tech level 3 40 days into the conquest with an asteroid to call bespin and the scout droid just figured out that you havent even moved monmothma off the Hoth system which is right next to bespin where the deathstar is smoking a big cigar. so the game is basically over as the deathstar jumps into hyperspace towards hoth. (because you lose the game if monmothma dies because fuck realistic win conditions) Too top off the level of stupid bullshit in the last paragraph the only ships you have to defend hoth from the battlestation are 2 corvetts, 4 xwing squadrens, han solo, and home one which by the way, doesnt even have a hangar hardpoint. thats right, the model ingame has a non-functional hangar on it. as if it was bad enought that the empire got free TIE fighters from a ship that costs less than 3000 credits, you dont even get free Xwings, or any Wings from ANY of the republic ships. AND HOME ONE IS A FUCKING CARRIER. LOOK AT IT IN EPISODE 6!!! oh by the way, deathstar doesnt even have hardpoints to attake with your xwings... (luke is litterally the only way to kill it) but he is on Nal Hutta remember? so enjoy that cutscene where its all ""Engage Primary ignition, Beep Beep Boop Beep Baduuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu shasuuuuushhhh..... KABOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!!!!!!!!"" But hey, atleast you have the blueprints to your Assault Frigate that you cant afford..... smh

Sorry this is an actuall thing that actually happened to me... I digress........

This makes it even more fun when you win as the rebels since its so challenging. This game was never designed to be a competetive RTO considering these facts and especially considering that there ""fix"" to the OP empire was to add an even more broken faction. 

Thank you disney for adding multiplayer support back in! it even works with mods and that is truly impressive considering the age of some of these mods and the original game as well.

If your going to play the original game i reccomend that you play as the empire and rebellion, not one or the other, because it isnt like LOL. the word ""ballance"" isnt of interest here. play them both and enjoy the uniqueness of each of these factions. If I had to pick a favorite faction though it would be the empire. Not because of Vader or the Deathstar, although those are kinda awesome too, no no no... The fact that I can Stomp on an entire village of Gungans in the middle of a ground Assault Battle with an A.T.A.T. gives this game a 10/10 Recommendation from me!

On a side note if your looking for a balanced Star Wars RTO then this game might still be your home. there are several mods in the community of this game that thanks to disney are quite easy to install in-game through the workshop. the Republic at War mod changes the factions to be the Grand Army of the Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems. 2 factions that were stuck in a stalemate war on a galactic scale for 3 whole movies! the ships are more balanced by far than the original game and it adds more content. Only disadvantage in that pack is the way that the ships move around asteroids. Keep an eye on them and you will know what I mean and want to tear your hair out a little bit as your Venator fleet does 4 360s and then just goes in the other direction.

Another great mod for all you Thrawn Lovers (Myself included) is Thrawns Revenge. this pack has 5 Factions and a whooole bunch of new ships. the game runs smoother, the ships have more hardpoints so the battles are more epic and strategic, and for a mod that has Grand Admiral Fucking Thrawn in one of its factions, everything is quite balanced.

I never even mentioned the skirmish battles in this review. there fun if you have 30 minutes to kill with a friend but dont want to get stuck in a full scale 4 hour galactic war.

CONCLUSION:

PLAY WITH FRIENDS
DONT PLAY THE ORIGINAL GAME OR EXPANSION WITH THE INTENT OF HAVING FAIR GAMEPLAY
TRY THE MODS IF YOU DO WANT FAIR GAMEPLAY, OR IF YOU WANT EVEN MORE CONTENT
KILL THE GUNGANS WITH AN A.T.A.T. WHEN YOU GET THE CHANCE BECAUSE YOU FEEL LIKE YOU HAVE JUST UNLOCKED THE SECRET TO THE GALAXY OR SOME SHIT AND YOU HAVE ""UNLIMITED POWAHHHHHHHH!!!!!""

-+-SPACE COMBAT-+-

The Space Combat is a standard RTS, but with several added features. The most important of these features is Hardpoints. Instead of attacking a target with it at full power until the moment it breaks up, you target specific systems, such a Tractor Beams (to prevent the enemies from trapping ships) or Hangar Bays, to stop them from releasing fighters. The next is Unit Abilities. These allow you to perform special actions to give yourself the upper hand in combat. An example of this is the Acclamators's Weapon Boost (Which is shared with most Imperial units). Overall, I really enjoy it.

-+-GROUND COMBAT-+-
I must admit, I do not enjoy the [i]base game[/i] ground combat because there are too few units and it is visually uninteresting (Though I do cut some slack for it being a very old game). Mods, however, greatly improve it, adding better maps and more units. If you are going to be spending alot of time on the ground, I recommend the Cone Wars mod, which makes each unit moveable on it's own, instead of in groups. 

-+-MODS-+-
Start by playing the base game, then ook into mods. Most mods are complete conversions and rely on you knowing the basics of the game. I recommend Clone Wars and Thrawn's Revengem the latter is receiving an update soon and the prior is complete.

-+-VERDICT-+-
STAR WARS: Empire at War is a brilliant game, and I recommend it even if you don't like Star Wars (There are mods that change the setting)

I love this game so why 7/10? Let me tell you... Corruption!!! Why isn't there some kind of tech or whatever to help control this super annoying feature? Many fan boys have complained about this and yet nothing was ever done. Two: No one is faster than the computer so why can't the player start to move their units on the campaign map in pause or during the start of a battle? I find some times I go from battle to battle to battle to battel without being able to react to anything on the campaign map. Just give me 1/2 a second to move my units. Good Lord! And, this is a big one, multiplayer isn't supported anymore!!!! WTF!?!?

Well, that was my two cents. Oh and don't expect updates with any of Petroglyph or LucasArts' games. Won't ever happen because they don't think they make money from fixing released games. Yet they still sell them and at full price almost ***6 YEARS*** later! humm? Shame on you!!

89,STARWARS Empireat War GoldPack,41158296,english,"There's nothing like a good strategy game. Star Wars Empire at war was my very first Steam purchase. I had always been looking for a Star Wars game combined with a strategy RTS, and this game was it. 

Gameplay: Outstanding. I love the gameplay in Empire at War. You can get a close up on each planet you control and build things like a space station, a barracks, a shield generator, all the Star Wars land items that changed the galaxy! You can also train stormtroopers, build AT-STs or AT-ATs, or move a hero like Darth Vader to a planet's surface to protect it from invasion while playing as the Empire. You can even build the Death Star and actually destroy planets! As the rebels, you can train rebel troopers, use powerful artillary and missile tanks, and use iconic heros like Luke Skywalker or Obi-Wan Kenobi to guard a planet or fight in space. The space battles are absolutely amazing. Join the Empire and send an armada of star destroyers to crush the rebels, or join the rebels and steal technology from the empire to build memorable vehicles like X-Wings and Mon-Calamari cruisers. In the Forces of Corruption expansion, you can join Typer Zann and build a criminal network to control the galaxy, while also given the option to play as the Rebels or Empire with more units like darktroopers, Super Star Destroyers, Yoda, and Sith Inquisitors. The only weak points in the gameplay are the land battles and the balence in the Forces of Corruption expansion. I've always found land battles to be extremely cliche and boring. They are mostly something you want to get out of the way so you can fight another space battle. They also take a long time and are sometimes extremely difficult to win if the enemy has turbolaser towers, artillary, and a few heroes present on the battlefield. My issue with the balence is that the Consortium is really overpowered. They have cannons called Mass Drivers that fire these metal slugs that penetrate shields. They can take down entire armadas of Mon Calamari Cruisers (known for their powerful sheilds) quite quickly. Overall, the gameplay of Empire at War is one of its strong suits.

Community: The community is great. There are a ton of great mods you can subcribe to on Empire at War's Steam Workshop like Republic at War or Thrawn's Revenge. You can also play against real people online with Empire at War's newly refurbished multiplayer servers! Empire at War also has a very active community in the forums, so if you have a technical issue, it will most likely be answered quickly.

Pricing: Worth full price. I even would go far enough to say that I would still buy it if it were worth $30. 

Performance: There are still a few glitches that Petrolyph's team is working to fix, but none of them are game-breaking. I'd say the only major performace issues I've noticed while playing the game is when using mods, especially Republic at War.

Overall, I'd say that any Star Wars fan/gamer would have a great time playing Empire at War.",1522429978,1522429978,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,40,15,14391,0,10544,1581724245

Honestly, even allowing that its a fairly old title, I cant believe it was ever popular at all aside from the ""star wars"" part of the game.  Its honestly the only reason I can see this game having any draw.  

The ""missions"" are pretty much the same thing, every time.  The ""campaign map"" is nothing but a way to choose the next ""mission"".  You fly down to a planet, which MIGHT have 'gasp' a different map, that will play out exactly like the map you just played before it.  There is no difficulty, there is no innovation.  You simply choose from a very limited group of units, and overwhelm your opponents position with numbers.

16,STARWARS Empireat War GoldPack,40726381,english,"Ok, this review may be a bit biased, as this was my very first PC game ever, but lets get into it. I love this game, and I have loved it since I found out about it when I was 7, and when I found out I couldnt get it on my Xbox 360, I was saddened, to say the least. But then, I got my PC, and when I saw this on the steam store page, I knew it had to be my first game. So I bought it, and boy am I glad I did. This games skirmishes and base combat are inferior to other games like Starcraft or Command and Conquer, the primary competitors of its era, but it has one thing over them. Galactic Conquest. Galactic Conquest is the game mode in this game where you control different planets, the different planets all have different advantages, and different incomes to make money to expand your growing empire. You capture different planets with land and space skirmishes, and you only beat the game if either A. You defeat the primary villan/hero. (For the Empire its the Emporer, for the Rebels its Mon Mothma, and for the Consortium its Tyber Zaan) or B. you capture every signle planet in the galaxy, which, on the biggest map is 55 planets, including your own. I could play Galactic Conquest for hours upon hours, I would play the biggest one until I had mastered it, then move onto the next difficulty. And then I had completly mastered the game on the hard difficulty, and just as I started to not play anymore, they revived the multplayer. I got my friend this game for his birthday, he was skeptical at first, as he is a Starcraft player, but he got sucked in, just as I did. And now, we play Galactic Conquest with each other on a weekly basis. And the mods. Dont even get me started on the mods. All I will say is that Republic at War 1.2 is better than the base game, and for anyone who likes the base game, get this. You wont regret it.

The base game offer tons of fun for the price you pay, from its campaigns, to skirmish, all the way to the galatic conquest mode, where you can play as one of the three factions in an attempt to conquer everything.
Each factions has completetly different units and heroes as well as different mechanics, especially the Zann Consortium with its corruption mechanic.

The space combat is the best part for me and getting to command all my favourite starships, ground units and heroes/villains makes me feel like a child again, witnessing Star Wars for the first time.

Pros;
- combat mechanics are engaging and focus on critical sections of ships which gives the player a more tactful feel.
- the battle camera is a great way to view the battle from the perspective of your forces.
- galactic conquest takes a story campaign to new heights! 
- the AI isn't fully scripted through GC so anything can happen.

Cons; 
- does take some time to load.
- limited skirmish options.
- mods can make your game better or worse depending on how you look at it.

If you're a star wars fan the battles both space and land are going to make you smile.  Sounds are spot on and visuals arent half bad for being made in 2006.  If I had to pick on thing to talk bad about I would say I don't like how in the base Empire at War doesn't give you a spot to send in a unit first.  In forces of corruption they give you a box while managing your fleet or ground group that allows you put a unit in there to send them first into battle to scout instead of sending in everyone with no control on who comes and who stays back to reinforce.  I apologize I am bad at explaining things but its a very simple difference.  If they took their machanic from forces of corruption and added it to the base game I would give this game a 10/10 but that one thing does have a big effect on my playstyle and annoys the living hell out of me if im honest.

My experience with this product of a game its very competive with its own economy based income completely different from a comparison point to STARCRAFT 3. Another RTS game like an example Warcraft 3: The Frozen Throne is a follow up comparison through economy and base construction and manuver of units. What made be buy this product was the game trailer from the PS2 game console within the STAR WARS Battlefront 2 extended content or STAR WARS WARFIGHTER also for the PS2. New released RTS games like Company of Heros there are four extended content of the game and it takes considerable amount of data to play and sometimes doesnt run. Empire At War that I experience has no problems and runs smooth. Best RTS with fast economy and unit control. I recommend it been wanting to play for a awhile. Another fact is its very fast in gameplay but I struggle with economy income where you have to find icons with the map of building refinerys to establish a higher income to produce base functions and units. money with the game is very diffcult like any RTS game manage your units very carefully and campaign is very fun follows the movies very precisely.

While it has some balancing issues like almost every other game it is immersive to the star wars universe makes you feel like the grand commander of any of hte factions you choose to play. It runs very well when not in multiplayer, and even there it runs quite well. I loved this game from the minute one of my cousin's firends put me in front of it and not only got the game on disc but rebought it on steam for ease of modding and to give the disc to one of my friends so they could play it.

On top of the base game content Forces of Corruption expands and adds to the level of play while adding an interesting new faction to the mix that base game didn't have. 

Whether you wish to weild the might of the Empire, resotre hope to the Galaxy as the Rebellion, or simply make a profit and corrupt everything as the Zann Consortium this game has something to offer everyone.

As well access to mods using workshop and so on can allow you to add so many different factions and bring this game into whatever setting of the star wars, or even non star wars, universe you like.

40,STARWARS Empireat War GoldPack,38386789,english,"                Now, if you are currently looking through the reviews and have found my little review, take this to heart before you buy. This game, is not an amazing rts. Dont get me wrong, i love this game to bits, but realisticly, its not that great. The ground combat is...well, its not terrible but compared to the space combat its a joke. If you buy this game, you bought it not becuase you wanted to see darth vader completley destroy an army of infantry (though, you can see that if you want), you play it to watch as your army of only empire capital ships gets completly destoryed by thousands of rebel bombers because you thought you didnt need any anti-fighter ships. You came to watch the rebels snatch victory from insurmoutable odds, obliterating what you once thought to be intimedating star destroyers. You came to laugh with a sick twisted sense of pleasure as you defend the death star before, while the match is playing, you press a button to activate the death star, and watch a rebel planet expload. 
           but, most importantly, you came because this is star wars game. A Star wars rts at that, a very rare breed. So, just remember before you buy, if you wanted to have epic, fun and awesome GROUND BATTLES, you may not want to buy this. However, if you're willing to sloge throught the mediocre ground battles to experience the awesome space battles? Well, then i welcome you- to Star wars: Empire At War. Oh, and btw, mods add a lot of longevity to the game, some mods just make the game better, more then a few that put this game in the clones wars (one focuses more on the cartoon series while the other is more just general clones wars stuff, noramlly stuff in the movies with a couple mentions to the cartoon). If you're a star wars legends fan theres even a mod that puts this game in the entire legends era after the battle of endor, with all kinds of new factions to mess around with.

land combat sucks. its hard to keep track of your units because they just walk off without orders and get destroyed. also, its annoying to build units because the buildings that build units are spread all over the map and you have to, while in combat, click all the way over to your building, click the unit you want, AND THEN you have to go to the ""reinforcements tab"", select which unit you want to call in, and then you drag and click the unit onto the map depending which reinforcement points you control. You have to do all this while you are swarmed with hundreds of air speeders, artillary, and fast moving tanks.

Excellent Game! Although there are some pretty serious and crippling bugs that need addressed such as the Empire's Speeder ground unit, and its begging desperation for the desired Clone Wars expansion, the game's content is very relavant and on topic to the starwars franchise. I have played and enjoyed many RTS's (real time strategy games) including Blizzard's Warcraft 3 and Ensemble Studio's Halo Wars (I) and I have to say that Star Wars: empire at war is right there with them with years worth of enjoyment and with a slight brush up and fix on EAW's bugs even has the potential to be better than its competitors. 

Recently EAW has been updated with a new expansion, forces of curruption. While it is exciting to know that the game is getting another look at it, and I may only have put a few hours of investigation into the expansion, my first impression is that it is a BIG mistake. Any type of expansion at all is way out of oder from the needed address of bugs and balancing issues that the original has had for a very long time. Im not trying to be disrepectful in any way of the game creators who I love and thank for making the original game but, for them to put all time and work towards making the new playable side Zahn Consortium with all its unique playing complexities, when all they needed to do was fix the handful of bugs in the original and call it a day. It was alot of aplaudable work im sure, but cronologically went in the wrong direction. If some one is looking at this game, saving up money, and drueling over youtube videos wondering if this game is worth buying? It most deffinitly is, you wont regret your purchase if your a fan of RTS games. ""Odds are the Empire's speeder unit will never be repaired"" -3CPO, ""Don't tell me the odds!"" -Han Solo.

Update: 12/13/2017- I given the game a few more hours of play time and I've found that that empire's speeder bike unit work much better and im super excited and happy to see that, also I slightly noticed that the tie tank's self destruct range of effect is 0, deson't really even hurt any enemies, I suggest only using the self destruct ability when attacking building and there are enemies that would destroy the tie tanks otherwise, besides that everything is awesome!

80,STARWARS Empireat War GoldPack,38082015,english,"I don't know if it was the pressure of early adult life or the demands of college, but I began to experiment with huge ships in my late teens. I began by looking at huge ship magazines in the basement when my parents weren't around. Then one day, my mom came home early and unexpectedly caught me in the act. Both of my parents were furious. They asked me where I go the magazine from and I said I found it and that I thought it only contained articles on small watercraft. As a result, I started to sneak out at night, telling my parents that I was headed to a friend's house to watch Full House, but in reality, I was in the library, reading up on huge ships. As my career developed, I found an apartment that I could afford and I moved out of my parents’ house. My interest in huge ships only grew. My apartment became a center for trafficking huge ship paraphernalia: model huge ships, pictures, of huge ships; life preserves – you name it. Eventually some neighbors complained and the owner of the apartment building had me evicted. By that time, I was so far gone that I didn’t care and I moved into a hostel. It was the perfect place to continue my pursuit of huge ships. The rent was cheap, drifters came and went, everyone minded their own business, and once in a while a new person would come along with scale models of huge ships in Turkey. We had a lot of wild nights and I was having trouble holding down my job. Eventually got fired. One day it dawned on me that if I don't get away from huge ships, I'll end up dead. By pure luck, I ran into a fellow who went through the same thing and he recommend Trimmer's book. Between the book and my support group, I made progress and got back on my feet again. Last night I almost turned left out of the parking lot instead turning right, as I've done routinely for the last 6 months. Turning left would have meant that I was heading to the Port of Baltimore where huge ships are present everywhere: horns blowing, sailors lashing gear to decks, and merchants teasingly gesturing to the gangplanks as they ask passersby if they want to go for a voyage on a great, big, huge ship. I started to imagine the wakes in the bay and the frolicking of tugs as they pull and push these huge ships in and out of the port. There was a burning desire inside of me: my mouth started to salivate; my hands were trembling; and my eyes darted left and right as they searched for an answer. I thought that maybe I could just go to the port and find one or two huge ships and it wouldn't be that big of a deal. Call it a voice in my head, an angel on my shoulder, or Trimmer's book in my glove box, but I turned right and headed home instead. My support group had a meeting last night and I told them about my near stumble. It felt good to tell everyone that I did not fall victim to weakness. I have my beloved support group and my dearest John W. Trimmer to thank for 6 months - huge ship free.

-THE GOOD-

---#%$@ING STAR WARS: Empire at War puts you in the command seat of the immense Galactic Empire, the tennacious Rebel Alliance or, with the Forces of Corruption expansion, the Zahn Consortium; a brutal criminal cartel that dominates the galactic underworld. Games like Battlefront (the original games, not the half-baked EA remakes) let you live the battles and see the struggles of each soldier but Empire at War makes you the commander of entire fleets of Star Destroyers, swarms of X-Wing fighters, or legions of brutal Consortium death-squads. It's difficult to understate how satisfying it is to invest thousands of credits into building your fleet and executing the perfect strategy to take-apart your enemy's most formidable defences. The level of joy I feel when I hear the Imperial March playing in the background as my massive AT-AT walkers crush rebel troops underfoot (literally) is really what makes Empire at War special.
---SCALE: Empire at War gives you the tools, resources, and authority to take-on the entire galaxy in the game's 'Galactic Conquest' gamemode. In Galactic Conquest, you choose between a number of unique scenarios and are given a pre-set loadout of planets, heroes, and resources and one goal: annihilate all opposition and conquer the galaxy. Maps range from small handfuls of worlds to the ENTIRE Star Wars galaxy! On top of all that, each planet includes both space and ground combat and comes with their own unique sets of advantages and disadvantages. For example: Tatooine, the desert world Luke Skywalker grew up on, is prone to sandstorms which significantly reduces the accuracy of rocket weapons. That means any invasion of Tatooine must be planned ahead of time because, if the defenders have tanks or defense lasers, your rocket weapons won't be very effective and you need to get creative.
---THE FACTIONS: It would've been very easy for the developers to simply make the Rebellion, Empire and Consortium factions functionally identical with different reskinned units but that's definately NOT what they did. All three factions have definate strengths and weaknesses that must be taken into account. The Galactic Empire has access to far more resources than the Rebels or Consortium and can create fleets and armies very quickly but they rely on strategy to be used effectively. You can't just charge a fleet of Star Destroyers into a Rebel attack force and expect to win, for instance. The Empire also has another unique advantage over the Rebellion and the Consortium that I'll discuss later. The Rebellion can't engage enemies directly because their units, though able to do significant damage, don't do very well in sustained combat. That means Rebel players must be willing to use hit-and-run tactics to fight their foes. The Rebellion also has the most powerful starfighters in the entire game and good Rebel players learn to use this to their advantage. They also advance themselves by stealing technology from the Empire and Consortium; gaining access to cool and unique units allong the way. By the end-game, the Rebellion ends-up with an extremely flexible fleet that can handle almost any threat. The Zahn Consortium, however, is much more brutal. They rely on the 'Corruption' game mechanic which, by doing special missions, the player can sabotage their enemies, move through their territory unseen, and gain access to powerful new units. Be careful, though, because your enemies can use their charismatic Heroes to purge your corruption! The Consortium relies on it's tough units to beat their foes; their fleet is built to brawl up-close and personal and their ground forces are capable of fielding units that counter even the most powerful enemy units. For example, they can build a Ysalamiri Cage that prevents Force-users from using their powers, and can turn an extremely powerful unit like Darth Vader into a much more managable threat!
---THE DEATH STAR: Yes, you heard me right. The Empire, in Galactic Conquest mode, can build the Death Star. By constructing expensive Research Facilities on various worlds and researching various parts and technologies, the Galactic Empire can build the Death Star (or the Death Star II from Return of the Jedi if you have the Forces of Corruption expansion). Once construction begins, all players get a warning message ""DEATH STAR CONSTRUCTION HAS BEGUN"" and a 5 minute countdown. ""DEATH STAR CONSTRUCTION COMPLETE"" heralds the completion of the most powerful unit in the entire game. As you might expect, the Death Star is capable of utterly destroying entire planets. A fleet with the Death Star in it can engage in space battles as usual. However, you will see a graphic on the HUD with a countdown ""ENEMY BASE WILL BE IN RANGE IN...MINUTES"". Once the countdown is complete, you can pull the lever and watch a demonstration of your fully armed and operational battle station. The resulting blast will completely annihilate any structures, ground forces and heroes stationed on the planet's surface and turns it into a lifeless asteroid field. The Death Star II, from the Forces of Corruption expansion, can even target Capital Ships and Space Stations with the Superlaser and instantly destroy them in one blast (at the expense of a delayed countdown). The Death Star is easily the most powerful unit in the entire game; so powerful that it cannot even be attacked in a regular space battle! It lingers ominously in the background, inching closer and closer to firing range of the planet. Fear not, however! It can be destroyed! If you manage to locate the Death Star, the Rebellion can stage a daring, desperate assault on the Death Star using the Rogue Squadron Hero Unit and destroy it. The Zahn Consortium can send the cunning droid bounty hunter Hero Unit, IG-88, to sabotage it's main reactor and cause it to self-destruct. If destroyed, it CANNOT be rebuilt so use it wisely!
---MODS: Though not as numerous as games like Skyrim and Fallout, Empire at War does have its own modding community (ModDB). While they range in quality from utterly unfinished to out-of-this-goddamn-world, they are fairly easy to install and it even has Steam Workshop support if you're new to modding! I personally recommend the ""Thrawn's Revenge"" mod, otherwise known as ""Imperial Civil War"" which totally overhauls all the units and planets in the game to reflect the old Expanded Universe post-Return of the Jedi continuity. It's easilly the best mod out there for Empire at War and it's totally free! *cough* Bethesda Creation Club *cough*

-THE BAD-

---BUGS: As is inevitable with video games, Empire at War does have it's share of bugs. I haven't encountered any game-breaking bugs in my play sessions but I've noticed a few audio and graphical glitches. Nothing huge or game-breaking (you won't see units distend like overcooked pasta or anything like that), just little things that might irk you if you're the kind of person that notices those things often.
---FPS: I've noticed that Empire at War tends to struggle to maintain a stable 60 fps when you zoom out in large space or ground battles (especially on the more graphically intensive maps like the Maw Installation, Taris or Coruscant) but nothing major. Most of the time it's temporary and I haven't had it dip bellow 45 but everybody's computer is different. It's a fairly old game so most people shouldn't have too much of a problem running it.
---GAME BALANCE: None of the game's units are especially powerful (okay, besides the Death Star but that doesn't really count), but there are a few instances where your faction might struggle to compete. For example: I find that the Rebel Alliance tends to struggle more against Zahn Consortium in space because they're so heavily armoured and they have weapons that can penetrate shields (the main source of Rebel Ships toughness). Using their powerful fighers and bombers tends to fix this, though.",1512418835,1512419012,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,83,21,21859,0,17938,1578776446

91,STARWARS Empireat War GoldPack,37340488,english,"Star Wars Empire at War and it's expansion Forces of Corruption (included in the Gold Pack) are a must buy for a Star Wars fan looking for a worthy RTS to soak some hours into.
I may not have many hours on my Steam copy, but I assure you I played this all the time on my old PC back when it came out. You could say it was my childhood pc game.
In this game you can play a story campaign of all 3 factions: Empire, Rebellion and the Zann Consortium. The Empire and Rebellion ones take place before and during A New Hope. (You need to run the Empire at War Gold Edtion game to play this) The Consortium campaign takes place after this. (You need to run the Forces of Corruption game to play this) I'm putting this behind it as it's a bit unclear to newer players.

But the game really shines in the next part of the game: Galactic Conquest. This is where you will put most of your hours in. A real-time sandbox campaign with the goal to take over the Star Wars Galaxy. You can do this with the 3 factions listed above. As the Empire you can build the Super Star Destroyer: Executor and the best of all... the Death Star! (Death Star I in EaW and Death Star II in FoC) I really enjoy playing as the Empire with all its technical marvels. But beware even your greatest piece of technological terror has a weakness... and others are desperate to exploit it!
But the conquest works as follows: you have an X amount of starting systems, which you can upgrade with bigger space stations and build bases on to increase income, your army or build it into an impenatrable fortress. To capture a planet one must first destroy the fleet and station in orbit, then you must prepare your troops for a ground assault. After winning both battles the planet is yours! I would get this game for this sandbox experience alone. 

And then there's Skirmish, the mode where you can play on a vast selection of space and ground maps with all the units available in the Galactic Conquest mode (except the big ones like the Executor and Death Stars). Here you start with a space station (in space) or a ground base with pre-built buildings and defences which you can upgrade (on the ground). The focus here is more on epic battles than on base building, you can still put down turrets, repair and healing stations. 
I played this less, but it's still good fun. 

And then you have multiplayer! Yes! Since a few months ago, Disney gave the all-clear to the developers from back in 2006 to release new updates to the game! In the first patch they added Multiplayer which was gone for quite some time after GameSpy got shut down, it's now integrated into Steam! Furthermore they fixed bugs and crashes that were still present in the game. And best of all they made installing mods quicker and easier with the addition of the Steam Workshop! 

And then we come to the final part of this review.. the mods! The mods for this game are amazing, from mods that add new units and maps to enormous overhauls that change the setting from Galactic Civil War to the Clone Wars era! This means that when the base game starts getting old, you can just download a nice mod from the Workshop or Moddb and get a whole new experience! 
I played tons of Republic at War, Phoenix Rising with my CD copy. Now I found new ones like Battlefront Commander and Awakening of the Rebellion. 

So should you get this game? Well I think you know the answer by now. The game is very stable, yes some crashes here and there but thats mostly when playing mods. The game has plenty of content worth of 100s of hours. Great community and modding community with amazing mods. 
I'm grateful to the devs for making this game. If you are a Star Wars fan and like strategy and RTS? Yes get it now! As Darth Vader said many times: ""It is your destiny...""

Also, a few sentences that will describe the experience of playing this game:
- We will crush this Rebellion with one swift stroke!
- Everything that has transpired has done so according to my design....
- General, prepare your troops for a surface attack!
- Lord Vader, you may start your landing. The shield will be down in moments.
- It's a TRAP!

7,STARWARS Empireat War GoldPack,37733322,english,"Ah, Empire at War. Where to start?

It is, as the name helpfully implies, a Star Wars game, an RTS to be specific, released in 2006. The vanilla game having a Rebel and Imperial story campaign, the latter being a what-if? and the former following the old canon before Disney. Both of them are rather easy, the Empire one moreso, and are functionally, in my opinion, little more than extraordinarily long tutorials, mainly prepping the play for Galactic Conquest. The DLC Forces of Corruption adds an entirely new faction, who are functionally a galactic crime syndicate, with their own entirely new campaign as well. The story is signficantly imrpoved from the previous two, and is rather enjoyable overall, as the new faction also has entirely new units, vehicles, and ships.

Cons-wise, the base game is rather outdated graphics wise for obvious reasons. Ground battles are generally repetitive slogs. The AI is as dumb as a sack of braindead kittens, even on higher difficulties. Auto resolve, as in the vein of almost every game to ever have the feature, is bound to only end in heart break. There are also still some bugs and similar hanging around, although I haven't encountered anything truly game breaking. But the biggest issue overall is balancing in Forces of Corruption, as the new faction introduced is hilariously, utterly, and completely overpowered, capable of casually swatting aside either the Empire or Rebels.

However, dont be fooled. It is in of itself one of my favorite games of all time with ease, and I have been playing it for nearly a decade now on numerous computers, and for good reason. The space battles are the highlight of the game, and watching a Star Destroyer swarm obliterate a Rebel fleet is orgasmic. The strategic layer/ galaxy map portion is also strangely enthralling, watching a stack of Star Destroyers build up while you station AT-AT's on literally every planet of value, then some for shits and giggles. And finally, mods. So. Many. Mods. You do yourself a diservice not to play Republic at War, Thrawns Revenge, or EAW Remake, which has updated the graphics in space battles to more than easily match any modern standard for most people.

Overall, it has flaws, but this game is still one the very best Star Wars games out there, and for very good reason. Buy it. Do the tutorial and a few campaigns, maybe a few galactic conquests and skirmishs.

I've owned this game since it came out back in the day, and I've loved every minute of it. It has a fun mix of ground and space combat in the great Star Wars universe, with all the memorable units and characters from the films. It expands this roster with characters from the Star Wars expanded universe (now legends). 

The game has all the things that make it a good game and more, for the community has one of the most passionate modding communities out there, and thanks to the new steam workshop it is easy to install. So if you want to play with stormtroopers, rebels, clones or droids this game can offer it all. And let us not forget all the space ships from the films, or the... Death Star.

This is one of my favorite games, as it offers Star Wars on a galactic stage and you are the one you lead either side to whichever goal they might have, be it galactic peace and stability or freedom for all in the galaxy. 

And now with Disney taking over and actually bringing back multiplayer, we might see more of this game in the future, though that might just be wishful thinking.

I mainly bought this game to play its many mods, but was not dissapointed by the base product. It's space battles are perfection, good for people who want good looking casual space battles, and this is the games strong point. Ever watched as your tie bombers blow up a space station, or the crumbling feeling when one of your main ship shatters and breaks apart? How about, with mods, watch U.S.S Enterprise destroying a rebel fleet, or even destroying the UNSC as a covenant fleet. if you want this in your life, then this is the game

the ground battles are kinda just there, a bit meh if you ask me, and i tend to play space battles anyway.

Pros
- Amazing space battles
- Decent graphics (but old)
- Good AI

Cons
- Bare bone land battles

I love this game, but pick it up in a sale if you want it, or if you want more tactics and better graphics, try Battlefleet Gothic Armarda (not advertising, just a good similar game)",1510596599,1510596599,TRUE,1,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,79,6,2163,81,471,1601236282

I originally played this game on a crappy Windows XP computer in the disc version. Being fairly young at the time this game astounded me. Of course I didn't have a sense of what good graphics were at that time, but (as it does now) that hardly mattered. I could control the whole Galactic Empire?! I could blow up planets with the freaking Death Star?! The list goes on. Years later I bought Civilzation V (another classic) from my local Hastings. It required a Steam account so I went ahead and downloaded it. A year or two later I discovered that my childhood classic : Star Wars Empire at War FOC was on the Steam store. I purchased it as soon as I could. The nostolgia hit me like a brick. Later they fixed the Multiplayer and added a Mod Workshop. Great job Steam staff!

13,STARWARS Empireat War GoldPack,36333916,english,"I used to have the physical two disc copy of this game and regretted getting rid of it – but I found out that Steam carried it and promptly bought it again.  I have always enjoyed Star Wars, but I am not a super fan that loves everything unconditionally.  This game is dated, lacks gameplay variety, and is not really supported on account of it being over 10 years old.  I can easily kill time with it, but it is buggy and lacks the components that new users would want to see in an RTS even if they are willing to overlook the dated appearance of the game and excuse its other quirks.  

Despite its issues, and there are a fair number of them, the game is enjoyable; it has three decent campaign storylines, instant action battles, and custom Galactic Conquests maps.  There is modding available and the mods that still work give the game some variety and help the overall game longevity - if only a little.  The game sounds are all atypical of most Star Wars titles and are not seriously off-putting, your favorite characters appear at some point, and there is a decent selection of planets to conquer as well.

Overall, I enjoy this game – however I would discourage you from paying the full $20.  Even though it contains the game’s only DLC, the decade old duo (Vanilla game + Forces of Corruption) is not worth that much as there are newer triple AAA games with similar User scores going for $20 or less on Steam.  But if you really like Star Wars and/or there is a good sale going on I recommend you give this unique Star Wars RTS a try.

Shame I could never get this game to work.

The Disney 2GB patch couldn't find the game, the .exe had to be run in Windows 95 compatability mode just to stop the game giving me epilepsy and when running the sound, and gameplay, turn into a choppy mess.
I tried and tried to get this to work and it just refused to work for me.

Oh, and the game crashes whenever I change the video settings.
So that prolonged the time it took me to figure out whether I could get it to work or not.

Finally got it to work.
You have to try and retry to apply the 2GB patch for it to work and you run it in Windows XP Service Pack 3 compatability mode.

Now that I got to play it, I can say it is quite an enjoyable experience.
I only wish that you could give orders to units while paused (on the Galactic Map).
The game is a pain in the ass to get running but I can say it was well worth the time.

There are land battles too, which feel a little easy (there's a heavy limit on the maximun number of deployed troops on both sides).
From the Galactic interface you're deciding when are this battles happening. You construct buildings (factories and mining facilities), you raise armies and move them from planet to planet.

And that's it.

The land battles also lack any sort of strategy. The space battles, however, are absolutely beautiful and fun!! I enjoy playing the skirmishes. If this game could be redone with aspects of SWR along with fresh ideas similar to the Total War games, this game would gain an entirely new level. The redeeming aspect of this game is the fact that it is moddible and there are several great mods out there (battlefront commander being my favorite).

But even so, it depends on what points, what I like more about this game is that it is more of a fast-paced game than Galactic Battlegrounds which is really, but really slow that it can become an annoyance.
The fights in the space are really great, it's amazing.
Rebels, Empire and a criminal faction named Consortium.
Pretty great but there should be more factions.
republic, separatists and perhaps some minor factions such as the wookies.
Otherwise, great game.

So if you love Total War or strategy games in general then you'll love it.
The space battles are really awesome especially with the camera switcher, It feels like you are watching a Star Wars movie.
The land battles are also really great.

Features: Space battles, Land battles, Zann's Rise To Power (FOC only), Galactic Conquest.
Over 20 maps, both Land and Space. 5 Maps for the Galactic Conquest. Pretty good plot for the

That is replaced with either the Empire Campaign, or the Rebellion Campaign, both with their own plot and over-lapping time-lines. Also, in EAW, health and damage change.

Why should you play this game? other than that it is a classic in the star wars universe and a RTS game that went down a path that not many other RTS games went?

Well there is the fact that they did something that no gamedeveloper seems to be able to do these theys they finished a game properly.

For its age the graphics are top noths in the RTS world
The voice acting is perfect with the original voices for the iconic characters. Han Solo ans Han Solo, Boba Fett as Boba Fett and ofcoarse Darth Vader as Darth Vader!

Play massive space battles
Or giant ground battles
Concquer an entire universe
Or have a fun match with your friends via the newest update that they released!
Or even better challange your friend to a massive 1v1 campaing that will last hours or days!

And if the original content is not enough for you check out the newly added workshop and change the entire setting to a diffrent era wtihin the star wars universe or even outside it (like battlestar galactica or Halo)

I have played many RTS games and really suggest this game for Star wars fans like myself
I got this game in a star wars sale and I have played it for 55 hours and i have a good understanding about Empire at war gold pack. In 2017 this game is amazing I suggest this for everyone who likes Rts games or likes Star Wars like me this game has it all ground combat, space combat, multiple campaigns and Galactic Conquest. With lots of units and the Death Star its a real good game.
+Mods I don't use any mods but there are clone wars mods that look pretty good

Pros:
Lots of units
Campaigns
Galactic conquest
Skirmish battles in ground and space
lots of unique planets to fight on
Death Star
Graphics are pretty good on ultra but this is an old game
good price for a game like this
Multiplayer update!

cons:
Death star freeze if Han is on the planet
Non cannon units but you should expect this
voice acting is good and bad sometimes but I don't mind it

-Space battles. Mmmm, the space battles! They're just so amazing. Build turrets here, deploy TIE-fighters there, wait for that f*cking piece of sh*t space station to finish the upgrade...

-Galactic Conquest - A gamemode where the players try to take control of the Galaxy by capturing planets. It's a bit confusing but fun when you get into it.

-Multiplayer is back!

-Modding support!

[b]CONS:[/b]

-Land battles are ok, but not very interesting. In other words, they suck.

-Only three factions: The Rebel Alliance, Galactic Empire and Zann Consortium. I wish there was more.

94,STARWARS Empireat War GoldPack,34805629,english,"I got this game on disc when I was about 9 or 10 ""back in the day"" and played it for years. Then my best friend got it on steam and we had to do some manual patching wizardry and use third party software to play together. It was still one of the best games we've ever played, despite the headaches getting it working. Now they've updated it out of nowhere with multiplayer and workshop support. SO, allow me to share my experience and a few tips for some of you who may just now be discovering this old RTS masterpiece.

First, a quick overview. You've got the Rebel scum, the Super Pirate scum in the expansion, (admittedly they have some very fun toys such as the OP Driv-I mean Mass Drivers -- we'll get to that...) and everyone's favorite the glorius Galactic Empire. You battle in space and on land with fairly standard base-building RTS mechanics. In space you expand your space station and on the ground you build your structures in predetermined locations. You also capture neutral buildings with various functions in both modes. It's very straightforward. There's a Campaign, [a typical scripted RTS campaign from what I gathered from playing not that much of it] Skirmish, and Galactic Conquest, where you build all your buildings ahead of time from the galaxy screen and then once a battle takes place, you have to work with whatever you built up as your defense and garrison or whatever forces you brought as the attacker. Think Total War games. But still with the neutral buildings and turret emplacements to capture, and production buildings like the barracks will occasionally produce extra units for the defender. (if they built one, of course.)

...That wasn't so quick, but let's move on nonetheless. Here are some tips and general fun stuff about the three factions. This is (almost) all about space combat because I don't care much for the ground combat and avoid it whenever possible. Also some of it only applies to the Forces of Corruption version. It's better. Just play that one. :P

The Rebels have a wide variety of units available bla bla bla here's what you need to know: They have better small stuff. Their fighters and bombers tend to outperform Imperial counterparts. (especially if you micromanage X-Wings -- they can be told to fold and unfold their s-foils for speed or firepower. time it right to crush those Ties.) Their most outstanding unit IMO is the B-Wing. It is INCREDIBLY powerful against fighters and capital ships alike. They use rapid fire lasers and more proton torpedos per run than the actual bombers. They too can lock their s-foils and I suggest you keep them closed because they are very, very fast that way, and their firepower only goes down from *Ridiculous* to *Really Quite Good*.

TEH MIGHTY EMPIRE has STAR DESTROYERS. ...They also have Tie Defenders which are fantastic but are just a bit overshadowed by the B(roken)-Wings. But mainly they have the Victory class and Imperial class late game ships which are just beautiful. ALSO almost every Imperial capital ship (basically just not the interdictor cruisers) comes with a fighter compliment which replenishes throughout combat so long as its hangar bay survives. (did I mantion you can target subsystems of capital ships? You can target subsystems of capital ships.) They get AT-ATs too, which can just shit out Stormtroopers and wreck every other vehicle on the ground. (Yes the Rebels get snowspeeders. Yes they have tow cables.) BUT the BEST PART about the Empire is their Galactic Conquest endgame. At final tech level you can build the Executor (the giant fuck-off star destroyer from ep.5 and ep.6 that crashed into the death star if you're not a nerd) which can spawn INFINITE RANDOM TIE FIGHTERS (one at a time on a cooldown; it's not THAT broken) and THE DEATH STAR 2 WHICH CAN TARGET SHIPS, STATIONS, AND PLANETS. Tired of those pesky ground battles? Did the Rebels sneak in and re-capture the planet you rightfully conquered and oppressed? BLOW IT UP. WIPE OUT THEIR FLEET AND BLOW IT THE FUCK UP. Ten year old me was very happy when I discovered this feature. Can you tell?

The Zann Consortium (the badass pirates who are so badass they kill all the other pirates and think they can rule the galaxy) get all the (really) interesting units and features. Corrupt enemy planets and profit off of them in Galactic Conquest, revive Destroyer Droid production and steamroll enemy infantry, use cloaking technology to sneak into the middle of the enemy fleet and then self destruct them to death, or MASS DRIVERS Here comes the bit on MASS DRIVERS Do you have time to talk about our lord and saviour MASS DRIVERS??? Ahem. The Mass Driver is a weapon type just like Turbolasers and Proton Torpedos. Actually it's both. See, Turbolasers are the big conventional guns that go BANG BANG BANG BANG BANG et-cetera at some speed and pound enemies into dust. Proton Torpedos are big and slow and aren't fired very often, but they IGNORE shields and do ALL THE DAMAGE. Mass drivers are both. Seriously. They don't compromise; they aren't a hybrid. They are the best of both. They go BANGBANGBANGBANGBANGBANGBANGBANGBANGBANGBANGBANG STRAIGHT THROUGH SHIELDS AND OBLITERATE EVERYTHING ON THE OTHER SIDE. The guns are equipped in space on the Vengeance class Frigate, their super-capital, (basically their star destroyer or mon calamari cruiser equivalent) and their upgraded space station. On land they are THE BEST DEFENSIVE TURRETS AGAINST EVERYTHING and also are on a tank that also has shields which is the best tank in the game IMO. The DOWNSIDE is... well the Vengeance class doesn't have shields, and all their units are expensive. If you're a turtle player like me, this won't even phase you, but good luck rushing with them.

Well that took FAR too long but I hope someone sees this and at least has a good laugh. By the way, OBVIOUSLY Steam can't display my hundreds of hours with the disk version... you'll just have to take my word for it. ^_^ Cheers.",1504832769,1504832769,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,169,8,2934,0,906,1593637033

However, when I bought the game It lacked multiplayer which had been removed common for an old game and mods were difficult to install I could only get one to work, got around 30 hours out of it. Afterwards I thought it would be a game that just sat in my steam library never to be touched again.

To my surprise, multiplayer has brought back by the developer for the game which over a decade. But this was all, along side the release of multiplayer again is steam workshop support allowing us to really easy to get mods installed. Mods I once could never get to work can now run with a few simple clicks.

Lets go through the list of [b][i]why its so good.[/i][/b]
[list]
    [*] The campain mode is good, galactic conquest is better.
    [*] Forces of corruption is the diffinitive way to play.
    [*] It comes with the gold pack for free.
    [*] Its very enternaining seeing everything fight and duke it out in close range brawls that do still require thought to win.
    [*] Factions are reasonably ballanced.
    [*] The Galaxy map looks good.
    [*] There is strategy needed on the Galaxy Map though.
    [*] Space Battles look good.
    [*] Hero's feel like Heros.
    [*] Abilities look neat.
    [*] Voice Acting is good.
[/list]

Lets go over its [i]short commings[/i]
[list]
    [*] Ground battles are usually boring.
    [*] There is no galactic conquest co-op mode.
    [*] WHY ISN'T THERE A GALACTIC CONQUEST CO-OP MODE?
    [*] No faction really feels unique.
[/list]

If there was a Galactic Conquest multiplayer mode this game would be better. It's a solid RTS that holds up today and requires thought about how to play on harder modes and on easier ones its quite the light show, Mods make the game much better and unique but any RTS fan should pick this up because it is fun and looks amazing.

Sorry for the short review but Empire at War doesn't have too many overly complex things or anything thats so bad it requires discussion. Everything it attempts to do it does right. Space Battles feel good and while ground battles take a bit too long they're not unbearable. I simply cannot talk about much because there isn't much to discuss about how good or how bad it is, it does what it tries to do and does it well. I can't talk about the story mode because its a side part of the Galactic Conquest mode which is superior and can be played for hours trying to push through the enemy in gigantic epic battles for control.

I suggest getting this game because its fun, its enjoyable, and throughout my childhood and even now i've spent a few thousand hours playing this game when my dad first introduced it to me when he Pirated it.

This has got to be my favorite game of all time. Portal was more fun but only lasted a few hours. Empire at War you can just keep playing...

If you enjoy strategy games and star wars you will like this game. I have stayed up until 5 am several times because I can't stop playing this game.

If you want to see gameplay I would highly recomend TheXPGamers Youtube channel, he uses mods but the gameplay is the same I bought this game after watching his videos. My review is just going to be random thoughts.

Tired of losing AT-ATs to rebel planets filled with pesky airspeeders and OP artillery? Use the Death Star to blow the planet up! 

Everything has a counter but most things aren't hard counters with some exceptions:
-Artillery (on the ground) is a little OP. They one-shot infantry and have huge range and large splash damage. Their laughable health means you can use some fast vehicles to take them out but they can be very annoying to deal with. 

-Infantry take forever to die, except vs artillery. This is something that mods fix but an infantry vs infantry fight lasts a silly amount of time IMO.

-Corvettes are a little too good vs bombers. If there is one in the general vicinity of your bombers they will die in like 2 seconds. The empire has a large supply of bombers but the rebellion has to pay for every squad...

I haven't played the expansion much but in the base game the two factions are very well done. As the empire you just use brute force. Units like the AT-AT and Imperial Star Destroyer have high health and damage but are rather slow. The rebels can do cammando raids and have to be carefull where they strike because they are weaker than the empire but most of their space units are much faster than comparable imperal ships.

Each battle (space or ground) is played out with time paused in the rest of the galaxy so you can really focus on your tactics or just use movie mode to watch the battle. There is no base you have to babysit and unit production is only done in galactic map view between battles. The models aren't very high-resolution but I still enjoy just watching the battle once I know I will win.

The mods out there are also great. Republic at war and Thrawn's Revenge are my favorites. (If you read the extended universe books Thrawn's revenge inclues lots of that stuff). Mods really spice things up but I would recommend playing the base game first. Thrawn's revenge fixes all of my above complaits but the AI isn't very good. Republic at War the Confederacy AI is infamously hard (it will focus fire and retreat damaged ships).

Speaking of AI, the AI in the base game is very competent most of the time, it will often rush you with corvettes to kill off your fighters which is really really annoying but a very effective strategy. It try to only attack you when it has a larger force and it builds up ground defenses on every planet.

It is possible to play multiplayer on GameRanger but I have yet to do it.

I bought the game on sale but I think it is worth full price.

I went back and tried it again a while back after I had stopped playing the disc version for a few years and got confused with that, only to get confused again with this version.

I could probably read up a bunch and figure it out, but as any of you with jobs or other games begging for your attention know, it's not worth my time to go research a game I haven't been having any fun with. This was a great idea, but better tutorials would have made this much smoother and make sense to me (hopefully).",1501043128,1501043128,FALSE,0,0,0.363323212,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,1338,635,114,0,114,86400

Positive:
You get to use famous star ships from the star wars universe, including the deathstar (to a certain point)
You can blow up any planet with the Death Star
Great mods that even i haven't played fill this game with even more hours of fun including but limited to the Clone wars
Great campaigns for every faction although the rebellion can be a little dry
Each planet effects your faction in different ways such as Kamino makes organic troops 1 credit (basically free) and other planets provide discounts on certain units as well.

Neutral:
Very poor balancing accross factions however this also make it great fun for choosing Empire or Zawn Con.

Negative:
Unfortunitly the game has many bugs that can mess up your campaign as well as random crashes that make the game annoying to play at time, However i must honestly say i very rarely have issues.
The game could have certainly used some work on a cover system or a better way of organizing troops

26,STARWARS Empireat War GoldPack,33239174,english,"Hello boys and girls Joker here, this review/guide is primarily made for those that have experienced issues getting this amesome game to run under Windows 7, 8 & 10.. I'm currently using Windows 10 (Windows 7 up intil 4 months ago) but i know it would probably work just the same.

So, let's begin shall we.. 
Let me just say that installing the game caused my system to give me some kind of error message stating that the game installation could not get the required update due to it being locked after not receiving full access etc? (Err, Wot..TILT?!)
Anyway, i figured it out by following a few simple steps! 
Step 1) Remove the contents from your library by first canceling the installation process and afterwards clearing the games cache (the game must be greyed out so to speak).
Step 2) Go over to your Windows Steam folder (Program Files x86, Steam, SteamApps, Common,..) followed by selecting the corresponding Star Wars EAW Gold file and deleting it accordingly.
Step 3) Restart your computer.
Step 4) Start Steam and install the game again, which should now work correctly..
Step 5) Start the game normally. 
Step 6) This next step is a bit tricky and will most likely cause your system to hang/freeze but you can easily fix that by restarting the system once more.. (No worries, just use crtl + alt + del and in case you can't fully use the task manager, simply 'force' the PC to quick restart without actually rebooting it.)
*So, let me discuss (Step 6) a bit further now. You would like to change settings to your personal choosing, so just set the game according to your optimal/automated settings. 
*Do not set the monitor settings to maximum just yet or it will be guarateed to crash (you can do that afterwards).
*Get into the game once more and you'll notice that your settings are now adjusted/adjustable..
In case your system would still crash, just repeat the previous steps and all will be working fine afterwards.
Step 7) Enjoy Star Wars EAW Gold!!! When done correctly give me a thumbs up guys, that's all i'm asking. :)

Now for my short review: 
I still have the original disc copies at home and i must have played both original copies for many, many years..
That's why i decided to buy them on Steam hoping i could still be playing and enjoying them here while using Windows 10. (and This version works perfectly even without the patches i needed ""in the good old days"" to be able to run the expansion, which i can honestly say is quite awesome)
I must say that i'm really pleased that for me at least it remains the same just the way it was all those years ago.
Therefore i can only recommed it with my own personal thumbs up and an additional score of 8.5/10 in my book!
It's still a great game, so why should i need to say more right?
For those that might still have some doubts, buy it when it's on 75% off sales, it's really worth it and if you think not, just refund it!

59,STARWARS Empireat War GoldPack,32784942,english,"So I decided to make a review after I really really made my friend upset. So everyone says the Zann Consortium is horrible to play as and against, but I don't see it that way. After playing only fifteen minutes against my friend I managed to antagonize, defend and annihalate him while he was the empire. But I don't see the Consortium as overpowered as each of the ships have weaknesses that can be easily exploited and if smugglers are used by other factions the crdit amount gathered b the consortium can be dropped from a high amount of around 12,000 to 6,000. Now that is a lot of credits still, but each part of the Consortium requires Credits. Space stations, upgrades, even unlocking abilities of your units requires money. To stop the unlocking of abilities for the Zann Consortium, which without them would get decimated, you have to keep track of planets with Black markets and either stop their heroes or defilers from corrupting the planets. 

The original game itself is nice, but the multiplayer if there are any disconnection issues you immediatly get kicked out due to the games setup (Also you have to use Gameranger for multiplayer) So playing with the Forces fo corruption is beter as you have a timer before disconnecting. 

I also love playing as the Consortium, It was also fun to find out all of the abilities and tactics for the faction, all the while my friend laughing and enjoying the fact that I couldn't find the abilities for my ships and was destroying me. But now he is very very very very unhappy for the fact I can blowup the deathstar with IG-88 for a small sum of 50,000 credits, and I also figured out the abilites for my units, so now he gets really angry. 

I enjoy this game very much. (.....) hates the consortium and agrees with all the online reviews saying its evil and unfair. I just find a sense of FIGURING IT OUT. Yep. Thankyou. Also this probablly isn't a very good review........

I played many, many hours of this game as a kid and I bought it on steam because the Forces of Corruption expansion wouldn't install properly on my computer. This game installs and plays but let me warn you: SAVE OFTEN! Do not count on the autosave. I got some PTSD from the steam version after I played some hours in the campaigns. The game has some serious game breaking bugs. You may not get them, you will be lucky to get them 1 out of every 5 times you play the campaign. But when you do, you will want to tear your hair out. The one I got in the steam version (similar stuff happened on the disc version) was when I moved a character to do a mission within the time a scripted sequence was occuring in dialogue (IIRC) and he bugged out inside the planet. I needed him for the next mission but he was stuck in the planet. What's supposed to happen is you get your character back after a small period of time but that didn't happen. The autosave happened right after that so my save file is unplayable. SAVE YOUR GAME.

Land and Space battles do what you would expect.The Galactic Map is where you create more troops/ships and send them to a spesific planet.There is alot more to each mode but I am too lazy to type it all (and it would take forever).

GAMEPLAY
I mean, do i even need to say how good it is? Honestly if you are like me and LOVE instant action strategy games, this is THE game for you, even if you dont like star wars. Its easy to learn, somewhat hard to master certain strategies such as bomber-fighter hit and run and defence formations in space and on the ground. It definetly has given me countless hours of replayability.

GRAPHICS
Who cares about this anyway? ITS MOTHERF***ING STAR WARS!

On a serious note, the graphics are actually pretty nice for their time. 

MODDING
Countless amounts of mods are available for this game. personally I play with Absolute Corruption v2.4 for Forces of Corruption. Though, it sadly isnt possible to have multiple mods on at the same time, some Total Conversion are essentially entirely new games. So once you get bored of the base games, look for some mods, they are freaking awesome

If you're a star wars fan and loves RTS series, this game worths every penny.

Pros (My opinion): 
-The real ""Star Wars"" simulation, if you've ever wondered ""Is there any star wars game that I can play the whole universe in it, not just playing the jedi and doing some guns/lightsaber fight"", this is the game for you.
-Amazing soundtrack 10/10 , feels like when you're watching the movie. 
-The RTS mechanic is not that simple (a Pro for me)
-Land and space battle (Yes, you control the space ship, even those big ships, you control it.)
-Death Star that you can control. 
-Main characters like C3P0, Obi wan, etc.
-Amazing mod communities add a replayable value to this game.
-Two campaigns, plus one with the DLC.
-There's skirmish mode too.
-The RTS mechanic is not dissapointing. (Like you can build a fighter ship that has the ability to ""grap-hook attack"" to make the AT-ATs fall down) 

Cons:

Other than that, it is kinda adictive. I do not like strategy games where there is way to much to manage or way to little. This game has a fine balance. The games strategic play, is quite unique and feels fresh in a sense. Simpl y put, not generic. 

There are few options when it comes to downloading maps these days, as the official site does not offer maps eny longer. So basically the only option to play seem to be campaign.

But just enough for pros to set hotkeys easily. Smooth gameplay on my Potato Laptop I use (6 GB of Ram, 1.3 Ghz) and the games run at 60 Fps easily. 


These are the pros i've had found in this game 
- Imperial story involving the use of the Death Star (Yes, You get to fire it)
- Galactic Conquest
- Active Modding Community 
- Good mods
- A good EW story (DLC)
- Good Canon and EW Units that were added (Darktroopers, Thrawn, ect.)
- Spaces battles
- Huge Ships that YOU control
- AT-AT's
- Star Wars Themes Maps (Duh)/Hoth 
- Amazing Story Replay ablility 
- You get the DLC with the game for $20!!!!
- One of the best Star Wars RTS's out there

Here are some Cons i've found...
- Lag when theirs only Huge Capital ships in space
- Story lags a bit in the non dlc verison
- Some Rebel units have so weird textures
- Han Solo & Chewie should be nerfed

The ground battles are enjoyable, but not as enjoyable as games like Age of Empires 1 and 2. The campaigns are alright and do expand on the EU and some missions are really enjoyable. The Galactic Conquest mode is probably the best gamemode for Empire at War because it allows you to build the Death Star as the Empire and yes you can blow up planets. You can also conquer planets from the movies, like Tatooine and Coruscant. The expansion pack even takes the game further, by adding a new faction and allowing the Empre and the Rebellion the ability t build new ships like Darth Vader's Super Star Destroyer (Galactic Conquest only).

Republic at War: Puts you in th clone wars era, difficulty is definately raised here, somewhat unbalanced but really doesn't take away from the experience.

Thrawns Revenge: This is my personal favorite for many different reasons, There 5(or 6?) factions and most of them are playable, It adds a metric assload of new units (Both space and ground), its very well balanced and challenging, and it changes up the combat in some neat and good ways.",1487632253,1487632253,TRUE,0,0,0.49751243,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,38,2,11886,0,4279,1588472320

The Space combat is hands down the most enjoyable part of this game and it feels like I'm partcipating in a Star Wars space battle. The Ground combat is a very slow and does not feel very natural it is very hard to control anything. While there is alot in the base game and its expansion Forces of Corruption the real fun comes with the insane amount of mods that the community has created for it. They come in many ways for example if you love just the base game but wanted more ships and ground units then getting Absolute corruption which adds countless ships to each side and adds units to ground combat to make it less annoying. However if you want a total conversion then there are two mods I would point to, they are Republic at War and Thrawn's Revenge.

i took my Vacation and went from casual to power gamer.
*the idea of me taking my vacation and staying home gaming offended 
her... Well it offended me that it offended her..
of course i had to put Aluminnum Foil on the windows to
combat GLARE! 
plan B solution to glare= sleep all day!

In 2006'ish,,i couldn't run this game even on medium settings.


*When i tried to install ""PHOENIX RISING"" mod- I got a 
message saying that even on low settings i couldnt run it..
~~Phoneix mod is special because it adds over 80 planets,each with it's own planetary bonus,
and you can upgrade them(thats not in base game)
it adds about 100 heroes.. that's about 85 more then
the base game..
And in this mod== you upgrade the heroes multiple times..
So luke starts out as a Red Squad pilot,,then Rogue Squad, and finally those Stealthy X-wings form the post Vong war in the books...
the mod takes the game to suuuber nerd mode kinda like 'Rebellion' did..
 

*Fastforward to 2011. got a mew PC andinstalled Phoenix Rising= still couldnt run it. wtf!
(i could run it but only on low settings with shadowsOFF and details on low. F-that!)

~2015 got new PC that can finally run Phoenix Rising mod and i lost interest..

1,STARWARS Empireat War GoldPack,29631364,english,"Overall this game is fun to play. I haven't had too much time to play it, but let me explain the pros and cons. I apologize if I forget anything.

Pros:
-Space and ground combat
-Modding community
-Campaigns or simple galactic conquest (I prefer the latter)
-Gungan genocide
-Non-CPU intensive
-Multiple ""galaxies"" for Galactic Conquest
-Tech advancement (allows for you to properly build up your forces over time)
-Heroes (it's satisfying launching a huge clone invasion on bomis koori 4 and killing darth sidious (mod))
-Can get groups using Ctrl + 1-9

Cons:
-If you don't press ""attack move"" (basically move but they'll engage targets) they won't engage targets
-You have to micromanage everything
-Stability is a little whacky on newer platforms (I personally have only had the game freeze for a few seconds)
-Graphics are shit
-Can't rotate around the battlefield, which makes some maps (mostly mods) hard to play in
-Multiplayer doesn't work (can probably get it to work using evolve or hamachi)
-Unit prices don't seem realistic
-Can be hard to manage all information
-AI does some dumb shit (attacking high level space stations with ground units in transports)
-Auto resolve always puts the enemy in favor

9,STARWARS Empireat War GoldPack,29566127,english,"This is, in my humble opinion, the greatest Star Wars strategy game of all time (and the second-best Star Wars game after Star Wars Battlefront II). I'll give you a quick overview and then launch into a more detailed breakdown of the various pros and cons of the game. (And check the bottom of this review for a couple of handy links)

Quick overview; The game is a grand strategy game, based in the Galactic Civil War period (but mods can be used to get the Clone Wars, or the aftermath of the Battle of Endor or pretty much any other time period). There's a campaign for both the Empire and the Rebels (and the Zahn Consortium if you have the gold pack), or skirmish battles (land or space) and Galactic Conquest. The campaigns can take a while, and there's huge replayability with Galactic Conquest and skirmishes... you won't get bored easily! The graphics are the biggest downside, but for a 2005 game they've aged quite well. Land units are undeniably blocky, but the space fights (relatively unaffected by graphic because ships are blocky anyway) look remarkably good for an 11 year old game.

Pros:
The space battles are the jewel in Empire at War's crown. No game before or since had managed to capture the magic of Star Wars space warfare so perfectly. There's even a 'Cinematic' option that hides the HUD and views the battle as if it were a film.

The Galactic map spans the entire galaxy - all the planets from the canon films and many more. All of them have their own beautifully detailed land and space maps, and many have local life (eg. Wookies on Kashyyyk) who aappear on the land battle and, depending on their circumstances, will fight for either the Empire, Rebels or Zahn Consortium.
The game manages to give each faction not only unique units, but also a unique gameplay without giving any one side an insurmountable advantage. For example, obviously the Empire has Star Destroyers to the Rebel Mon Calamari cruisers, but the Empire gains technology by building research labs, and the Rebels gain it by sending R2-D2 and C-3PO to steal it from the Empire. The Zahn Consortium has various criminal methods at their disposal - such as bribery and extortion - to compensate for their weaker spaceships and (debatably) weaker land units.

The campaign is fairly extensive, and the Galactic Conquest means virtually infinite replayability. The skirmish also means you can easily hop straight into a battle without having to build up tech or anything first.

Heroes. Ah, heroes. Both sides have all the main characters from the original triliogy; Lord Vader, Luke, Leia etc, but also have some more minor heroes, such as General Veers and Captain Antilles. There are also a few from the Extended Universe, such as Mara Jade (the Emperor's hand) and the Zahn Consortium have quite a few bounty hunters (IG-88, Bossk etc). Each has unique powers and some have unique disadvantages (the Empire cannot retreat from any battle if they have Grand Moff Tarkin ""Evacuate?! In our moment of triumph? etc)

Grand Strategy - the campaign and Galactic conquest have a heavy emphasis on the grand strategic overview. You have a population cap, and you need to decide how your planets will be defended. Will you have huge defenses over a select few worlds and all but ignore the others, risking losing them to even a small enemy force? Will you have only a few infantry on each  planet, relying on your massive fleets to stop any enemy incursions? Each planet also provides a unique bonus, so some  planets will be more valuable than others - while some will be vital because they are on a hyperspace lane and if you can hold that planet nobody can get to your core worlds.

The Death Star. You won't get this until late in the Imperial campaign, but there are few endgames as sadisfying as literally destroying the few planets yet hiding rebel fighters one by one until the Empire reigns supreme over the galaxy.

Cons:
Land battles. They are very 2005, I'm sorry. There's no getting around it. This game has lots going for it, but nobody plays it because of the terrific land battles. They are somewhat like the battles in Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds (remeber that Age of Empires rip-off?). The graphics are forgivable, but the most annoying thing is you can't build your own base. You can only build on pre-designated build pads, which kind of damages the flexibility of the game.  The good news is they are generally skipable, aside from a few campaign battles.

Multiplayer. If that's your thing, I'm sorry, but once again, old age is hurting this game. As of May 31, 2014, online functionality, including network multiplayer and wireless chat is no longer available due to Glu Mobile purchasing GameSpy and shutting down all game servers. Hey, there's still mods being developed, so the community is far from dead.

The gameplay can be a little frustrating at times, and the AI often appears to be nigh-omniscient during Galactic Conquest. But really, is a challenging AI that bad a thing?


Summary:
As you no doubt have figured out, I love this game. To rehash what I said at the start, it is by a long shot the best Star Was RTS out there, and the way games are going these days, it probably will be for a long time to come. The space battles and the 'grand' part of 'grand strategy' really define the greatness of this game.  Buy it. Buy it now. I promise if you're a Star Wars fan (or even if you're just a casual RTS fan) you won't regret it.

-Tiny community now leaving multiplayer to be almost rare
-If you stayed vanilla, you greatly risk losing interest after maybe a good week's worth at least of gaming.
- Music is kinda repetitive and may make you wanna mute it after a while

Neutral:
-Galactic Conquests can take forever, it's reward being subjective
-As far as RTS games go, it's pretty standard aside from land and space scenarios

53,STARWARS Empireat War GoldPack,29211849,english,"TL:DR The game was fantastic when it came out however it did not age well but if you want a good Star Wars RTS this is it.

-The Galactic conquest mode was fantastic for it's time, a real-time X4 type of game in which you have to manage armies, fleets and planets in order to grow and conquer your enemy. Story mode took place pre Episode 4 until the end of Episode 4 (this was before Rogue One and everything got retconned by Disney)

The space battles were great, large ships were split into different hardpoints (weapons, shield generator, engine etc...) so you can focus on which ever target in order to give it a negative effect after it's destroyed. And all the fighters were in dog fights when they approach another squadron of fighters. (However it's hard to tell if you're winning or losing those dog fights.) 

The mods for this game were fantastic, mods that included new races like the CIS and clone troopers, to new ships and units for exisiting factions.

Some maps (ground and space) and special points on them that you must go near to capture them, points like Abandonned Factories, Sensor Pods, Communication Array, turret points, Hutt Palace, etc... each brings an advantage to the owner of the point.

So the issues now:

-For land maps there's a pathing issue with every map, meaning units can get stuck while moving. This is especially true in long skirmish matches.

-RTS games were never visually appealing but there's something off about looking at ground unit models that have triangular shapes. Even Darth Vader looks to funny to take him seriously.

-If the Rebels can reach Tier 3 in a skrimish match it's pretty much game over as their T-4B tanks are juggernauts that can't be beat, even with AT-ATs and Darth Vader. Basically the game is unbalanced at that point.

-There is no online community anymore so unless you have friends to play with, you'll only get this for the single player.

-The AI in the Galactic conquest mode is a bit... silly. They will send a fleet of rebel transports without protection into your Imperial controlled space (space station and whatever ship you have stationned there.) And then will attempt to flee after the map loads. Vindicator cruisers with gravity well generators can prevent them from escaping... meaning they just lost an army because they decided not to bring ships to protect them...",1484256910,1484256910,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,214,5,7165,0,2619,1579983416
54,STARWARS Empireat War GoldPack,29191401,english,"Years later, Empire at War continues to be a great RTS game in general. Three campaigns (across both the standard edtition and Forces of Corruption) and Galactic Conquests give the game a lot of meat for your time. As my first time playing the Forces Of Corruption expansion (didn't have it back then), it was quite fun to take control of a faction that isn't Rebels or Imperials, even if it is slightly unbalanced. FOC also adds new heroes for the old factions, giving a reason to keep playing through Galactic Conquests and the like.

82,STARWARS Empireat War GoldPack,28900288,english,"Having completed all three campaigns and one game of conquest my worst fears are confirmed. EAW is an RTS hybrid that tries to be many things but is tripped by technical issues, bad design decisions and a clear lack of testing. The end result is a game that is mediocre at best and only held together by the magic glue that is Star Wars. Only recommended for fans who are willing to suck on a lollypop made out of pure salt just because it's shaped like Darth Vader's helmet.


+Authentic Star Wars music and sound effects that leave nothing to be desired. Sometimes even the voice acting is surprisingly good
+Graphics seem fairly timeless with some space battle effects still looking pretty sweet
+Space battles are fun most of the time
+Asymmetric factions (Empire has bigger ships with free fighters, Alliance has better fighters that require no carriers etc.)
+Multiple campaigns and conquest mode scenarios
+Dropping the screen filling Executor in the middle of a battle for the first time should make any nerds inner fascist climax immediately

-Doesn't seem to play nice with Win10 and has no borderless window support. If played fullscreen while Alt-Tabing can put your Windows in a state where you have to reboot to get anything done. I recommend running it in a maximized window instead.
-Game breaking bugs include disappearing critical characters, inability to task units to campaign critical missions, disappearing units etc. These issues can be somewhat circumvented with furious saving. [b]Always save to a new file![/b]
-A multitude of UX issues that range from fighters needlessly blocking capital ships from selection to the way save files are handled: latest saves don't always show up first, save files take too much space etc.
-AI blatantly cheats both by its very nature and also seems to gain scripted fleets out of nowhere for the campaigns
-AI sometimes just freezes and does nothing with its ships in battle
-Unit AI is atrocious and does not seem to do any target prioritization whatsoever for any attacks. Pathfinding gets progressively worse with unit size to the point where units like AT-ATs, artillery units and Star Destroyers sometimes require near constant micromanaging so that they move the way you need
-Being unable to assign any movement orders on the galactic map in pause mode makes no sense
-Forces of Corruption doesn't integrate to the main game and is actually a separate game that feels like it was cheaply hacked together in a hurry
-While the original EaW is somewhat balanced, the Consortium faction in FoC is completely out of whack and seems to have the best in almost everything in addition to their frustrating corruption mechanic that requires constant fiddling especially from the opponents
-Ground battles are usually horrendously repetitive and tedious
-Battles can be autoresolved, but the logic for resolving them is completely ludicrous and can lead to massive casualties even if the opponent doesn't actually have any chance of fighting back
-Very limited amount of units and ships in a battle at any given time (for example, you can have 6 Imperial class Star Destroyers if you have almost nothing else) and the rest have to be drip-fed into the battle as reinforcements when previous units are destroyed
-Player can't choose which units enter a battle first in EaW (mostly fixed in FoC though)
-Flying units can't actually fly over many obstacles in ground battles
-Some of the writing and voice acting is very cringeworthy especially in FoC. A few characters also use quotes from the movies to a ridiculous degree even for fanservice
-The Alliance can commit genocide without any issues and can actually get more funds from it",1483272687,1483291537,FALSE,14,5,0.485892713,5,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,169,45,4905,0,4157,1581450167

48,STARWARS Empireat War GoldPack,28247793,english,"I'm writing this review at the tale end of 2016, I still play this game regularly, and there is a very good reason for that. I am hopeful that with the uptick in Star Wars everything with the new episodic series and the Star Wars Stories series that another Star Wars real time strategy game; until then, Empire at War reigns supreme. To start with, the original Empire at War in this pack, it is an in depth yet user friendly real time strategy game that allows you to build massive fleets and land armies with limits for space and land battles so you don't lose track of your units in battle. The game has three modes; story/campaign, skirmish and galactic conquest. The story allows you to choose the Heroic Rebel Alliance or the Fearsome Galactic Empire through many unique missions that allow you to explore the unsung battles of the galactic civil war. This game mode yields to the Galactic Conquest mode which is very similar to the Campaign but without the special missions and cut scenes. This is my personal favorite mode because it allows you to run through the whole galaxy and conquer it for your favorite faction. In this mode, you have to balance the logistics of limits to your troops, money to pay for new units and for developing conquered planets. You work your way up in the tech tree to unlock the more advanced and powerful units and buildings in the game. The Empire and Rebellion have dramatically different capabilities as well; different enough for their strategies are challenging to master but very well balanced. For example, the rebellion can launch special land invasions on Imperial planets called raids that bypass the orbital fleet and if the rebellion is successful then the empire loses that system no matter how good their orbital defenses are. The Empire on the other hand can build the death star that can of course destroy enemy planets. It must have a fleet to defend it while it gets into range and within a few minutes of a space battle, it can fire and destroy the planet. The balance here is that the rebellion can destroy the death star for an automatic win, regardless of the state of the map so the empire is forced to spend many resources defending the Death Star. The final game mode is the skirmish mode that allows the player to engage in a single land or space battle. All units are purchased from the base or space station unlike the previous modes. This mode is great for a quick battle to learn a map, play with units the way you want or simply cut your teeth on new strategies. Unfortunately, the servers for this game have been off for a long time but you can use game ranger to play with your friends who own the game. With the vanilla game covered, I'll briefly cover Forces of Corruption. This add on adds a completely new faction with its own campaign. The unique thing about this circumstance is that it is in the extended universe and has many non-canon units, characters and missions. The Zann Consortium is a criminal syndicate to rival the Hutt gangs and in the campaign builds itself into a formidable faction in the galaxy. It uses underhanded techniques such as sabotage, piracy and other abilities to advance its tech tree and earn credits in the galactic conquest mode. It uses a mix of different ships to form its fleets all with their own unique roles and powers. They add another player faction to the multiplayer as well and is a DLC that adds serious content to an already wonderful game.

Space battles are incredibly awesome

THE EMPEROR!!
ADMIRAL ACKBAR!! (etc.)
The models on the ships, units, etc. are very good

After Initially not particularly enjoying this game and writing a review to reflect this, I decided to continue playing in the hope that this game would improve if i gave it a chance. After a lot of restarts coupled with a lot of trial & error, I finally got to the point where winning a game of galatic conquest seemed viable. 

Now for anyone reading this review, I still contest that this is indeed a poor man's Command & Conquer, It's strategy aspects are about as deep as a puddle, with what is ultimately a glorified game of rock, paper, scissors. 

All games effectively play the same, capture a few systems, build up planetary defences whilst you wait for your credits supply to build up, position ships on key systems to prevent raids and keep building units to defend systems from incursion. then you simply build 2 or 3 fleets, and 1 large ground assault force, attack with the fleet to clear the atmosphere, then land troops and auto resolve, rinse and repeat until you win the war. 

One aspect I did enjoy however, is the very simple idea that destroying the enemy team's mascot ends the game, for example if you destoy the fleet with the emperor abaord a star destroyer it's game over, same with destroying the death star or killing mon-martha.",1480791256,1480838338,TRUE,1,0,0.463474691,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,84,4,259,0,259,1480806275

As soon as the Death Star II was constructed, it started blowing up every outer rim planets, space stations, any capital ships (If that stupid idioitd Ackbar put his big-arse ship in the fight, he will be the first to get blownn up before he realized that he's in a trap). By the time the 5th planet was destroyed. I cannot fathom how these stupid rebels can still have the will to fight, they have become ""the problem"", every planets they planted their bases were blown up, Realistically, any planets will quickly reject these stupid rebels and their hopeless cause, else they risk being annihilated. 

But since this is a game, the Rebels, in their blind persuit to restore their stupid and flawed as fucked ""Republic"" kept retreating into other outer planets (they didnt even have the balls to take one of the core worlds), this resulted in every outer rim planets being annihilated down to the last planet...and that ONE planet they retreated was ironicially..Korriban, the birth place of the original sith pure-blood.

The Emperor did not wish to destroy this once sacred world, simply ordered the alternative. Every fleet, every military units in every star system in the galaxy were ordered to travel above the orbit of Korriban to show these pathetic rebels who couldn't learn to just get along and admit that the Empire is the new order who actually brought peace, that their cause was a delusion long lost.

Mon Mothma, along with the rest of the remaining rebel heroes and ONLY a single platoon of infantry left (Everyone else had pretty much died or abandoned them) watched the sky as over 70 star destroyers, more than hundreds of AT-AT, AT-ST, Artilleries, thousands of stormtroopers assaulted their last base (Which now cosists of only a barracks and a light factory).

Luke, Obi-Wan and Yoda died in a fight against his royal majesty the Emperor himself, Lord Vader and Boba Fett. The traitors such as Han were being demolished by Colonel Veers's army. Chewiee tried to hijack something but died to TIE-Bomber bombardment, wookies don't win this one.

Finally, Mon Mothma was humiliated when the Emperor added the final insult to injury by ordering a single dismounted Scout Trooper to shoot the barracks she hid inside until it exploded. Finally causing the end to this stupid pointless rebellion that caused over 30 worlds to disappear from the galaxy map when they could have just surrendered ages ago.

While all this happened, Tyber Zann's plan was ultimately foiled because Ryloth, the planet he was on, was thought to be a Rebel world and got blown up along with the planet, the Consortium died long before they even ever got their first capital ship built (Palpatine was getting annoyed these rebels wouldn't give up so he simply ordered the Death Star II to just flew randomly to any non-imperial controlled worlds until the entire galaxy is marked blue)

Other than those two quirks, I'd say that this is a very great, well made representation of the Galactic Civil War in the form of a well balanced RTS game.

Pros:

You could play for hours on end without the game getting boring or repetitive.
There is a good modding community, crap tons of mods, and the mods are easy to install


The game is correct, as it follows all the books, movies, and comics (extended universe)
There is an exellent community, and online is fun (if i could figure out my gamespy password), in FoC, (Forces of Corruption) you get to play as a pirate faction, and FoC has more mods than the normal game

Cons:

the guy who made the AI was probably high (just a fair warning).
A few minor bugs.
(for thoughs who care) the original graphics are pretty OK (not going to lie, they're not the best), but you can get mods that enhance the graphics.

All said, the game is solid, loads of fun, easy to understand, and better than 80-90% of all other strategy games i've played, and last IF YOU THINK YOU WANT THIS GAME AND IT'S ON SALE; GET IT!!!

71,STARWARS Empireat War GoldPack,26220153,english,"This is one of the best stradegy games I own. Right up there with Total War: Rome 2 and Age of Empires 3. Why? Because:

1. I am a big Star Wars fan. I have seen all of the Star Wars movies atleast 3 times.

2. It has everything you need and want from a scifi stradegy game: It has space action, land action, different troops that are good for different situations. It actually tells you what the units do. Like in Total War: Rome 2 the game tells you ""Yeah, this is a spear unit. Guess what it's good for."" Obviously it's good against horses, thats obvious but what about the other units? I don't know what is the best counter for an elephant from 2 000 years ago. But this game, it tells you EXACLY what it's good for. Like saying: ""Here, dumbass, look, bomber is good against slow moving targets like this this and this. Also, these things counter it."" It tells you 3 units that it's good against and 3 units it's not good against.

3. A great storyline. Sure, it feels rushed at times and forced but the quality voice acting combined with the ""I am the most powerful person in the galaxy. Now hold and drag this unit here."", makes it a great experience. It is a both a tutorial and a great story at the same time. Feels like Sly 2 on PS2. Oh the good DLC-free no-microtransactions times...

4. It screams Star Wars. It has rancors, Darh Vader, fitting music, Admiral Ackbar and the Death Star. It has everything you wished from a Star Wars game. (you can also blow up planets with the Death Star! CAN YOU BELIVE IT!?)

5. Okay a few complaints now: The Death Star is the second Death Star, I understand that it looks good, but why isn't it finished? It looks just like the one from Return of the Jedi. But in RoTJ it was not finished. Now I am attacking with an unfinished Death Star and throwing it around the entire galaxy? Come on man, build it first. Also, there is a bug when you destroy a planet that has Han Solo and Chewbacca, the game crashes. The makers, Petroglyph Games still exists so why haven't they fixed this HUGE bug? Come on, the last update was in 2009. Come on. Fix your game before saying good bye.

But overall it is a satisfying experience to any Star Wars fan. If you don't like Star Wars, you can skip this one. There is nothing much to offer to people who don't like Star Wars or scifi.",1477424744,1477424744,TRUE,1,0,0.521739125,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,238,87,1944,0,719,1579185441

As for the game itself... well. Empire at War, I would say, stands as my favorite Star Wars game, since it combines an infamous franchise with a beloved genre, and their child is beautiful and healthy. That child is Empire at War.

EaW and Forces of Corruption (FoC) are both rather uniform in regards to gameplay. In EaW, you can play as the Rebels or the Empire; same goes for FoC with the addition of a third party of pirates and criminals. The basic premise of the game is in conquering the entire galaxy by force alone; to do so consists of two separate stages: a space assault with fully customizable fleets, and a ground assault on terrestrial defenses. Once both have been met with success, the planet is yours, along with whatever bonuses it provides. Another ""hidden"" bonus with capturing certain planets is that you can cut off hyperspace lines, or to simplify it, place roadblocks that would prevent your enemy with combining his forces, since he can't pass through planets unless they're either neutral or allied. For races, I suppose, counting Forces of Corruption; you have three different choices that have their own benefits and quirks, but can ultimately be played the same way, or however you'd want them to. 

First up is the Galactic Empire (or just ""the Empire""), and no different from the rest of its appearances in Star Wars, the Empire has a fetishistic love for firepower and big guns. The Empire has a VERY strong Navy and Army that deliver a serious wallop at the tradeoff of a considerable cost. Most of their best weaponry is unlocked in the fourth and fifth/final tech tiers, which gives the Rebels and the Zann Consortium plenty of time to strike at leisure.

The Rebel Alliance (or just ""the Rebels"") don't match the Empire in terms of raw strength, and their tech tier development is dependent on that of the Empire, but what the Rebels offer in exchange is more flexibility and diversity. For example, the Empire's Star Destroyers have automated hangars that automatically deploy TIE fighters/bombers as the battle goes on (unless the hangar is destroyed), but their shield generators are exposed to enemy fire. The Rebels' cruisers have internal shield generators that can't be destroyed (but the shield can still be knocked out), but no hangars - to compensate, you can specifically build whatever bombers and fighters you need, and how many you need; also, you can deploy them whenever and wherever you'd like, as opposed to the Imperials, where you're caught in a waiting game for what could potentially be what you are or are not in need of.

Added in the expansion, the Zann Consortium is what I can only describe as ""parasitic"", in that the bulk of their strength comes from that of their enemies; allow me to explain. The Zann Consortium has a tech tier that, for the most part, is based on stealing technologies and credits from the Empire and the Rebels, and in certain cases can actually acquire units from those two factions. One of my favorite features of the Zann Consortium is their ability to enslave races on certain planets, meaning you can get Ewok suicide bomber units, where a guy with a whip forces Ewoks out of a burlap sack and they charge at an enemy with a bomb strapped to them. It's extremely easy to play as the Zann Consortium, and they are brutally overpowered (their method of destroying the Death Star whenever it shows up is what can only be described as ""cheap and effortless""), though it does take a bit of a learning curve. 

As far as game modes go; both Empire at War and Forces of Corruption share the same modes, of a singleplayer campaign; a single-or-multiplayer Galactic Conquest mode which is the main course of this excellent game; or basic ""skirmish"" battles that can take place on land or in space, and better units are issued as time goes on. Empire at War contains singleplayer campaigns for the Empire and the Rebels; Forces of Corruption only contains a campaign for the Zann Consortium.

Empire at War caught my attention before I even knew of its existence, and I bought it as soon as I saw it. It was a perfect buy, and it was in the will of the Force.",1474429928,1474429928,TRUE,3,0,0.545693755,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,113,69,11550,0,4952,1592291834

35,STARWARS Empireat War GoldPack,25357776,english,"I really like the game, but there are 3 major things that make me mad about the game, the difficulty, the Corruption, and the lack of maps. I will explain the three in this review.

The difficulty has a major jump of difference from normal to hard. Normal being super easy if you can build up and defend yourself for like 50 days and hard being just a pure fucking headache. The Empire and Corruption just team on me on hard and just keep on sending excesively huge armadas just like 5 days in the game. And it's so hard to spam out mining facilities when A. they're being blown up and B. you have to make a shit ton of space units to defend. 

The Corruption is horrifically overpowered. Being able to ""Corrupt"" plants. After being corrupted, you can either slip through the planet's defences and go to another enemy planet, or blow up ground structures. On hard, the Corruption will pretty much just destroy a building every oppertunity they have. Making it difficult to make an economy because your mining facilities are being blown up. Not to mention the fact that it is QUITE expensive to remove it unless you have a shit ton of planets.

The lack of maps make it just boring to play, they don't even seem to be that well made. Like in Equal Footing all of the factions' worlds were spread out and difficult to defend UNLESS you're Corruption. 

tl;dr unless you like a challenge, (don't play corruption in galactic conquest) You will propubly find some aspects of this game a pain.

The good: Even to todays standards with the Thrawn mod ( can't think of the legit name I got it on moddb) are pretty sweet.

Lots and Lots of units space and land.

No veterancy
Every other Star Destroyer is Named the Alecto.

54,STARWARS Empireat War GoldPack,25060673,english,"First, I'm gonna start with the pros:
- No lack of content, you could play this for hour at a time.
- Compatable with Windows 10.
- The campaigns are very entertaining and interesting to follow.
- You could always try a quick skirmish battle from the home screen if you're short on time.
- The 'Forces of Corruption' pack has a really good EU story, it's also fun to play as a team other than the empire or rebellion in a GCW Star Wars game.
- Very little lag.
- Very few glitches.
- You actually look at what your/the enemy's troops are good/weak against and use that information to win the battle instead of just aimlsessy making them all charge like hooligans.
- ADAPT, ADAPT, ADAPT!
- Snowspeeders are fun.
- AT-ATs are even more fun.

Now for the cons:
- It's not fun  going against a snowspeeder or AT-AT when you don't have the opposite.
- Not the best graphics, for those who care about it.
- Units may sometimes be unresponsive, especially in space.
- Special abilities don't always work.
- It's sometimes hard to go from right click for move/attack to left click for the special ability.
- Money is very rarely a challenge.
- WHAT?! 4 SHOTS FOR A BLOOMIN' KILL FOR ONE PERSON, WHAT IS THIS?!
- Some beginners may find easy mode feeling medium or hard (EDIT: The first few missions are normally quite hard, the rest rather easy).
- Auto resolve is pretty harsh and unbalanced.
- Most of the times that I tried out the Death Star it crashed (luckily it works for the campaign).

Overall, it's a very good game with its cons being rather minor. The content has kept me up for days  yet I'm still going. It is very addictive and it's hard to just leave among all your other ditched games. It also is probably one of the very few games that is actually tactical, making you adapt to certain situations. 9/10.",1471811298,1471979730,TRUE,19,1,0.679005742,4,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,17,1,2165,29,1816,1601077701

4,STARWARS Empireat War GoldPack,24381030,english,"I've owned this game on disc for a long time and have easily sunk hundreds hours more into it than what I have on Steam.  As a kid the battles of Star Wars were mind blowing.  So, the chance to play an RTS that lets you command all the inconic units of the original trilogy was a dream come true.  This package also includes the Forces of Corruption expansion.  This added the criminal empire of Tyber Zann as a third faction, and added additional units and heroes to the Rebel and Empire factions.  When launching this game, steam will ask you whether you want to launch the original or expansion, so you can pick whichever you prefer at any time.   

For anyone who hasn't played this game, it is primarily a singleplayer game.  The main mode is galactic conquest.  In this mode you control either the Empire, Rebellion or Zann Consortium and are battling for dominance on a galactic map.  Each time fleets clash on the map or a planet is invaded by ground troops you get to fight the battle in real time.  
There are story campaigns for the Rebels and Imperials in the base game, and for Zann in the expansion.  These are basically galactic conquest maps that feature special missions and maps, as well as some basic story in the form of voice acted conversations.  
There's also a skirmish mode that features single battles either on the ground or in space.  In my opinion the skirmish mode is the weakest part of the game, but there may be many who disagree with me.  

Experienced RTS players will probably find this game a bit easy, especially playing as the Zann Consortium.  A patient player with a few units on the ground can sometimes sneak past a max level space station and destroy armies of units on a well entrenched planet, occupying the planet and automatically destroying the space station in orbit.  As the Zann Consortium, I can't tell you how many times I've just sent my five heroes  to occupy planets single handedly.  It's amazing how 5 people can so effectively hold an entire planet.  

But even so, it's undeniable how satisfying it is when you do get those classic Star Wars battles.   Dozens of Imperial Star Destroyers squaring off against Mon Calamari Cruisers over Coruscant.  AT-ATs mulching inferior rebel T2 - B light tanks, only to get tripped by Airspeeders.  Zann or the Rebels bringing a massive fleets only to find themselves locked in battle with a Super Star Destroyer and the Death Star.   NOW WITNESS THE FULL POWER OF THIS FULLY OPERATIONAL...  *ahem*  You can get the idea.  

And keep in mind all that I've said here is just about the base game.  This game is many years old now, and there are truly incredible total conversion mods out there that are even better than the base game.  You owe to yourself, whether you're a noble Rebel leader, an ironfisted Imperial general , or a cutthroat Consortium goon to try this game.

It's kinda hard to pin down why, because on paper it all should work. It's a Star Wars game where they add Ground control style combat on land, Star trek Armada Style space combat (which was a pretty good RTS, not AMAZING but it worked) with Hyperspacing mechanics that allow you to reinforce just about anywhere. [strike] Complete with a ""Risk"" style map ripped from Dawn of War.[/strike] [b]EDIT: I derped, Dark crusade came after this [/b] Sounds great right?

Well it just doesn't play as well as it sounds on paper. Again it's  hard to describe but it all just feels so bland. The units aren't terribly interesting (except some heroes), the textures are plain, yet muddy, and it all feels like they took a lot of concepts that were AMAZING in other RTS games (Ground Control's Dropzone mechanics, CNC Tanks, Company of Heroes' Squads, Dawn of War: Dark Crusade's Risk map, Yes I am aware some of these came after this, but they still did it better) but didn't properly understand WHY those mechanics worked the way they did in those games and thus it ended up watering it all down.

The Second World War was arguably the most significant period of the 20th century. It brought about major leaps in technology and laid the groundwork that permitted post-war social changes including the end of European colonialism, the civil rights movement in the United States, and the modern women’s rights movement, as well as the programs for exploring outer space. The primary combatants were the Axis nations (Nazi Germany, Facist Italy, Imperial Japan and their smaller allies) and the Allied nations, led by Britain (and its Commonwealth nations), the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the United States of America. The Allies were the victors. the nazis must have had ADHD because they lost, im a part of the allies because i like camels. im going to go ride a camel.

Each faction has unique units and different playstyles while there are a variety of scenarios to choose from that further enhances Galactic Conquest.

-once all units unlock, the end result becomes foregone
-steep difficulty curve between easy and medium. Easy mode the computer is ridiculously easy. In medium mode, the computer's aggression is turned to 10 and development of a military force is much more time consuming. It becomes a matter of consolidation of resources and base defense.

-Finally a nice space and land RTS game in the Star Wars universe.
-Decent selection of units for each faction
-Lots of room for ""what ifs"" (What if I attacked a star destroyer and space station with nothing but X-wings)

Three things I would have liked that would have made it perfect; first, better support for ultrawides and/or multimonitor (I have an ultrawide and a 1080p monitor), the active image (everything but menues sans planets) get progressively more and more stretched out further you get from 16:9, I would have loved to see the battlefield using both my UW and standard seeing a platoon march from one side of one monitor, across it, then across my ultrawide to the edge of it, but it was basically unusable with the amount of stretching. Second thing is that I would have loved to see an expansion following the extended universe, I wanted so much to fight the battle of Byss and had a level destroying World Devistators plus battling the Kiss Empire (I know there was probably a mod for one of these, but still). The third and easiest change I would have loved would be for the standard runthrough for the Rebels would be following the Deathstar blowing up, retaking the galaxy and the Empire having further and further more sophisticated units and weapons while the user lags behind the advances, or not, just further pushing Empire into a ball that makes it more and more difficult to fight.

26,STARWARS Empireat War GoldPack,22971915,english,"Oi, I wanted to love this game I really did.  Ok First things first.  Yes it's a big galaxy strategy game of Star wars, you can build fleets and armies, have land and space battles, build star destroyers etc, it's all there.
BUT: When I'm playing it I'm thinking, for every thing the game does well, there's two things that crop up that make me think, 'rebellion did this better six years earlier'.
1)You get limited 'command points' so that the biggest battle you get is about 5 star destroyers... if you have 20, fine, they come in one at a time as reinforcements.
2) Ships repair automatically, so if you cripple a ship in a hit and fade mission, eg, you play as rebels, fly in blast a big star destroyer, fly out then your main fleet comes in just after, literally 1 second can transpire, which represents maybe 1/12 of a galactic day, and that ship will be completely fixed.  So anything you don't destroy is immediately repaired.  That seems like basic logic has gone WAY out the window.
3) You can not sabotage anything, you can only steal technology as the rebels, so usig spec forces or whatever doesn't come into it all.
4) Ground battles are  alittle repetitive, and if for eg, you take over a planet, you can't build defences on the ground level until a battle starts... WHAT THE HELL! So eg you can build BIG things like Ion cannons or shields for the planet, but little 'build pads' for local defences to help you shoot down AT-AT's or whatever can't be built until an invading army arrives... what was my army doing for the six months I held that planet, just standing there? Then they go.. 'oh right, the enemy is landing, maybe we shouldn't have been just giving each other piggy back rides this whole time...'

These might sound niggly as problems, and  they are, but they and a few more I wont mention REALLy pile up to hold the game back from being great. 
The story is paper thin, leads up to the destruction of the 1st death star in star wars 1977.

THE EXPANSION PACK:
In short, it fixes about three little problems, much improved story campaign, you can now sabotage and do things like that BUT ONLY WITH THE NEW TEAM, but the issues above are still largely present.
And when you play games with all 3 teams (ie NOT the campaign) You can see how balance was not an issue for the developers.
The new team, the pirates are SO overpowered and will absolutely cripple the rebs and imps, so play as them or get angry, that's your choices.

So overall, yes I do recommend it, you can see by my hours played that I still gave it a go, and the expansion definitely improves the game enough to give it some reply value. ( I got a MOD with some maps, so I could play the expansion on old maps WITHOUT the new pirate team, thus it wasn't so unabalanced, but could play with the new features, ships etc)

Flying into battle with the Death Star II and Vader's super star destroyer with another 4/5 star destroyers is still very enjoyable. So worth a play, but beware its drawbacks.",1463215811,1463215811,TRUE,1,0,0.500092268,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,160,84,4403,0,3822,1461233398

74,STARWARS Empireat War GoldPack,22792202,english,"TL:DR - If you're looking for a more casual RTS - This isn't it.

So, I can see how this would be something many people could like. It is Star Wars after all. But after playing for a good 5 hours, I can tell that this is not a Star Wars game that I like. Which is very rare for me. 

My experience with it so far has been pretty horrendous, mainly through seemingly cheating AI mechanics and sudden difficulty spikes. Naturally, I was playing on Easy, and I'm not great at RTS, but I sort of assumed it would be more like C&C where you would have time to build up your forces and then assualt the enemy. Its not like that at all. My experiences come from C&C Red Alert and Generals and I've also played a fair amount of Shogun Total War. My issue I feel is that the time scale of the game literally leaves you behind within 30 seconds. 

In Galactic CQ, I am frequently being raided and out-gunned within the first 5 minutes of play. The AI steam rolls as it doesn't seem to be confined to the amount of actions a human could physically decide upon and take. The AI is so precise and clinical in its processes, that within the first 5 Galactic days, the Rebellion already has amased an economy 5 times greater than my own. I've been through forums and such and there seems to be no real answers about why this game is so different in play style to C&C or Shogun. But I feel its the fact that the AI moves so fast.

Personally I was looking for a more casual Star Wars C&C clone. This is not what this game is, unless you're already good at such game. I feel like I would have enjoyed it more if I had time to learn and not be swept off the game board almost immeditly by huge fleets which can't physically have been created with only a starting credit cap if 5K. Inexperience is also a deciding factor. The tutorials are decent, but they don't really provide you with the load of how much you have to do and organise. Also, the reinforcement mechanic which the player is forced to use, but the AI can happily spawn tanks etc against you... is just broken. 

Also, don't bother playing the expansion. The 3rd faction is so OP that there is literally no point, unless you like seeing all of your ""owned"" worlds, completely corrupted and leeched within 30 seconds.

Just glad I bought it on sale. If we consider £1 for 1 hour of play-time, I'd say the game at least achieved that.",1462361522,1462361522,FALSE,5,2,0.375252008,6,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,82,4,308,0,308,1462360721

Empire at War may have been ""good"" a decade ago, when you were younger and thought it looked pretty and thought that Darth Vader was cool, but there's a bit more to a game than the characters in it and how nice it looks.  Like having fucking balance, and not making 95% of the battles boring because of the simplistic, stupid AI and arbitrary, manufactured maps that  slosh together.  The space battles are fun to watch play out, but the game likes to fuck up and you'll have to work around the shitty unit management to get them to do what you want.

Yes, there's a pause button on the galactic map, but you can't do anything while paused like move fleets or build units. It only works on the tactical map. Also, some of the scenario maps seem glitched on tech levels. If you go to advanced settings and reduce the starting tech level while playing on hard, then you start with reduced technology but the computer starts with regular technology. Having X Wings, Y Wings, and basic frigates doesn't really match top of the line Imperial Star Destroyers.

There's also no hold position command. You can tell units to stop, but it's very easy to lure or get lured, especially when units won't respond instantly after being lured. This creates a very annoying situation where rocket infantry wreck light tanks, anti-infantry vehicles wreck light infantry, and aircraft become pointless (although aircraft dominate easily until AA weapons are around). In space, it means fighters and bombers won't withdraw from cruisers, and larger ships that are slightly misoriented beacuse they advanced two inches too far take forever to turn around.

The game really isn't that bad, but it's like they choked it for no good reason and ruined the experience. If the units were responsive, tactical map unit caps didn't exist, the galactic map was turn based instead of real time, and the pause button let you issue orders while paused, then this would be an easy thumbs up.

5,STARWARS Empireat War GoldPack,22528484,english,"Like RTS? Like Star Wars? Just like crushing your enemies with giant war machines in both space and planetary battles? If you like any combination of these then you will most likely like this game. You get to control the Rebel Alliance, Galactic Empire, and, if you have the FoC expansion, the Zann Consortium (basically underworld units). Each of these factions plays differently with the Rebels focusing on stronger armies, hit and run attacks, infantry focused armies, and guerrilla style warfare. The Empire uses numbers and brute force (Hint: check what happens when rebel infantry play chicken with your vehicles ) Finally the Zann forces use a mix of subtle corruption type debuffs and overpowered units. There are two main ways to play, skirmish and campaign. The skirmish allows you to do one off battles that are slightly different from the usual ones with resource capturing, and building up your tech in-game. The campaign allows you to play your own war between all of the factions. You manage your troop movements, production, and strategy. There are multiple set ups for how to start, each with a different number and distribution of planets. I prefer the  campaign, but sometimes its fun to just play one battle. 
       I highly recommend the FoC pack as it adds a new faction, new planets, and new units for everyone. Both of the game types (space and ground) are fun, with the space being my favorite. Little tip, some heroes (like Han and Boba Fett) don't just hangout on a transport if you get into a space battle with them, but take part in their own ships as well as on foot in ground fights. Also as your tech level gets higher, make sure you own at least one of the ""shipyard"" planets so you can build your ultimate capital ships ASAP.",1461130494,1461130494,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,56,17,6498,0,2535,1533841474

52,STARWARS Empireat War GoldPack,21874114,english,"Star wars Empire at war is a real-time strategy game based in the star wars universe. Both factions the rebels and the empire have different units. The rebels can use tactics like sending small groups of 2 units on to the planet to avoid emperial fleets and can steal tech from the empire too. The Empire on the other hand can use brute force to take over systems and build their way up to the death star and blow rebel bases to bits. Each faction has a different metheod for dealling with things. There are neutral factions on certain planets some are allied with rebels or the empire and will be under that factions control in a fight, there are also pirates which will control the neutral systems.

THERE IS NO MULTIPLAYER! ( the servers were closed down ages ago but single player is still there)

The Forces of corruption (FOC) however adds a third faction, the zann consortium, who use corruption which lets them carry out assassination, blackmail and all sorts of dirty under-handed tactics. The consortium hire mercs and buy their techs on black markets. You may notice that the consortium has less units than the empire and rebels BUT they can use piracy to steal the ship types of enemy factions and slavery to capture locals to fight for you.

NOW! there is a major thing you should know. When you enslave ewoks they are forced to wear and explosive vest. Yes in this game you can kiddnape baby ewoks and force them to blow themselfs up for you. like i said dirty under-handed tactics.

The games graphics are... not too good and at times it can run a little poorly. but i feel that the game play (which is heavy on MICRO) makes up for it. the campaign is all about using your heros abilities to over come pearls and complete your objectives. now if you dont like the gameplay or the ewok thing then i can see why you wouldnt like the game.

Ive never played the Multiplayer, however it couldnt possibly deviate from the main game too much. That said theres not much to the game execpt Skimrish, Campaign, and Conquest.

3,STARWARS Empireat War GoldPack,21278250,english,"The base game is pretty solid. The campaign can be a bit frustrating, what with the very specific objectives you have to follow to the letter or else you fail. The galactic conquest is more fun in that regard, since you can do basically whatever you want and follow no strategy but your own.
Forces of Corruption... where do I begin? There are the positives, of course. New planets- Mustafar, Utapau, Kamino, Dathomir, and Mandalore, to name a few. New units, spanning the movies and the Expanded Universe (now known as Legends), such as the TIE Defender, the Executor, and Grand Admiral Thrawn. A new campaign and a new faction- the Zann Consortium. New features, like orbital bombardments and using the Death Star II to shoot ships and space stations out of the sky. Basically, it's a lot of fun.
Now the negatives. That new faction? It's overpowered, unbalanced, and overall no fun unless you play as them. Why? They spread ""corruption"" to your planets, expanding their influence and giving them limited control over your planets. So what does ""corruption"" let them do? Destroy your buildings. Any and all of them, unceasingly until you remove the corruption. And as soon as you remove it, it's back again. There's no way to defend against it. If that's not bad, they can use IG-88 to hack the Death Star, blowing up whatever planet it's orbiting, any fleets above the planet, and the Death Star itself. Yeah. The Zann Consortium sucks. I recommend getting a mod to remove them from galactic conquest, so you don't have to worry about getting the Death Star, the entirety of one of your best fleets, and the planet you just captured randomly wiped out because ""why not?""

Star Wars: Empire at War is a Real Time Strategy (RTS) game set in the Star Wars universe. It got an expansion pack which expands the game a lot.

Good things:
-The main game has 2 campaigns, 2 factions, and a lot of planet to play with. Meaning a lot of different ways to win/lose.
-Battles on Foot AND in space. And in the WHOLE FREAKING GALAXY.
-Newcomer friendly. This game got me into strategy, and seeing as how I f*cking love this genre, it's a VERY good thing.
-It's about the Galactic Civil War. Meaning you get to play as DARTH VADER.
-The expansion packs adds a 3rd campagin, faction, and a dozen of planets.
-With the expansion pack, you get to chose your base's layout. This may not seem like a huge thing, but it can be important depending on your playstyle.
-You get to use THE DEATH STAR(s).
-The 3rd Faction has Destroyer Droids. Nuff' said.

Bad things:
-This game's graphics aged REALLY badly.
-It's set in the Galactic Civil War. Meaning you don't get to play as CRISTOPHER LEE (R.I.P.).
-Boba Fett is Empire only. Even with the 3rd Faction.
-The Death Star may make your game crash. (That's not a good thing in case you're wondering)
-If you don't have the Expansion Pack, Luke is Space only. And with the Expansion Pack, he's on foot only.
-The main game has cinematics in case you lose/win. The Expansion Pack doesn't. Because F*ck you.",1455580786,1455580786,TRUE,0,0,0.478260875,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,94,5,7022,25,1026,1601206375

I feed stupid for saying it, but this was too difficult for me.  The first bit of the tutorial was a breeze, but as soon as the second one started, I was lost.  Drag this there.  Zoom in.  Click that.  I followed what I was told to do, but didn't have much comprehension as to why.  There was too much information given to me in that second tutorial and I was unable to absorb it in order to use that knowledge in-game.

I skipped the rest of the tutorials and started a campaign (on easy) to see how much the information on the second tutorial impinged on the game.  On the second part of the campaign, I was presented with the world map - right there, I was lost.  I dragged R2-D2 onto the planet I was meant to, and did the same for a couple of troops, but when I zoomed in to that planet, it said the battle was starting so onto the ground I went.  Moved right a little while and found a laser turret, quickly followed by more troops than I had.  Didn't last long before I was wiped out.  The commentary said to call for reinforcements but I'd no idea how to do that.

Should I have dragged more troops on before getting to the planet?  I understand that Empire at War can't just be more of the same that was presented in Galactic Battlegrounds, but this was too much of a departure/advancement for me.  I'd far rather be put on the planet and have to build my base before encountering the turret and troops - I could then have built more if needs be.

Given I'm fine with other similar games, I blame the tutorial.  If it was anything like the one in C&C Red Alert 3, it could impart as much new information as it needed to without the user feeling lost.

While the graphics may look appealing, even today, the gameplay is an entirely different story. Both on land and space battles, there are units and certain aspects of different factions that you can exploit to garantee a win. 
If you decide to play a conquest game, beware when fighting against the Empire. If they are able to build a death star, it can quickly decimate the areas you control. When defending against it in space, you will have a couple of minutes to try and destroy every last space craft the enemy has, before they'll be able to use the death star to instantly destory your space station or planet, forcing you to lose the battle. 
The Consortium is just as bad. While they have most of the cool and fun to use units, all of their units are designed to ignore your units shields, auto kill any fighters you have, etc. while they have individually shielded structures, and gain bonuses to what really matters (space station wise), hard points.
Most larger ships and space stations have things called 'hard points', such as turbo lasers, ion canons, proton torpedos, engines, and shields. Once destroyed, they can not be recovered. While the Empire and Rebels usually can increase their shield strength or firepower, the Consortium increases the armor on their space stations hardpoints. Why this is so important is because each faction has at least one or two units that can bypass shields, usually missile ships or bombers, so shields aren't entirely important to bolster. Being able to better defend your hard points is a little more effective. 
As for on the ground, both the empire and rebellion have a unit that can fly, a special, unique kind of unit that ignores most rules of combat. Bolstering incredibly high mobility and decent firepower, they can skip the ground combat and go right for the enemies base. With a large enough force, most units wouldn't be able to shoot them down, while you quickly wittle away at their forces and structures. Seriously, they are just that powerful. 
This doesn't mean I hate the concept of this game. Rather, I hate how little thought and care was put into the game. It had the potential to be so much better, and I would love to see someone try and remake the game. 
I strongly recommend not buying the game for more than $6.

I also will state that I have enjoyed playing this game and I feel that it could be a very good game, if only the dev had put more effort into the base gameplay engine and less effort into the ""cinematic"" features.  Read More:

Pros:
- Epic feeling space battles with fighters, bombers, cruisers and battleships
- Mod Support!
- Skirmish modes for people who don't want to play a galactic campaign (more 4x games need this)
- Galactic Conquest mode allows you to conquer the galaxy
- Land battles add some variety and breaks inbetween the space battles

Cons:
- Pathfinding ( and by that I mean the complete and total lack thereof ) - I mean seriously, ships refuse to obey basic movement commands, they can't path above or below each other, they can't squeeze between each other (even if 2 ships at the same time should be able to squeeze between), they retreat into the enemy, they face the wrong direction and ignore you when you tell them to turn the right direction, they take the longest possible path to the destination, and they stop before being able to engage the target you just told them to attack.  As for ground pathfinding, units constantly get stuck on terrain and other units, sometimes permanently making them useless for the rest of the combat.
- The Defending side in battles have a massive advantage as they get a station or buildings plus the garrisons (infinitely respawning defenders), possibly a super weapon, and they can get upgrades, because upgrades aren't empire wide for some odd reason.
- Fleet incoming warnings usually don't go off and so randomly you'll get hit by an incoming fleet with no warning even though you have long range sensors and sight on the systems the attack came from.
- You can't give orders while the game is paused, unlike many other strategy games like this.
- Battles are separate from the galactic conquest mode, so they constantly break the flow of conquest.
- Auto-resolve will always cause you to lose way more ( ie. Instead of a victory with no loses if I played it out, auto-resolve gives me a complete loss with no enemies killed), but when you get attacked 3 times every minute, it looks appealing.
- Gravity wells don't prevent the enemy fleet's reinforcements from retreating even though they should be holding right there in hyperspace and should be effected.
- You can't have your entire fleet fight the entire enemy fleet all at once due to pop cap during a battle, although this is probably to limit how much frustration you get from the absolutely terrible pathfinding.
- A criminal empire is by far more powerful than the Empire and the Rebels combined, with only one required money building that also provides a super weapon in orbit, meaning they can fill their planets with massive garrison buildings, they have insanely good ships and no tech level requirements so they can build tech 5 shit at tech 1, and oh yeah they can corrupt the galaxy which gives them money, and buffs including, removing control of planet from the owner if corruption removed, moving past enemy fleets to pretty much anywhere, and gaining vision everywhere.
- Ground combat devolves into artillery catching other artillery off guard with maybe a few spotting units.
- You can't get rid of heroes which take up pop.
- Space maps feel claustrophobic ( Coruscant being one of the worst with my defending ships started facing the wrong way and the enemy could already shoot them while the game was still in the battle start view) while most land maps are too big and slow down the game.

So yeah, while I had fun with the game, it has some issues, so I can't recommend it, primarily due to the complete and total lack of pathfinding.",1454108594,1454201643,FALSE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,110,8,3338,0,2437,1577581414

51,STARWARS Empireat War GoldPack,20801084,english,"Terrible.  Before the expansion, Empire at War was a below average strategy/rts game that I went ahead and played sometimes anyway because it managed to pretty faithfully create a Star Wars feel.

Then I bought Gold to get the expansion, even though I didn't enjoy the original very much.  I was thinking I would get some more ""hero"" characters and maybe the new faction would be nice.  The new faction is not nice.  Almost nothing that comes with the expansion is from Star Wars--most of the hero units you get are characters that I guess came from Expanded Universe or one of the animated series, or maybe created originally for the game.  Whatever they are, new hero units are terrible.  They don't fit with the original character and stand out like a fist-full of sore thumbs.

Why fill my Rebel Alliance hero roster with all these off-brand characters such as ""Garm Bel Iblis"" when you still haven't added a Princess Leia character?  

The new faction is the worst.  The Zann Consortium--a criminal empire, is made up almost entirely of ""Not from Star Wars"" units such as Urai Fenn, and Tyber Zahn.  Why not make it Jabba the Hutt's faction and use all the bounty hunters from Empire Strikes Back for the Hero units?  They did include IG-88 and Bossk at least, but overall this faction doesn't feel like it came from Star Wars at all.

The Empire is full of weird characters too.  If this game has moved away from Star Wars, then why the Hell am I playing it?  Not for the gameplay, that's for sure.

Space Battles are kind of fun.  They look good, and feel like Star Wars, at least until the new, wacky Zann Consortium ships show up.  Ground Battles are terrible and have been terrible since the original game was released.  Ground battles are clunky, simplistic, poorly balanced, and just plain not fun.  And now that there is a bunch of Not From Star Wars units running around, I'm just playing a poorly designed, generic sci-fi rts on the ground.

So lame.

The Strategic Game/Empire Management?  Not very good.  Kind of boring--you play it because its Star Wars and it vaguely feels like you are commanding the Empire/Rebellion.  Again, the more the game moves away from actual Star Wars units and feel, the more Im asing myself why I am playing a clunky, poorly designed RTS game.

While i like playing this game a lot, i think it would be best if it were played in compatibility mode, playing it from win 7 i am having frequent issues with the game bugging in graphics or glitching during specific moments like the ui disappearing on me, including the planet names and fleet icons. frequently needing to shut the game down and start it up again in order to cure the problem. the latest trouble i have run across is starting the empire campaign, you get the initial planets plus taris and everything else is locked out, but from thyferra or abragado to taris, it is not accessible to be reached. this is just after the first mission on the empire side.

graphics are now more dated then games on more modern standards, but that does not matter too much. as long as the game is fun and engaging, it is enough.

Edit: I wouldnt recommend the expansion though, the first hit impression wasnt good, and after now playing a number of hours on it, i do not like it; the auto resolve ground fight more often than not end up with losses mounting, the single player campaign isnt that accessible and the balance is woeful, your ground forces just die all too easily. this becomes a problem when the ai takes a few swamp speeders to your landing zone as you are landing forces. within 10 seconds you would of lost 3/4 of your standing forces before you can get any control of the units to attack back which more often than not, happens. 

so while the EAW gold i would recommend, the expansion is something i would not recommend.",1452601778,1452682359,TRUE,1,0,0.521931291,1,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,154,51,4352,0,2122,1495635926

*ACTUAL REVIEW BELOW*
Empire At War is an RTS  Set in the Star Wars Universe. The game itself has 2 Primary Modes, and several Modes wihin that. The Primary are Galatic Conquest, Similar to the Battlefront Gamemode, and Instan Action, in which you just pick a map and begin. The two of three sub modes apply to the other two, Those two being the Land Battle Mode, where you use various troops, vehicles, and heroes of the Universe to engage an opposing side, either the Rebel scum or the Mighty Empire. Another is Space Battles, a mode where you use Everything from fighters to Star Destroyers to fight your opponent's. 
The gameplay itself is more or less just a simplified RTS; It focus's more on the War and Battle part than building structures, although a basic Unit Upgrade system is in place. The empire has a Slight Advantage in Space Battles in my experience,  as with even basic units, the basic Tactic of Swarm with many troops is efficient enough to win most Encounters. However, having not played much as The Rebel Scum, That may be true for both sides.
The modding community for this game has created a large amount of Mods, with mods in The Clone Wars Era, to the Imperial Remnant Era.
All in all, I enjoy this game, and, despite some small bits being dislikeable, such as the fact the Empire Can eventually just Death Star Planets to death, I give it a 8/10. Some things could have been changed, but asides from that, I Highly reccomend it, as it is a Fleshed out, enjoyable game.",1452376200,1452376200,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,386,10,391,0,265,1548699076

 In the DLC Forces of Corruption you add the new underworld faction into the mix with new units that add a little variety after a while. And if you get tired of that there are tons of mods avalible to download that can make it feel like a new game.

***EDIT***
""This review use to be negative i did however find a fix, im not sure how long term it is though. I will now rate it as reccomended, but its up to you to determine if you want to invest in a buggy game""

Pros

It has a great modding community, some great mods like Star Wars the clone wars, Republic at War, Stargate, custom maps, so much more. Modding is very easy as well. It is not workshop modding but your classic digging in the directory modding. However very simple, easy for all ages.

It has great controls. I thought it was going to be extremely complicated and hard to understand, however it is very simple. With mods such as Republic at War and Clone wars, they literally feel like they were built into this game and not added on (if that makes sense) It has a simple interface and point and click controls.

Fun and intense battles. OF course with most games you can easily overwhelm your enemy with enough units but if you put this game on hard mode or even if you believe you are the next great War tactician and download Republic at war and put it on hard. You will need to honestly think and command your units, you will not be able to simply hold the line or overwhelm your enemy (unless you spam 40 Republic Class Venators). None the less for a star wars game you do alot of thinking, you get to control the fate of the star wars universe through your actions.

Galactic Conquest.

Nuff' said? But really it is hands down the best game mode i have ever played. It consumes hours upon hours as you command your fleets to take planet after planet or defend from enemy invasions. Mods only make this experience better. 

There are more pros but i do not want to list them all. Lets get into the reason why i do not like empire at war.


Cons

1.Forces of Corruption

This add-on is very CORRUPTED. When modding or even playing the stand alone game i have ran into countless errors. I have spent up to 4 hours assembling my forces in Galatic Conquest for a dumb Exception error to occur and DELETE ALL MY SAVES. A quick google search and you will see loads of people have this problem. The problem is the updates and patches meant to fix this are already in the steam version so i have no idea why us steam users experience these issues.  These issues have made a 11/10 game into a 6/10 because there is no point in playing when the game deletes your saves or crashes. 


If i ever i find a fix i will reccomend this game. But i will not take out the con as i think people should be ready for alot of bugs.  Really hope i find a soulution. 


Things i have tried

Ram fix (however it says ""unable to write to installation path"") this occurs for forces of corruption. 
Patch 1.5 (same error as above)
Verified integrity of game cache.
Uninstalled and Reinstalled MODS


FOUND FIX (will update if turns out to be wrong)

If you constantly get an exception error that says to check a log file and you're log file says invalid code pointer (or something like that) then my fix was to go into the corruption folder located inside the empire at war directory and go into the data folder and delete your XML folder.

MAKE A BACKUP IN CASE THIS CAUSES MORE PROBLEMS

So far i have made it to day 111 on GC and no problems. The problem started at day 50-80

The starting position and fog of war is not needed as in space your sensors would pick up all within the entire system most of the time.

Pros:
-Challenging.
-Includes a fun story mode and missions that are separate from the story.
-Moddable.
-Active Community.
-Many locations from the movies and new places to invade.
-Forces of Corruption is an expansion that adds a lot more content.
-Famous heroes can be controlled, including Luke Skywalker, Boba Fett, and Han Solo.
-Battle Camera can allow players view battles in a way seen in the movies.
-The game can be replayed a ton due to Galactic Conquest and Skirmish.

Cons:
-The game can get repetitive without any modifications.
-Without Workshop, modding can become difficult.
-The artificial intelligence is not the best, sure you can be out-smarted by them in your first game but you will learn and there will be no way to lose.
-Ground battles can be annoying, especially when you kill everything but one person is hiding somewhere.

It's one of the worst I've ever seen in a strategy game. It's real time with a pause, which wouldn't be an issue execpt the game refuses to let you make any meaningful orders while paused. It will only be an hour or so before you started getting bombarded with battle prompts (which you can autoresolve) back-to-back, and it just becomes completely unmanagable as your attention is constantly divided. It seriously plays like a turn-based system that was retooled to realtime at the very last second, and its shows. I cannot understate how frustrating it is to deal with. 

And while the battlescape is fun to play on, it also has issues. Pathfinding for you or the AI is atrocious, and you'll often have to bear ships taking a full minute to turn around when they could have just moved forward. On top of some pretty awful unit balance, battles are always completely lopsided and predictable.

My dreams of galactic conquest and the destruction of rebel insects could continue! 
LONG LIVE THE EMPIRE!

Pros:
-Obliterating scores of Rebel Scum has never been better.
-Graphics on maximum (which any modern computer can easily handle) are not fantastic but do hold up
-Space Battles are so much fun. Commanding fleets of Star Destroyers and Victory class cruisers against Admiral Ackbar and his supporting fleet of Mon Calamari cruisers never gets old
-The AI on hard can actually be a tough challange, and has given me a run for my money on several occaisions. 
-The modding community is still going strong, and there are TONS of mods for this game.
-Playing as Rebel scum can actually be enjoyable.

Cons:
-The third faction, the Zann Consortium, is kinda OP. They have a bunch of units that can directly counter your big strong ones and make you feel kinda useless. This is especially true if you play the Rebels.
-Some unexplainable crashes, but not enough to make the game unplayable
-Ground battles are kinda shit. This can be easily fixed by building a mass of stormtroopers (or Rebel Infantry if you play the Rebel scum) and auto-resolving every ground battle. Can also be fixed by blowing up every planet with the Death Star. 
- Limited Faction choice and few units. This can easily  be fixed by downloading mods for the game. There are mods that expand on the original game, and there are also total conversion mods that turn the game into the Clone Wars, where you can play as the Republic or the Confederation. 

Overall, if you like Star Wars, buying this game is a no-brainer. If you like 4x RTS games, buy it. If you like to get crushed by the Empire or to crush the Rebel cockroaches as the Empire, buy it. And if that isn't enough, you can build the Death Star and win by turning every planet into space dust.

The space combat of the game alone should be more than enough to attract any space fanatic type of person, ground combat can be boring and can drag on due to the population limit (most units you can have is usually less than 10) and how large some ground maps can be. The game however suffers from a sketchy and out of tune ai, making the game quite unpleasant, espicially during space maps and your own units having a mind of their own and not being able to properly nagivate throughout the map.

Multiplayer (I imagine) is where you could chose a land or space battle and then after trying to find a match you would face-off an actual person. You would need lots of patience to play this game because if you play skirmish or multiplayer it would usually take a long time since you need to slowly level up to the highest level in order to attack.

I just recently bought the steam version so I could play online with other Steam players on Forces of Corruption via GameRanger. If you can get past the slight balance problems and bugs the game has you will enjoy it a lot. 

Pros: 
1. Very cheap $$$ wise.
2. Regular Empire at War is almost perfectly balanced.
3. Both EaW and FoC have a very fun fast-paced Skirmish for Land and Space. 
4. EaW and FoC's Galactic Conquest can give hours of entertainment. 
5. Forces of Corruption has a very fun Campaign.
6. Both EaW and FoC can run on low-end PC's with lower graphic settings while having the ability to look amazing on higher graphic settings. (Graphic enhancement mods exist as well)
7. Both EaW and FoC have countless mods, custom maps and etc that extends the gameplay.
8. Pretty easy game to mod and a good start if you want to learn how to mod games.
9. Very simple map editor.
 



Cons:
1. Forces of Corruption isn't balanced. (Not even close)
2. The Campaign's for Empire at War aren't the best and can get boring. (My Opinion)
3. Multiplayer no longer works without 3rd party software such as GameRanger.
4. Multiplayer can be very buggy and cause a lot of Synchronization Errors. (Via GameRanger)
5. If you attempt to play Forces of Corruption online with another player with the Steam version then he must also have the Steam version. Steam players can't play with Retail Forces of Corruption players due to a version mismatch. (Does not effect regular Empire at War)
6. The EaW AI is very dumb, the FoC AI is slightly better but still isn't that great. (AI Improvement mods do exist)

Mostly they are just balencing issues with some of the units being far too overpowered or weak. The biggest issues are in the conquest mode with the Zann Consortimum being unbalenced (""Your structure on Coruscant has been destroyed! Your structure on Kessel has been destroyed! Your structure on..."" so on and so forth), you can hear enemy fleets approaching because of the massive alert it gives you but you can't see where they are moving or where they are attacking just that they are attacking so most battles end up like 1 battlestation and a frigate against an entire fleet (IT ENDS PRETTY FAST) also the ""autoresolve"" function hates you if you have a army (or fleet) that is one of everything you will win most battles by autoresolving because of a countering system that the autoresolve goes through, on the other side of that though if you just spam only fighters like the A wing prepare your anus (Brother made 500 A-wings I was it was stupid he kills entire fleets with them, I stand corrected apparently it was genius). But for a game it's really fun it is, and the space battles have the cool function of shooting at specfic parts of ships which makes for interesting gameplay. The conquest and land battles are fairly bland though as nothing much happens other than those small fast ending battles and land battles are just... well boring. But it is definatly fun to play and I remember why I enjoyed it as a little one.

9,STARWARS Empireat War GoldPack,18756842,english,"Excluding the expansion, I've always like this game, however, there are some weird qualities this game has that will leave your head scratching, but before I get to that, lets look at the positives.
Single player modes, there are quite a few, but you either play as the rebels or empire, for an RTS game that kinda sucks because most RTS have multiple factions, but this is star wars so whatever, each side has their own story in their respective campaign modes, they follow the story but as soon as you get farther into the campaign the less the story matters.  As far as timeline is concerned it's more along the lines of A New Hope than any other point.  Anyway, what's nice about this game is that there's space combat and ground combat, and the campaigns dive into both.  You build an army, send it to a planet, space combat if necessary, then land on the planet for a ground assault.  Simple, effective, and fun.
There's Galactic Conquest which follows the same type of gameplay as the main campaign but a more do at your own pace and strategy.  This is where balance imo becomes more lopsided.  After playing a few rounds with either side, I've come to this conclusion.  The Rebels ARE FAR stronger than the Empire in terms of Navy and Army.  Empire have certain units that are most definitely stronger, IE Star Destroyers and AT-AT's, but as a unit the Rebels just kick so much ass, even the heroes are more than a match for Empire heroes.  Each side also has special abilities, Empire can build a deathstar and instant blow up planets and systems, while the Rebels can sneak attack a planet they deem weak enough to liberate under the Empire's noses.
Every planet is different however, some side with Rebels making it harder to win for Empire and vice versa.  Some can't have speeders on the planet, so yes, strategy abounds in this game.

Then there's the skirmish mode, it's so weird.  You don't have to build any main buildings (like a barrecks), they're already prebuilt, you just upgrade your soldiers, build mines/turrets, summon soldiers, and that's it, but this is where my biggest gripe comes in.

The enemy players regardless of difficulty, WILL BUM RUSH YOU!  They will send every available soldier they have straight to your base, so if you don't build anti-infantry turrets right away, you're going to have a bad time, seriously.  What's more annoying is that even if you build turrents, they will try to run straight past them straight for a target at your base.  The ai logic is piss poor to the max.  It's also randomized so sometimes games will be harder than others, again regardless of difficulty.  All in all, the game has held up for quite a while as it came out almost 10 years ago, but the poor ai logic can sometimes just kill the game.  I give it a solid 8/10, great game, shitty ai",1446184722,1446184722,TRUE,1,0,0.5,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,91,10,32101,189,5107,1601068074

This game is a lot of fun for those who are both fans of strategy games and Star Wars.

I'm recommending this game not so much for the vanilla game (which is ok and fun but not brilliant), then for the many great mods available for it. Some are more then brilliant. For example: Stargate mod, Absolute Corruption mod, Republic at War mod, z3r0x mod and many others. Any of these mods enhances the game experience by so much that you virtually can't stop playing :)
Yes you read it correctly above: Stargate mod! As in Stargate SG-1, Stargate Atlantis!!! Which means that even the topic of the game becomes diverse. You can also play other eras of the Star Wars universe, for example the Republic At War mod focuses on the Clone Wars.

It offers turn-based gameplay with real-time battles. One of the coolest parts of the game is that it allows for the ability to fight in space and on the surface of a planet, something no other game in this genre currently offers! Another cool aspect of the game is that the various space and land enviroments really come into play. For example, whlie battling in space players can use things like nebulas to cloak their ships from enemy sensors to launch a surpise attack just after the enemy flies by. On land, if the planet you are battling on is covered in lava then you will want to use mainly vehicles or find some serious cover like a bunker so your troops don't melt. Furthermore, players can also use their capital fleets and any orbiting bombers to aid them in their land battles using tactics such as oribital bombardments and bombing runs. Moreover, the ability to target specific systems of the enemy's larger ships and space stations for destruction as well as various special abilities for units really makes the game feel incredible. That, combined with the ability to acquire Star Wars hero or villain units, depending on your faction, really makes the game feel alive. Thus, Star Wars: Empire at War Gold is superbly polished from start to finish and any fan of the 4x-strategy genre or Star Wars will surely appreciate all that this game has to offer.

This game, which is basically a spiritual successor to Star Wars Rebellion (which I unfortunately have never played because it apparently doesn't work on Windows 7...) is probably my favorite Star Wars game and definitely one of my favorite real time strategies too.

This thing has got EVERYTHING, and if you get ANY of the decent mods, the quality goes up through the roof (it already was touching the ceiling with having all the lovely super weapons the empire can build, like the Super Star Destroyer and the 2nd Death Star) - only for Forces of Corruption though.

The original is still great though. The ability to play both the Rebels AND the Empire and even start before the Battle of Yavin is amazing, and in fully voice-acted and fleshed out campaigns too? As M. Bison would say: YES! YES!

The ground combat is kinda silly, but it's epic. Darth Vader, Luke, Obi-Wan, Yoda (yes Yoda) and the Emperor himself can lead swarms of rebel troopers, AT-ATs and everything else in between in huge clashes that take place on many different worlds, most of which are actually from the Expanded Universe (but don't worry, the originals like Hoth, Tatooine, Endor and Naboo are still there and even have the proper indigenous peoples as well).

The Space Combat is where this game really shines though. Despite the lack of ""technically"" 3-D combat, it still manages to hold up really well after 10 or so years.

The Death Star II has a big role to play in the space combat by the way (I think you can probably guess how).

I didn't even mention the Zann Consortium did I?

The Zann Consortium is only available in Forces of Corruption, but they have their own campaign (which has some ups and downs and kind of a meh ending, but is still fun) and basically are the cooler version of the Black Sun Pirates (yes even Xizor makes an appearance from Shadows of the Empire). So does Thrawn...and IG-88...and Bossk...and Jabba the Hutt.

White-haired Tyber Zann and his wannabe Jedi (but not really) alien partner Urai Fen try to build up their criminal enterprise after losing virtually everything when Tyber gets captured in the tutorial, and they do this through two ways: One, the conventional way, CONQUERING EVERYTHING IN SIGHT, and Two, the more interesting way, Corruption.

The way this new game mechanic works is that it will basically ""corrupt"" the planet that it is executed on (which usually involves doing a specialized ground or space mission) and give you extra special bonuses from holding the planet.

This can come in the form of just extra credits, or even being able to build ships that the faction's planet that you corrupted build!

I'm not sure if you can build Star Destroyers because that would be a little OP, but considering that the ENTIRE CONSORTIUM is OP, from their massive canderous death tanks that slaughter AT-ATs to their Mandalorian capital ships and specialized capital ships that shoot GIANT BEAMS OF DEATH, getting the half-finished Eclipse at the end just seals the deal.

By the way, the Eclipse had a scaled down superlaser, that was a little less powerful than the Death Star's.

On the other hand, it shoots faster, and kills any ship it hits instantly (just like the Death Star II), so that's always a nice plus.

10/10

P.S. I know you're probably getting tired of seeing these P.S.'s but I'm DOING EM ANYWAY.

Anyway, the P.S. I had to say here is that if we ever get an RTS that is star-wars themed, you should always think of this before you make the decision of whether to buy it or not. If it's not any better than this, don't bother. Just play this. The modding community is VERY active.

Some mods I recommend (mostly for Forces of Corruption):

Ultimate Empire at War (it's inactive, but a lot of work was done on it and it's a solid mod)
Thrawn's Revenge (haven't actually played this one, but it looks very, very good)
Awakening of the Rebellion (made by a German team oddly enough, has had a lot of updates and even has some story to it - unfortunately the voice acting's only in German, but it's great, and the combat is vastly improved on the realism front).",1441100289,1441100316,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,260,50,30177,0,3218,1600874864

82,STARWARS Empireat War GoldPack,17679557,english,"The first paragraph is my story of experiences with the game, and the second is akin to an actual review.

I first learned about the game when I was like 7 and I was watching the Bonus Features disc for Revenge of the Sith and I saw the trailer. I instantly fell in love with the idea of a Star Wars strategy game. I got on my mother's computer, downloaded the demo, and played all the tutorials and the 3 planet Galactic Conquest. I begged my mom to buy the game for me, but she said no so I did the most logical thing for a young kid to do. I got on my mom's computer, went to Amazon where she was already logged in, and bought the Star Wars Best of PC Collection, which came with Empire at War, Knights of the Old Republic, Battlefront, Jedi Outcast, and Republic Commando (the last 4 being stories for other reviews). I was mainly interested in Empire at War though. I chose One-Day shipping so the next day when I got home from school, I saw a package a the front door. I grapped it, ripped it open, installed EaW, and played the Empire Campaign non-stop. The next night, I here my mother screaming at me, ""WHAT AMAZON.COM ORDER?!?!"" I told her about it, said that I was sorry and begged her not to tell my father, and I got grounded for the first time in my life. She ended up letting me keep it though, but I had to pay her the $60 it cost plus the shipping, so I was out of money for a while. For like my 9th birthday, I asked my grandmother if she could buy me the Empire at War Gold Pack at Walmart, (which I had just discovered) and I got it. I played through the new campaign, but soon delved into Galactic Conquest as the Empire. I wondered why I didn't have Vader as a hero like in the original game, and then I saw he could be constructed for 12500 credits. I did it, brought him into battle, saw the Executor, and then I truly fell in love with the game. If Steam counted the hours I had on my cd copies, I might even be into the thousands in all honesty.

Onto an actual review though, Empire at War is a Real Time Strategy game set in the Star Wars galaxy. You can choose from either the Empire or Rebellion (or the Zann Consortium, a criminal empire with many unique gameplay elements in the Forces of Corruption expansion) in either story driven campaigns, galaxy wide Galactic Conquests, or small skirmish battles. Once you've familiarized yourself the game however, I would reccomend delving into the huge modding community for this game. There are many great mods such as Thrawn's Revenge (Setsthe game after Return of the Jedi with new factions, planets, mechanics, and a more accurate Galaxy map), Republic at War (Take a guess), and Awakening of the Rebellion (Which gives the Galactic Conquest much more depth, rebalances everything so the Empire is a hulking behemoth of a war machine and the Rebellion is just a ragtag group of freedom fighters, and just adds to the overall feel of the original Galactic Civil War Era). Even without these mods though, Empire at War is still a great game and is definitely worth your money.",1440346434,1440346434,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,180,16,9271,0,2638,1598136530

The modding community has allowed many adaptions to allow republic versus CIS and many, many more modes and maps. If anything I think the game is too short, I also think the AI needs to be harder for more intense game play. The models for the base game and even the models for mods are fantastic. The varying  units for each side are brilliant and really show the difference between factions. Even after playing the base game there are many tutorials to install new mods to allow new and exciting gameplay. When it comes to the forces of corruption aspect of the game I think it is an exelent new story for the galaxy. Being able to experience the way Zanns plans unvail and experience first hand the Wrath of the empire is incredible. Again all the game really would need is a harder AI for ""Hard"" or just a new difficulty level. In conclusion I would deffinetly recommend this game to star wars fans and even strategy game fans. C:

And now to Forces of corruption, in general I quite enjoyed the campaign but it was kinda short in my opinion. On galactic conquest ""Equal Footing"" playing as the empire is quite hard, even on easy. I build the second death star and Darth Vaders flagship the executor. The Zann band of pirates controlled a small fleet and a handful of planets. I moved my main fleet to Kuat to build more star destroyers and support ships, Zann sent a defiler to corrupt Kuat and before I could remove the corruption they sabotaged the planet destroying all forces in space and on the ground putting the planet in nuetral. I lost the second death star and couldnot rebuild it.

88,STARWARS Empireat War GoldPack,14769741,english,"The expansion pack to this game, Forces of Corruption has containd a game breaking bug since it was initially released; to this date it has not been fixed.  The issues is noticed during the main campaign of the FoC; where, if a player corrupts a planet that one of the main characters is suppose to do a campaign mission on, then there is a chance that the character will become stuck on that planet, invisible.  The player will have no way to interact with the character or start the mission.  How you will notice, is that the character will suddenly vanish off of the map after completing the corruption mission.  No matter where you look, it won't be visible.  If you click on it's icon in the upper corner, it will direct you to the planet where the character was suppose to do the mission.  The reason is, because that character is stuck on the planet; just invisible.  This breaks the game.  The only thing you can do is return to an older save and avoid using corruption when you last did it.

The fact that such an aggrivating bug exists in a released product, is enough to earn it a poor rating.

Edit: I deleted some comments due to fallacies.  Just because you never experience a problem with a product; doesn't mean no problems exist.  You can go to the Star Wars wikipage for FoC and see the campaign bug mentioned on the page.

-Game is fun, and plenty of strategies to experiment with.

-Really is worth the money, with the free ""Force of Corruption"" Expantion.
-3 factions to experiment and play with.
-Real ships and vehicles from the movies (Including a couple that aren't).
-Balancing is great, depends how you look on it though.
-Maps that you can re-inact your favorite battles with.
-You can build the Deathstar. 'Nuff said.

Cons:
-Gameplay is fairly limited.
-Units are fairly limited.
-Ground Battles aren't exactly bad, but they aren't great either.
-Multiplayer servers shut down. (You can download third party programs to get multiplayer, though I havn't tried this yet).
-No workshop. (Mod installing isn't as easy as it could be).

Empire at War is a game about conquering the galaxy as either the Empire or the Rebellion. Or some third party faction.

Ground combat is not the best, I actually autoresolve most ground battles because the real fun is in the space combat commanding mighty Imperial II Class Star Destroyers and tearing through Rebel Escort Frigates.

If you get this game I strongly encourage you to check out the two major mods for this game: Republic at War or Thrawn's Revenge. Repubic at War is a full conversion to be all about the Clone Wars and features characters from the TV show. I've never played it but I've heard good things about it. The other, Thrawn's Revenge is based on the expanded universe novels set after Return of the Jedi and it is a lot of fun. Thrawn's Revenge will add a lot more ships and unit types and heroes spanning the events from just after the Battle of Endor, through Grand Admiral Thrawn's Campaign, the reborn Emperor and that crisis, into Admiral Daala's time in command, the Black Fleet Crisis, and ends with the events of the Hand of Thrawn books covering about the 15-20 years between Return of the Jedi and the Pellaeon-Gavrisom Treaty.",1438287319,1438287319,TRUE,1,0,0.503105581,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,102,27,2456,0,1432,1482811833

The content in this game is mind-blowing; the creators obviously spent a hefty amount of their time researching into what Star Wars has to offer (including EU content).

Land battles are fun, though not visually impressive.  Compared to other RTS games, land battles are certainly lacking.

Space battles are where the game shines the brightest.  Battles are gorgeous, the ships are gorgeous, and the cinematic camera view is certainly entertaining.

69,STARWARS Empireat War GoldPack,16458475,english,"It's a very interesting game, you have elements of a 4x4 game, a normal RTS game, and capture point RTS.

Simple explantion of a game: Many planets, some have perks. You first sent your fleet over, than you attack it and take control. You have pre-made units that you deploy to the plant. Than you build on the planet whatever you want. 

I enjoyed the concept that you need more than one fleet to protect choke point planets and sometimes you need a ground presence, but generally if your fleet is destroyed and your planted is invaded it's not going to be much of a battle because you can only keep ""X"" amount of units actually on a planet. 

The game starts to go wrong half way through the game:

1. Space battles. As the Empire you can not build normal tie fighters, they come from your crusiers. The Empire does feel stronger in space when you are the rebels, but when you play them they are capped at 20 compared to Rebels being caped at 25. Which would be fine, but you're two major big ships cost more points compared to the Rebels big ships. 

Overall the space battles are interesting but at the same time you're fleet doesn't seem to respond very well to what you want them to do. More so when you hit a ships special ability. 

2. Ground battles 

When you play as the rebels your missle soilders are a key fuction, they deal a great deal of damage to vehicels. When you play as the Empire they seem to do even more against you. Which is fine in the long run, yet as the Empire you don't have any missle toting storm troopers. 

Vehicles are too easily defeated, they seem to die quicker than soilders. More so they don't seem to deal a lot of damage, even the big ATT shots at the rebels soilders and the damage isn't near what you would think it would be. Yet somehow you need them.

The speeder bikes for the Empire are sort of pointless. They are suppose to drop a little bomb, but by the time you click on it your bike is blown apart, and your lone storm trooper is doomed. They are meant for exploring and doing quick bombing runs but it never works out. You don't need to scout...You know there are a ton of baddies (or goodies-depends how you feel about the rebels) in the location where you are sending them.

The Rebels assult speeder is basically untouchable, nothing the rebels have can really damage it. It's not like they do a lot of damage, but they can bring down your ATT with the cable lines. Since none of their soilders or tech have something to bring a flying unit down you have to hope there is a pod where you can build a missle bay. Even than your range is very limited. 

The main isssue is the balance, there is not a lot of countering. Your standard battle is mostly about getting another capture point to bring in more units, and getting close enough to do a bombing run which destroys a building in one shot along with anything around it.  It's pretty much a pissing contest latter in the game and you fighting till you can bomb again, 2-3 bombing and a capture point is how you win.  Strategy goes out the window. 

With that said it's a fun game and even when the game isn't on sale it's worth playing. This is one of the games where it's not a thumbs up or a thumbs down, it's just OKAY. Hardcore Star war fans will probably love it, but it just seems like they could have done a lot more with the game.

Galactic conquest mode is great, allowing for battles across land and space of 50+ planets as any of the game's three factions. Bonuses gained while occupying planets diversify it quite a bit and sometimes makes you want to keep the planet rather than blow it up with the Death Star. Don't look for great depth in this game. You have money that is given on a regular interval, which is determined by planets controlled and mining facilities built on them. Use this money To build units or buildings. Diversify units to counter enemy units well.Conquer the galaxy.

The space battles are amazing and what really make this game great. Being able to target specific functions on larger ships (smaller ones like a Nebulon B Frigate, up to a Star Destroyer or Mon Calamari Cruiser, even to a Super Star Destroyer) serves great purpose. The ability to send bombers in to take down shields with proton torpedoes, for example, is a great use of this as it disables the shields on the ships and makes them vulnerable to laser fire. Units  are well balanced, Empire may get the Executor or Death Star to conquer space and destroy planets, but Rebels get Garm Bel Iblis who can sneak past fleets and invade the ground with his powerful shielded tank- capable of winning over many planet systems.

Overall, a great game. I mostly played this as a child when I had it on CD and played a ton, but I do not regret buying this again.

Anyways, it's an old game, and I HATE to say it, but it has not aged well. At all. In fact, if I ever play it again, it will be entirely for nostalgia's sake, unfortunately. The problem is the balance, especially in land battles. 

The way everything is set up just feels weird. It feels like vehicles can die too easily, the Empire infantry weirdly stack up into box formations that just doesn't really fit with the Star Wars atmosphere, and the rocket artillery on the Rebel's side is RETARDEDLY overpowered, to the point where they can almost take out your entire military force at the beginning of a match (yet when you use them, they don't feel nearly as powerful). It's just kind of a weird game, and yes, the space battles are cool, but they have also aged to the point where unfortunately, it's just not worth it anymore. The meta game  (galactic conquest or whatever it's called) is also weird. A lot of time there are strangely fast time limits to win the game, which annoys me because it gives little time to really develop a nice army and tech that can really do damage. And since it's all in real time, it sometimes devolves into a game of tag, where each side has their core planets, and then all the outlying planets are taken by one side, then taken by another, and so on and so forth, and this is due to the unit cap, which restricts you from truly building a large enough force to take over the empire. There's so many connections to all of the planets that it's not easy to actually form a stronghold, and while there is strategy in that, the game isn't quite good enough to compell you to want to develop the skills to master that strategy. I don't think I ever finished a single galactic conquest map. I ended up just reverting to multiplayer (which I can only assume is dead now).

96,STARWARS Empireat War GoldPack,16091823,english,"Honestly, it doesn't seem like this game came out 5 years ago. This is one of my favorite RTS's of all time, right next to AoE. The dual plane RTS mechanic is what makes this game a great balance between combat and building your empire. I have yet to replay  through the story, but I recall it being really fun and quite long (If you consider the different story lines just one campaign, it is even longer). Also, being able to refine and hone in your ground combat skills in the skirmish mode is very helpful, since you don't have to initiate an extensive galactic conquest match. Since I don't want to have a wall of text, nor feel like making an in depth review, just buy this game. Here is a synopsis of why you should:

+ Star Wars
+ Really great space battles
+ Fun ground battles
+Great sounds and sound track
+ A good learning curve; this game can appeal to casual gamers as well as hardend RTS players. It just depends on how much time you want to put into the game, and if you want a challenge (the CPU opponents can get pretty feisty lol)
+ A plethora of units from the entire Star Wars galaxy 
+ The cinematic view is cool
+ Space battles in particular are super fun to just sit back and watch. Something about them lasers...

Really the only con(s) would be
- Price. But the game gives you so much content for a fraction of the cost of a big name companies would charge. That said, I'd suggest getting it on sale if you still have reservations about buying it
- Graphics. The game is 5 years old, what do you expect? Even so, it really isn't that bad maxed out, it actually looks quite good for its age! 

All in all, great game. I have yet to find anything bad/wrong about the game. 10/10

EDIT:
I've since played throught the campaign, and its really fun. Not necessarily note worthy story telling, and there isn't much of a plot, but I still found it entertaining to play through.

Other RTS's, such as: Warcraft III and Starcraft and Command and Conqore with Red Alert as well, you build your base and then your army, and then you attack/defend. This game you build your base  on other planets, then your army, then you take your army and attack the enemy base which is on another planet. The ideal behind this is the person playing defense has the advantage. They have factories that will constantly put out troops, while you are limited to the troops that you brought. You attack their space station and their defenses, while they continually get backup. So you have to work quick to bring them down. Making this a unique and interesting approach to the classic RTS
However this game is not without its quirks. It is starting to show age and some of the units are not fully balanced. But since the multiplayer really never kicked off, they didnt keep messing with it. Yet this doesnt take away from the fact that it is a fun game to play, especially when you are with your buddies/roomies and just have a lan party for an hour or so, or just play single player.

While it is loyal to how a good RTS game should be, you are not likely to have played something like this before. It is really an unique experience to command those rebel forces to destroy the death star and save the galaxy, to create a path of destruction with your imperial star destroyers or to corrupt your way through the galaxy with the Zann Consortium.

The game has good graphics (for its age), lots of strategies to try and many different worlds, vehicles and military units with unique traits to discover. While it has a few flaws (the expansion bugs sometimes and the AI is way too predictable when you know how to play), they're not likely to disturb the gameplay too much.

47,STARWARS Empireat War GoldPack,15746447,english,"I used to play this game back in my college days, and when it went on sale on Steam, I got it for nostalgic value. Playing through it again, it reminded me of all the faults and all the pros of the game.

""Empire at War"" is kind of like the Command and Conquer games, but placed in the Star Wars universe. You have a map of the Star Wars galaxy, and can choose to play the Empire or the Rebellion (I never played the expansion). The universe map is semi-real time, with the clock ticking while you choose to raise units and build structures on various planets to either gain resources, research better technology, be able to build more units, etc. You can move ships from planet to planet, and in the case of battles, there are two: space battles, just above the planet surface; and land battles, after you've secured the space above the planet and have troops available to attack.

Sometimes space battles can be boring. If you have the upper edge, you can pretty much just sit there and stare at the screen while the enemy is obliterated. That being said, if there's a decent fleet facing you, things can get exciting. It's also exciting if you're outnumbered: there were a couple of good fights where I had nothing but a space station and a few regular ships up against a much larger fleet, and managed to come out victorious. This is where micromanaging (a dreaded word to some) comes in really handy.

Land battles can be more engaging. One thing I must recommend in battle: USE THE SPECIAL SKILLS OF YOUR UNITS - A LOT! Not even just your hero units, but you're regular units as well. If you try to play this game with the units as is, you're going to lose every time. Trust me - I know it might sound weird, but unless you really put time and effort into your micromanaging, you're going to get overrun. When I first started playing again, I didn't do this, and got frustrated when I kept losing. When I started to use the special abilities for even foot soldiers, things turned around. The only other complaint I might have about land battles is the drop point limitation can be annoying sometimes; on some planets, you can only land three or four units, and then you need to really push and use your strategy to obtain other drop points in order to increase your army. If you're not careful, one of the annoying default units of the planet will swipe in and steal your drop point. In fact, the default (or ""native"") units on planets will be especially annoying given how quickly they spawn. However, this doesn't make land battles IMPOSSIBLE - you just need to be wiser and keep these things in mind.

Perhaps the saddest part about this game is the cinematic camera option. Basically, in the midst of a battle, you can choose to have the camera look at the scene from various angles, as if you're watching a movie. The problem is how the game decides to put the camera is peculiar. You could have a massive battle like the opening of Episode III...and the camera chooses to focus on a giant rock floating off to the side. What?! Sometimes it will shoot at a random part of the space station completely untouched by the battle. Again, not sure how they developed the camera system, but it's disappointing how lacking it is in delivery.

Overall, this game is a fun way to past the time, if you want a strategy game set in the Star Wars universe. It's not the greatest strategy game ever, but it can be one of those games you install and play every now and then. With Star Wars fandom picking up again, probably worth a try.",1431123377,1431123377,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,64,5,483,0,396,1448767664

The gameplay is fantastic other than the low unit cap in land battles i think its top notch. Now if your one of those people that likes to make giants armies and crush your opponents utterly, then maybe you should think twice about buying. The units caps are very low and very annoying, its makes it hard to crush your opponents and you just end up beating them. Not destroying or killing, just beating them. The new campaign with the Zann Consortium is nice, its not a ""go there do that"" campaign. It gives you an objective and lets you get there anyway you want(which is nice). So all and all, if you forget the unit cap i would say its a 8/10 game, and its the only star wars RTS game i have ever seen. So if you want to add it to your star wars collection then buy at will,  but i warn you, DO NOT BUY IF YOU WANT HUGE ARMIES! If you just want a mediocre force of soldiers go ahead and buy the game.

This mod is based on the Clone Wars rather than the Imperial Era and is well worth the download.

Some reasons this game is so good:
[list]
[*]Easy for a complete noob (i.e. me) to start playing.
[*]Has solid multiplayer (with the help of Evolve or other similar software).
[*]Is the only game that allows full immersion in Star Wars battles on such a grand scale.
[*]As of this moment, I have barely touched on the Galactic Conquest gamemode. But if you play smart, you can amass a colossal fleet of Star Destroyers and cripple everyone, which is amazing to watch.
[/list]

Some interesting things that have happened so far:
[list]
[*]My friend had a full population of B1 Battle Droids, I had an orbital strike and annihilated said Droids.
[*]In a 2v2 game: Other team attack all our mining facilities, they lose to teammates Acclamators.
He attacks their base, a solid stalemate. I then send in the 6 Venators I've been stockpiling. Win.
[*]I start my first Galactic Conquest game. 5 minutes later. Alderaan is being attacked. I have 2 Venators and a couple of other ships defending it. Droids have 13 of their biggest cruisers. I lose.

Overall, most of the controls and mechanics are solid, and of course it doesn't look fabulous, but the graphics are not bad and, to me, the game looks fine. Besides, a little less graphical quality helps it run better on non-dedicated gaming machines. The AI in the game are not super hard, and you will find things about bad ground AI, but to me the AI in ground battles has been fine, and the space battle AI is still good. Really huge Star Wars fans would love this game, as well as many casual strategists.

Rebel campaign, in my opinion, seems a little harder early on - you don't really have a ship equal to light Imperial cruisers, though you do have bombers.

Besides, some of the space battles can get pretty awesome, with large fleets of Star Destroyers or Mon Calamari ships.

For those who don't want to do a lengthy campaign, there is a solid skirmish mode.

Overall, a solid game that looks alright and is pretty fun for most strategists.

SIDE NOTE: One of my favorite, somewhat ridiculous battles that I had was as the empire in the campaign mode.
(LOOKS AT INCOMING FLEET) 1 missile ship, okay.
6 corellian corvettes: my Acclamators can handle them.
21 squadrons of Z-(21?)s: That's alot.
56 squadrons of X-wings: This is going to take a while.

Onto the review:
[h1]NOTE:[/h1]
I have only played Star Wars: Empire at War, not the Forces of Corruption expansion that also came with the Steam version, thus that makes this review for the core game itself, not the FoC expansion!

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
The game itself is an RTS. Rebellion vs Empire in the Star Wars universe that features a galactic map system (Something people might be familiar with in the old Star Wars Battlefront games). However EAW features both land and space battles in a two-step invasion system to conquer a planet. The ultimate goal is to take control over the entire galaxy, but to achieve it smaller, and much more tedious and annoying goals must be finished. The online multiplayer last time I checked no longer functions due to gamespy shutting down their multiplayer servers (RIP). But back when it was online there were a few gamemodes, none I really played. It had a fairly sizable modding community which provided custom maps, Which I am not sure you can get anymore as they were hosted on filefront. Not to say this game is boring, but just throwing out there that there are custom maps for this game you could find.

[h1]Standard Maps[/h1]
Every planet (Excluding one, the astroid fields.) has it's own space and ground map, which will lead to hours of gameplay alone as you battle through each of them for either faction. But be aware a lot of them have native species which will either side with you, your enemy, or themselves. There are build pads scattered across the maps in key locations and choke points where you can build turrets (AA, AT, and AI), radar scanners (Sensor Nodes), or a medical station/vehicle repair station.

[h1]Misc.[/h1]
The graphics on thisgame show their date. The game itself is pretty old. But like I stated before, there are mods for that. Just use google and you can probably still find them.
This game has very few custom songs, maybe none at all from what I know. All the music I have heard in this game is recycled from the official movie's soundtracks.
I would especially recommend this game for newer players getting into the RTS genre as it is a very forgiving game on the easier difficulties. RTS veterans would still have a bit of a problem playing on the hardest difficulty as I have found the AI player does not really have many restrictions on it, meaning it will start producing units from multiple locations at the same time and have dozens of fleets moving at the same time, leaving the player at a severe disadvantage.",1427895296,1427895296,TRUE,2,1,0.541984737,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,106,14,2383,0,710,1575356407

I've always loved rts and I've always loved star wars and this game really does a great job of combining the two. The split between empire-building by controlling and upgrading facilities on different star systems and the real time strategy of both space and land skirmishes remind me a of the Total War franchise and I like it a lot.

The real time missions though are what gets me. You can just jump right into them from the main menu without doing a campaign - a live action space or land battle at your fingertips. Did you ever have those little figurines off the millenium falcon or of some star destroyers or x-wings? I used to play with those things; flying them around and making up little battles and narratives to go with them. This game gives you what you always wanted that experience to be. Good sized fleets and armies to fight even though you'll still find yourself wanting more. There are a couple of maps that allow you to fight more than one AI but not too many. The game does allow for the play of custom maps which is really neat in concept, if a little bit of a hassle to get too for....uh. well lazy people like me when it comes to these things.

12,STARWARS Empireat War GoldPack,14096297,english,"A suprisingly good starwars game despite the glut of terrible ones produced by the late Lucas Arts.  It has a very strange system that I have not seen in a game that I remember.  You have the campaign map, but it is not static.  You generate money pretty quick and the enemy can attack you at anytime.  The land and space battles are similar to say what total war is on a much smaller and different scale, but there is no pause after on the campaign.  

The difference in difficulty between the rebel campaign and the imperial campaign is huge.  As the empire you should have no problem steam rolling the alliance.  Imperial ships are heavily armored, carry free tie fighters, and have more fire power than most rebel ships.  Your land units will also destroy people.  ATATs can produce squads of free storm troopers meaning you have the best anti veicle and decent anti infantry that cost nothing.  

The alliance campaign on the other hand can be frusturating.  Get read to have the auto resolve tell you that your fleet can own 10 victory star destroyers only to play it out and be destroyed.  Because you rely on figters so much, and the Y wing is your only chance against imperial capital ships, its devastating when a Tantun cruiser kills almost all of them in 10 seconds.  Managing ships is hard.  With the empire you just send in your gugernauts and they kill everything.  With the alliance untill you get the assault frigate expect to see your capital ships blown out of orbit.  The nebulon B frigate (medical frigate) is really only good at giving Luke a robot arm and being blown to peices.  

Luckily even if you cant hold space, you can hold planet surfaces if you invest in defenses.  The battles can be tense though.  But just as shields are hard for you, they are for the enemy.  Rebel infantry are really good, just watch out for the over powered tie maulers who can just run your entire army over at 60mph.  

Still the best starwars RTS I can think of, and there are lots of mods.  I think there is even a 40k mod.",1421845286,1421845286,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,479,26,4311,0,1346,1577560204

24,STARWARS Empireat War GoldPack,13919814,english,"Having logged countless hours in the retail version back when retail was up-to-date, I was eager to play it again and replay an awesome RTS in the SW universe.  Now before the actual review, I would like to warn windows 8 users: MAKE SURE THAT YOU DO NOT BUY THE RETAIL VERSION!!! You will find this game super cheap on Amazon, E-Bay, etc, but they will not run correctly on win8 systems. There is an official patch to fix this, but it doesn't always fix the whole problem. However, you will not need to patch and/or modify the game on steam to work :)

 Now for the review:

Yes EaW is old, but it can compete with most current RTS games pretty well. EaW brings cool ideas to the table like space battles, hero units, and a conquest mode in which you have to conquer the galaxy!!! While EaW wasn't the first to do some of those things, they sure did them right. Ok now time for the generic Pros and Cons section:


Pros:
Doesn't feel repetitive
Has a large map variety
Explores a part of the SW timeline from an interesting new perspective
It's in the SW universe!!!
Space Battles
Balancing is ok (Aside from the Rebels and their suprise armadas out of nowhere!)
Zann Consortium adds a fun new play style



Cons
Kinda pricy for an old game
Graphics (Expected from an old game)
Battles should be bigger (There's probably a mod for that)
MP is dead :( (There are programs for running MP on Gamespy dependent games though, look up Evolve or Gameranger)
Rebels are really OP and can do massive suprise invasions



Conclusion:

If you like Star Wars, RTS games, or both, then buy this game. If you are looking for stunning graphics and scripted events every minute, then this game is not for you.

The game comprends both vanilla eaw and forces of corruption expansion, it works well with no bugs (for me) and is a must have for all who love star wars and strategy game.
Some good things:
-well done model of ships and vehicles, only somehow simple if yu zoom too mutch
-campaigns both historical, scenario and free set in a galaxy map with conquerable planets
-good space battle mechanic, with ships with shields, engins and cannons distructable
-after space battle, yu can capture a planet with a land battle or blow it with the death star
-yu can control heroes on land and on space, so yu can kill the rebels whith Darth Vader on land and the Executor on space ;) (the super star destroyer is only avayable in the expansion)
Some not so good thing:
-land battle are not that funny in comparison of space battle
-the third faction present in the expansion (the Zhann Consortium) could be a little too much op for a criminal organisation; also, the Consortium appears only in this videogame, not in books or film (i could be wrong)
The game is worthy of the price, and it also goes often on sale.
A last good thing: there are a lot of really good mod for this game, also easy to install and play with, i recommend yu to try Republic at War and Thrawn's Revenge.
PS
I recommend all of yu to see some video gamplay on yutube before buying any videogame, not only this one, trailers and rewiews alone often doesn't give yu the right impression of what a game is ;)

You can play as the Empire or the Rebellion (or the Zaan Consortium, in the expansion) and battle against each other in skirmishes, campaigns or a free-for-all in galactic conquest. You manage the buildings on your planets, generating armies and navies. The ground combat is a bit lacking, but the space battles totally make up for it. Don't let my hours fool you, I used to play this game obsessively years ago, and picked it up on sale recently.

The only problem I have with the game is the balancing, in that there is none. It's actually kind of overshadows proceedings. If you want to play as the Empire, I'd give a couple run throughs of the Rebellion or Consortium first, because the Empire is severely underpowered compared to those two (until you get the Super Star Destroyer and the Death Star, which takes quite some time. Even then, they can only be in one place at a time). The Rebellion is pretty much unbeatable on the ground, having artillery that might as well just automatically win every assault, and the expansion gave them fast-moving torpedo ships that make space combat a headache. The Consortium generates credits so quickly they can just effortlessly throw massive armies and navies at you over and over until you Phyrric Victory yourself into the grave. Not to mention they've got the Canderous Assault Tank, which is so OP that ten of them can take out pretty much anything you've got. The Empire really has nothing to compare.

Still, balancing aside, it's a great strategy game, and if you love strategy games, you should definitely pick this up.",1420265118,1420265237,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,301,28,8223,0,1600,1579327343

Empire at War is a stunning Real Time Strategy revolving around the 'Rise of the Empire era' Star Wars universe. The main game allows you to take the sides of both the Galactic Empire and the Rebel Alliance across varied planets and participate in epic space battles above said planets. Famous environments such as Hoth, Endor and Coruscant return as well as lesser known planets from spin offs and extended universe canon.
Ultimately you control either faction with the goal of controlling every location in the galaxy. Along the way you will participate in skirmishes with land forces and space fleets and combat your enemies in engaging and clever ways. Land battles see you build bases and call in ground troops from your fleet in space to wipe out the enemy presence while space battles see you attacking or defending a space station with a wide range of units such as fighters, frigates and capital ships.
The expansion pack, Forces of Corruption, adds a third faction and a wide array of new locations, units, and ways to play.  You can now play as the Zahn Consortium, a group of intergalactic space pirates who want their own share of the galaxy. The new setting takes place during the galactic war and sees you entering the fight between the Rebels and the Empire.

Had this on disc for years but time to its toll and both the expanision and base discs got damaged to the point of not being read by any drive I put them in.

Empire at War is a great pick-up and go game. It's gameplay is fast enough to not get boring quickly but it still maintains the challenge and pace of a true startegy game. If you have a beefy system, I'd recommend modding the game to allow for (virtually) unlimited population caps, especially in space battles. Nothing more fun than playing with friends and having a massive battles spanning across the entire map.

Don't worry if your system isn't powerful either, my laptop (AMD E1 @ 1.35GHz) can handle pretty large battles with not a huge loss in framerate. Plus it runs it with max details and AA too so I can't complain too much.

Essentially a Total War game in the Star Wars universe, albeit with a realtime campaign map as opposed to turn-based, this game offers a deeply enjoyable RTS and Grand Strategy experience, all set in the wonderful world of Star Wars. Play the Empire and crush the rebellion with your lumbering fleets of Star Destroyers and the legendary planet-destroying planetoid, the Death Star. Alternatively, shatter the tyranny of the Empire as a fledgeling Rebel Alliance, utilizing fast and agile ships to run circles around your foe.

Ultimately, of the three gameplay modes, Space Battles are where the game design shines the most, followed closely by the campaign map, both of which overshadow, by a large degree, the lackluster ground battles. But this is not an issue. The Space Battles and Campaign map are so engrossing that you will likely get more fun and replayability out of those two modes alone, than a version of this game where more time were diverted to making better ground battles.

Plenty of bang for your buck, with three campaigns, about a dozen turn-based conquest modes, and classic skirmish battles. However, if you're an experienced RTS fan, you might find the ground battles lacking. The unit controls are imprecise, the balance questionable, and the pop limit placed painfully low. 

That said, the space battles are magnificent. Each class of ship has its place, and the pop limit gives you far more breathing room. The game just shines here.

51,STARWARS Empireat War GoldPack,12690727,english,"Star Wars Empire at War combines a great combination of ground and space combat which not only looks great but also plays well.

The game works around the idea of a galactic map with planets that you control. these create a general map that you have to conquer, each planet can change control to whoever conquers it and has two levels of defence that you can have.
Ground defence allows you to have fight in traditional RTS ways where you have to eliminate the hostile forces to capture the planet  or stop an invasion force.

Space combat allows you to bring large or small ships into combat using RTS gameplay, this creates great combat and gives you the oportunity to play as you want. there can also be a space station and defences that you can build / destroy making space combat vary in each fight.

the game in general is good fun for anyone who likes RTS games with a unique take on the genre. i find that it is enjoyable and the game has its own fan made expansion which completely overhauls the game and changes the empire and rebels to republic and federation. This allows for an entirely new type of gameplay as the new units have far more weapon spots and units which makes your screen light up with turbo lasers.

the expansion however can run a bit slugish if you go insane and spam battledroids as the game tanks and doesnt run too well.

The one thing I dislike is the ground battles when you capture a point and call some troops in and a ship comes down which is awesome but they your troops are very open for attack and some times which happends to me alot is if you play against hard AI, If there the Empire and they have a AT-AT and it's at your capture zone you call some tanks to deal with it, Then the ship comes down and the AT-AT destroys them which is a waist of cash.

This power can be asserted by RTS space battles, in which huge fleets massacre eachother, or in RTS ground battles, where every unit has a weakness and strength, meaning that combat must be played strategically.

48,STARWARS Empireat War GoldPack,11309468,english,"This is my favorite RTS of all time. Probably because I've never played C&C but anyways this is a very simple RTS but a very fun RTS too. First, there are the Space battles which are pretty fun and can be super epic. Then there's the land battles which are pretty slow and boring, there are some cool moments that can happen but you will most likely auto-resolve. There are 3 campaigns, Many Galactic Conquest modes, and Skirmish battles. Galactic Conquest is what I think is the best mode because you can conquer more planets and choose your approach. Campaign is a simple Star Wars story and teaches you how to play the game. Skirmish battles are land/space battles where you destroy the enemy base. Unfortunatly the game's multiplayer no longer works but you can play regular Empire at War (No Forces of Corruption because Steam counts it as DLC.) with Gameranger.

What I do suggest if you get bored is that you download some mods. Some of my favorites are Republic at War, Thrawn's Revenge, and Super Star Wars: Rise of the Droid Empire.

Despite its age I still think this is the best star wars RTS to date. It has everything from the original films and is a bit like playing with virtual star wars toys. You get land and space combat so the best of both worlds really. Warning though as this game will soak up many hours of your time. You get some awesome moments such as launching an AT-AT attack and then using the death star to destroy a planet. There is also a larger galatic strategy to the game where you control planets and what is built on them.   It adds further depth to the game so its not just about RTS. In the land battles you sometimes get to control one of the iconic heroes / villians which is a whole lot of fun if you come up against an opponents opposite.

77,STARWARS Empireat War GoldPack,11010837,english,"Let me start by saying I do believe this is worth buying but I caution you if you are a fan of RTS games that this may not be what you are used to. The modding community has also done wonders with this game and for the Republic at War mod alone is worth buying the game.

The game is split into 2 distinct parts. The galaxy overview where you build bases, move your troops and play in a Risk like format. The second part is the the RTS side of the game where you control your troops directly. This is further split into space combat and ground combat. I'm going to give each a review and then add the sum for my total review.

First with the ground combat it always involves protecting or destroying the buildings. The defending side get's units through deployed troops already built and gets further free troops from buildings designed to construct units. The offensive side I find often is at a disadvantage and it becomes of game of invading with totally overwhelming numbers or playing more tactically with stealth based units. This generally ends up being long winded and downright boring battles in the later parts of the game where the combat is meant to be more fast and furious to keep a game going. For the ground combat I'd give it a 2/5.

Second the space combat. This is where the game really shines and you can recreate some of the great moments from the movies. The Rebels and the Empire both play very differently and it keeps the fights fresh each time. The Imperials go for that ovewhelming numbers and get free Tie Fighters and bombers from the capitol ships. The Rebels why they need to buy Fighters and Bombers are generally more well rounded to deal with threats. Capitol ships on both sides play fairly the same with your standard Rebel Crusiers and Star Destroyers but what makes space combat so unique is that larger ships and space stations have hardpoints to target. To many Tie fighters take out the hangar. Mon Calamari Cruiser flanking around you take out its engines and leave it stranded. This adds a whole new dimension to and RTS that I've never played before and makes it a truly tactical experience. Space combat gets a 5/5.

Finally the Galaxy Overview portion. It's fairly straightforward and just involves moving units, building bases on planets, sabatoging enemy bases and upgrading the tech tree. For players who don't want to play the battles can actually play and entire match from this screen and let the computer simulate the battles for you. It's different, it's cool, it's noting totally special but does offer a new take at strategy games. The Galaxy overview gets a 4/5.

Don't expect much difficulty from the computer. The AI is somewhat dissapointing but fear not. One of the best parts of this game is what the modders have created for it. The Republic at War mod can take the place of the expansion and allows you to play out the Republic vs. Seperatist conflict. The AI in that is tough. I'm at the point where all I play is Republic at War and it offers the challenge that I was looking for from an AI in an RTS. AI gets a 4/5.

So when you add it up the game is a 15/20. That takes into accounts both the vanilla game and the modded game. The modded version is much better and totally free so it's absolutely worth getting. Vanilla version is more for people who want to learn the game or are big Star Wars fans. In all it's not super difficult and definately different from most RTS games on the market. I definately recommend this game!",1404261464,1404261464,TRUE,4,0,0.571428537,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,56,2,5923,0,4780,1456084549

Land battles are a bit different to typical RTS games, in that there's no real base building. The units you get for a battle are all the units you brought with you for the invasion, no more no less. You start out with just a few on the board, but by capturing control points around the map you can bring down additional forces via dropship.

A few minor nitpicks: The 'accelerate game time' button (which you will use a lot, as you wait for buildings or units to be built in the galaxy overlay) isn't really that fast, and battles can feel a little sluggish at times.

18,STARWARS Empireat War GoldPack,9823078,english,"omg where do i start one question and one thing to say why i recommend this game  WHY U NO BUY and IF YOU NO HEARD OF THIS!?!?!?!?! DUDE GET IT!!!!!!!!  

i have played this game for about 4+ years and the gameplay is just   wow to any negative reviews YOU ARE A NON STRATAGY FANBOY OR YOU HAVE A BAD PC

 now to start the real review

I bought this game about 5 years ago I do not know it has been so long. I fell in LOVE with this game from the start which if you are a Star Wars fan and major geek (and i am proud to call myself that) then you know some of what Lucus Arts has to offer game wise i remember i watched videos about this and i was wondering how i could get it my mom back in the past  (like i said 5 years ago) never let me buy anything that was not from gamestop but i bribed her to get it from Lucus Arts themselves and I was waiting for the game for I say a week.

When the game arrived I was surprised at the size of it (4GB) which was farely little compared to some games I had played in the past so I slid the disk into the PC and started up Empire At War (not Forces Of Corruption) and I first got taken by the battle in the background and I was a beginner at stratagy games back then.

Anyway I went on the story and it was hard but fun i remember i was playing the rebelion mission where Han Solo has to steal blueprints from Outpost That was the hardest mission of them all

The skirmish is just a slice of the heaven that is Star Wars, it makes the battles micro sized compared to anything else the space battles were ok but it was small like i said  the max unit cap is 25 but with an AI with you it makes it more fun,

I remember from the start of my battle it took about 2 hours to complete one where as now i can blitz my enemy and be done in about 15 minutes if i made myself make it last i remember i was just playing a few minutes before i posted this review and i spawn camped my enemy god i love doing that,

The Galactic Conquest mode IS THE BEST where to start...  well let's see you start out with a huge force and fight for control of planets while defending yours and working to the ultamate weapon (for Empire you know what it is) while keeping your income going with mines and defending them with fleets and troops.

all in all 10/10 it sucks Lucus Arts closed down i would have loved to see them make another one of these.",1397555621,1403007855,TRUE,4,0,0.507692337,3,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,151,54,14583,0,6353,1595630290

I first picked the gold pack up a few years ago before i had steam, the game has 3 campaigns, one for the empire, one for the rebels, and in the forces of corruption expansion you get the consortium's campaign.
The game looks great, although it dosent actualy look too good compared to the screenshots or other modern strategy games it holds up very well. It has a very good variety of units, although the balance on the consortium may be a bit off on the op side, its hard to notice when storming them with AT-ATs. The galactic conquest mode however is where most of your time will be spent, as it allows you to conquer the entire galaxy as your chosen faction. There is also skirmish mode but compared to the other modes you will not spend all that much time in them.

22,STARWARS Empireat War GoldPack,10460550,english,"I bought this game a week ago, and before I even thought of writing a review I wanted to play this game extensively. Its been eight or nine years since Empire at War was released and it still holds up as a viable and entertaining game, even though the engine is a bit outdated.
   Space Battles are superb and can mass into hundreds of ships locked in hull to hull engagements. The battles are so detailed to the point where you can order a squadron of TIE fighters or X-Wings to attack a starship using a unique hitpoint structure for the games time (We have seen it many times since). However, I have to say the space battles are the MOST impressive aspect of this game.
   Unlike the space battles which is almost unlimited on your size of the seige, the land invasions are heavily restricted on how much is on the battlefield at one time.  You land at a command point with a set number of reinforcement slots and must wisely choose what unit you want on the field. The options are massive as the Galactic Conquest mode offers forty-three planets to dominate under the Galactic Empire or the Rebel Alliance. It is an amazing sight to see five to six AT-AT's roam Hoths frozen tundra in search of the elusive Rebel Base, and you actually command them!!

I usually compare this game to Halo Wars on Xbox 360. The gameplay is very similar to upgrading buildings and telling troops where to go on the battlefield, and the space combat is exactly the same. There is an out of battle part of the gameplay (unless playing Skirmish Mode) where you send fleets and troops to other planets to attack, reinforce, or retreat. You also train troops and build ships and space stations for when you actually fight in this part of the game. There are heroes in the game you can play as (Darth Vader, Boba Fett, Han Solo, Chewbacca, Luke Skywalker (Red Squadron in base game only, Jedi Knight in DLC only), Yoda, and more).

However, because the land battles suck so much, it even ruins the Galactic Conquest. That is the entire reason I really dont like this game. The land battles just completely destroy the experience for me. I dont understand the whole, click a button, and units go into automatic cover and are completely invinsible.

1,STARWARS Empireat War GoldPack,9992502,english,"As RTS games go, this title isn't going to redefine the genre in any way. But that doesn't stop it from being an enjoyable enough game, especially if you're a Star Wars nut. Personally i find the space battles to be the real highlight for me, they're just so much better than ground force battles. I also must admit to having NEVER played as the rebel alliance, i always play as the Empire... purely because their ships and vehicles look so much better! For this reason i'm not sure just how balanced the gameplay is in terms of unit strength or if the number of recruitable units varies to make up for the difference in strength... after all, sure an AT-AT is going to be pretty tough to beat, but i wouldn't fancy the rebels chances if the Empire could recruit as many AT-AT's as the rebels can recruit in soldiers!

Those of you who want to play as the rebels will be at least partially pleased to hear that the AT-AT doesn't appear until VERY late in the campaign. Same applies to the vast Executioner class Star Destroyers, although those ships seem to be lacking in firepower and are little more than enormous target practice sites. The bad news for the rebels though is if the Empire manage to finish constructing the Death Star and retrieve the stolen plans, they've already as good as won. If you're playing as the Empire then consider this good news, especially as you then get to destroy 4 or 5 planets and revel in genuine global destruction.

In terms of graphics and audio, this game is fine and has stood the test of time well. In terms of gameplay it's pretty simple, bringing in little in the way of new features to the RTS genre. So if you're a fan of Star Wars and like the established RTS style of game, you're going to really enjoy this.

17,STARWARS Empireat War GoldPack,9831333,english,"This particular ditty was released back in 2006 and at the time, I couldn’t have been more excited.  A game like this was a long time coming, as the last title to have a similar theme (“Star Wars: Rebellion”) was released back in 1998.  I won’t bother reviewing a game that is well over five years old, but I will say that it was an incredible feat and achievement.

Essentially, the player will control either the Rebels or the Imperials and attempt to wipe the other out.  Galactic Conquest mode will let you play a game similar to what you may have experienced in “Star Wars: Rebellion”.  You’ll attempt to grow your empire by capturing planets, which in turn gives you more money in which to expand further and build fleets.  Unlike “Rebellion”, you’ll be in complete control of both space and land battles, though you can automate them if you wish.  Skirmish modes are available for those who just want a quick fix, though it doesn’t do Galactic Conquest justice.
 
An expansion was released later that year (“Forces of Corruption”) that adds a third faction.  This faction resembles a pirate faction that acts very differently during Galactic Conquest mode. I honestly wasn’t very fond of this new faction, as spreading corruption around for the sake of earning credits was tedious and repetitive.  The expansion also forced all three to be played in Galactic Conquest mode, rather than allowing you to pick and choose which factions would be present.  Luckily, Steam lets me load the core game and not the expansion when I want to eliminate this faction.

Overall, still a great game after all these years.

The only bad thing about this game is that the developers left the game alone. And in turn  leaving the multiplayer lacking in players and ""issues"" take some time to fix if they do.

74,STARWARS Empireat War GoldPack,8928217,english,"Although a very very old game, it provides an excellent blend of Galactic management, ground tactical battles, and space tactical battles.

The best parts:
Interactive galactic map that, while it appears overwhleming, it actually extremely simple. Planets have space stations, ground structures, and special effects based on the specific, such as planetary weather or tactical advantages such as production discounts for specific units.
Space battle mechanics. Frigates, Cruisers, Capital ships and Space Stations have ""Hardpoints"" that have different functions, like torpedo launchers, turbolaser cannons, shield generators, or engines. 
The hardpoints are individually selectable as targets and can be destroyed in any order. As hardpoints are destroyed, the ship loses functions, for example destroying turbolaser cannons will silence them, destroying shield generators permanantly disables shields, and destroying engines reduce speed and manuverability.
The hardpoints also have limited firing zones. What his means, is that turrets can only engage targets in their cone of fire, so it's possible for skilled tacticians to ambush larger ships and hit them in their ""Blind spots"" to gain a tactical advantage.
Each factions has it's own unique line-ups of ground forces, starships, and heros. Each one is unique, and nearly all units have special abilities to exploit. All units also have carefully designed strengths and weaknesses, and using each one correctly is the key to success.  No point-and-click tank and plane wars where the bigger army wins. A small force of well-played units will trump a large force of point-and-click steamroller armies.

Of course, the game is a bit outdated. The graphics aren't up to date, and the game sacrifices intense, specific battles.

85,STARWARS Empireat War GoldPack,8801023,english,"might not be the best rts but its definatly a good star wars game
command your armies to take over the galaxy     pretty straight forward
whats special about this is you got two forms of combat, land and space which really makes capturing a planet a process since you have to get both to have full control of the planet,though you can send smaller units, particularly heros and you wont have to deal with the space battle
units are broken up into infantry\fighters, light vehicles\small ships, artillary (or what would be called glass cannons), heavy vehicles\big ships and heros 
heros are pretty self explanetory, the characters you know can fight on ground battles and some in space, alot of them can land on planets undetected and have special abilities, once a hero dies they will recharge before they can be brought back in again
in the galactic modes you can build structures on planets that allow you to build units, get upgrades, etc
every planet can build a space station which like some ground stuctures provides free garrison units when the planet  is attacked
ships and space stations are build up of hard points, hard points normally contain various types of turrets, shields, hangers, engines and special weapons, i thought this was really cool considering you can focus your forces on the most important hard point similar to how you attack the enemy ships engines, bridge, communication and life support in star wars battlefront 2 however these hardpoints contributes to the ships fuction and if they are destroyed they are gone for the rest of the battle (ex your engines are destroyed you go really slow, your shields are destroyed you have no shields) 
one of the things that i disliked about the game is that you can auto result a battle which will automaticly complete the battle and show you the results the only problem is it decreases your winning chances signifgantly, auto battle is only a viable option when you want to give up a planet but want to take some forces with you but sometimes it wont even do that and if you do win you will get signifigant loses
some units arent even properly balanced
another thing is that the galatic conquests maps are always so split apart
i enjoy the mode the most when you start off on less than 6 planets and have to beef up your defenses before going on the offenses, the problem is either your planets are two and far apart or you have too many planets and not nearly enough time or money to prepare your planets 
i wish there where more galactic conquests though because skrimish is well skrimish and campagin is obviously very directed
but then again you can always download custom ones so thats not a big deal
i highly suggest getting the republic at war mod it really adds alot

Huge potential for replayability with mods

3 sides are well balanced with slight favor to Consortium and a disadvantage to the Rebellion
Theater mode is a very good edition
Holds up decentely graphically and is well optimized for most systems
Great atmosphere, reallly feels like Star Wars
Fantastic use of the Star Wars soundtrack

Cons: 
Ground combat is lack luster and slow
Single player could have been done better 
Storyline is decent but is out of place and borderline non-canon
No replayability without mods
It seems like they recorded 5 voices for the entire game and areas where voice acting should be present and abundunt are not capitilized on

NOTE:In this anylisis I'm writing about the gold pack itself. Apart from a few exceptions,I won't make any distinction between the original EaW and FoC
-Graphics
7/10
Well, yes, I have talked of perfection and all of that stuff before, but, the graphics aren't perfect. The original game graphics are poor and cheap.The battles are truly spectacular,specially the space battles.Land battles aren't that wonderful, but they are playable and fun.
-Duration
10/10
I won't talk much about this aspect. The ""Galactic Conquest"" mode can last for days, and you can repeat it  again the next day and have brand new posibilities! This game is REALLY long.
-[u]FUN FACTOR[/u]
We finally arrived at this aspect. The previous two were just a warm up.Now is whe the real review begins.
It's completely awesome.Period.
Okay.You're still reading this.Then you are interested in the game.It's clear now.
The game features the Galactic Empire, The Rebellion, and, in FoC, The Zann Consortium. The main Campaign drives you through the perils of each of the factions, though the Consortium is only available in FoC.
Then there is the ""Galactic Conquest"" in which you control one of the factions to ultimate galactic domination, crushing, liberating or corrupting.
And there is also a skirmish mode, but you guys must already know what entails.
In fact, the feeling of crushing Echo Base(Hoth) with your AT-At's is wonderful. There isnm't any feeling like it.
Well, this is all, finally, I can only say that.... 12/10.

I told you just a bit earlier that there isn't a feeling like crushing echo base,but, there is one.

39,STARWARS Empireat War GoldPack,7991260,english,"Great game if your looking for awesome space battles!

Pros: 

- SPACE BATTELRUUUU~
- A dated game, yet explosions and ships don't imeadiately disapear, I love how the hunks of destroyed ships fall slowly into the abyss away from the field.
- Awesome spawning in system, team battles are amazing.
- Mostly balanced races for fun all around actual games!
- Mauler Mithel- I mean Darth Vader in a tie counters everything but Darth Vader in a Tie (dat XWING tmg reference)

Cons:

- LAND BATTLES D: so much potential... so much tank spam
- AT-ATs provide free supply of squads, actually very game breaking when you have enough
- Assault speeds counter everything. Harpoons in the future are the key to controling the universe apparently.
- The NINE supply... MFW
- Confusing and very annoying/frustrating when trying to build your units, why not be like the space battle and have everything built/unlocked at one key location? WHY BREAK YOUR OWN GAME!?
- The ultimates are ultimately useless until you knock out the shield generators- and even then, they really don't do that much damage, and are too slow that you literally need the force to make them connect with anything viablly tactical.

Final Review/Opinion:

Great game overall, if the supply lock wasn't so low for un-modded battles, this would be an even better game, but even with the supply locked to a default the battles are intense, and every choice or reinforcement you call in is a  carefully decided choice. Should you go for the giant capital ships, slow but powerful? Or should you field a specialized fleet of fast movers capable of dodging the fire and taking out his big supply units? Micro versus Macro, fleet ships engage with decent AI, fighter squads also engage in decent AI at a ship to ship level of combat. The ground battles are giant blobs however, whoever has the better blob wins.

42,STARWARS Empireat War GoldPack,7979445,english,"History lesson:



A long long time ago in this very galaxy LucasArts made a game called ""Star Wars: Rebellion"". It was a RTS game that was released under Windows 95. While this game was VERY fun, it did have a lot of flaws built into it. (one example would be an overuse of windows). The fans liked the game anyways, and demanded Rebellion 2. LucasArts developed Star Wars: Empire at War (originally called Rebellion 2) 



Review:



This game is a must have for any Star Wars fan, but in reality, it is not the game that Petroglyph wanted to make. Unfortunately, LucasArts tended to be fairly impatient with the release of the games and would rush games to the stores before they were even really ready. While a lot of the errors can be seen if you know what to look for, and the AI will cheat (the higher the difficulty, the more the AI will cheat. The only real way it gets ""more difficult"" is by having things there is no way it should have. The tactics the computer uses aginst you is always the same), it is still a very fun game. I have spent many a hour playing this game. The graphics are good, the sound is what you would expect from a Star Wars game, and the voice acting is very good.",1386571746,1386571746,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,223,8,3016,0,422,1593042938

54,STARWARS Empireat War GoldPack,7782284,english,"one of if not the best strategy game EVER!

although i should technicaly say ''games'' as this is the combination of both the original and the expansion.  this game seemlessly combines a civ builder and a strategy game together to fully emerse the player in the star wars universe WITHOUT screaming ''star wars om nom nom.  only star wars fans all others excluded''  (infact many star wars fans of other star wars games feel alienated by this game)  however for the fans they will find many of thier favorite ships aswell as some interesting new ones and allot of backstory and info they might not have nowne otherwise.  

as for the game?  its a fun ALL real time strategy/civ builder.  everything is in real time.  everything is linked together.  from strategy map> space map> ground battles> taking over planets for the strategy map in a fast paced but fun way.  of course if you simply want to see GIANT ships firing HUNDREDS of lasers at each other then you can simply jump into the battles with space and ground skirmishs.  and the expansion? no it isnt some small add on or a tiny little pack but a full new campaigne and my favorite faction.  enter the consortium, a chaotic space mafia bent on ruling the universe!(ses economy) consortion adds not just new ships but also a unique and interesting and totaly new tech level upgrade sytem... stealing.  you can even steal ship disigns from the other factions and make them your own (though technicaly... uh oh that would be a spoiler)  the multiplayer is fun though it is an old game and therefor its probably best to find a friend that plays it.  additionaly the factions arent balenced very well but the expansion does add some balancing by making the rebel faction dominate the consortiom but not to the level that the empire dominates or the consortiums pure awsomness.  a multiplayer co-op campaigne would also have been cool but alas we can only dream.  there is however, a multiplayer co-op skirmish that is an interesting take on an age old idea (by that i mean starcraft :P)",1385546629,1385546629,TRUE,4,0,0.542679906,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,372,18,10230,0,6841,1512974994
55,STARWARS Empireat War GoldPack,1422139,english,"Like Star Wars? Like Command & Conquer? Remember Rise of Nations? This is a lot like that, but not turn-based. In the galaxy map strategy part of the game, you have to build all of the units you're going to use in the ground and space battle parts of the game. Aside from that, you have hero units that can be deployed in battle or sent on special missions. Smugglers, for example, can be deployed to enemy systems to steal credits, or deployed in ground battles.

There's a lot of strategy and tactics involved. Certain simple tactics (baiting/kiting) will sometimes work and sometimes not, depending on how the AI feels right then. Like any good Total War game, you have the option of just allowing the computer to calculate the results of a battle instead of playing it out yourself. And as with any good Star Wars game, the music reacts to the battle conditions.

I give it a B+. When it was first released, I would have given it a C, but patches have improved the mechanics a lot.

This game was created with an obvious degree of laziness, and the result is a frustrating experience.

Don't be confused by the storyline, it's not ""canon"" or adheres to the lore 100% but the gameplay is what sells me. I'm a huge Star Wars nuthead but when I came across the Galactic Map and all the planets I could conquer it seemed quite daunting.

You take over worlds with 2 fleets, the first fleet is your ""Space Fleet"", which invades an enemy planet and initiates a space battle. Should you win this battle (and destroy the enemy space station / fleet) you can send your second fleet, namely ""Ground Forces"". This will initiate a tactical land battle whereby you have to destroy all the enemy structures, capture reinforcement points in order to increase you unit cap on the map (therefore more ground forces can land) and do this with every planet. 

The large amount of units to choose from, different routes to take and with the addition of the Pirate Faction in Forces of Corruption (the expansion) you'll find that you're in for a really long and great time. The AI is ruthless on harder difficulties and the game is mod compatible so do check out the Empire at War Filefront website for huge add-ons to the game. 

At this point I guess I've clocked 400+ hours on this, and that's just a small estimate, I'm certain it's a LOT more. Check the game out, see videos of it online, do what you want but I highly recommend this game.
