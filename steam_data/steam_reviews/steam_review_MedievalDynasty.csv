Did you enjoy Kingdom Come Deliverance and any survival with crafting first-person immersive role playing games? Then you would love this! This game feels like I'm playing a survival crafting version of KCD.
It's as if KCD's DLC came out where you can actually go build YOUR OWN VILLAGE yourself properly! And not by making people do it by just sending the money.
I've always wished I could do more life-play/survival or even build in KDC or games like Skyrim. 

Basically, if you like Kingdom Come Deliverance's setting but also enjoy survival/crafting/farming games like Minecraft/Ark/Stardew Valley/Harvest Moon/The Forest etc, you should try it! (you can get married and convince more people settle into your settlement)

10,77050982,english,"So here's the thing. The game plays ok, but not great. The inventory systems and such are just cloned directly from Kingdom Come. So, that's nice. The combat is shit. Friendly NPC behavior isn't much better. It's a village simulator, with a village full of idiots. There's something wrong, where they don't even seem to work, especially like the fields, if you aren't standing next to them. Apparently they don't actually work if they aren't in render distance...So you have to either do those tasks for them, or stand there and lean against a shovel while they do it. As far as collecting items and building things go, congrats, it's a pretty standard survival crafting game, where surviving isn't really a challenge in any way. 

But this is the 3rd ""dynasty"" title that these guys have released in the last year. They have 2 others in Early access, and they have two more ""dynasty"" titles under development, that they are expected to drop into EA anytime now. When you look at the publisher's list of games, it's a bunch of obvious rip offs. Look at the artwork for ""Ghost Platoon,"" and tell me that isn't Ghost Recon. They even have a clone of ""Football Manager."" 

So, while I want to say, yeah, this is an ok game. Or I could see where it's going to be once development is finished...Just absolutely nothing that Toplitz has done would lead me to believe that they are going to follow through. 

Knowing what I know now, I certainly would of avoided buying this in EA, and I recommend that everyone else do the same.

Right now, its barebones. Looks good, a good music track, performs decent. The villager job and production that is kind of the whole point of the game, is unfinished. For instance, there is no tool requirements for all the jobs and the output from those villagers and profession for wealth production is missing almost entirely. There is no real automation yet as far as one job producing an item, then another refining or using it to craft and supply villagers or to sell. Farming is the furthest along, but everything else is hit or miss.

Early Access..
Instead of paying several people to play their game and debugging like in triple A game, Early Access game make people pay to hunting bug and support them financially, finding the player (market) demand, and creating a royal fan base, isn't it clever?

Yes, Medieval Dynasty (MD) is what an early access game should be and worth my money. The developer team is really work hard to release fix and new feature regularly in a scary rates. More importantly, the update rate on MD is so high that even cracker and pirates found themselves left so far behind the current release.

I would describe MD as:
""An Early Access,
role-play first person view survival (realism simulator),
in medieval era which is popular,
from civilians point of view to build a village (city building)
while let your family name goes by even after you're die (family simulator) which is I guess where the ""Dynasty"" name come from""

All those genre and theme make MD a unique experience. I find MD is close enough to an Norwegian MMO called Wurm Online that I love and played back then on 2010 combined with Banished or Life is Feudal: Forest Village.

From MD you'll learn, what you should not do for a early access game is rushing the game.
Why? because you'll find yourself in tight situation when you exploiting bug what will be patched later. 
For example you found that food won't spoils in chest, so you think it's good to plant as many crops and hoarding food on you village food shed. And then, the next day you open your steam client you read an update regarding foods spoilage and you're forced to let them spoil or waste your time back and forth selling those food to nearby village.
This happened due to the nature of early access game that many players keep an eye on bugs, exploits, unbalance feature and so on. That many players actively report to developer in a scary rate. If you join their discord you'll find the bug ticket usually be gone each day which is amazing.

Other than rushing in this early access you should instead take your time, or even repeat the play-through to find the right pace. At least that's what I do.
If you find something is not right, not suiting your taste, or have a new idea for game feature, you can consult the forum or discord right away.
Of course some idea maybe accepted while some will be on hold or even rejected by community or developer if it's not urgently needed or will change the essential soul of the game.",1601828670,1601828922,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True,76561198159189960,9,1,4740,1625,3522,1601969515,,

I'm looking forward to horse transportation and would like to see a solution for carrying goods across a distance; for example a sled for the horse to pull or a cart for the player to push or pull. Making these items expensive and gated via late game skill levels would make sense.

If you enjoy survival simulators and looking for something with roleplay elements then give this a shot. I recommend watching Kage848 on youtube if you wanna see the game in action.


After playing over 100 hours I have some thoughts on gameplay, some from my own noggin and some from other players.

 I suggest adding more buyers to the game, where everyone will be a buyer. In order to unlock the buyer, or in order to sell to a specific person, you must reach a certain level of affection like you do with hirelings. The more you talk to people the more you find out about their roles, and what they will buy and sell. The main merchants will have more money to spend, like Innkeepers and Farmers, and regular villagers will have have much less money to spend.

Each village buys the goods they need.

For example in Borowo a specific buyer or buyers will purchase your sticks because they build with sticks. Another merchant or two in Hornia might buy your stones because, get this, they build with stone in that village. Every village will buy logs.

Additionally, the hunter in the northeast will buy your bows, arrows and other weapons. Town Guardians would also buy your weapons (you could find out who the guardians are by observing and speaking with them, for example. Town Guardians aren't in the game right now, I'm simply making a suggestion).

Innkeepers will buy your food goods (items to make cooked food like raw meat, salt, and berries) and crops (veggies, wheat, rye, etc.).

Seamstresses will buy your sewing items like flax and wool as well as the cloth you make from them.

Craftsmen will buy certain crafting items based on their skill (the metal worker in Hornia will buy your iron, and the craftsman in Borowo will buy sticks and logs, for example).

Farmers will buy your tools, seeds, fertilizer and items to make fertilizer.

Everyone buys clothes, cooked food, and firewood.



I believe this would add interest and life to the game, as well as provide incentive to travel to different places and even more reason to purchase a horse or beasts of burdens (when they're added). It would require balancing like everything else but I think it's not a bad idea.

This game is great and I want it to get better. I realize it's early access and things aren't balanced, so I'm not going to talk much about balancing, here are some of my thoughts:

One solution to making the game more challenging and therefore more interesting might be making it so only certain small regions produce certain scavenging items. For example in the forest south of the starting position there hides exclusively among its rolling hills wild berries, or a second location, perhaps the region north of the unnamed village. This would give the player incentive to build near these regions or simply more incentive to travel. Another example might be the healing herb only grows on slopes of the southwest rockies or maybe they require areas of dampness so they can only be found in the marshes northeast. These two items are too abundant in my opinion and these changes would increase their value as well as add interest to certain areas of the map that may have gone unexplored or unpopulated otherwise.

Another possible solution to the easy difficulty might be creating incentive to not build in the central area of the map because it's more susceptible to bandit raids or wolf pack attacks. This would make the player consider building somewhere safer but more secluded so that they would rely on their swift steed to get them to other places to trade and look for hirelings. This suggestion stems from the premise that most players will always build in a centrally located position to the other villages (west of Gostovia, and northeast of Denica) because of its convenience. The player could still build there but would need to fend off the attacks. Currently there is no real incentive not to build there.

If the above is ridiculous I have another suggestion: create more areas that are flat for the player to build on. For example a huge mountain, with multiple levels of flat areas, sort of stair stepping up, for the player to build on. Or simply a huge mesa. These new potential village areas would add variation and replayability to the game.



A thought on the bow: the crossbow needs to have less drop in my opinion, since it is the highest tier bow. The player should be rewarded with high quality when they have to wait for it.



A final suggestion from a redditor u/drouinfrank, ''villager buy less stuff/refuse common resource such as stone and (I easily made 400 gold in 1 days simply by selling branch and stones)'' I'd like to expand his thoughts to making only certain items sellable to certain merchants. For example your stick buyer is only found in the village of Borowo (why can I sell something like sticks to just anyone, especially repetitively), because she builds with sticks and repairs with sticks, for example. Your rock guy could be in Hornia, for their homes and buildings are built from rocks. Another example might be the innkeepers only deal in food, while the town farmer deals in food, general goods like seeds and lumber, and clothing. I also suggest a limit on how many particular items the player can sell to a particular buyer per day. For example after selling 50 Pottage to the Innkeeper one must find another buyer for their Pottage. This would make the player vary their crops and products from their crops, and add incentive to unlock more recipes and even provide incentive to travel to other villages. I believe these changes would make the world feel more alive.

I believe these changes would make the player reconsider their village location, and reevaluate their travels and routes they take, while also creating variation in gameplay. I believe these changes would give incentive to build somewhere other than centrally located between the other villages, further changing gameplay variation. These changes are suggested based on the assumption that horses will soon be added to the game.

68,77023808,english,"There is a lot to recommend the game, and I wish that the steam reviews were not just a thumbs up or down.  Out of a scale of 5 I would give it a solid 3.  It is an amusing game, and does help burn time away.  I want to now mention that this review will contain spoilers. If you don't want any, suffice it to say that there are two big issues that make it a deal breaker for me, and there are other 'survival' games that deal with the genre that don't make you want to hit exit game.  If you don't mind spoilers read on.

So there are a lot of good things.  I like the seasons, and in essence you have the 3 days or activity before the season ends.  Lets you see when a shift is going to happen instead of an 'aw crap winter clothes go go' (More on that).  I think the resource system works, except for the sheer wood you need.  The forest around me looked like a team of lumberjacks had lost their damn minds.  Hunting animals did and didn't work (More on that), but once you got the hang of it, hunting big animals I found relaxing.  Doing a town planning thing was neat.  All around as mentioned, there is a lot to recommend.  Then two things happened in succession that were deal breakers for me.

So one thing to note before the deal breakers, hunting can be unforgiving at the beginning until you find a system.  I went through SOOOOO much resources getting it right it wasn't funny.  In fact it was very frustrating.  Once you get the hang of it, works like a charm.  But even when you do get the hang of it, at one point you have a quest to hunt 3 small foxes.  I wanted to slap a goat I was getting so angry.  They are small and the same color of everything else, so you don't see them until it's either winter, or you stepped on it.  When you do notice that a fox is close, they take off like a bat out of hell.  It's rather disconcerting.  Another thing that I seemed to have missed because apparently I am an idiot, is that you have to buy your schematics in the technology screen.  Thanks guys.  Good that you put that in there in a weird place where it was not very intuitive.  Considering the import of the schematics, you would have thought that this would be it's own tab.  But no.

Then, this is where I lost it in the game.  Winter.  I have to say who ever put this together should be smacked and fired.  So winter comes, and if you are not wearing good clothes you will take damage and die.  Nice.  But where to you get these magical clothes?  I didn't find a ready vendor as I was trying to survive instead of window shop.  Apparently there is a quest line from an NPC near your starting place that gives you 2 parts of winter clothing.  Nice.  I had done a few quests around that area, but again, I was trying to do the whole 'survival game' thing and didn't have time to deal with someone's insanity and popping out a billion quests.  And therein lay the rub.  Since this issue is so direly important otherwise your entire game is dead by winter, you would have thought that someone would have put it as a main mission chapter.  Chapter 3 - Go Do This, Chapter 4 - Get Winter Clothes Or You Will Freeze To Death Or Starve Your Choice, Chapter 5 - Hunt XYZ.  So as an average dude, I missed the quest chain that would have saved my game.  This alone is a deal breaker for me and one never experienced in a survival game.

Last issue for me was in marriage, but this isn't a mechanics thing as it is a personal preference thing.  So I get married, she moves in, again I have to survive so trying my best.  Come back after getting some supplies.  She is gone.  A lot of question marks arose on that one.  But no.  She is out of there.  Why?  The mood system.  I think that it needs a bit of a rework, or at least have certain people exempt from it.  So a hireling I can see that you have to take care of them since they are working your land etc.  But I kind of figured that your 'family' is a bit exempt from that.  They are in it with you.  Or so I thought.  But no.  They are treated like a hireling and all that that entails.  For me after the death winter that got me salty as hell, the family checking out was something that got me thinking that there are games that are a hell of a lot less frustrating that I could be playing.",1601816212,1601816212,False,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,True,76561197983398724,269,4,521,521,521,1601777779,,

Only one small thing is missing for my immersion, and that's the Voice Acting/Overlay, but I hear that the Dev's are working on that, so I'll wait, and see.

The game does have it's fair share of bugs, but it's Early Access, and I'm not expecting miracles. The learning curve is high, and I would suggest a few [i][url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLuVdZTGzpo&list=PLhk2InOhK1bcemWpVywfbg4eMgSL6aFku]YouTube: Walk-through[/url][/i] videos before purchasing this game, to see if it's up your alley.

There's plenty to do, explore, and the map is a decent size too. The graphics are superb, and the music score is soothing, but repetitive. You can learn/upgrade many things in this game, including yourself. The skill tree is very diverse, and immersive to watch your character grow, and mature.

Before you buy this, I'd recommend you see how it's coming along, read some reviews [i](Good & Bad),[/i] be cautious of the Supporting DLC [i](they are actually charging you for a [b]GAME MANUAL},[/b][/i] and observe the forums, as this company [i][b](Toplitz)[/b][/i] has recently displayed a history of not completing what they ask their Developers to start [i][b](Farmer's & Lumberjack's Dynasty),[/b][/i] and abruptly stops communicating on the forums with those that helped support their EA projects in the past. Dozens of inquiries go [i][b]Unanswered.[/b][/i] I hope I'm wrong on this, and the newly acquired Developers [i][b](Render Cube)[/b][/i] gets the chance to finish this, or any future support from me will end for games by [i][b]Toplitz.[/b][/i]

You may also want to note that [i][b]Render Cube,[/b][/i] is both a Developing Company, and a Publisher, but I truly don't believe they have publishing rights with this game judging by the way they are listed on the Store Page.

The reason I posted this is because they also have a game out called [i][url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/767360/Monster_League/]Monster League,[/url][/i] where they are listed as Developer/Publisher, and that game has been in Early Access since October of 2018 with only 38 reviews currently. It's also their only game out, and hasn't seen an update since June of 2019. Draw your own conclusions.

So, based on that, the game gets a 8/10. This is why I bought it. Looks good, feels good, and sounds good, but still skeptical about it's completion should they start another EA game. However, I may not have purchased this one if I payed closer attention to what [i][b]Toplitz[/b][/i] did with [i][b]Farmer's & Lumberjack's Dynasty,[/b][/i] regardless whom the Developers were. It's the Publisher that has the purse-strings, and therefore calls the shots. So [i][b]Toplitz[/b][/i] gets a 2/10 on Communications & Support for their loyal EA backers on their previous games. Total Rating: 5/10.

86,77012410,english,"First of all before you jump into conclusion to buy this game remember this is EA (Early Access). 
Things can change and will change in time before game leaves alpha status.
If above is ok for you then this below review is for you.

For beginners you have to start building your own dynasty from scratch. That means making sure you have good starting spot to build houses and expand from there. Make sure you think before you start building. Many have moved their houses later on for better spot and its not easy rather time consuming. One thing to keep in mind at current game status with no horses you move around by foot all the time so build close to npc village as you need money from selling items.

Game has many aspects that make it unique. You have to craft food, items, plant food, gather materials and sell also to make money. So economy is big part of this game and as EA status it already does this very well. If you look some instant combat action then this game is not for you. Fighting will be only by hunting animals for now. You can use bows or spears. Later in development we know already there will be bandits. For now this game is all about your settlement manage and surviving seasons and years. ALL people get old including you and your workers you hire. You can have heir before you die and continue playing as heir. So technically you can keep playing this game forever if you dont die without having hier who is old enough. 

Game is very beautiful and well designed. Day and night cycles with 4 seasons. Each have its own differences what you can do and grow that season. That includes what you can gather in the world. It adds a lot depth to the game. There can be some bugs with quests but its expected from EA. If you like to build, plant, hunt and gather type focused game while expanding your settlement and growing it each day then this game is for you. There will be more content coming by end of this year so this is just a start.

What if there was a game that mixed all three of those together?   I know, you think I am nuts saying that you can mix Banished in with a First Person Survival game, but.... somehow they did it.    

You start off as a peasant.   You get granted some land.  As much land as you want, provided you can make good use of it (and pay the taxes).  You build yourself a little house, maybe a field to raise a crop or two.   You build up your reputation and befriend NPCs to come and work for you.   You can assign these NPCs to a number of tasks like gathering resources, hunting, tending fields, crafting tools.   

There are a few bad points to game, but since the game is still in early development, these may be changing at some point.  Key among these is lack of control over your starting character.    You will always start off as a male, and can't even choose your own name.  Not only that, but when you eventually have an offspring to be your heir, you can't decide the child's name either.   

This game is still very early access.  Current version as of this writing is still Alpha 0.1.1.0.   There are a number of items in the skill and technology trees that are not yet implemented.  All of these are clearly marked.   What is there is stable and works well though.

The developers are extremely proactive, frequently releasing patches and hot fixes.   As an example, there was an update this past Friday (Oct 2), which changed the rate at which food spoiled, and allowed it spoil even in stored.   A lot of people were upset at how fast it was spoiling.  The developers released a Hot Fix within HOURS (not days) tweaking the spoil rate to something much more palatable to the players.

After 72 hours of gameplay, I think it's for those who like a survival game that allow you to build your community. You don't design your buildings like in the sims but the game is getting better and better. 
Yes for now it's not a ""completed"" game and I rate it as it is right now. 
I would give 9/10 for an early access game.
It's beautiful. The developers are making lot of updates. I can see that they care. 
I got hook and the only reason why I play less now is because I finished the main quest.
The only reason why i reduce 1 point is because after I played a lot... I felt like there is no threat in the game yet. 
I saw that they play to add bandits later on.. I can't wait to get back to the game when they come.
I wonder if we can have a ""Caravan"" to have our merchant going to sell our product to other cities. 
Better economy? Right now the best way to make money that i found is to sell Iron Arrows.
Sure, i didn't do any math behind this to make the best profit possible.. but arrows weight nothing and i can carry them all sell them.
It would be awesome if it would be voiced and i don't think we will get it one day.. 

Sounds are nice
Weather is a little buggy with the rain but it will probably get polished later.
Graphics are really good.

In future updates.. i hope we will get a bigger world.. once we can travel on horses.. and maybe a dedicated server and make settlement with friends. in coop or separately .. that would be nice.

Quests.. optional quest annoy me when they ask to go kill wolfs and they can't be found anywhere. 
some quest ask for a bow and you can only buy it for 700 gold and the reward is really not worth it.

Still need some balancing to do but it's an early access, it exceed my expectation in many ways. With time i think this game can get a 10/10. 

Right now it stay at 9/10 but for an early access  it's better than many finished game.

10,76995882,english,"I am REALLY enjoying this game! It's like a mix of many of my favorite games - The medieval atmosphere of Kingdom Come and Ultima Online (very beautiful music), the survival aspect of games like DayZ, the building aspect of games like Fallout 4 and Minecraft (not my favorites but it's lovely in this game) - another way to describe this game is a 3d modern version of Unreal World in many ways which is the greatest survival game of all time! 

You pick berries in the summer, mushrooms and herbs in the fall, hunker down for winter, and start again in Spring (when morels are in season!)

Just as a SURVIVAL game alone this game is a pleasure to play, and I say that as someone who really likes the genre but hasn't been drawn to many aside from DayZ and UnReal World, 2 of my favorite games ever.

You can shoot an arrow into a deer and then track it's blood as it bleeds out (similar to UnReal World). The arrow has drop so you have to accommodate for it (i.e. it's not hitscan). Your items will take wear and tear, you'll need to constantly be scavenging and harvesting sticks and lumber. You will need to keep an eye on your temperature, hunger, thirst, health, stamina, and so forth. You will need to find ways to preserve your food.

BUT THEN you have the entire aspect of recruiting people into your village, giving them jobs, keeping them supplied. You need to keep them happy through adequate access to shelter, wood, food, and so forth. But before that you have to build up their trust through getting to know them (if you talk about fancy clothes to a laborer they will lose respect for you and so forth). 

I really think this game has a TON of potential. I spent my first 12 hours basically playing it as a survival game and really enjoyed it, then I came into the ""dynasty"" management aspect which just adds a massive new layer.

I really can't recommend this game enough, but I will give some criticisms (coming from a place of pure idealism) -

1. A game like this that is an MMO is my dream game, essentially a modern Ultima Online with more hardcore survival elements, or a game like UnReal World in a multiplayer setting. Making an MMO is a massive feat and this game is wonderful as a single player game, but ideally I would love to see an MMO like this.

2. Some aspects are a bit too easy, within my first session I was able to take out bears with a bow and arrow. Now don't get me wrong, I like that it's realistic in that sense, but the AI is fairly easy to exploit... I would like to see the animals flee and having to track their blood through a grueling process in the vain of UnReal World, and I would like to see meat, fur, and leather have more value. But with that said I understand this game is not just purely a survival game and that might tip the scales a bit much in that direction for it's vision.

3. ""Medieval Dynasty"" is a pretty bland, generic name for what is truly an amazing game of multitudes (very minor complaint).

And this game is in early access of course so expect many unfinished features and mechanics and some bugs.

Overall, i'll say it again, this game is truly wonderful and I love it.",1601768962,1601771025,True,7,1,0.619791626930236816,0,True,False,True,76561197967742702,152,16,3089,3089,875,1602051943,,

12,76996556,english,"Super boring. Unless you enjoy the slow parts of survival crafting games or MMOs. In the few hours ive played, quests have been nothing but fetch quests and to talk to the fella 3 miles away. Whos then going to want you to talk to the other chucklefuck you passed 20 minutes ago on the way over. 2 miles back the way you came.

You gotta grind pretty hard to get anything too. Just kill more deer, boar, and rabbits than can feed 10 families. Then you can maybe make your own bow. Ah but wait, you need feathers for the arrows! A handful may drop from SOME trees you chop down. Better start clearcutting. You need 50! Or you can try to set up a Coop and take them from chickens! But you gotta do the tilling and farming and sowing and harvesting before you unlock the opportunity to even think of doing so! Not to mention the money required. Exciting! Better to just buy them from the guy in the corner of the map. Just a quick 10 minute jog with nothing on the way.

You should bring some shekels with you though since its gonna cost something. The best way ive found making money has been you guess it, picking mushrooms, berries, and sticks for 20 minutes and selling them all for 1-2 chorepoints a piece. Engaging as all fuck! Games are already a waste of time but man this kinda stuff really makes one FEEL it too.

FYI, a basic wooden shovel costs 100 chorepoints. A waterskin costs 200 chorepoints. Or you can research them through repetative berrypicking, then buying the associated workshop, building the workshop yourself, and then create the tool. After you've bought the schematic. 

They also got those sweet perks you can unlock like % more health, or % less stamina drain, or +1 exp per action, or chopping wood with less chops required. Wow!

Real butthurt i dropped 32 bucks on a single player MMO game. Especially since it plays no differently from any other early access, survival, crafting, walking sim. All the innovative stuff must be after 20 hours of gametime or something.  Too bad i died of boredom 5 hours into it. (Honestly it was within 1 hour but i figured it'd get better/give the benefit of the doubt/am too stupid/gullible) It'd be different if you earned through skill or exploration or something. Or had an engaging couple of quests at least. Or actual threats at-all anywhere.

But nope, its all just mind numbing repetition with no variation and quests like 
""Bring me 4 logs, a string, and 13 sticks bruh.""
""Thanks for that stuff, heres your reward!""

This is one of those games we have been waiting a long time for, a dynamic Medieval life sim.  Guild 2 was close, Saelic is getting there, Banished/Forest village tried, Kingdoms has been trying hard to get there, and Kingdom Come almost got it with their DLCs. Medieval Dynasty is starting out ahead of them all.

There are some janky bugs: people lying flat floating across the ground, FIXED! quests do not complete FIXED!, animals fall out of the sky, crops being harvested in fall that I didn’t harvest (and didn’t get the materials for)FIXED!, and other funky non-game breaking bugs. 

Farming, I was able to get a “small bag” and tried to spread manure, which there is an option to do when right clicking, however a regular “bag” is required. (nevermind this doesnt work either)  FIXED! I wasted a lot of expensive materials in early game trying to figure that out. And arbitrary limits to placing items? I can only build one trap?

Building and crafting items are also locked behind long lines of ""points"" that you really don’t have a lot of control over, just have to wait a very long time to unlock what you need after a seemingly random list of “technology”. Want to build a cow pasture:  unlock barns, then hen house, pig pens, goose house, food storages, sheep farms… then when you hit 5000 points, you can make a cow farm?  Not done yet though… you have to purchase schemes to be able to use the tech. Oh and building limits, really?? How about the exponential taxes and decay are the limit.

Settlements are amazing... After 20h of trying to farm, hunt, and scavange, to see my peasants do it for me is very rewarding.... I like to just stand there and watch them work! Its very easy to manage them, and they have skills for each type of work. It is very well thought out. Still don't like the building limits though, they are tied to Dynasty points.

Skills on the other hand are a bit better thought out and there is more control with the literal skills tree. Most of which just decrease crafting times 10% or increase the rate of skill points +1 so not too exciting. 

Interacting with NPCs is very mechanical. When you enter a village everyone gets into place like the Truman Show: OK everyone! the player is coming! Everyone get into your places! And they mosey over to the fields and stand in front of their houses. Trying to get someone to like you is like rolling dice rather than navigating a conversation. I read the conversations are tied to the skills and profession of the NPC. Knowing that makes a bit more sense but conversations are just so linear. 

Quests are interesting as most are story archs, but some smaller ones are a bit repetitive. I really like when the quests change the village, 50h in and I am still uncovering new quests.

Hunting is fun and my favorite so far, sneaking up on an animal with a spear or bow, trapping a bunny, skinning. Gives a great feel to the world as you travel between towns. 

Building your own stead, and eventually your own village is a lot of fun. The building is mostly intuitive once you figure out how to build the first building.   

Forging is fun since it is tied to seasons, spring has different flora and fauna in the world than fall. Planting crops are based on seasonal changes as well. However, my main source of income keeps being picking up sticks. 1 stick= 1 gold. I really picked the wrong profession in RL! I am quiting my job and will be a Stick Pickerupper!

Crafting is fun… however by the time you can unlock the tech and craft the item you don’t really need it. 

So with all that, the game is buggy and janky but fun to play. They have patches every day and a great start to a great game and this is the beginning of early access. I recommended Medieval Dynasty because it is ahead of a limited genre of similar games , it’s fun despite its flaws, and the devs are VERY engaged.

The only thing I find annoying for now is that when building a house (or anything that needs logs) you have to carry like 10-15 logs just to place the foundation, but logs are very very heavy which makes it difficult to carry them all at once. 

I also find that the seasons are quite short but I understand why they do it. I assume every day symbolizes 1 month. So day 1 of spring is February or March, day 2 is March or April and so on. 

I also love that you can continue playing as the heir after you ""finish"" with the first character, so you do have many opportunities to do the things you didn’t do as the first one.

Having said that, I was really in the mood to play a base building game.  I saw some youtube videos, and bit the bullet and bought.  And did not regret.

For me, this game is a city builder game, like Banished or similar, BUT you play in first person.  You have resources that you need to get, like a survival game, and you get to build stuff, like a survival game, BUT you build a village, from scratch.  You have to recruit people, to be in your village, and you even court a wife.  

I have played this for about 60 hours.  During that time, the developer has made numerous patches to the game, mainly balancing and QOL.  There is a roadmap for adding additional features.  If the developer continues to be as responsive as they are now, the game can turn into a masterpiece.

Since it is EA, there are bugs and glitches, but the developer is constantly fixing issues.  Far from a finished product, it is very stable, at least for me, and very playable.  Right now it is a guided sandbox game.  By that, you need to complete certain requirements in order to unlock new buildings, but as of now, there is no real story.  If you like the grind in a game, you will love this one.

I will be shelving the game, for now.  Not because I am bored or it is a buggy mess, but because I want to wait for its full release.

49,76972996,english,"I will not recommend this game for now for one reason:

The developers have a discord channel and they regularly create polls to gather feedback, like 15 polls in a day. Then they choose one of the polls as a winner of the day. I don't have detailed information on how the winner is selected and what it means but it seems like the poll with highest approval becomes the winner and I am guessing winner gets priority.

At first this sounds like a good idea right? Well, here is the issue with it:
The game has some game breaking issues. Personally for me it is the fact that your workers do not need any of the required ingredients of production chain. A basic example being seeds and fertilizer for farms. If you assign a worker to a farm, they will fertilize and sow the field without anything. This is a big problem because as a player you need both of the ingredients and they are expensive and time consuming to acquire. So using a worker instead is almost literally a cheat.
When this mechanic was asked as a poll vast majority voted to have workers require those ingredients.
However there was another poll that got the winner of the day:
Adding random villagers walking on roads
A feature that is good for immersion but not even close to being essential is chosen as poll winner because the above issue is jut a bit more controversial.

If developers keep following this method to improve game, I am afraid that the end product won't be as good. Currently it feels like developers using the polls to forward all the blame to them while core mechanic issues are being ignored.

52,76971918,english,"Edit: I do have an additional 50+ Hours of Offline play on this game.

I do greatly enjoy this game. Common complaints I find is people saying day/night/season/year time cycle is too fast; quest rewards dropping if you reload or save scum; items are too expensive to make and don't deal enough damage/durability.

I personally growing up on a farm and being a history buff can swear to you that work 16+ hours a day is common and historically accurate, plus the game does NOT require you to sleep so you have 24hrs a day to do things, and final time cycle argument is This is a game played on a YEAR time schedule not a DAY time schedule. That is why you have families, children PCs, and legacy is such an important factor in things.

Quest rewards dropping on reloading into game I also Personally like as it helps with immersion and puts pressure on you giving the quests and rewards meaning and pride once completed. 

Bow, arrows, spears, tools, and their upgrade tries are something. I think that their ease to make and availability vs their damage and durability is questionable, BUT each upgrade does feel like a Significant upgrade. People complain that you cannot INSTANTLY one shot things with a higher tier bow, crossbow, or spear and again I think this stems from an realistic standpoint. You're not building a Ark survival evolved or connan type RPG game where everything Scales with the PC. Rather the PC advances while the world stays the same. 

In closing my recommendation is to make a ""world settings"" panel so people can tweak these when they start their games. So the current ~10 IRL hour year cycle doesn't get extended for everyone, just because some of the player base doesn't realize that you can never finish everything each day and the game does a FANTASTIC job in it's realistic portrayal of medieval lifestyle.  Same with the items, animal density, and those that choose role-playing over min/maxing. 

Feel free to voice your opinions in the open comment section. The last I knew the devs were watching and commenting on the reviews and I hope they see this one here and agree that a world settings panel would be better than changing the well balanced work/time and penalties to save scum.

The Forest, Ark, The Long Dark, Conan Exiles, Green Hell...

[u]Building simulation[/u]
Banished, Settlers, Frostpunk

[u]RPG[/u]
Games like Skyrim

[b]Story/Content[/b]
You have a medieval open world in front of you and complete freedom in choosing a location for your future village. You start by building a house of your own and then expand in the course of time, building more and more houses (smithy, sewing workshop, tavern, barns, crop fields…) and inviting more and more people to your village. Therefore, you need to unlock the necessary technologies and increase your skill levels (i.e. crafting, diplomacy, production…). At the sime time, you can complete (main and side) quests in turn for money, gifts or to get on in the story line. To ensure a long time existence of your village, you should regularly talk to people of the surrounding villages to eventually find a wife, marry, and become father of a child. In that way, your village will continue its journey even after your death (you start as an 18-year old, so there is plenty of time). 

To me, bringing together several of my all time favorite genres, this game is highly addictive. I got to force myself not to play it each day, because otherwise I wouldn’t do anything else :D 

[b]Development[/b]
This is an EA, so of course there are still some bugs – which I consider minor and not at all decreasing the fun of the game. I.e. sometimes quests want you to deliver goods that you don’t have the technology for yet or goods that are only available in a different season. Also, the crop field management is a little buggy as the „orders“ of crops to be planted sometimes just vanish and I have to remanage them. 

[b]Wishes[/b]
As for me, there are some things I’d love to see in the game in future. 

- For example, letting you know the exact task you have to complete when taking a quest. At the moment, you take the quest and only after that you can see what you actually have to do. 

- I’d also like the map to be centered around me when I open it, so that I don’t have to manually move it. 
The chests created inside the houses are often much to small to carry all the goods I have. I’d like to either be able to craft additional chests or to have an increased weight limit for the chests or, and that is another general wish of mine, to have it a little easier to sell stuff. Because currently for example, I am drowning in cabbage and due to my own carry limit of 40 kg, I have to run to and from neighboring villages for so many times, until I have sold what I want to sell. It takes me forever. So currently, there is cabbage lying around everywhere in my village, as the chests are all full and I need much time to sell it. At the same time, I want to get a lot of money so that I can unlock all technologies etc. 

- I’d love to build paths, streets, decoration (street lights, barrels, flower pots…) and generally to have some more light during nighttime

[b]All in all, I can strongly recommend this game and find it very worth supporting the developers! Thanks for creating medieval dynasty! :)[/b]

Things that could be added or improved upon. 
1. Being able to craft backpacks, chests, etc to carry more things. Maybe saddle bags as well when horse riding becomes available.
2. Horses could have wagons or carriages that you could attach to them. It could slow them down but hold much more storage and have more health and storage. 
3, moving and rotating fields. I find that, from my position anyways, that the field is diagonal compared to the positions that my buildings are in. 
4. Maybe when you get in the future, you could fight bandits or make treaties between villages. ( I am only on Year 4 Spring looking for a wife. It may already be included.
5. There is some glitches where people sit in invisible chairs in the road or cows block a path to the guy who sells manure. (I forgotten his name.)
6.  Maybe there could be a tavern or something where you could visit to get information on your surroundings. For example, If you need to hunt a bear, see if you can find a local hunter. If you are looking for a cave, find an explorer or a smith. Maybe taverns could have general information like that bears exist nearby but they can point you to people in the village that can provide more information. 
7. Make markers on your map and label them. If I find a cave, I either have to memorize the location of build a random building there.

Bare in mind that the game is EA so hence my post can and hopefully will change.


The game right now is a relaxing ""walking simulator with some quests and some building"". What I mean with that is that the game can be so much more than it is right now. You start off with nothing and sure you can build a house, sure you can craft a farming field, sure you can buy animals but there is no depth to this game. At some point in the game you will notice that you have done the basic things the game throw att you and yet you feel unsatisfied. 

As mentioned before, the game can be so much more than its current state. There is plans to implement horses that would negate the ""walking simulator"" feeling for sure but there is so much more needed for this game to really shine. 

I am not so hopefull since the producers of the game has released: Farm Dynasty, Lumberjack Dynasty and for you who have played those games know that they are far from finished, heck they have even stopped with new content long time ago.

The bad is the patch and nerfs and small changes.

They making the game so hard to live there making me almost giving up.

The bad for now was the Fertilizer, now they raize the price or Manure and now we need 2 to make 1 Fertilizer, that's insane, 2 times the price and more 2 times to make 1, WTF, and if was not bad enough the weigh of Manure, is to have, we need to make 10 trios to Seller NPC to get all we need to finally farm. The time(3 days) it's impossible to do this.

Solution cut the weight of Manure in 4 times or triple the weight my character can carry.

Now it's impossible to play that way.

I LOVE the crop system of planting and harvesting... but it's not a cheap thing to get started...  

My only beef...  you grow fast.. however.. you will quicly run out of the ability to hire enough people to run the  town..... and that will lead to you running your butt off just trying too do all the little thing you need to be done...    and you can pull your hair out trying to sort out why your farm hands just stand inside the barn when there are 3 fields that need to be setup and planted.....

CONS: 

- Balance is way off, you will spend time waiting for the day to end, waiting for NPCs to be ready, waiting for the right season to talk to someone, waiting for the right season to plant a crop (this one is not really a con, but still annoying). Why does this suck? Because they give you XP to unlock skills.
- Grind is heavy
- Tech XP, to unlock tech, is SUPER HEAVY
- NPCs are repetitive and lackluster
- No mounts
- Thieving is incomplete (all chests are empty)
- NPC interaction for hiring/mating is random, no descirnable pattern (or maybe I'm too stupid to figure it out).
- Heavy graphics demand for older systems

PROS:

- Great graphics
- Variety of farming activities (mining, lumbering, farming, hunting, building, etc)
- Variety of buildings (different building for different activities)
- FPS element is consistent (spear throwing, arrow shooting, stabbing) seem to follow similar physics/damage
- You can jump and sprint

I know its early access but there are still some reservations. 
The most glaring for me so far is that so much time and energy has clearly been put into the visuals of this game - they are amazing - but the actual AI and gameplay has been almost a second thought to the graphics.
villager conversations are at best just plain weird, and at worst 4 lines of conversation repeated for all villagers over and over and over . Were the villagers real people they would have run me out of the village for simply being pervy or repetitive and annoying. 
The villagers themselves literally just stand still for days on end. One quest had me deliver 40 logs to someone who, after receiving a few logs, would state that he would wait for the rest. Turned out he meant it literally, as he didn't move from the spot by his front door the entire time! There is a child who has stood in the front yard for nearly a year, and was still standing there in the depths of winter!
The rest of the gameplay itself is currently quite clunky and not so well thought out.
SO if you simply want to look at a beautiful forest and river then go for it.
Otherwise id wait until actual launch when hopefully the development has moved on past the visuals onto the actual gameplay itself because as it stands so far its poor.

The world is very pretty and highly detailed. Village building is quite fun, hunting is fun, just roaming the land is enjoyable (though not so much in the middle of the night with two wolves on your tail lol). My villagers seem to have finally worked out how to farm after recent updates.  A few things which will hopefully be dealt with in future updates  are the lifelessness of the NPC's, sitting around in an Inn in the evening in total stoney silence (if they aren't going to have voices then perhaps a background hum of quiet chatter or maybe a travelling bard performing to break the total monotony), the tier 2 Inn doesn't even seem to have a fire animation (nor does the smithy) so the entire place feels very cheerless, the thatched roofs are fine but the wooden ones (both types) allow snow to just land on the beds and an issue which really bugs me is there's no possibility to wait anywhere in game and you can only sleep at night, if a quest takes you to one of the southernmost villages it can be a long trip to find the relevant NPC has just gone to bed and won't talk or hasn't been rendered immediately so can't be found, so you have to backtrack a ways out of the village to place a campfire and sleep even when your character isn't tired. A simple sit on the ground (or on one of the benches around the village central fires - which would be nice anyway) and wait for a designated number of hours would sort that out. 
Most recent updates seem to have sorted out quite a bit of the grind but the progression still seems off a bit. The seasonal quests still don't seem to move things along sufficiently and grinding out the seasonal quests for endless in game years can get a bit tedious.

The game has promise, if you like building things and setting up mini settlements in first person then there is countless hours in this.  The scenery is really nice in some areas and it's a slow paced game

The issues come in having to ""realistically"" walk everywhere with a limited carry capacity and tools/weapons that break fairly quickly.
   
The quests are fine, tho there is alot of waiting for another quest to popup as the main story they are on timed intervals.

Trying to get people to respond positively is hit and miss, you have no clue what a response is going to garner , even a nice chat can get a ""none of your business"" response and you can only hire people that aren't already a part of another settlement, which in lies the issue, in 38hrs of gameplay i've only managed to be on good enough terms to hire with 3 people, one of which is my wife.  Everyone else is either not hire-able or gets little to no positive response from anything.

The general day to day will revolve around getting some food/water for you and any fellow settlers, plus gathering resources for them and storing them in a central warehouse as they wont do it themselves.

Lastly as it stands you get told ok go out and build a settlment, that's it.  There is very little in terms of tutorial other then the basics.

Not alot else to do atm, but no doubt more is coming in future updates

I started playing this game without playing any of the developers previous work.  The premise of the game was interesting to me. I usually play games like Endless Space, Surviving Mars and those you find in the Total War series. In the Total War series my favorite aspect of the game is the city/state management. 

What Medieval Dynasty did for me was bring the empire management and made it occur at the ground level.  Do I prioritize getting more resources or getting more villagers to help? Do I make new buildings or fix the ones I have.  After playing this game solid for the 10 days that I have owned it, and joined the Reddit /r/MedievalDynasty forum where I can study advice of others, I find that I am always thinking about the game and plotting out my next moves even when I am no where near my computer. 

While the UI needs polishing, quests need voice overs, and the global economy needs a rethink, the developers are doing a very good job being agile. Often the Dev team is putting out 3-5 updates a week and are addressing major bugs (it is an alpha!) in hours rather than days.

48,76861271,english,"I rarely write reviews, but today, I get off my rear and do so.
Also take into account this is a fairly early review of the game.

Why? Because the game is perfectly in line with what it advertises.
If you like this genre, this is the game for you.

I have over 300 games in my library, so here are a few comparison points to other big name games in the genre:

(Remember, this is an early access game I am comparing to titans in the industry. And it still holds comparison, it really is that good.)

Ark:  Overly expensive by comparison. You get dinosaurs instead of bears. And the dinos are arguably tougher to fight. Ark is a more hardcore experience. Plus, you have multiplayer. No digging or terrain destruction in either. More freedom of construction in ark than in medieval, allowing for more replayability (Both from multi and replayability). No NPC control / management / Passive resource income in Ark however. Which this game has. You cannot have children in Ark. Or get Married via game mechanics. Unlockable tech is present in ark to keep players interested in progression. Minor questing in Ark. Minor story line.

Minecraft: Cant talk sandbox without mentioning this boy. Multiplayer access, environment destructability, digging, freedom of construction, lite combat similar to this game in the sense that combat is (imo) not very challenging. Some NPC management (Again I prefer Medieval dynasty's management). While some construction materials gate progress, no unlockables last I checked. (Which admittedly has been a while). Next to no questing or story last I checked.

Rust: Another survival mainstay. More PVP oriented, so multiplayer is a must. Construction again is free (Not limited to building shapes or sizes). Unlockable tech to keep players interested in progression. Can be an annoying grind when you spawn in only to get spawn-camped and tea-bagged no matter where you spawn. Servers reset regularly forcing replayability. No npc management beyond killing or avoiding them (Kinda like player interaction, really). No questing.


TLDR:
OK, so. Here is the deal. This thing has a lot to offer that these other games do not. It mixes strategy, questing, resource management, survival into a neat, well built early access game package that does its own thing, almost guaranteeing a niche audience, at the very least. 

=======================================================================

It also has two glaring weaknesses that, in my opinion, might be semi-easily addressed. The suggestions are ideas, but the weakensses, I find, are very real.

All these other games in the genre have some form of multiplayer. I am not even saying that you need to have full on multiplayer servers, those are expensive. Heck, Peer to peer, without the need for servers, would probably be enough. Limit to 3-4 players or something. Have host be the one interacting with quests to keep programming simple. Allow players access to all the other mechanics (duplicate main player, without quest access) and work together co-op. Playing with friends is one of the mainstay in these games for a reason I think and while there is questing I would not yet (remember, only played the game for about 20 hours as of this review) say this game is <story driven> enough to warrant it being a single player game rpg.

Also: Lack of <endgame> tech and content. Maybe for a future expansion? Progressing the story to the point of becoming castellan yourself? Building stone walls, an actual medieval castle-town (which, lets be honest, is kinda a staple of medieval culture.) Plus with the unique building mechanic in this game would be really fun to build piece by piece, layer by layer until you finish the whole behemoth project. (which could be cool to build with a friend, in p2p coop, just saying.) How about cathedrals? Bathouses? Canals or wells to bring water from a river to your town so you dont have to run to the river everytime you are thirsty? BIG BUILDINGS PLEASE, NEED TO BUILD MORE, BIGGER THINGS! Things I will die before completing, that my descendants will have to finish in true medieval fashion! (Maybe have the cathedral be a building that passively has you get more NPCs instead of poaching them from other towns and the castle provide some measure of passive income? Bathouse pumps up villager happiness and canals / wells allow water access away from rivers?)

54,76578717,english,"the graphics are really great but your are forced to a certain path

- no voice for the npc it's boring to read, read and read...
- if you reach winter without warm clothes you die...
- in game prices are highly abusive
- no time to wander and chose a very good location for your first house
- 3 days by season is far too short
- as you start and are still unaware of the interface you loose a lot of time
- some resources are really difficult to find, such as stone or the healing herbs
- if you start tthe first day, knowing where to find the NPC, where you can find the resources
  you are still unable to finish the first house before dark
- you discover later that by lack of time you have not chosen your house location wisely
  and find later that you are unable to build anything else nearby  

in fact following video and making stone axes is probably not the best solution to make fast money if you are just beginning... you are getting 14 coins for 1 axe but you need 2 stones
and 16 sticks.. (do not sell stone they are precious and scarces...) the sticks are saled for 1 so 
200 sticks = 200 coins... the same for straw, near the starting city straw is easy to collect
I made 1000 coins in a game day...


finaly this game may not be so bad if you don't follow the stupid monkeys making video on youtube
they spend more time showing themselves rather than delivering a nice tutorial for this game
they just want to show people how good they are by showing things that are not efficient at the begining
I restarted the game ignoring all I had seen on youtube en successfully surviced the first year...
there are still a problem: the like of reliability of objects... (I'm using the same hammer since more than 40 years... in the game it breaks too often as well as the stone axe)
trying to have a field the first year is useless, I've been unable to pay both for the clothes and for the scythes

Potential: 8.5/10        
Will update review throughout development.

I understand its an ALPHA and in development so most the time and focus will be put into the actual overall development but, I think the following recommendations should be relatively easy to implement and would greatly improve the players experience overall.

**Recommended Improvements:**

- Please, reduce the amount of times a cow ""moos"". They moo way too often. Its to the point I completely avoid that area in the starting village.
- Allow for way points to be set on the map by a player.
- Flashing more noticeable indicator that your hungry, thirsty, cold/hot or dying.
- Please center the game map around the player when opened and not the actual center.
- Increase the spawn rate of certain Animals you need to kill when you are given a quest to kill them.
- Give the option to have your lumberjacks make logs into firewood.
- Add more detail as to how a building functions. Example: Hunters hut: Hunter/gatherers will find and deposit food  directly into your food storage. Ensure they have the tools needed for them to complete there task.
- After we discover a wildlife spawning area auto label that on the map for us.
- This one is not so easy but can we please get a wheel barrel or hand cart to increase our carrying capacity? If you're wanting balance, you could limit its use to roads/paths only.

**Pros:**

- Great looking environments. 
- Devs seem to toss updates in nearly every other day.
- Freedom to build almost any where.
- A lot of potential for content revolving around hunting/gathering,
- The crafting system seems promising,

**Cons:**

- The world is sparsely populated. I get this is Medieval times so towns were small but they just seem desolate. Maybe the town we build can get very populated and lively in the future so this con could be ignored.
- There's just not much going on in towns. The town folk generally stand around doing nothing. 
- Quest are not very fun and unnecessarily long since spawn rates are terrible or there are no indication or hints as to where to go. (Its not fun wasting 20 mins running around looking for wolves. This waste of time makes me wish I refunded the game)
- Not enough quest in the game. (The devs just did a update to have more quest available each day)
- No random events when heading out into the wild when exploring.
- It takes way to long to woo someone to marry you and just becomes a chore.

Overall the game seems like it could be super fun in the future. I don't recommend it right now since there is too little content..I love sandbox base builder games so I will keep my eye on this one. If the devs don't suck in cash while its in alpha then abandon the project this could be one of the best Base Builders out there. I'm very skeptical since this seems to be the steam trend but I am still hopeful. Edit: Since they release updates so regularly I'm becoming hopeful they are not just doing a alpha/beta cash grab.",1601173001,1601530467,False,5,0,0.558339595794677734,0,True,False,True,76561199088326773,2,2,1573,1573,1525,1601907578,,
64,76846669,english,"Game is missing basic stuff that would make it so much more user friendly. 
Run out of spears in a quest --> chop down tree --> make spears --> get instantly attacked by a wolf --> press 3 to equip spear...... oh wait for some reason I have to go into inventory and equip them to the hot bar again. Seriously its not like in real life you would put your spear somewhere different! Every other survival game has this sorted because its basic common sense.
Want to eat food you have to go into your inventory because it cant be equipped to the hot bar....
Picking up logs, sticks and rocks all day every day doesn't seem to improve your strength, so i guess all those people at the gym are wasting their time then? Game play wise this makes it really tedious to move anything in quantity. 
There is no obvious way to set your spawn point. I've gone to sleep in my only house and woken up in the nearest village... Sleep walking a 'feature' I was unaware of?

Auto save --> saves at the bed you last slept in --> so god help you if you die on an overnight quest a day later (in game) because you will have to redo everything you just did for the last hour.

I think practicing skills should provide the ability to create new items or hire additional numbers of the NPC to work. And I'm not into the taxes. What a drag.

14,76476800,english,"Fantastic game. You get your basic RPG in 1st person, set in a fairly realistic medieval setting. The gameplay is great, because there is an actual threat of starving or dying from cold winter conditions. You also start thinking like a farmer. Things like "" I need to stock up before winter ! "" or "" I might just make my house, but it is a long trip in the dead of winter ... "" 

The game offers: Hunting, trapping, farming, character building, tons of crafting, gathering, roleplay interactions and choices, a wife ! and a lot more adventurous stuff.

I am truly in love with this game after 16 hours. Some things could however still be improved, but of course it is in early acces. If you like skyrim, life is feudal and 7 days to die ( like me )  I would strongly recommend you buy this game and spend the measily 20 euros they are asking. 

TLDR: Great game, if you like crafting, peaceful, RPG games, buy it. 

+ Great atmosphere 
+ unmatched gameplay 
+ Good soundtrack 
+ interesting crafting system 
+ Seasons ! with seasonal items 
+ farming and crafting
+ Gritty and lovely at the same time 
+ Hunting is great, you have to really sneak up to an animal to get it down with 1 shot.
+ Very frequent patches / fixes and the team working on it listens to the community.
+ You get to run your own town with, with people you have persuaded to join you. 

- Bow mechanics are functional, but they are very static. ( like firing an arm ballista ) I trust the devs to change this. 
- The game does not have horses yet 
- Tree stumps can not yet be removed, although placing a despawning campfire next to it does the trick 
** Fixed, they can be removed by using a shovel **

- Bit of a learning curve, no help section but good tutorial 
( clicking the ! in the quest screen will bring it up )
- Quest dependent village expansion, thou shalt please Uniegost otherwise thou shalt not build

The other is crafting. I would of liked more ""how to"" elements when it comes to this as I was so lost playing and not knowing what to do. My first run through I died in winter since I couldn't figure out how to make proper clothes and gaining technology points is really slow so by the time sewing was unlocked it was already fall and I had no time to prepare anything. And the last thing is time. I get that its supposed to be challenging and I like that, but takes so long to do anything and everything that by the time your done (like with quests and especially chain quests) most of the day and season is gone and you are unable to get barely anything done. What ticks me off is that every time you sleep you wake up back in your own bed. Its inconvient as I was across the map and when I slept i was back home. Almost a whole day wasted getting back to where I was. I would like it if when you sleep by the campfire you wake up at said campfire.

Too short of seasons/days
Weight limit
Crafting process
Travel and sleep

The game is early access, framework only right now; but playable and enjoyable!  I'm 80 hours into my play-through and look forward to 80 hours more.  Almost daily updates by the developer to fix bugs and balance the economy is impressive to say the least!  

The game is designed for a casual gamer who enjoys city-builders and colony managment simulators.  In the beginning you are alone and trying to survive, which can require a good bit of grinding materials as you chop down trees and pick up rocks or chase deer and rabbit around with a pointy stick.  As you progress, you can attract NPC Villagers to join you which will slowly lighten the burden on your crafting grind as each villager has strengths and weakness's and can help you out with tasks to grow your village or harvest resources.  In time you'll go from Solo-Mio Survival Sim, to village chieftain and merchant caravan.  You'll take the resources your village produces and go to other villages to sell them.

As it stands now, if you are looking for combat this game is not for you.  As I understand it, Bandit attacks are on the drawing board for a much further away update at some point.  

In closing, this is likely one of the best ""Early Access"" titles I've played in a long time.  It has an interesting take on being a hybrid between two of my favorite game genre's (City Builders and Survival Sims).

51,76812006,english,"tldr; As it stands it's a decent foundation for a game but it needs a lot of work before I can recommend it. 

The initial problems are the bugs, the balancing, and the pacing. 
The bugs:
The main one being quest system is a minefield of potential bugs, quests failing for no reason, quests givers just refusing to talk to you, guest givers refusing to take what they requested, the rewards not triggering.
The villager system some times it works, sometimes it doesn't. Some days your villagers will spawn on roofs and stay there. Some days they'll stay lying down and slide to work. A lot of the time they'll be standing around doing nothing, luckily for the most part all you need to do is assign people to tasks and you'll get the supplies without them even being at their job. But you will have to stand and watch your farmers work or they won't do anything. 

The balancing:
The economy is borked as hell. The best way of making money is to sell sticks and berries. After that starts becoming too much effort food or iron arrows is the way to go. Everything else costs far too much time and effort for too little a reward. As an example, making something out of leather will net you 2 more gold than selling the leather by itself, which is about the same as 20 sticks or 10 herbs. 
Item and building degeneration is excessive. Fair enough for rock tools and sticks to fall part quickly but iron tools barely last any longer. If you build a single stone building you'll likely use up most if not all of an iron hammer. Buildings need to be repaired so often; granted it slows down for log or stone buildings but since time goes by so quickly you'll find yourself having to repair buildings almost every other day. 

The pacing:
The game has two states: loads to do but not time to do it and it's not worth doing anything with all the time in the world. Early game you feel rushed to do everything, mainly because you don't have anything. The days are short; so it feels like it takes forever to gather enough resources to build anything. Once you get to log buildings it feels like it's a whole day per building once you've cleared the area around your village. To speed everything up you can get villagers to gather for you allowing you to do other things. The problem is how many you can have is locked behind this really artificial roadblock called dynasty reputation. At first I thought it wasn't too bad: 250 rep per new villager. You can only get rep by doing quests, which as I've mentioned are buggy in themselves, but they are also time consuming. You have to travel to all the villages to collect the quests, that's basically a whole day. Then if you are even able to do the quest, as early on a lot of quests ask for items locked away from you, you still spend another day running round to hand them all in. That's two of your three days of a season gone just doing busy work. Also if you can't do a quest or it bugs out you actively lose rep. So you have to save before every quest and reload if it's not possible or it bugs. I've had to redo a fair few seasons because of quest bugs. Then the chapters give you a huge boost to 10k rep, you'd think it'll unlock so much for you but it doesn't. You realise the rep requirement for new villagers is now 5k per person. So once you've done the chapters it's completely pointless to do quests. So you reach this point of having your villagers collect and craft everything you need. It's pointless to do quests. Going to gather resources for yourself isn't worth it for how little time you have. If you were to go out and collect say iron or clay, unless it was right next to you, you will use over half a day to get a full inventories worth. At which point if you go for a second run you'll be mining in the dark and running back in pitch black. So you'll spend your time watching your farmers work waiting for the main quest to continue while maybe once or twice a year doing a lap of the towns to sell of stuff to pay taxes. The simplest solution would be to either make days longer or extend the number of days; then also add the ability to go back to bed to skip the day. A simple fix for both problems.

I have a lot of other little niggles like the storage being so small. 1k kg sounds huge at first but you'll max it out in a season and villagers won't work if the storage is full. As an example, if the barn and food storage are full farmers will harvest crop and they'll vanish. Wasting a season of growing. Animals always being in the exact same spots doesn't really feel like hunting. Not being able to delete fence blueprints until after you've built them. Being unable to walk when you're carrying 60kg. That might sound about right for an office worker or someone in retail but you're a farmer/builder/lumberjack/miner... I would've thought someone working in almost nothing but manual labour would be able to carry a lot more. There are a lot of basic spelling mistakes in the game as well. 

Looking at the rate they've been patching the game I imagine most if not all of these will be addressed in someway or another at some point. So why the negative review? I guess I've been ruined by early access. My first real experience with it was games like Rimworld and Factorio. Games that felt like complete games when they were only 20% complete. Since then pretty much everything else has been broken and shipped feeling incomplete in the final build. So looking at the roadmap for this game my main concern is we're looking at 80~90% of the final product all it's missing is a few little additions and turning on villagers needing tools to work. To me that feels like a very shallow experience, almost like a shell of a game. When this game is capable of being so much more. Frankly I want to be proven wrong, that this is just a fraction of what we get in the end... but my time in early access tells me otherwise. 

Oh and to preemptively respond to the ""how can you play it for so long and not like it"" comment. I'd say more than half my play time was the game idling. I'd be tabbed out watching farmers work, waiting for work on 300 flax/wheat to finish, crafting 10 stacks of iron arrows or 100 potage etc. I wouldn't say I enjoyed my time with the game, it felt more like a job than a game. I guess there are games like Euro Truck so that's not a bad thing in itself if that's what you're after.",1601474085,1601474207,False,0,0,0,1,True,False,True,76561198007934206,404,39,7129,5999,7129,1601467338,,

For anyone who doesn't like early access things, then I still recommend giving this a shot. The price is almost always less before the 1.0 release, and this has a surprising amount of content for an EA game that was just released publicly not too long ago.
It also has a lot of different features that are pretty different and unique for survival and crafting RPG games. It's a bit like the lovechild of Conan and Mount & Blade. I'm extremely excited to see how this evolves as development continues!

Enjoy this game immensely.  Now the end game is a little bland, stated up front, but given that the game is currently still in development, (and the road map looks quite promising) I would have to say this is so far so great.  I've played fully released games that don't have as much polish on the aesthetics as this game.  Quest and script department could use some work, albeit its a very click and choice basic interaction system.  

Buggy atm, but consistently addressed with patches and hotfixes by the developer.

Without knowing all the pieces to this puzzle, I have to say I would still recommend you play this game.  I've restarted 6+ times each in a different location on the map just to see how the different areas make certain things easier.

Absolutely beautiful graphics.  I run Ultra everything on my MaxQ 2070.  Smooth.

Well done Toplitz, and I look forward to many more updates!

the bad:
- early game feels super time constrained, you will run around like a headless chicken trying to get the quest objective before it expires. This leads to the second
- lack of time customisation. Would be nice to be able to set the duration of each season in terms of days. I know this would mean some of the food production would get disrupted so adding a ""hunger rate"" would probably solve it and make it possible to make the game more challenging in the late game (many people, long seasons=longer time between food production) or easier (less hunger and food needed)
- no coop - this literally begs for an option for coop (with pair of siblings or two unrelated survivors escaping the war - this would make a perfect couples game for rainy weekends!
the good:
+ the game is probably the only one so far where you actively recruit NPC to your cause and build supply chains.
+ looks good
+ actually feels quite rewarding to watch your little village grow

Coming from someone that has invested countless hours into games like Factorio, Satisfactory, and other automation games, I can say that Medieval Dynasty is not one of them.  While it may appear that you can recruit villagers to do labor and begin automation, it's important to recognize that during early access their harvest yield for an entire day is less than what a player could do in 5-15 minutes of actual play.

I'd call Medieval Dynasty more of a hybrid between popular survival games and some of the other 'Dynasty' series produced by the developer.  You can feel a lot of overlap in fundamental ideologies; however, it's fair to say that Medieval Dynasty stands alone very nicely.  As of review, I've invested just under 30 hours of game time, and think I'll get another 100 before I get bored of the game.

42,76744619,english,"So let me get into it, I didn't experience everything in the game, but I built a lot of buildings and hunted a lot, etc.
And here is what I hope to see in the future: 

[b]Major things:[/b]

- Put schematics before building because: 
A- Logs are VERY heavy, so you can't walk freely while you choose a location. (and buildings need A LOT of logs)
B- Destroying a building gives you nothing back. (Could have a skill that gives back some of it)
OR  make it that we're able to move a building's location after building it.

- REALLY need to make crafting buildings easier, as it's literally the whole idea of the game lol. 
What can make building easier, give us the option to build a chest outside in the open (or have us build a specific building for that early in game) where you can put materials in, and use them for building. 
Also, very important, make it that the chests in the buildings do the same things. Like when I put something in the Hunter's lodge, I can immediately go to the table and craft something without having it be in my inventory. Or any chest for that matter, because having it as it is, is annoying.

- I am sure you guys are working on this, but npcs are boring to talk to, the dialogue options are limited and also feel VERY random, don't know what they might like or dislike to hear. 

- Also, and I hated this a lot in KCD, please make it that when I want to talk to an npc, that I can wake them up, or if they're busy. I went to do the wolves quest where I had to give a guy 40 logs, and I hate to wait on him SO long to wake up!

- I also think you are working on this, but just in case, make cities closer, or add more, maybe also make them a little more unique, with the things you buy, etc. Not much reason to visit a city if it's literally the same thing.

- Also, I know you will implement horses, I saw the skill, just have them be obtainable much earlier than now, I am 15 hours in, and no where near being able to  having one (assuming you need a stable for it, etc.). It gets boring walking all the way to other cities, and actually stopped me from going to other cities after a while.

- Skills take WAY TOO LONG to give you an attribute point, though I think you are still working on it, but just a note to pay attention to that, you don't want to make the game a tedious grind.

- Add a skill to increase inspector's mode range, see further. Maybe for it to cost less stamina, too.

- Hitting animals with a spear in close combat isn't balanced, they take way too many hates compared to hitting them from a distance. Also, their hitboxes when hit with other weapons is almost non-existent lol.

- I know you're working on it, but just in case, more quests and more variety. 

- Really need to be able to remove tree stumps, I don't think there is a way now (?) but really need that. Also, I played for almost 2 seasons, so I know that doesn't exist, the tree should grow back, after a year, or preferably half, because I was running out of trees near me. 

[b]Minor things:[/b]

- Need to see time of day without having to go to the map everytime, perhaps you can put it next to the season timer.

- Please add the ability to toggle shift to run instead of keep pressing it, same with crouch.

- Be able to put a mark on the map.

- Compare option in inventory for clothes, also, if it's possible to not make the clothes weigh in the inventory, you already can't carry much as it is.

- Inspector mode shouldn't cost stamina imho, at least not in towns when you're inspecting people or looking for traders and such.

- Being able to see the name of mushroom before picking it up, they all say mushroom. 

[b]Fixes:[/b]

- The wolves quest (with 40 logs) when you're done and his wife gives you food, you say ""Shame on you"", it should say ""shame"".

- There is a visual bug with a few items where when you want to sell them, it says 0 gold, but selling gives you money.

- On the roasting menu, should say to press ""R"" to make more, because people might not know.",1601350780,1601398948,True,28,2,0.67978215217590332,8,True,False,True,76561198863498454,77,8,925,925,925,1601343189,,

This game has a lot of potential. As of this review date Its obviously in early stages. Considering this is in Alpha, I have not encountered too many bugs, for the most part everything is running really well.

The game has some really interesting aspects. The hunting is fun, and i like the balance of survival elements without making it a chore.

If i was to give the developers some advice for a potential change, when placing a building you should be able to zoom out so you can line it up better with your surroundings. Its hard to determine which direction the building is facing as the building blocks your line of sight. Perhaps either zoom out when placing a building or if in 1st person allow a control to push the building away from you so that you can determine the best place to place the structure. hope that made some sense.

64,76759563,english,"I held off giving a review to see how the first week played out as regards bug fixes and balancing and TBH I'm pretty impressed with the developers.

The game is still somewhat buggy but they seem to react pretty quickly to community feedback. The roadmap released so far looks promising and if they deliver on time or thereabouts the game will move up even more in my estimation.

The basic premise of the game ATM is build a nice settlement and fill it full of your serfs, keep them happy and housed, sire an heir so they can take over at some point in the future. That map is fairly large and has all sorts of terrains, which in turn gives it some replay value as your next settlement would be somewhere more challenging than the first one.

Graphically is very pretty and does feel right, for my liking the weather isn't challenging enough but I guess that could change. The quests probably need a lot more variety but again once bandits turn up I'm hoping that will also improve. The buildings are good but a little challenging to place if the terrain isn't perfectly flat. The seasons are short so sometimes you have to prioritise whats important, I guess that improves once you have quality serfs.

The first year or two is very grind intensive and you never seem to have time to spare but as you expand it gets easier but not to much. No co-op at present which might put some off but overall even with bugs it's worth full price.",1601383070,1601383070,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True,76561198069488538,76,4,12271,9432,7215,1602045938,,

My first playthrough I quit because I had built so many buildings/crops my tax rate at the end of the season was enormous and I only had 22 gold. “ Okay, I will just start over with one hut and be a hermit deep in the woods for my second playthrough- F the peasants and their taxes.”  Well turns out you’ll die in the winter if you don’t level up tailoring, which just so happens to mean lots of sticks, rocks, and berries to sell to unlock the recipes.  

Give us vagabonds the option to discover recipes from crafting, exploration, looting, etc.

So, I grind out some gold farming to unlock the fur recipes for winter and stab some bears to death with sticks.  I gather hundreds of fur pelts, unlock the recipes, build the tailoring hut, and lo and behold, I can’t make them.  All the fur recipes I just unlocked? Not even an option on the crafting menu, except for the boots.  
I go to make the boots: “fur clothes are made from leather, not fur?!”  If there is a way to make leather from fur, I can’t find it, online or in game.  

The items I do create and equip vanish when I log out, so all those rocks and berries I diligently sold are for nothing.

I can make two pairs of boots for 60 leather each (each rabbit is 1 leather, Bear is 4 and so on, so good luck with those disappearing time sink items).  Winter is here and I’m naked with just “fur” boots standing AFK on the firepit in my hut, so I don’t freeze to death.  Maybe I need to progress to tailoring hut II for real “fur” recipes, but at this point I cannot continue to farm gold.  And man, do I ROYALLY hate taxes, IRL and in game.  Give me the option to be a bandit or something, not kick me out of game when I refuse to pay.

I really want to like this game.  Its foundation is full of beautiful graphics, fun ideas, liberties, and progression.  However, there are some major wrinkles that need to be ironed out before I will return to this game or recommend it to others.
The crafting system and gold scheme in this game needs serious rethinking.  In a nutshell, get ready to gather sticks, berries, mushrooms, and rocks for hours on end to sell to peasants so you can unlock recipes via gold.  Not fun at all in my eyes.  

The good:
-Awesome graphics
-Interesting character progression
-Immersive world
-Sandbox freedom

The Bad:
-Combat is janky and awkward
-Lots of pointless gathering and selling
-Items disappear without reason and break super easy
-Your helpers are useless unless you constantly babysit them
-You need to farm gold - there is no other way around it, you’ll die if you don’t
-Your game gets the ax if you don’t pay taxes for so long
-Taxes!!!!!!!!!1?? >:(

New Complaints~~~  1. LOW HEALTH- Flash the screen fricking red please when I am below 20% health! this helps when I am spending 10 or more mins crafting and looking at phone because I'm not staring at a circle looping all the time. 2. For crying out loud please put map pins in the game so I can remember where best hunting grounds are and caves are!


Hot fixes- In this regard you guys have done a great job and I'm very impressed with it.

All in all kinda rough to play but pretty fun. I'd Like a little more crime though, like having to worry about thieving villagers kinda thing.

LONG TERM GAME IDEAS - There should be bandits added to the game but far more pressing borders between the villages with resource fights I mean there is only so much in the valley right? Guards of course should be put in with that as well. However one of my other problems are the quests..... like for real, f*ck the quests.

The visuals are remarkable.  Something you usually don't see from new devs/early access games.  I was certainly surprised by the quality.  There are plentiful plants and trees and grass, and it has that right formula of layered textures and objects to truly look like a medieval landscape.  This is even more impressive considering they have four different seasons to visualize.

Speaking of seasons, this is another excellent unique mechanic to this game.  Every three days is a season and there are changes between each.  Not only do mechanics change but the visuals do as well.  This mechanic is well-done so far and increases your immersion and adds another layer of depth to the gameplay.

The progression in this game is still being worked on, but it functions like Skyrim mixed with Kingdom Come.  You unlock skill points by doing skill-related activities and this increases your level in that area, allowing you to distribute skill points that affect that skillset.  Examples are crafting, hunting, harvesting, etc.  There is also a technology component, in which you unlock more buildings and items by simply continuing to produce items at your current level.  Build enough small houses and you'll unlock medium houses, etc.

This does remind me a bit of banished with the look of Kingdom Come Deliverance. Your goal is to set up your own village, recruit others to live there and work for you. The NPCs then can automate the most grindy aspects of the game. 

The 3-day seasons ended up giving me plenty of time which surprised me. If you have your seeds in the field before the dawn of the next season your fine. The new season will open with fully grown crops. They currently do not require you to sleep and I often just spend the night crafting and whatnot. Hunting is the only thing that's non-viable in the dark (at least for me). I like that when I didn't grow enough Flax, I didn't have an eon to wait until the next spring so I could plant some more. I was dumb and didn't follow the main quest line, so just having to deal with winter for 3 days was a blessing. 

It still needs a lot of polish and balancing especially with the economy. But the devs push bug fixes frequently and they are active on the forums. I have a lot of hope for where this is going. This is a low stress management game. If your cool with that and a resource grind, get it.

BUGS
Main Quest - Chapter IX - The Dynasty Continues. If you get married before you are at this point in the Chapters quest line, this quest bugs out.

Side Quest - Have you heard of the trading village. I do not know what caused this quest to fail, but I did follow it and it failed. After giving the boots to the NPC who requested them, the game continued to tell me to talk to this NPC. The only option I had after giving them to her was the (LIE) option.


IMPROVEMENTS
Crafting: I really wish storing the resources in the building would allow you to use those resources. Right now, you must have them in your inventory.

Repair/Building/Upgrading/ETC: Same as above. If you have a storage building, you should not have to have the material in your inventory.

Tools: Steel tools should last longer.

Farming/Field Workers: I noticed my field workers slack off if I am not watching the field. Seems intentional, but is annoying.


ADDITIONS

Boats and wagons would be awesome. 

Larger variety of wild animals. Examples: Mountain Goats, Big Horn Sheep, Cougars/Mountain Lions...etc.



Again, great game and I can't wait to see what else is planned!

55,76718297,english,"Looks really nice(every season is like a different Bob Ross painting) and the idea is cool too, but

You chop trees, collect rocks, build a few houses, hire a few people and thats it.
There is nothing to do, even if you are into base building, there is not much to build, no furniture, no decorative items, no lanterns.
you cant get rid of shrubs and tree stumps. (you can build farmlands which gets rid of the shrubs, so maybe in the future they can implement it for making a nice lawn or something like that)

The survival aspect of the game is just filling the hunger bar and the thirst bar. There is a lot of different types of food, but they dont do anything special, like for example: different types of food would give you different stat bonuses.
(Hunters would choose to eat the food which makes them aim better)

The people you hire do their job, but it doesnt look like it, they are really lifeless and so the village seems lifeless to.
Building a self sustainable village is not satisfying, it should be.

Gameplay is not the best.
Hunting with the bow and spears is a little disappointing. The range and speed of the weapons are so bad.
It gets the job done, but its not fun.
So if they add bandits, I dont think fighting them would be enjoyable.

The game need events and different playstyles/goals, because if I would restart the game a 100 times, I would have the exact same experience a 100 times.

but but

I really like how the game looks, and I can forgive a lot of gameplay things when I get immersed.
Except summer, every season is really well done, I like the purple undertones in winter, the blue nights, the colorful autumn.
I like the sounds too.

I dont really want to play the game anymore, but Iam really looking forward for future updates because I want this to be a good game and I think that it can be one.

You have the basic survival, base building, managing mechanics(Which are just alright),

58,76728351,english,"IMO - This game is a breath of fresh air to those of us who have played games for decades.

It seems to bring the style and depth of RPG's we played on Macintosh computers in the 80's straight into what the 21st century game engines have to offer. Hours and hours of game play, all while risking perma-death at any moment. Where choices have consequences. You can save/reload, but when you die you don't simply re-spawn on a bed somewhere. You're dead. Gosh, I have missed this.

To make it even better, much less focus on combat/violence, and much more focus on building out reputation and creating a polite and productive society. Working your character to the bone to setup infrastructure that will support him and other NPC's. All in first person, and in a beautiful Medieval world setting. No top-down, God's view advantage of placing buildings perfectly. No pickup and placing a building somewhere else after it's built. Choices. Make them. Live with them. Love it.

There is no ""dark"" option to choose. Although you can steal from villages, doing so will ruin your reputation. The game guides you to think BETTER, and do BETTER. To help others and to build a community. To think about more than just your (character's) self. To be a Hero, and not a Villain. This is another thing I have missed, and is quite refreshing.

I am writing this review very early on in Early Access. I have encountered a few bugs, but overall there is an excellent core game to build upon. 

I sincerely hope that the development team continues on with the vision and creativity that made this game what it currently is. Many times over the years, I have seen where the voices that complain the loudest will convince developers to change their original concept into a watered down blob of gobbeldy-goop.

I should stress that I am not a hardened gamer, I play games for enjoyment. If I find a game that is fun to play and has a well written narrative/story I can discover through quests or levels then its a great game. This game ticks both of these boxes which is why it's so frustrating that this one problems takes so much of the enjoyment away.
That problem is the timescale when doing quests; while 3 in games days per season works for the farming/village side of things it becomes a problem when doing any long quests that are season sensitive, if you have to look after your village you find that you have very little time left to actually complete longer quests. Which becomes very annoying and the game is not longer fun, it leads to frustration, angry and feeling that the game is rigged against the player. 
Whats annoying is that if they added more choices to how you play the quest such as a 'quick' option, it would not only help with long season restricted quests but with other quests that you might have problems with, you'd have a way to move on the the next stage and not just abandon the NCP to age and die (which they will do) still waiting for you return.",1600791049,1601318172,False,4,0,0.540506303310394287,0,True,False,True,76561198167539971,8,1,2738,619,2602,1601920435,,

71,76723336,english,"A fairly relaxing title about simply living out life in the middle ages. It's often been described as something akin to Kingdom Come: Deliverance meets Harvest Moon, and that description seems perfectly fine.

There isn't a lot to talk about with this one, as there really isn't any new ground being broken at all. It's another Unreal Engine survival game and it feels exactly like what's written on the box. I will mention that the team seems to have a particular attention to detail or level of knowledge and finesse, as it's uncharacteristically lacking of most of the jank that one would expect to see if they've got any experience with survival games, especially in the unreal engine, as the projects are often just copy pasted module plugins and the developers rarely seem to actually have any idea how to fix issues when the arise. Not the case with this title, with the developers having already lovingly battered out some of the jank.

The game has a relatively slow pace and attempts to focus on realism, perhaps to it's detriment in places. Especially, your weight capacity is extremely limited, and with a lack of any carts or sleds being in the game, the simple act of chopping wood can sometimes feel like a major chore. Don't even get me started on hauling clay. Thankfully, as your village progresses, you can assign yeomen such tasks unless you really enjoy doing them, and focus more on your profession, whatever you may choose that to be.

I find the gameplay loop to be quite enjoyable. Akin to something like Green Hell, you're given a survival situation with emphasis being placed on routine. Along with an emphasis on community and being seen as a valuable member of society, this is about where the Harvest Moon/Stardew Valley themes end.

The rest of the game's element are common themes from survival games. Eating, drinking, sleeping, cutting wood, picking up rocks, making tools and progressing through a tech tree. There are several different skill trees that can allow you as an individual character to do what you want and your village will be fairly content as long as you provide two basic resources, food and wood, and those tasks can be delegated to NPCs if you choose, assuming you have enough Building experience to create the required workstation.

There's a lot of dithering in this game. Very rarely you'll encounter a bear or a wolf or something that's genuinely a threat, but most hours of most days are spent just performing chores to get yourself a little bit ahead of the survival curve. Checking and setting traps and fishing nets in the morning, going to do your profession or a required task (such as building a new house) during the day and then settling in at a local tavern to improve your relations in the kingdom toward the evening and do some proselytising. Even something as simple as wandering to a nearby village to buy a new pickaxe could take the better part of a day. Not a lot happens, so when you actually achieve something in the game or when you reach that next level of tech where everything feels just a little bit easier and some of yesterday's frequent tasks melt away, it really feels like an achievement.

Ultimately, I don't think this title is for everyone. But if you're a fan of survival titles and don't mind living a somewhat mundane medieval existence (You're not a knight or lord, just a yeoman trying to make his way), then this title could very much be up your alley and is quite enjoyable, and is much more polished than similar titles such as Kingdoms.",1601315465,1601315465,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,True,76561198044280999,147,16,1213,548,1069,1601450920,,

81,76716979,english,"TL;DR: Stardew Valley + Kingdom Come: Deliverance with elements of The Guild 2. It's a complicated mix, but I'd say if it sounds cool to you, it absolutely is going to be. This game has a lot of road ahead of it and you need to like grind, but even at this stage it's insanely addictive and has a ton of things to do. It's more open and forgiving than SV in terms of time (e.g. there's no punishment for not sleeping), a bit uglier that KC:D and has less management than Guild 2, but the final product is very promising and well worth your money even now.

It's an unusual survival game, since survival itself is almost effortless. Sure, you need to eat half the forest of animals daily if you're only eating meat early game, but add some onions or cabbage and you're good for hours. yup, in some areas the realism/grind balance is clearly towards grind. In others, like healing - it the other way around. It's super easy, free and instantaneous to heal. Anyways, there's no major threats or challenging needs at this time - maybe outside of tax, more on that below.

The core of the game is not surviving, but improving - more technology, better skills, better tools, larger village. There's a ton of grind for sure, and progress comes very slow, but steady and exciting at the same time. I'm not the biggest fan of grind, but this game has actually very little repetitive and boring grind. You need to do a lot of stuff, but rarely the same stuff for longer periods of time. You hunt for a while, then you build something, craft something, then you need to plant the seeds for this season, then you need to visit a friendly village. Getting logs for buildings can be pretty daunting, and I'd love an option to hire a villager/rent a cart for a while to help early game, but just that's one major complaint. That's a direction I hope this game progresses in, more options that reduce the grind, but keep the balance. 

A nice change from that is your workers. What's a bit shocking - looking at how much grind there is, workers are mostly self-perpetuating. Once you have all the necessary buildings in place, outside of using reasonable amounts of food and wood (which they can provide themselves as hunters and gatherers) - they just need an assignment (make sure to check that in the workplace building management), and they just produce stuff from resources (as long as they are not bugged/outside of radius, but we're talking about alpha here). They don't need tools and too much care. Pretty interesting, simple mechanism, but a one that's a nice contrast for the grind.

One of worst things for now seems to be the economy. I enjoyed creating a sheet with the sell prices per raw material, but it revealed some weird things. Like, you can buy a recipe, say Thick Leather Gloves, for a lot of cash. But at least they will sell well, right? Wrong. They actually sell FIVE COINS BELOW COST OF RAW MATERIALS. Often, you have no chance to reason about the selling price before buying recipe, and it turns out to be ridiculously low. Making decent money from crafting is almost impossible at first - turns out selling firewood is one of the best sources of money (foraging, like berries/herbs, is another). Making throwing rocks out of rocks brings up the sell value by about 1000%. But making gloves out of leather? Nope, that's like throwing it to the garbage. I don't need to mention that the sell/buy ratio is absolutely crazy, about 20%, and skills to bring that up are high level and pretty hard/boring to train. Of course, every in-game year you have to pay the tax, which is also fairly high. That's hardly fun and needs to change for sure - for now, maybe check the sell prices online first. Adding reasonable differences in market and supply/demand economics would be nice too, but I'm pretty sure that's coming.

However, there's so much good in this game. As I mentioned, the sheer number of different things to do make the grind acceptable (if not enjoyable), the freedom to build is great (you can place buildings all over the map - just not too close to existing villages and on flat enough ground - mechanism which could be more forgiving to be honest). There's so many options and products already that unlocking new stuff and discovering what's good to make is fun - but could be more rewarding as already mentioned. It certainly looks like an early game with great potential.

There's a ton of other things that are a pain in the butt (like you can't upgrade buildings in place from version I to II, you need to destroy the first one first and not getting materials back (!), a lot of knowledge is missing from the in-game at this point and needs to be found online, many elements are bugged), but nothing changes that overall, this is a very enjoyable game that's fun to discover and master, and it's very likely to end up being a great one.",1601307578,1601307886,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True,76561197989606396,584,7,2694,2694,1931,1601590956,,

I love the game, it has amazing amounts of potential. I hope that the development studio is up to the task. 
I recommend the game for those looking for a offline, relaxing yet challenging experiance. 
Pros
Building freedom - building anywhere on the map is great, there are plenty of amazing locations that you can build a pretty cool town of our own. 
Lots to do - You have a lot of stuff to do to make sure you people are taken care of, its complex in some areas of crafting which is great. 
Early access Content - as far as early access games go, there is a lot of content available with minimal amounts of bugs. Nothing i've run into is game breaking yet. 
Patching - The development studio seems to be pushing patches out for breakfix pretty often. Only hope they keep this up and release new content every so often in these patches. 

Cons- 
NPC's are a little buggy, not game breaking but they can be touchy at times. 
NPC dialog - sometimes the dialog is repeated with the same options. 
No voice over for dialog. It would be nice if they got some voice actors to actually talk to you. 

Would like to see added onto the game: 
-I would like to see more wildlife. 
-I would like to see Tameable wildlife, wild cows, sheep, pigs, that you can tame and breed instead of only buying animals from other villages. 
- Added resources. The resource list can be expanded, including copper, granit, marble, gravel, and much more
- Building Wells, Wells were very common in this time era, it would help with building in more remote areas. 
- ROADS, please for the love of god, please give us the ability to expand the road structures to make cooler town layouts. 
- roaming merchants. Adding NPC's that walk the main roads that sell goods that might be more rare. 
- Carts. Adding the ability to craft carts that the user can pull around for extra storage, would be great for mining. 
- Horse's - looks like this is already planned to be added. 
- mountain Lions
- expand the settings capability to allow the user to set the day longer or shorter, have the ability to modify respawn times of resources if wanted. 
- more weapons, right now the wooden spear is really the only weapon you need in the game, with a single headshot killing most everything. 
- Expand skill set for combat type activities. 
- Boats - small water craft that you can use to quickly sail up and down the larger water areas. 
- Bigger map. It would be nice to have the map expanded a bit with some different biomes. 
- Trainers - Have NPC's that can teach schems that can't be learned through the technology tree. 
- GOD - Add religon to the the game, 
- Buildings: Church, Water well, Guard Post towers, Wooden Palasade guard tower, wood cutter mill, Windmill for processing some crops, public baths, parks, halls, gardens, market square, bridges, bakeries, carpenters hut, mason hut, watermill, wall gates, wooden palasade gates, theatres, grammar schools, university. 
- Ability to collect taxes from your villagers.

1,76171735,english,"Who ever thought that 1 season should last only 3 days is completely insane. Perhaps the intention was to show changing seasons and stuff that comes and goes with it but now its literally main and biggest problem. 
You start in spring - chop some trees pick some herbs and its summer.  The conversation options with NPCs are poor but on the other hand you dont have time to read if you do you will miss a season to plant or die from lack of food.

Until the amount of time for a season is changed or perhaps a slider to set it manually arrives I cant recommend the game. 
It look great, lots of potential and would be really fun if you would not need to rush all the time. I played for 10h and it felt really exhausting to just constantly keep tabs on time not to miss something.

Even with this amount of content I can easily see myself spending atleast 100h on this game if the time amount for seasons will be increased.

EDIT: So I spend some time playing game about 100h now decided to change my review as it did entertain me for some time and it would be a bit hypocritical to leave thumbs down after so much game time.

I did not change my mind about 3day seasons - its abit of a shock when you start a game and lots of time management. It gets easier once you recruit some villagers and start farming yet again as seasons go by fast you will be swimming in tons of goods left from last year as you produce more than you consume or npc's can buy. I'm sure farm output will be changed later on but I'm afraid it might make game start even harder.

Time management plays a big role - you basically need to split your time in half. Day for quests\trading and night for work\craft\build.Not a bad thing once you get used to it.
Some broken quests and npc's here and there but its EA so not big of a problem. Devs do react to those and fix em quick most of the time.

The positives - game is really beautiful, the change of seasons looks great. Devs are active and update game almost every day(lets hope that wont change). It is immersive and you can spend some serious time playing.

For Medieval Dynasty I would have to say: Wait for no less than 6 months to a year before purchasing it.

The game is OK, but feels to linear, like you’re being forced down a path not of your choosing. 

The start is to limiting and even though you have a say as to what the exterior of your buildings looks like: Where your windows and doors are as well as materials used. There is no player customization for the shape of the building nor can you create and move around the furniture. When I tried making 3rd video on the game, I fell asleep while watching the edit. The game looks ok, but play is slow and boring to watch back. 

It’s nice that there is a torch in-game, but it’s to in your face and makes it hard to see anything around you let alone in front.

The seasons and the length of the day light is too short, it would have been nice if the player had some customisation on the length of the days, nights and seasons.

The game itself is fun its not terrible but it's not great by any means either. It's boasted as a hardcore survival game be it a survival game it is not hardcore by any means. If you die in the game you have to be trying to or just stop keeping up with your food and water all together. One of it's biggest flaws is that after you get villagers you have to dedicate a good portion of your time to making sure they have food and it's cooked. To make sure that they have firewood. The Villagers eat and need firewood almost excessively compared to you.

The Village recruits help automate but not really all that much, with a high enough level hunter he can provide a good amount of food for people but when you start going passed 5 people he tends to not be able to keep up which adds to the list of things you have to do to keep them up.

combats not bad but it's not anything impressive by any means. The crossair is off to the right for throwing so it makes it hard to figure out where to chuck your spears or use bows.

Currently the games worth about $10 so the $30 price point (even though it's discounted) is a bit high for what you get out of the game. I'd suggest waiting until they make some progress on the roadmap which kudos for them for doing that. I'm sure it's worth will raise if they keep at what they are doing.

I have had hit and miss with Early Access games. I can say full-heartedly that this Early Access is by far one of the most put together games I have had the pleasure of enjoying. The game is well put together for early access, it has some bugs as every early access game does but, the developers have done a phenomenal job fixing game breaking bugs as the community points them out. The other thing that has really impressed me with the developers is there communication. They frequently have Q&As with the gamers and even ask the gaming community for input on where they would like to see the Game go. This really makes the experience feel very involved and adds to game experience. Finally, the biggest reason I would recommend this game is it is one of the most relaxing games in my Steam Library which makes it a great way to relax after a long day, plus with the constant updates each time you logon it's filled with fun new experiences to explore.

Pro's
+ Very pretty, even serene at times (though one friend wasn't able to play on her laptop)
+ Music
+ Basic mechanics seem to work - Villagers form families, have children etc...
+ Enjoyable.

Con's
Now this may seem a long list, but note this is EA and they are fixing stuff.
- Villager AI is terrible, If you're more than 100m away they consume but don't produce and the Field worker (one of the more important workers completely stops without save/load refreshes), shackling you to the village, despite all the rest (hunting/mining/trading/quests) demanding you be somewhere else.
- Economy is broken, you start by making 100s of stone knives and eventually 100s of arrows/cabbage stew
Costs of producing are out of whack with end products with narrow windows to make money, which you need to do because
- Taxes, high taxes, which you have to waste half a day to go pay ... leading me to
- 3 day seasons, trying to get everything done in three days is a pain.   I'm 6 years in and if the travel (horses pending) and villager AI (see above) were fixed, I can see 3 day seasons ... but with these things broken and you having to do all this yourself, not so much.
- Quests/Content, there is currently a hole where the main quest pauses and the side quests need you to gather 300 dynasty points at 1 to 2 per quest, when some of the quests are still buggy.  Look its EA and some are being fixed quite quickly, but there is still a hole, which you are either meant to leave it alone for a number of years or grind through hundreds of side quests, at 3-4 a season.
- and finally minor stuff adding up, lack of tutorial, ability to check stuff, name things, single save game, interface designed like a console (Action, action/cancel) rather than drag/drop.

44,76383484,english,"Burned by this genre before, I was skeptical when I thought of purchasing this game, so to my surprise, I was delighted when I got into the swing of things. Firstly, the graphics are exceptionally beautiful, and unique. The game-play is similar to other games of this genre, but at the manner as to which you use them to further your base knowledge and skill, is less than simple - it makes for a challenging play through of the current content (I happen to like challenges, while some others might not.) There was other pro's and con's attached, and I'm going to list them below; before I do however, there is one thing that I'd like to express my comment upon.

The seasons currently, are only three days long in the game - and you have to strive, to doing a single day for hunting, one for questing and travel, and the next for other things; farming, working with the animals, ect. I know that this cycle will be elongated in the future, so before there are complaints, we need to remember that this game is first and foremost, uncompleted. It is my only gripe, and I know in the future, that this will change. (I saw a developer answer another review with this information; it was a great answer as well!)

I also haven't gotten so far in the game, so this will likely be amended from time to time, as I experience the game  and the mechanics to the game.

Pros -
• Beautiful graphics.
• Smooth frame-rate.
• Good optimization.
• Challenging game play; makes you feel that what you do in-game, is worth it.
• Single-player specific.
• Interesting village-building concepts.
• Dynamic character interactions between NPC's and player-characters.
• Potential for growth in both mechanical elements and story-telling.
• Hours of entertainment.

Cons -
• Short season (Again, this is not permanent.)
• Early-game stamina drain is hefty.
• Tree growth is unbalanced; trees regrow every three years. (This drains the area around you of resources.)
• More coming soon as I discover them? There aren't really many cons at this point.

At this point, I want to give my accolades to the development teams working on Medieval Dynasty - you have a game that has the beginnings of becoming blockbuster for the genre, so please don't do what most have done and give up in the middle of development. I also believe that, you should keep this game single-player and make it not a multi-person game, as I believe not only will development be easier - but, I believe the village-building element would be lessened, accomplishment wish.

-Aeresia.

Edit - 9/27/2020

So, I've delved deeper into the game and I'm going to add a little more onto the review, in consideration; we must remember, that this game is NOT COMPLETE and is currently in a state of unbalance. I'm trying to be as just as I can about the game itself, being truthful about the cons and pros. 

Some of the new cons that I've realized are;
• The hunger/water drain substantial - very high, and unfortunate.
• The amount of meat taken from creatures big and small, are the same. Not the quantity, the amount (meat of a boar, gives the same amount as meat from a bear, or rabbit.)
• Gold, in the beginning, is hard to come by - and the game wants you to progress so fast, that you haven't the time to make gold, unless you are constantly working and doing the quest objectives at the same time.
• Might be me, but I'm not good at getting people into my settlement. (Maybe, I'm just not a people person, lol.)
• Not a lot of flat ground to build on; maybe I haven't found that yet though?

Some of the new pros;
• There are a plethora of critters around, much to hunt; never runs out it seems.
• Easy instructions and help manual available to those in need.
• Some of the quest rewards, are pretty helpful to get you started.

I'm still in love with the game, given the new short-comings I've discovered; it isn't game breaking, it just makes me feel the need to delegate my time more effectively. These things, I'm positive, will change for the better - this developer seems to pay attention to their consumers.",1600788867,1601258769,True,165,5,0.904506981372833252,0,True,False,True,76561198014638940,179,3,1014,430,1007,1601496151,,

Honestly, the whole ""diplomacy"" and talking to NPC's is an absolute joke. You ask the simplest question, or ask how the weather is and they somehow get offended and shun you for the rest of the day. Not to mention you can ask the same question over and over again if you are lucky enough and gain reputation fast that way. Sometimes you get two options that will result in a lower reputation, and there is nothing you can do about it. Conversations are absolutely dumb and need a huge rework on them. 

Also: NPC's show a lack of care when WOLVES are literally munching on you right in front of them, and wolves somehow have the ability to open doors??!? 
Surviving can seem like a chore at times, as you have to drink 30 gallons of water a day, and eat like 80 mushrooms a day. You're heavily limited on what you can build, and have to basically grind for XP to build different buildings. Not to mention no one at all joins your camp until have done a few missions, which are actually very f*cking rare for no reason. Like I only had 1 mission in the starting village, and couldn't find anymore after that, making the main mission to allow you to build more impossible. 

Did I mention the U.I is atrocious? I don't want to talk much about it, and this is probably just my opinion: but it's garbage.

61,76226445,english,"Can't rebind keys.  Crap programming in 2020 and they don't know if it will get added.  The lefties of the world roll their eyes at you.

Edit a few days later:

Notes on the game:

They added a (clunky) way to remap some of the keys.  Yea!  Note - you forgot to allow mapping of the arrow keys.

World looks nice though bushes and such don't move or make a noise when you walk through them.

I tried collecting up a bunch of birch.  Went into my inventory menu to look at them and - where are they?  I don't see them.  Huh.  Ah - it turns out that my inventory is not really my inventory it was a 'here's how to use your inventory'.  Found the actual inventory when I hit esc.

When trying to click on something on a different screen, the game freezes up and goes into a weird three quarter screen.  Yeah, some of us multi-task with multiple screens.  It's annoying but not game breaking.  It becomes progressively more annoying over time and should be an easy fix for the developers.

I wonder if you can change the size of the text when talking to people.  Some of us are old and bigger text would be a help.  Holy cow is it small for me.  

Hopefully in the future they'll add things like 'people move their mouths when they speak', voices, conversation options...

The quest says to 'collect straw'.  There is no straw.  They mean 'reeds'.   Why do they call it 'straw'?  In the inventory, it goes back from being reeds to being straw.  Bad editing.  Make it all reeds and you can keep straw for a seperate resource later.

If you chop down a tree and it falls on you, there is no damage.  Disappointing.  Also, you can't get rid of stumps (see 'The Island' for details on how to do this.  Also for people who are really in to having a clear spot for building and such they will go nuts if they can't get rid of their stumps.

Chopping bushes to clear the land (again, see the game 'The Island' to see what I mean) doesn't work.

Only ONE rabbit trap?  WTF.  Anyone who knows anything about trapping knows you want to put down a BUNCH of traps.  Feels like a super artificial, arbitrary limit.

I get that the developers want this to be a 'dynasty' but holy crap it really feels like 'This is the woman you will end up marrying - whether you want to or not'.  And will actually having a 'dynasty' pay off?  I have doubts on that but whatever.  

On day two (holy crap whoever decided to make seasons three days long, seriously WTF) I noticed I was starving a bit so I decided to use my 'fifty gold' in town.  Turns out it should have been labeled 'fifty copper' because it's not enough to do hardly anything.  I can get a couple packets of seeds or one decent meal.  That's it.  So I will have to use up more of the food that is on me.

When you hit the button at the campfire to either sleep or cook, a long hit gets you the sleep only option, a short hit on the key gets you the cook option.  It took some time to figure this out.  It would probably be more clever to have them all on the same radial.

Spent time looking for rocks.  Considering the entire planet is made of them, they seem a bit of a scarce resource.

I get that this is a slower paced game but (unless you know everything about the game and where to find things) the beginning part seems like a slow drag to me.

While being unable to wake people up to talk to them might be a part of game play, it is both unrealistic and incredibly annoying.  

It seems like I spent most of my time on the edge of starvation and moving at a creep from carrying too much stuff.  Hopefully, they'll adjust that stuff in the future.  One of the first cheat packs I can see getting made is for a slower rate of food consumption.  While I wanted to concentrate on building a farm (where the hell is crap?  Only one guy sells it and I can't find him?  WTF?) and then building up a settlement, I was instead constantly working on scrounging up food and barely making it day to day.  Realistic for a medieval peasant?  Possibly but fun?  Not really.

Due to the scarcity of 'rocks', they should probably be included with the 'examine' or 'inspect' light up thing - whatever they call it.  I'd call it 'notice stuff easier' or just 'notice'.

The 'stuck' button seems to teleport you ALL THE WAY BACK TO THE BEGINNING rather than just a couple feet from where you were stuck.  This is another WTF feature.

Bug - I was out hunting (to keep from continually starving to death) and made a camp fire to sleep at.  When I awoke, I was back home.

Invisible walls to keep you in the valley.  Understable but ...ew.

Summary:  So far, it looks like it has some potential.  Then again, everything does in the early stages.  Potential just means there is a lot left to develop and bring into the 'actualized'.  

I realize this game is in 'alpha'.  A status that has lost nearly all it's meaning in recent years as people play the game in alpha, get tired of it and move to the next game...in alpha.  

I suspect this may be a decent game once a lot more work has been put in to it.  I am happy the developers (mostly) put in the ability to change the key map.  I'll have to check back in a month or few to see how it is coming along.


Note:  For anyone who screams about me using 'the Forest' comparisons, it's only because that game and this share some elements and something new should always be better than something old.

88,76523679,english,"A survival rpg without undead/zombies/mutants/monsters? All I can say is about time!

Medieval Dynasty as the title suggests puts you in the medieval time period in the role of a young man who has fled his home after war came to his village and you start with just the clothes on your back, some food and a fistful of coins. The goal is to build and manage your own settlement through the seasons and years, get married and have a child who will take over your role when they reach adulthood.
Obtaining the required resources is central to the game from hunting, gathering and farming to provide food to mining and chopping trees to provide resources for building and tool making.

If you are looking for a realistic survival rpg then I highly recommend you give this a try but do note that currently there is no combat or fighting in the game with the exception of some wild animals that will attack you if you get too close.

Pro's: 
Very realistic gameplay
Visually the game looks very good (unreal engine)
Very active dev team who are constantly working on the game and providing patches and hotfixes on a regular basis
Roadmap providing information on what will be added in the next six months

Cons:
current lack of static objects/decorations that give a more 'alive' feel to the game
lack of information on side quests, for example a npc has a side quest where they need materials to repair their home but do not state what materials they need, you only find out if you accept the quest. This needs to be changed so you know exactly what is required before you accept the quest.

AI needs improvement. They don’t work when you aren’t around, at least not on the farm. When you are around, that’s all they do work, gather in the Tavern for a nightcap, then off to bed where they rinse and repeat every day.
Hunting, for the most part, is easy. When you have master aim, most animals are a headshot away from a kill, wolves howl before the attack, you have time to run upon them and kill them. Bears 2 headshots, and they die, same with the wisent “bison.” The aggression range could be increased, but not by much and remove the howl. 
Each building has its own interface; click on your management list, then hit “F” it will bring up a new tab with buttons on the top it will allow you to change what they make. 
Don’t try anything without works in the Resource Building. They are the ones that gather and deliver what each building needs. (this is all done behind the scene as none of them leave where they work) And as I cant see them do it, it’s only speculation.
I have a starter over. I was in maybe 8 hours before realizing that placing my house right outside the main starting sitting where your quest lines start hindered my growth. Before I found out how to destroy buildings, but at 70+ hours, I feel I haven’t even been half waypoint.

YES, this is EA, and things need and are being fixed. The dev’s post some kind of update almost every day. I hope content soon follows and major fix’s to the AI. Is 30$’s worth it? Yes, I bought it for on sale and would still have paid 30. IF they fix the AI and hunting and add some more variety for the quest, I’d spend 40.

Unfortunately, after awhile numerous tasks tire you down and it becomes quite repetitive and tedious, with no real goal in sight at the moment for the player to work towards after awhile.
Some of the problems i've came across so far and my personal wishes for the future development.

I feel like seasons or better yet day cycles should be an option. You should be able to choose whether you want to rush and progress fast or have more time to enjoy the little things in game. This game looks just too beautiful to not be able to sit around and enjoy everything you've accomplished so far.

Hunger needs minor adjusting, i say minor because there are skills that reduce the rate by 10/20/30% and it's a matter of realism as well. You can't just eat once in a day and get done with it, but you shouldn't spend half your day in a game getting food and water either.

AI needs a lot of work, both in people and animals. Hunting is very easy and not challenging at all, even hunting big game is too easy.

Transporting goods in general and especially logs is extremely tedious as well, they need to add a way to be more efficient as soon as possible. Some sort of ox wagons, horses or donkeys.

Buildings management should be optimized. It's very confusing at the moment and doesn't seem to work well at all.

Adding some pets later on would be nice.

My personal grand wish would be for them to add a way to build up from a little village to a Castle town. Where you'll have to fend off attacks of bandits and or war parties and keep everything running smoothly with various other challenges, like maybe some natural disasters or events.

PROS:
- Building your own village and sourcing materials
- Interesting quests
- NPC's aren't extremely easy to get to do whatever you want. You have to learn who likes hunting and who thinks themselves above it, etc.
- Choose your own journey. If you want to focus on making a town, sweet. If you want to go hunt a lot, sweet. If you want to go and get married and have a family, sweet. It's all up to you. 


CONS:
- Some of the weapons/HP are weird in regards to hunting. I killed a bear in 2 hits with a wooden spear. I don't think it should be that easy.
- A bit buggy. Can't complete some tasks because the items wont transfer to the NPC. NPC is asking for an item I can't get in that season. I'll sell items and won't get money for anything, etc. 
- I'd love them to introduce naming and managing multiple villages. Going into this blind, I have set up no where near any mining materials like caves. I'd love to make a little mining town, a little fishing town, etc. At the moment I'm not sure if it's possible to set up a mine so far away.",1601202814,1601202814,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True,76561198284420124,84,2,2085,1868,1939,1601350183,,

Its just lucky choices that you make to convince them to join you. One wrong move or choice and you literally wasted a day and have to start again the next day. Build food and resource storage places  and a few houses before inviting anyone to live with you or they will just walk away (mine did within 10 mins).

So, it has stay appeal and an acceptable prices, how about the state of the game then? Its not bad tbh, as ever, its an alpha, all things could change before ""release"" many bugs will be fixed along the way, so far the devs seem competent. I would say its in a stable state.

58,76643822,english,"Ok so its still in early access & there are a few bugs but, overall, it's a challenging & engaging survival/city builder game. You cannot rush thru it unlike a lot of similar games, you have to plan carefully & save before you talk to the npc persons you want to attract to your village/town. Following the main quests are very important as it will unlock the amount of buildings you can build. 
As for buildings, i found (after 3 restarts) that you need to start with 1: house 2: food storage 3: mats storage 4: hunters lodge, there may be better options but if you want to attract atleast 1 npc to your village, you need to keep them fed & happy. 
Talking to the free npc daily is a must so you can build up a rep with them (remember to save before talking) & if you get a negative response, reload & try with a different question. Also, it's best to google anything you are not sure of such as animal or resource locations as this will speed up what you can do each day.
The biggest issue you will encounter is the lack of time per day/season so you need to get as much done as possible as the seasons change every 3 days (or so it seems) so keep following the main quests before you do the mundane things such as felling trees or hunting etc.
Remember to wash before entering a town & interacting with the npc (you can make a wash tub from your crafting menu) as you stand a better chance of getting a positive reply. 
As for making money, well, there are plenty of you-tube videos to check out regarding this. Remember to use the steam guide to sellers so you know which npc sells what. I would recommend you go to LESNICA asap and trade with Teobald (iron tools) & Gizela (weapons & bows).

But its not ready yet. At 25 hours the AI just broke. I have a decent sized village of 6 people and they just stand in their house doing nothing. Thats a real issue for farmers tending fields as the work doesnt get done and primary income is tied to crops. They also have some systems that arent explained so you kinda guess and RP them but they may have zero actual benefit.

Pros -
* Beautiful graphics.
* Villager recruitment.
* Music is amazing.
* Hunting is entertaining and fun.

87,76634087,english,"If you want a game that's enjoyable, a bit grindy, and has active Devs who listen to the community, then you'll probably enjoy this game. 

In it's current state, you can likely get a few years (about 20 hours of playtime) in before you hit a content repeat void (like a AAA game after you've completed every quest in the game and only have ""This settlement is in need of your help"" type quests left). Basically, the game is still being developed so you can't expect a full, finished game out of it, but it's definitely worth playing or at least keeping an eye on.

A few things I wish were in the game or changed from how it currently is set up:

[list]
[*]Some way to set markers on the map, like waypoints of some kind
[*]Fast traveling to villages you've previously visited would be nice (no fast travel currently), but just being able to mark things on the map would help a lot
[*]The game currently gives the option to accept side quests from villagers without being able to make (or buy) the materials you need to complete the quest (It also doesn't tell you what you'll need to complete the quest until after you've already accepted it, which is inconvenient)
[*]Hints or tips for managing your villagers, like how they need equipment in their buildings to do their tasks, like axes for logging, or warnings that they have no food or firewood, or any indication that they're idle in their workplace with nothing to do

94,76630157,english,"Medieval Dynasty is just in it's alpha, but has so much to offer already and will only get better over time, if you can trust the roadmap. I still see a problem in keeping the motivation up to play this game for generations, you have to get a child, which you play when your charater dies, if you fail, your dynasty is a goner, but I'm ready to get surprised there. The quests are at the moment pretty simple, but I didn't expect more, tbh.

The survival aspect is great. It's similar to games like Conan Exiles. Meaning, you have to drink and eat every so often to not die. Your stamina drains by running and doing things. You level up by using tools and, similar to Skyrim, you level the tool you're using or more like the area the tool is used in. With the new level up you gain points to spent in that area and get some boni. Some are way more impatcful than others, but well, it's still in the alpha, so I expect some changes there. Besides that you also unlock new technoligies to get new things to craft and new buildings to build, which will improve your own town.

Well, I guess we can now talk about the big thing of this game: City building. Besides surviving in a more or less harsh environment, you get to build your own town. At first there are just some small buildings but over thime you get a real little lively medieval village. With that you get to manage it in every aspect possible. You have to assign the villagers to their job. Switch them in winter, when some jobs are useless. Watch out for your stock of food and wood, so no one is freezing or hungry. If you fail, they will leave your town pretty quick. And of course have to maintain the buildings, the cheaper the building, the quicker it will deteriorate. Last but not least, since it's not practicaly your land on which you're building your little village, you have to pay taxes and the bigger your town the higher your taxes.

So, in the end you have to manage a lot at once and that's the big difference here in comparison to other survival games. The genre mix is great and intriguing. So it's no surprise to see the hype it's currently generating. And the Devs are doing a damn fine job updating this game, it's just the cherry on top.

99,76628868,english,"So after playing the game and i know that the Devs are working on but I would not recommend it to my friends at the current state.
Pros:
I like the concept
I like the building aspect although we will get into the cons of the buildings
I do like the fact you need different tools for each things
I do like the skill leveling up although we will get into the cons about it
I like the quests it adds more to the game than just doing your thing and sometimes you learn form doing the quest.
Cons
While the game tries to be real in some cases such as growing crops and the length of time it needs to grow and proper tools to get the job done. We get into things that dont make sense. If I build a storage and it is built with one chest to place food into it then why does it only hold 50 weight and if so then why cant i build more chest in that building why would i have to wait to get a storage 2 or 3 building. If your managing a town does everything have to be micro managed. For instance why would you put a worker who I assume you would pick to have high skill in that area not make a axe to cut down trees or the tools they would need if you supply the materials in the resource building? 
The social dialog is not good because it gives you 2 choices and if your trying to get someones approval rating up it does make things difficult since one wrong choice and they dont want to talk to you for the rest of the day. You would think if someone was homeless and you offered them a place that they can work and have there own place to live they would take it in a heart beat but instead we have to go through this dialog that works sometimes and other times leaves you just to wait another day for new dialog to say to that person. 
Quests are very generic some are simple and others make you go long distances to make it there to wait because the npc went to sleep or stuck. Some quest like kill wolfs,boars, or bears at night seems like a simple quest but again you find that the animals that suppose to be endangering the town are nowhere to be found near, instead you are forced to find them randomly and sometimes far away to fail the quest because night was over. 
Lets talk about weapons why the heck i can throw a spear (by the way i have to use a log to make a spear instead a tree branch) hit a animal in the face and kill it and when i use a bow and the same thing the animal runs away. 
Skills i think need to be redone or maybe the way you learn them for some. For instance why do I need to plow a field and then destroy it to plow the field again and again and again to gain the building so i can get chickens? Why do i have to pay gold to learn technology diagrams? To me this is a short coming to why not make it a quest to learn it from a villager? Instead of paying gold to learn it but then why have skills if they have some cap and we are paying gold to learn something anyways? Why not just male money and pay to learn the skills instead of the grind of doing something over and over to hit a skill cap and furthermore why do i have to add skill to give me plus to learn the skill fro example survival skill, What do i do I pick as many herbs as i can to raise that and the first level in that skill I dont get to to put into something to male it easy to fond herbs instead I am forced to place it into the skill that will give me +2 for every herb i pick and then when I pick 250 more flowers I again put it onto +3 to the skill because otherwise the grind is that much longer then once i get to put points into skills that are good like less hunger and thirst I get level caped and it no longer goes up until later. 
I could go on and on about more issues but i think a big issue that could be addressed early on and was not and is still not is a direct and detailed explanation of everything on the game. How in detail to farm because the awhile there i was trying to figure out how to water my crops and apparently they dont need water to grow. Doesnt really get into how to get animals or take care of them. Also Why the heck could i not get any chicken out in the wild or even have wild boars ect, as farm animals? Interesting enough why does the place you pay taxes to seem to be so poor and the towns to the west seem to to be more advance with metal? Ill give an update review later.

1. Day time increase by 10 minutes or season day increase to 4 or 5 days
2. Castles well a 7x7 prefab that you can choose the walls for with a throne room
3. Horses (I know you are working on these) and carts as I would love to carry 100 weight in a cart when going mining
4. Paving block tiles for when you build off the road, could be a buildable object like fences but please refine that
5. Fence corners as that gaps in the palisade corners really bug my OCD and would be a weak point
6. Quicker crafting of food as spending a quarter a day to cook 50 stew is really annoying but essential for income

As this game progresses, what I hope to see are more enhancements on those principles and more details in the mechanics already established. As well as more elements that will make you more emotionally involved, which i feel like voice acting does(and I like this game so much i wish I could contribute to that).

I feel like a medieval game needs bandits/raiders, and I suspect the devs will implement that when they're ready for it.

37,76616445,english,"This review is after 10 hours of game play on build 0.1.1.0 and I have just finished the first year.

Medieval Dynasty is a really interesting game with a stunningly beautiful environment and graphics. It is in an early access stage but it still got a lot of content, most of the time the game feels like a well polished game almost ready for full release. So far I've encountered rabbits, dear, fox, boar, wolf, Bison and I think I saw a bear so there are many different ones to hunt already. All the animals react differently when approached just like they should, fairly good AI. There are also a lot of different NPC quests available.

There are of course parts that feel a bit less complete like empty NPC storage boxes (so you can't rob the content but will have to be satisfied by stealing what's visible) and a somewhat bad hitbox when throwing a spear at an animal that is right at your feet, works well at short or long distance though. Then there is the teleport function, I have been stuck one time in the beginning but very fast found that there is an unstuck button that will teleport you loose so no need to be afraid of getting stuck. However, if you go to bed in one house that you have built but also have a better house in the settlement you seem to wake up in that new house's bed instead of the one you went to bed in. Not sure if there are ways of setting a specific house to default, maybe I just haven't found it but it's somewhat annoying you don't wake up where you went to bed. There is also a problem if you go to sleep next to a fire in the woods and the next day is a new season, then you get teleported back to your house and wake up in the bed. This happened to me when I was far away in the middle of a quest (couldn't complete it because the NPC did not want to talk to me due to the time of day so went to sleep by a fire), had to run back the next day to finish it, this is not a big issue when you know about it but still very annoying.

The game have three days per season and at first I though that would be stressful but it's actually not. You can play the game in whatever speed you like and the reason for only three days/season is so you will be able to create and manage a village (you can build the village wherever you want in the world!), find a wife and get an heir (as far as I understand it), which is the main point of the game.

This is a classic level up survival game with a level up system affecting both your village and the character, I find it quite good to be honest. I have read some negative reviews complaining about the constant food and water consumption, there are skills to balance this, same with stamina, tool usage among other things so I'd actually say it's well balanced once you have the 30% less food/water consumption skill. Once you have villagers they also help with the chores like gathering, crafting etc (from what I've read in one of the the popup windows) so that will also make life easier. Then there is the constant running all over, I do somewhat miss a horse and don't know if there will be one or not, lets hope so but if there aren't any then I'd say it's still ok due to the really good looking scenery.

The sound and music in the game is great, the music is relaxing and the sound effects are superb, especially walking in cuddly snow. The water is very well done, even have ripples on the surface when walking through it.

The FPS is more or less constantly good so it's already well optimized for it's current stage, even with the highest settings.

I strongly recommend this game for anyone who likes a sandbox survival building game, it's easy to learn the basics, it's relaxing and beautiful with some dangers involved.

Lastly a tip, read all the popup notes, many won't reappear and they are really useful",1601149540,1601152649,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True,76561198000938478,209,12,952,708,609,1601219107,,

The graphics are amazing even with my GTX 1660TI and the way the game works is makes you feel like you're actually trying to start your own village and dynasty in the map that was created. The mechanics behind talking to other village members could use some slight work with it being very repetitive but besides that the mechanics regarding that are well made. The season mechanics are great, you can't plant anytime you want with any seed you want and the wildlife is scarcer due to winter coming of season and the wildlife either hibernating or just acting scarce.

Well, this game allows you to fulfill your dream. You start as a simple person on your own in a foreign land where you have to survive on your own. Then, when you find a nice place to settle, you can then build your first house, first workshop, farm and so on and eventually it grows into a real settlement. In the meantime you can get married and hand pick your villagers based on their skills. 

The game has 2 main parts: Survival and Settlement management. At first it is 100% survival as you have no food, no place to live, nothing. The survival part feels very natural and it does not require any extra knowledge or guessing. In my perspective, it was one of the best survival simulation as it was always very clear what you have to do by just checking the vital information. Then it slowly and seamlessly starts to shift towards the settlement management part as you grow your community. The villagers you select help you to automate certain processes like gathering food, resources, crafting and farming and so you don't have to think about survival so much as you have a steady flow of food. This whole process of settlement grows makes you feel very fulfilled and motivated to just improve it even further.

Best Building Spots
===============
Added this in here as I've seen the question posted and no useful replies.

As far as the best options are concerned, personally I would recommend the spot just west of the point where the stream below baranica meets the main river. In the woods slightly to  its west you'll find clay. Just to the north between baranica and branica, you'll find a mine.

If on the other hand you feel you can stomach the lengthy travel time and are happy to entertain travel further from the beaten track, there's a superb spot just west of Hornica in the south east corner of the map. Just to the east of that lake, on it's shore in fact.  The north stream that meets the lake has clay just off the west bank. Meanwhile if you follow the nearby track to the southeast, you can't miss the nearby mine in the hills. There's plenty of game around and a rich, mostly pine, forest, which makes this a pretty strong location for a big build.

Incidentally, bears (incredibly rare) are most often found in the mountains, including those near here, though it may take some time to spot one. Circling the woods around the lake will cover a wide range of other wildlife.

Most wanted change
================
I dearly wish it supported multiplayer - being able to invite your mates to help hunt or work for your village, or even visit would be incredibly neat and something that would open it up to a much bigger market.

As a stretch target, I hope after they finish this project they team up with other companies. Even the recently abandoned Chronicle of Elyria. Base software like this, scaled up to kingdom sizes for an MMO would be incredible.

General feedback
==============

A bit more info. Some aspects of the game are not entirely clear. You will get the odds quest (at least for now) that leaves you none the wiser as to what's actually needed. Simply ignore them. I have. No issue. When using spears, hold right then left click to throw the spear. They often break so carry spares.

When it comes to building your first house, and likely the location of your future village, this is unfortunately limited in terms of really good spots. The biggest limitation in my mind is the feeling that it takes an incredibly long time to get around. On the plus side, skills do indicate that the developers are working on horses, which should significantly resolve those waits. Also, you may like me feel that the encumbrance  limits are simply too low. You know those games that strive to be realistic, too realistic in fact? The ones where you're having to drop off your baggage to such an extent that the game starts to feel more like a chore? Well this feels a little like one of those. As such, you'll be wanting a location that's not too far out the way. 

NPCs aren't perfect yet, so left to their own devices as workers, you might find your food supply suddenly dropping off, so best monitored, but this is something the devs are hopefully still working on too.

That said, it's a great game already, and with additional work, could be something special.

Tip: Press E once you've placed a HOUSE template and have your hammer equipped and you're facing a wall / roof section. You can select from several options, which have benefits, including allowing stone built houses etc.

At present, ""repair"" doesn't appear to do anything. Guessing this is in progress.

Personally, I'd like to see an option that reduces the encumbrance aspect most of all. This would enable you to gather resources from further afield more easily, something historically managed with a cart or the like. In the meantime, it would be nice when launching the game to have a ""difficulty"" setting that had a few minimal effects, including perhaps adding an extra point for skill actions (could stack with the skill system already in place), at least tripling carry capacity, and perhaps for the less able gamers, increasing hit boxes for hunting etc. Better yet, also remove ""decay"" aspects from buildings too. This sort of choice in all honesty doesn't detract from gameplay, but just opens the market to people who like to relax, design and not micromanage so much.

All in all though, if you're looking for a game with charming graphics, beautiful seasons, the ability to build up your settlement from the ground up, scout local talent to invite as villagers, and simply sit back and enjoy your masterpiece, this is the one to go for.

Unfortunately there's still a lot of balancing and tuning needed.
- Money is very hard to come by (compared to VODs you may see on Youtube) especially compared to taxes, technology, and extreme expense of establishing a population.
- In the enthusiastic early game you want to build, build, build; unfortunately you end up in spring owing more taxes than you could possible pay.
- Managing people is 'Try and Fail' right now, with very little warning about their basic needs, and you can quickly run out of people to recruit (they seem to repopulate slowly, which just means you lost days of rep grinding).
- Thrown weapon accuracy is unfortunate at best, especially at close range where projectiles often stray far from the frame of view (throwing a spear horizontal to your camera, for instance).
- Buildings have storage, but the AI only recognizes very specific ""Storage"" buildings for very specific ""Items,"" having food in someones house does not feed them, they starve; but food in the ""Food Storage"" building works (too bad that early game it takes dozens of trees to build, and incurs quite a tax). 
- Food decay rate seems appropriate, but farming is miserably slow and ultimately less useful than simply hunting and selling fur/leather to buy linen for instance (even at terrible vendor prices).
- There appears to be a synergy between having animals and farming, however animals cost thousands of gold so they are virtually unaffordable. Buying manure appears to be the way to farm, though it's so expensive that there's no way to profit. I need to pun... farming is shitty. Perhaps if you could find manure.
- Skills and Technology unlocks outpace the resources you collect to attain them. Examples: A skill that allows you to place an additional fishing trap can be achieved early, but the fishing trap technology is deep in the tree. The main quest has you establish a barn/farm early on, but you cant afford animals or manure, so it's simply a tax burden. Bows can be unlocked early with a hunting lodge, but linen thread can only be obtained through vendors (farming is tremendously late game).",1601129215,1601129233,True,1,0,0.522058844566345215,0,True,False,True,76561197993404388,422,52,663,663,399,1601248261,,

Based on the names and the landscape, it's based somewhere in Poland, meaning hot summers and cold snowy winters, which is nice for a survival game. There are blueberry bushes and many different types of mushrooms that you can eat (they are very realistic, if you know your mushrooms, you won't even need to read the descriptions to know which ones are poisonous). The farming mechanics are reasonably realistic and fun. You have to pay attention to the seasons, and there is just the right number of different crops to make it interesting.

Pros:

- Reasonably well balanced, although some functionality hasn't yet been finished
- Nothing in this game feels like a grind, but there are still ways to grind more money if you find yourself broke


Neutrals:

- The quests are not particularly engaging, but it's original to see quests in a survival game, and it adds variety and gives you a reason to travel more
- Hunting mechanics: animals run away when being shot at (good), wolves call other members of their pack (fun), carnivores are far too aggreessive in this game (bad). In reality, bears and wolves don't attack humans unless threatened or startled, but this game is basically an all you can eat human buffet. On the upside, surviving an attack is actually very easy, so it doesn't bother me too much.

it do have missions and tasks to do and meanwhile you are doing them you get to discover the game
But there is couple of things missing:
1) A transportation to travel around maybe they should add horses
or maybe fast travel
2) Spawn more animals than usual 
3) Stack-able quick slots for example i have 20 throwing rocks but i can only put 1 throwing rock into the quick slot, and if i throw it i have to get back in the inventory and put another one.
4) Make the NPCs physically invisible and not stuck in stuff or make them a bit smarter
because there was a NPC right behind the door blocking it that i couldn't enter until i somehow glitched the game while spamming the E button next to the door to interact with him and tell him to move a bit (yes there is such option to tell the NPC to move a bit) but in such cases not so useful.
5) Should also add more sound effects for for the actions in the game

2,76589418,english,"This is gem of a game, albeit it needs more polishing and content, but has a lot of potential. Worth getting.

Pros:
- Great graphics: The 4 seasons are awesome
- Game runs smooth. Saving is ultra fast (good for save spamming). Loading is tad slower, but no issue.
- Gameplay is pretty deep, a lot of things to learn and expand on. 

Cons:
- Combat is iffy. I can't tell if I am hitting the beasts or not. Because of this, range weapons work a lot better. Bows suck though. 
- Cant figure out what is the objective of the game. Am I suppose to build a thriving colony? But the prohibitive tax, couple with money-making process getting nerfed constantly, it seems dev is pushing players into a leaner, smaller establishment.
- Content is pretty bare, but it is EA, so probably will be added in later. Now it is pretty much just farming and paying taxes lol.
- Quests seem to be time-triggered, and not tech triggered. Expect quests requiring item turn-ins made from techs you haven't opened up to yet. Or in the wrong season (asking for berries in winter). If possible, just buy those items lol. Save the game before accepting quests. You don't want to be stuck with a difficult quest which end up failing and losing rep. Hopefully devs give an option to abandon quests with no penalty. 
- Rep gain is too slow. (+2 per quest is just sad)
- Mats for building is bonkers. You will spend most of the game chopping wood. And because logs are heavy, expect a lot of running to and fro. This is possibly the single biggest turn off in the game. 
- AI is buggy. Your followers do weird shit. Some times they go on strike and decide not to work. Oh and your followers work real slow, sometimes it is faster doing yourself. :(
- Travelling is a bitch. Right now there is seriously no incentive to explore or visit other towns except for the occasional mats or recruiting followers with high skill points. Hearing that dev will be putting in transport, hope it is true. 
- Some buildings are worthless. No point building them and incurring tax. 
- Clothings are useless. I read that it helps with diplomacy, maybe it is true, but I do just fine without. They sell for less than the mats. So save your mats and $. 
- Most iron items are worthless. Although stone items have less durability and take more strikes to cut trees, the abundance of mats make it more worthwhile. Save your iron for making scythes and 50x arrows. Read Tips below to find out why.
- The economy is currently bonkers. 

Tips:
1) Dont sleep at night lol. Save daytime for NPC interactions (quest, recruit, sell items) and spend the night farming, building, crafting and stealing. Nightime is when you get most of your shit done. 
2) Steal crops to make money. After patch, it seems only grains crops can be stolen. Bring 2 scythes, go to village with farms at night and steal their crops. Thresh in your barn to launder it. It will lose its stolen tag after that. 
3) Build your town next to the starter village. VERY IMPORTANT! Dont try to be fancy and build in some place exotic. Use UNSTUCK to teleport back if you are far from home. Not exactly in your town, but close enough. 
4) Do not over-expand. The tax will eat you alive. Lean and bare minimum town. Some buildings are complete trash. Do not over-recruit. If you come across followers with 6 or 7 skills, recruit them. Fire those with lower skill points follower who are fillers. 
5) Build buildings close and tight together. There will be a lot of running to and fro. 
6) Save some herbs over winter. You dont want to be stuck with low health or food poisoning during winter.
7) Screw washtub. Immerse yourself in water to clean yourself while drinking.
8) You take fall damage, but wont drown lol. 
9) Spring/Summer: make money selling berries. More efficient than sticks because the bushes tend to cluster. Sticks during autumn. Iron arrows (base mats sell for 110, 50xarrows sell for 350) all year round. Need to farm iron though. 
10) Gain favors with followers by checking their stats. Their highest stat skill determines their vocation. Workers/grunts respond well to weather/gossip/farming (tough job in farm, not the early bird one), hunting, concern (how are you). Crafters respond to jobs question and the one about robes.",1601117037,1601117037,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True,76561198035356696,7,2,2658,2495,1779,1601305450,,

13,76177174,english,"When I play KCD, I think about this game (which I didn't know its existence), and it is becomes reality...

Survive in medieval, Born low and able to become the ruler some day.

What you get is:

- Farming, gathering, stick to season. Walk in the wood and picking mushrooms in autumn is quite relaxing.

- Game animals.
Trophy is in-need i think...And meat portion you get from butcher different size of animal is not feel right, big animal give you not so much meat. Interaction of animals is ok, a lot of room to improve. In current version they are not a life treat, the way they fight and damage is weak, and especially when you can find HP herb anywhere. But I know it's not good to push the survival level too hard whiles in EA.

- Crafting, building.
Building is quite clunky, should have some way to allow player to adjust position of building, because laying structure frame with logs in perspective view is a turn-down, while cannot have precisely placement. I do understand about realistic, but if the process can mark building space with 4 sticks before bring logs to site is a better idea. (Just place it like frame do but show it like fence laying mode with 4 corner sticks, able to pick area and rotate or moving around and place it again, then if use hammer with logs on it, will build foundation frame, like 1st stage of building in current version, the game will be so much better.)

- Relationship with NPC. 
A bit dry for now but hope for future updates, class-related dialogue system is good, but 
I think it need more flavor dialogue to enrish the world.

- Graphic is superb, lighting which react to scenery, NPCs looks good, I feel in the same way as KCD.

Cons (for now)
- Some aspects feel clunky like other EA game, bugs is there.
- Some quest description are not clear enough. Some information player should not to have guess what is it, for example, I have wolf hunt quest, if the deadline is 12.00 like onscreen info, please write it down in journal too, the journal should give me full info of the quest I received, in the way player could understand clearly.

19,76580799,english,"I wanted to post a review for this game, and started to type up a MASSIVE 3.5 page document with my review to copy paste into this….. It was too long xD

So, I’ll condense it down, and post the FULL review, in the games forums/community hub here on steams feedback-early access section. ((Likely shouldn’t have added so many tips and tricks I found in my time playing the game hehehe, oh well.))

First things first - I love this game. I think it is VERY worth the $30. However, there are a few things I want to quickly discuss. (Again, I will go into further detail with this in the other forum post)

- The game is in early access. Keep that in mind. At the time of writing, we are on v0.1.1.0. However, the devs appear to be fairly active with the game development already and they have a history of other good games of this same nature.

- Remember! It’s a survival game! You will have to manage your hunger.

- There are quests that will help guide you through the game and what you should likely build, starting off with a personal house. I also recommend starting up making fields so you can unlock the barn and food storage for when you start your village. BUT! Know that these quests can be done on YOUR time. Do not feel you need to rush it. Many of these quests have “talk to me tomorrow, or next season” type updates to them.

- The 3 day seasons! I’m sure looking at other reviews, this is a hot topic. I wouldn’t be opposed 1 extra day of each season, but honestly, it’s not that bad. If you are worried about winter, because winter sucks in most games like this, DON’T BE! If you store the food in chests so that it wont degrade, you will be fine. Don’t sleep in the game because it’s pointless. You can continue hunting and gathering the items you need in the dead of night. The only thing to note is that you will be teleported back to your house at the end of the season with full hunger and thirst meters. Also, if you finish the first few min quests in time (which you will, or you are REALLY slacking), you will get the clothing you require to be ready for winter. Believe it or not, the 3 days is actually balanced quite well once you put these into perspectives.

- Town management. Build food storage. Always food storage. And a house for people to live in! It’s so simple! But MAKE SURE YOU DO IT! I think the food storage is unlocked in the farming tree. Build fields and hoe them to upgrade that tech and unlock it! THEN start recruitment! They will need a place to get their food and you can’t just drop it off in the chest at their house…. I tried….

Over all, there are very few bugs that I find and the devs are active in fixing them. They are also good about getting feedback. Just be aware that they may not implement it because it doesn’t fit their picture for the game. BUT! It’s a heavy simulation/survival/management game. It plays on those strengths. And, frankly, I’ve always wanted a first person town management game like this. It’s so cool!!! >.< I recommend this game 100%. The more time you put into the game, the cooler it gets and the more you get out of it. The more it is worth that $30. But, if you wait on a sale, that is understandable too. But! I think it’s VERY much worth it. Just give it time and understand the mechanics of the game first. And this may take more than 2 hours, and maybe a reset, to REALLY get yourself where you REALLY want your town to be set up and stuff. It’s really cool but take your time with the game!

35,76574516,english,"Plus side: the game is extremely pretty.  The weather effects and day/night stuff is done really well.  The building side is really good. I felt genuine fear walking through a forest not knowing if a wolf was going to burst out of a nearby bush.  In short, it has lots of potential if they massively overhaul the quest system.

Minus side: can't play as a female character.  And don't whine about 'realism' because I punched a wolf to death and healed myself from about 2% health with a leaf.  Funny how realism is only important in some situations.   This wouldn't stop me on its own - I've played Assassin's Creed for example - but it is a bit of a downer.

The quest system is...non-existent.  I have one quest that's waiting for summer, and another that's waiting for me to flirt with someone (see below). There seems to be no real way outside of this to raise your dynasty to the point of getting hired help - maybe my game was bugged as other people seem to have managed it?  I spend days running around the map to do random quests (of which there were a grand total of 2) but only raised my dynasty by a few percent.

I couldn't get on anyone's good side enough to enable flirting, not helped by the fact that opinions seem to keep resetting - again, this may be a bug.   It's not realistic (heh) for people's opinion of you to reset to neutral after the sun goes down (or maybe they are androids and I've discovered the sinister undercurrent of this game!).  If someone does me a massive favour (dude to whom I gave a bunch of money - twice - I'm looking at you), I don't forget about it after a few hours.  A long decay would be better.

Most of the characters look identical apart from grey hair to indicate age - this isn't great when you're trying to remember whether it's Alfreda or Elthelburga that likes hunting and who isn't going to react with revulsion when you boast about butchering Bambi and Thumper.  I shouldn't have to write down characters' likes on Notepad to progress.

Summary - play it but remember that it's VERY early access and they seem to have prioritised scenery realism over gameplay.

It would be nice if there were independent storage for specific type of items. like for instance log storage. and you see a rack built to hold the logs. and have it work of proximity to the main storage instead of having to all be in the same chest. 
2) more in-game or online help available about different aspects of the game. i understand it is new but still some help on say how to get a worker to work in the barn would be nice.
3) add in crafting of more small items please. like more chairs, beds, etc. and have it to were we can make ROADS and PATHWAYS !! stone and dirt or clay. ;)

52,76568439,english,"At this point - I really can't recommend the game. It has some interesting potential, but many of the things that are currently broken don't seem to have an easy fix (or speak to a larger decision to take an easier path during development):
[list]
[*]Quests often require seasonal ingredients but can occur in any season (and expire at the end of the season they were given, often uncompleted) or require items you won't unlock for years (ex: berries are only ripe in the summer, but you can get a quest to turn them in in the winter)
[*]Raising reputation with villagers (needed to recruit them to your village) is just a matter of asking them the correct things several days in a row. Each villager seems to have some responses they like - so you can just ask the same thing repeatedly. (ex: my wife agreed to marry me after I asked her about her day was for a season, and then told her how pretty over the course of the next year)
[*]The economy is completely unbalanced - villagers will buy anything but only sell at prices that really, really don't make sense (ex: my iron axe is apparently equivalent for enough manure and seeds to fill a 2x2 plot that'll yield me a whopping 20 carrots)
[*]The UI behind the management aspect of the game (eg building and managing a village) is exceedingly clunky for it to one of the main features (ex: if you want to assign a villager to a building, you have to know what skills line up where, you only see skill matching if you assign from the building itself)
[*]Progression is very odd... you unlock iron tools way before you unlock a pigsty
[/list]

However, even with all of that - what really kills it is the AI. The AI is in theory the backbone of this game - without it, you're just randomly around collecting berries and wood. You'll often find your villagers just standing around stuck in some sort of loop. I recently spent a good 3 minutes watching a villager draw her bow, relax her draw, and repeat. When villagers are bringing you any benefit, it looks almost like they are magically generating and teleporting resources rather than actually taking an action (eg, assign them to a certain job, out pops X amount of Y each day). And if they are supposed to actually complete actions, the whole thing needs to be rebalanced - it takes my villager a whole season to walk to and from the mine she's supposed to work at.

I could forgive the rest of that list if the AI worked... but I'd stay away until it's fixed and I'm not sure that's something they can easily address.",1601082770,1601083106,False,1,0,0.506493508815765381,0,True,False,True,76561197972136118,779,13,949,337,949,1601082435,,

Some minor issues, there seems to be quite a large slowdown in game progression around 500 Dynasty Score. I've seen some talk that this slowdown is lessened after ~Y5 but I have not hit that yet so I'll see if this is the case.  Either way, the explosive growth seems to lull hear and you fall into a rhythm.  Not necessarily a problem, but maybe the pacing could be leveled out some?  Rather than shooting through dynasty score and village status for the first two years and then plateauing out for the next 3, I would prefer a slightly slower progression through the earlier portions and then having it slightly faster around the 500 DS/10 building stage to help balance this while maintaining that exciting rapid growth early on.

More character diversity (I have walked up to 3 different women thinking it is the woman I'm courting lol)
There are some grammatical and spelling issues in the game (using to instead of too, etc.)
The seasons are TOO SHORT! I feel like I am rushing all the time
More story quests and dynasty points for doing smaller quests
Character creation -- I know they said that is going to be soon to come
More animals like squirrels in forests, alligators in the swamps, etc.
More small towns
Dynamic shops (changing each season or year)
More dialogue options
Maybe sounds from the characters rather than talking? (grunts and children laughing)

70,76561914,english,"To be clear, i am enjoying this game, but it isn't currently worth its price as its kinda lackluster.

the game is yet another spin on the survivalist genre with a bit of village management mixed in. Its fun, you choose where you wanna build & just go from there, however not much land is actually 'good' for a village (by that i mean flat)

Seasons: seasons are a cool idea of relating time, but at times i have literally nothing to do with my 'day' and  i am just gathering up food or wood before the day ends.

Leveling: leveling is slow. REAL slow. And a lot of what you need is related to leveling.

Quests: It has quests, which are a fine way of getting gold or other stuff here & there, however they are WAAAY too spread out, i would have preferred one big hub.

Swimming: There is none, meaning you just kinda, walk, in rivers/water. Making the bridges kinda pointless.

Tools: There is a good variety of tools, but i kinda want more. The way i have been hauling things to and from my town, i'd like a cart or something to at least make life a bit easier.

Animal AI: Its horrible. Pigs & such spot you at a distance and really good luck outrunning them. They even break into your house. No where is safe.

Village: I don't really like the whole ""You are only allowed to build 4 buildings"" kind of angle, which i guess they don't want you building houses every 10m? iunno.

Dark: Stuff is horrible in the dark, i really wish inspector mode made spotting of basic stuff easier (Like sticks, rocks etc.) (Possibly a lvl up, iunno.) seems useless atm. Once you're in the dark and you need to sleep, but have no gear to make a fire you're kinda screwed.

Health: I get they're kinda going for realism, everything kind of has a purpose, these mushrooms are food, these are deadly, but with the amount of health you lose its near impossible to find the herbs you need to get your health back up to 100. I'd prefer you gain a bit of health from eating, maybe making stews.

Tl;dr: Its a fun game, its just very..slow, with several things that i feel they could do better if given attention. You certainly won't be having Ark or the forest levels of fun out the gate. Its slow, even tedious and at times, repetitive.",1601072506,1601072506,False,1,0,0.5,0,True,False,True,76561198047588172,781,79,804,804,659,1601896047,,

The game is great, has a ton of space for new things, hopefully they will add a ""lord"" system or something.
with that being said, i will say NO for now, until they fix the massive issue we mostly have with new games: PERFORMANCE/OPTIMIZATION, is not something that cripples the game, but it definetly make an impact on gameplay.
even with a beefy PC, you can see these performance issues, to me that is the only problem that is holding this game back.

But as of now, until they fix perfomance related issues, i will say NO.",1601069592,1601069970,False,1,0,0.502909421920776367,0,True,False,True,76561198138388314,31,4,1526,1526,580,1601411342,,
77,76559901,english,"The game starts out feeling like a giant open world to explore, but hour-to-hour seems a little smaller and little bit more lonely until you realize after 15 hours of gameplay there isn’t a lot of reason to stop chopping wood and get out more. I recommend, but you need to understand that it is definitely an Alpha and the downsides will eventually overwhelm the fun aspect of gameplay if major updates aren’t made (not just hot-fixes).

I assume you know what the game is about already, but if you don’t: You are a young man who is building a small village and hiring local villagers to work the fields for you. Ultimately, the goal is to marry and raise children to continue your dynasty (hence the name).

What I love:
-The game is gorgeous, if even just to walk around and take screen shots and enjoy a relaxing experience.
-Being able to put down buildings and a layout for your village is always fun to anyone who enjoys city building games.
-The seasons, while short at only three days, are absolute transformations of the visual feel of the game and have a full range of affects on not only farming and exploring, but also what is growing and animal behavior.
-It is neat to take a tour of the trails on the map and see little hamlets (I don’t want to call them villages, as most are only a couple of houses).


Major issues going forward:
-The villages, or hamlets, are extremely small and there is almost no reason to visit any of them outside of a minor side-quest. In a game where the major “thing” it has going for it is the visual appeal, the existing hamlets looked phoned-in and unremarkable.
-The AI needs work, there are only a couple dialog options and they are pretty much set in stone. I personally don’t enjoy dialog heavy games, so this isn’t a deal breaker for me, but it is a major mechanic of the game.
-Map gets smaller with every hour as you realize that there are only about 7 little hamlets of only a couple houses and again, no real reason to visit them outside of a minor quest or buying an item you don’t want to craft.
-For me, the villagers don’t seem worth the hassle of having, they make more work than they contribute.

Minor issues (fine for an Alpha): 
-Audio isn’t worked out yet. On headphones (or with spatial sound) it sounds like people are walking beside you when you walk and it is off-putting. I just put the audio on a sound-bar behind the monitor so I don’t have the spatial awareness of footsteps (it isn’t counter-strike, you aren’t being snuck up on, except by soundless wolves).
-Animal behavior is unreasonably bad. Deer will walk into you, wolves make no noise as they run full speed next to you, the two bears on the map just hang out outside the save and will attack you if you get within 20 feet.
-Tree stumps won’t go away after chopping trees, making your village look like an open field after a WW1 standoff. I know that you can punch the tree stumps with your fists and they magically disappear, but they will come back the next day.
-Funny sitting of people in mid-air like witches.
-Will need to restart after killing animals, as you often cannot skin them, but they will disappear after restarting.
-The build areas aren’t consistent. There are areas that are perfectly flat for a building type, but you will still be told that the area isn’t flat.
-Animals don’t breed. Ironic for a game based on human breeding.
-Fishing isn’t working yet (the spear/gig) and I am not sure how they are going to incorporate that.

Recommendations (for what it is worth):
-Outside of opening the map, grow the hamlets a bit and put more effort into advancing them into villages, with at least one major town.
-Put some bad-guys in the game, or something to do other than chop wood.
-Horses and/or trade routes between the villages with carts.
-A sandbox mode to create a village and organize things. Look, making the villages is cool, but capitalize on the fact you have a very pretty game and people can build on it. Most folks aren’t going to want to spend 50 hours to chop down 1,000 trees just to build a few buildings with some log fences so they can take screen shots.
-A multiplayer map that only has a limited number of designated starting areas for players to build in and they can expand eventually. A map generator or open map modding would make this easier, let people break it on their own, or at least give them the option.
-A free building mode for individual buildings. Basically like ARK and any other building game (cough, RUST, cough) so I can make my own large building. I get that they might not serve a purpose, but again you have a game where people want to build col buildings and take pictures of them in the different seasons, capitalize on that.

ADD the fact you get to build and manage a settlement that you can build and maintain over those 10 generations then you see that there is almost unlimited playtime potential thus the length of the seasons becomes almost trivial.

If you like building / survival / crafting games I highly recommend!!!

Pros: 
Beautiful, jaw dropping
Music is really period for the time and is a great way to chill out after a long day of work
Great simulation of a medieval town, building from the ground up and finding villages to work for you.
Great User Interface
Interesting Story so far
Progression in the game is good, make you feel you earned everything crafted / built
Good bug fixes - squashed daily so far by the developer (THANK YOU / DANKE to the team)

Cons:
Needs some balancing, but expected from an early access
Bug fixes needed but the developers are very responsive and seem to care about making a quality game 

Overall: Highly Recommended from someone that doesnt like to give reviews. This is a game that brought me back to my childhood of wants to spend my life on a computer again. Thanks and no thanks to my family that will miss me ... LOL.

One of the biggest things I will point out that simply doesnt work/barely works. Is your settlers actually doing their jobs.

23,76287458,english,"I posted a negative review about this game around a week ago. Since then, the developers released seven (!) patches fixing most of the issues I had with the game. As such, I am now recommending it, with some minor caveats:

Finding a wife in this game is very annoying. You basically have to do a multiple choice test for ""flirting"". It is  **completely random** which of the three options will raise their affection. It seems to stay consistent during a day for every person, so someone that likes being called strong will continue to react positively to being called strong, but it changes from day to day! An option that worked on day will have a negative impact the very next one. Because of this I do not see how this can ever be done. I never managed to get Affection over 10% (presumably it has to reach 80-90), although I go and talk to these ladies every day.

In the end, I used cheat engine to fix their affection which solved this issue for me.

There is stamina in the game, and it sucks. Imagine Minecraft but you can mine only two blocks before having to wait 10 seconds to recover. Shooting an arrow, felling trees, building a house, all very quickly drains your stamina. In the end you just end up waiting a lot in between actions that are actually fun for your stamina to recover. This adds nothing to the game but frustration. I do not understand why it is there. Making a game harder by just forcing the player to waste time is not a good idea.

Progression. It seemingly takes forever to progress. Very quickly you will need 1000 points to get to the next level, and an action, like collection branches, gives you.. 3. This needs to be faster somehow. Especially since there are absolute must-haves like more stamina, more carrying capacity, etc. in it. For the most part the RPG elements in the game are very boring anyway, with most things just giving you a +x% faster xyz. You can fix this with cheat engine as well.",1600618363,1601057723,True,0,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True,76561198011351873,534,16,1571,654,916,1601145602,,

There are a few issues I have ran into however. One, in my playthrough, NPC's did not carry an inventory in their chests within their homes nor their workshops (when I have watched other playthroughs, NPC's carry some nice equipment, not to steal, just borrow *wink ). Another issue is the taxing system, not that the taxing system is broken, just that the taxing system is not explained. From what I understand, the more you build and the more citizens you have, the larger the tax which is fine. However, I just got super build happy with maybe 40 gold to my name in the first season and had to pay nearly 800 gold. I was literally crafting any tools I could in order to sell them to vendors to pay my taxes in time.

As to game play and feel. The games visual and gameplay aesthetic is very much a spiritual partner to KCD. Having exhausted the latter game for the time being, this is a much welcome element.

The quests work fine, and even the dialogues are feeling nice and understandable. But most dialogues next to these feel a bit different. The opportunities of saying things to a woman of your choice, to hopefully built up a family are random and sometimes make no sence. I'm playing the german game, and even if the dialogues are in german, all toturials aren't. Maybe it's because of that, but building my own dynasty has failed after almost two days of playing the game. But I think, that wasn't my fault. The mainreason, my citizens left me, was because they said, they'd need a warehouse for food, even if I built one and my in-game-wife was working there... That really was disappointing and made me delete my savegame, because a village makes no sence without citizens, which btw aren't able to do anything.

Animal of very different kinds behave authentic and look great! I was overwhelmed seeing the thick fur of a boar ingame. That really looked photorealistic!

Medieval Dynasty is a unique gaming experience, and when everything will work and seemed to be finished, it will be a real medieval simulation, without not so realistic farmkid-becomes-a-knight thing.

- Too little time is devoted to the seasons. For example, I have to walk around the world all day long and all night long and then I have chance to do something, knowing that a HORRIBLE winter will begin soon. I would like to have free time and look at the world without hurry.
- Weight for chests. I understand that the implementators wanted to prevent the action ""put everything in one"" with chest. But they could do sorting of items and the ability to add something else, designating it as unnecessary things.
- It would be great if flax like a flower could be cut in the wild, not just in planted fields.

23,76525694,english,"In Medieval Dynasty you start your story as a young, 18 year old, man fleeing war. You try to find your uncle in order to start over. Upon arriving to the village he was last known to be, you learn that he died a few years back. You are given a few tools and unrestricted access to the land in the area to build your farm and grow as long as you pay your taxes.

In this journey you will have to :
- Gather resources and food
- Build your house, village and tools.
- Food to feed your village.
- Make friends with neighbors and help them in times of need.
- Manage your house / farm

This alpha release is very promising by how smoothly it is running. The few bugs / glitches (that are corrected at an impressive rate) are in no way harmful to the gameplay. If you like this kind of gameplay and the medieval time period you are in for a treat ! 
Great work so far and can't wait to see more !

For the devs :
After 25+ hours here is my feedback on balance.

A few adjustments to balance might be needed like :
- selling / buying prices are not fair at all for the player. It is normal to buy a little more than what you sell but the factor right now is too big.
- Bears and Wysents are too easy to kill
- Make logs heavier but be able to craft more tools (spears, hammers, hoes etc) with one log.
- Following heavier logs : make initial building requirements lower (4-5) but cost more to build the individual parts. Buildings are build too fast.
- Seasonal missions should let you know what you'll need to bring (or more detailed) before accepting the quest. Because learning that you'll need to bring an iron tool when you can't gather it leaves only two options... pay a fortune to buy one (that is if you have the coin) or fail the mission. 
- Following on more quest information before accepting, make the dynasty reputation gain higher on completion on lost on failure. No more accepting quests you can't fulfill.

I have not read other feedback so I hope this was not too redundant. On top of that I did not find the bug / glitch report page or area. Got a few small ones that I could report.

An example of the economy balancing challenge is that the buying price for manure is crazy and seems to exceed the sale price for the wheat and or flour you can grow after paying for the manure and the wear and tear on the scythe and the land tax.  Hunting doesn't bring much cash to the table either, so it's hard to get anything happening.  You are better off gathering and selling sticks than you are hunting if you want to make money.

Other interesting feature is that you have to cook meat before you can put it out for your villagers, I haven't yet been able to work out if I can get someone to do that for me or if I an just supposed to do it.

I decided to watch minimal amount of guides and videos to figure this game out myself, and it's astonishing how easy it is to figure out, now of course it's easy to have a guide up where to find different animals, but almost every animal is easy to figure out due to missions, only one that CAN be hard, is bears until you are well far in, but shouldn't need to fight them either way with just an axe or Spears.

I can say, I was quite dissapointed when I found out how the tax mission by Uniegost(The second one), was hard to do and found out how buggy it was, hard to figure out another place with a wolf, and then there was this bug where I couldn't finish the task, cause it didn't register the citizens giving me their tax coins. However this bug was quickly resolved literally the day after, and I thought it wouldn't let me finish but it did, so I'm continuing onward.

TL/DR buy the game for a harsh life as a peasant trying to build a mercantile dynasty, it's fun!

The first year or two will be a lot of hard work as you build your house and try to set up basic survival things like a farm, hunting for meat, trapping, gathering berries and mushrooms to sell at the different villages to get enough coins to buy farming tools and seeds and building your reputation in the valley. Take it slowly and chill or work even at night if you wish so.

Around the second or third year you have recruited a few workers to help you around the village and your work load is getting lighter a bit. you can concentrate on questing, getting a wife and heir and building more amazing structures for your village. How big you can build it and how many villagers you can manage depends on your dynasty score (points from questing and storyline).

The game is awesome to be honest, the devs are very active and updates frequent. They are quick at patching bugs and have a roadmap for the rest of the year and 2021 also. For an alpha game it's very playable. Some people have complained that each season being represented by 3 days is short but you will have over 100 real time played hours (or so) until your heir can take over your positions as a village leader. That's a hell of a long time for a mercantile dynasty game!

89,76511271,english,"A frustrating experience, at the moment.
But it's doing what it says it does.

What kept me playing for twenty hours was the next goal, the next building, the next new tool or item that made things easier or opened up new areas of the game otherwise unexplored. There was something almost fun about walking half way across the games entire map 1250m away just to buy a pickaxe so I could collect iron, so I could build tools, so I could finally harvest grains with a scythe because I wasn't going to buy one of those, and could collect my own iron and make my own tools to also sell.

Unfortunately thats where the grind began to set in. You need a certain amount of experience points to get to that next goal. You have to then buy the plans to make things in that new building. Everything is expensive, but it gives you something else to spend money on aside from taxes. You pay taxes every year, which was neat. And made sense depending on how many buildings and people you have living with you (I think). Having to pay out 1150 in coin I had plenty of from selling scythes and salt. Diverging from that to complete quests which give +2 or +5 reputation to reach the next goal- Which was pretty much out of reach at this point. You'll need 1000 to get to 20 buildings and have more than 5 workers who eat and burn firewood at a reasonable pace. But there's no more large chunks of reputation to gain past the 550 mark. And there's only two or three quests per season. Oh, and half of those are bugged. So you end up gaining two reputation, and losing that two reputation on quests you can't complete. The nice +5 quests often require tools. Sometimes tools you don't have around or are capable of crafting yet. Like the Recurve Bow. 660 gold for a pat on the back and +5 reputation.

It continues to go downhill watching you workers refuse to work the last 5 plots on the farm for no reason what-so-ever. So much so that every post (at this time) on the forums is a question on how to solve this issue. (Dismiss everyone from the field worker job, at the barn, in the tab menu. Save game. Reload game. Assign everyone to the barn as a field worker. If they still don't want to work, Dismiss everyone, again. Save game. Exit game. Start game. Reload game. Assign everyone to the barn as the field worker. Get fed up and do it yourself.)
But these workers are useful. They harvest and do everything slower. It'll take them a whole season to do up an entire 10x10 (but crops magically spring up the next season regardless of this) but they use tools and manure and seeds... so long as you have them. However I never saw these numbers decline and manure is 10g per pile (really). So I kept these parasites around. Sent one out hunting, who only collects a total of about 15 leather and meat per year. And another on logging, who, everyday filled up his bank with logs and slowly dropped logs into storage. And you need all that to create an ecosystem among your workers. Food and firewood. Food and firewood. 

It's not very good at explaining certain things and you may find yourself looking for information on certain buildings and what exactly they do for the village. It's rather annoying to have to corral the villagers and assign jobs and cancel jobs and reload to get them to do jobs. It's a slog through reputation after the major story quest demands you reach 1000 reputation until the next milestone and quest rewards are awful and thats if they even work in the first place. It's got potatoes but no gravy. Yet.

I'm going to shelve it for now and see what happens next year. So I'll be back in 12 days.

95,76510254,english,"Short Review: If you don't mind unfinished Early Games with tons of potential, crafting, survival, city managing, hunger/thirst, then what are you waiting for? SINGLE PLAYER :D

Real Review: Ok so I finally have a wife and child, after about 20 hours, in this twenty hours I have made, 10 Buildings, convinced 4 people to join my town, have done about 12 quests in total, but a couple of them are the same, so it doesn't really count, this game is EARLY, but man does it have potential to be SPECIAL, the devs really care they've been updating this game like every other day, bugs are to be expected, however I myself have not encountered any game breaking bugs. The worst bug I have encountered is when (On rare occasions) I will get stuck on the doors of certain houses when sprinting through them, I still give my thumbs up on this game in support of the team behind it, That being said, a couple of things are in desperate need to be corrected/Updated.

Weight Limit: Currently the Weight Limit is to low considering how the game requires lots of building, It makes every house build, a quite tedious one, as you can only take certain amounts of material, otherwise you'd be slowed down. That being said, their are ways to increase it so maybe I'm not far enough, but as of now I'm only at 40KG in weight (You start at 35), this is not alot considering all the basic tools you need at all times will take up about 10-15 KG depending on what you use, this leaves you with not much to work with in the vein of heavy items (Logs,Rocks,Iron). 

Voice Acting/NPC's: Nitpicks as the game is very new, but new NPC's for some variety would be great, possible voice acting?? Ehhhh could take it or leave it.

Food: I can't stress this enough, I enjoy this game and will likely continue playing and watching it grow, but the food is slightly meh for me, hunting is already a bit bland considering the games combat is very inconsistent, at present it is much more beneficial to just keep projectile weapons, Bows, Pike, Wooden Spear are the best weapons, stabbing with the spears or any melee based weapons is inconsistent, alot of times I've seen it just wear down and break after stabbing a boar directly in front of it three times. But on top of that, while the game gives you a decent amount of meat for your hunting kills, roasted meat only restores 6?? Cabbage restores more!! It just seems low, I can get behind making stuff like Stew and Porridge, but especially early game, having to kill a deer for the first time and realizing the entire deer only gave you enough food to restore 24 out of 100 hunger?? Atleast you'll never die of thirst! THIRST IS PERFECT THE WAY IT IS< DON""T TOUCH IT, JUST ADD MORE CONTAINERS!! :D 

Multi-Player: I like to point people to THE FOREST game, Medieval Dynasty has some of those mechanics, and like THE FOREST, this game needs CO-OP, it is GREAT on single player, but for it to get even bigger, Co-OP is a must, imagine, You and up to 8 friends can all play on a giant open world map, creating your own villages, trading, helping one another, and at any point simply banding together and making a giant Kingdom, sounds marvelous. Then again this game is great single player as well, so I wouldn't mind if it was kept this way, the team already has a list of new updates, great game, great team, can't wait for the big content updates.

So, onto likes/don't likes...

- Like the Banished (Building) / Guild (Dynasty) / Kingdom Come (Atmosphere/Quests) vibe I get while playing.
- Like that building is an actual process and you do things in steps rather than all at once or instantly.
- Like that you can recruit NPCs to help you run your settlements.
- Love that you can have a family.
- Love that even on medium, the graphics are still dope AF.

There are, unfortunately, a few more dislikes at the moment.

-Do not like that NPCs aren't very alive. They walk around sometimes and look like they're interacting with each other, but walking into another village somehow still feels like you're entering a ghost town- especially when everyone is inside. You can go in their houses, but walking into a building with 2/3 NPCs just standing there doing nothing is... weirdly disturbing.
- Do not like that every time I level something up, I almost have a heart attack because the bloody celebration music is 10xs louder than it needs to be. Why is that even a thing? Every RPG-type game does it now, it's obnoxious.
- Do not like that things aren't dynamic. Like the storage shed, why is there no visual representation of resources in there? It's so empty and lame.
- Do not like... no, hate. HATE that you're a pre-determined character. I know there's a story, but it's so generic that you could be anyone, but no, I gotta be this knobby looking tool from the single cutscene in the game.
- Hate the dialogue. It's generic and repetitive, and I'd actually like to know the people I'm going to be asking to live with me. 
- And I absolutely despise the head bobbing. I'm not as sensitive to it as others, but it still gives me a headache. I can't play games with a headache, devs.

Anyway... for EA, it's not bad and I'm sure some, if not all of my problems with it will change/disappear in future, so I'm recommending it, mainly because it's one of the few survival games that didn't make me think of the 9381717648 other survival games like it.

18,76310532,english,"This game will be mostly interesting for players who like Long Dark, Don't Starve etc. It has potential but I cannot recommend it at the current state. I've tried it for 2 hours and requested a refund. Problem is, there are quite a lot of games which have potential but it literally takes years for them to get anywhere. Therefore, I'm worried Medieval Dynasty might follow Long Dark's fate which was in beta for 2 years, and now 4 years since the official release (!!!) the game is not even close to being finished. I still might purchase MD some time though. Time shall tell.

So, the idea of creating your own village and build a dynasty is great but after playing for 1.5 hours I just had no desire to carry on. Some issues I've noticed:

* Very annoying hunting. Your spear keeps breaking after 2 hits and you are running after some motherfucking doe for 10 minutes. For example, I managed to throw a spear right in the doe's neck and guess what: he kept running away with a spear in his fucking neck. This lasted for maybe 5-7 minutes. The hero can't hit properly as well. This whole process seems very tedious; it's more like a bug hunt, not a proper hunt. And you'll need loads of meat to keep going therefore this bug festival will carry on and on forever. Another issue is that you get very low amount of meat even from a buck or doe: 7 pieces or something around that. Is that enough? Not really. You'll eat all 7 pieces in one go most likely, this won't even be enough for a single day. I'm not sure what the devs are thinking but in reality killing a buck means lots of meat...

* Interacting with NPCs is supposed to be quite important because you'll need to find a wife and newcomers to your village. Basically, this mechanic was supposed to be one of the main selling points of the game because otherwise it's just yet another survival thing. Problem is, the interaction is non-existent. You can choose from two possible phrases to say. The overall selection of these phrases is abysmal: ""the weather is good"", ""I've worked hard all day"", ""how are you"", ""how's work"", ""have you seen some rich motherfucker riding by"". The NPC will randomly like or dislike the chosen phrase and you basically have no clue of what to choose. Mind you, reputation is very important to attract settlers. Also, it seems like 95% of women are already married. I don't know, maybe you should marry a doe or something.

* Tutorials are non-existent which means you'll spend lots of time trying to figure out how to do basic things. Or, well, you may try googling or reading forums. In any case, this is quite annoying.

* There's virtually no voice acting and it somewhat ruins the immersion. Seems like you're talking to a wall picking one of the dialog options

* Lots of walking. No horses, nothing like that. Quite boring.

* All chests have no loot. They are just empty, there's nothing inside.

* I did not have any sense of exploration. There's a forest, a river, and a village. Then, there's yet another forest and yet another village. There are 10-15 buggers living in each village but they don't do anything interesting.

* Each season lasts for 3 days. Idk how are you supposed to achieve anything with such strict limits. It just feels very rushed. I mean, you need at least some time to explore the world and decide where to build your house, but then suddenly it's already the middle of the summer. And you'll need to prepare for the coming winter somehow.

* The graphics is somewhat dated but that's the most minor problem for me.

So, to summarize the game feels quite generic so far. It can achieve great success but god knows how much time that'll take.",1600653883,1600991852,False,19,2,0.677771687507629395,0,True,False,True,76561197996725585,40,10,119,0,119,1600560088,,

Edit: BUGS and unbalanced values. 

After 36 hours of game time I found some issues:
Unbalanced resources points (3 meat for a dear/ 4 meat for a huge buffolo)
Huge tree produces 4 logs and small tree 3 logs
Very hard to obtain Iron for tools, very few caves and very far away considering a very small inventory space (mule skill included – 40 kg max)
We need a way of transporting huge amounts of logs, stones, salt and Iron, something like a cart or a wagon or something
A horse for the player would be nice.
Please fix the amount o money the NPC villages have and rebalance the values for items, I buy a Scythe for 600 and my own craft sells for 110, that is hugely unbalanced considering a single cow or pig is 5000 coins, a chicken or a duck 2000.
We need more clay deposits and limestone to upgrade.
NPC are working extremely slow even if the get assigned to their max skill profession.
The time is passing very fast, barely keep up with the crops and wood necessities.
The tools should not break so easily, especially the IRON ones.
The dynasty POINTS should be erased…or should be offered more easily, like for commerce or payed taxes…because once you lose some it is impossible to regain them fast enough, and under 340 you cant recruit more villagers.

I understand it is an early access, but if the developers try to fix these unbalanced values this game may become hugely played…and only imagine the fun on multiplayer (if that would ever become an option).",1600546625,1600990292,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True,76561199051278083,3,1,4772,2608,2443,1601939669,,

22,76506354,english,"First off, this game has been released for a week and is still in Early Access. In that time, it has been patched and hotfixed almost daily (which shows a care and desire to continue this product). This game really feels like a cross between Subsistence and Banished (which is a good thing, and a great theory). The graphics are amazing and it really grabs that medieval feel.

For any game this young in it's development, it's going to have a huge con of ""not a lot of stuff"". Sadly, I feel this game does suffer from that, but not in the text of what you can build. Where I feel it lacks the most is quests/tasks and diplomacy. The diplomacy is very rough, in that you get two choices of speech, then what seems to be an RNG to determine if they go + / - without any clue about the person. Unfortunately, diplomacy is a very needed and required system for the game in gaining a spouse or people to move to your village. The only other really major con is the storage system. The player has a very small amount they can carry, and a house has a similar size of storage. You also, currently, cannot build more chests or storage without building new buildings. This does not permit you to gather a lot of resources for later. Also, the economic system is vastly skewed, but that's more of a gameplay/balancing issue that I'm sure will be addressed soon.

I mentioned a few pros at the beginning (theory, theme/feel, graphics, continual improvement). The game is easy to get started in to, without a real push or rush. Early going, it's rather easy to keep in food and make a small amount of coin. It also means you get time to learn and develop an understanding of the game. The game is only as tedious as you want to make it. These are always good points, for me, in a game like this.

So i'm going to give my cons first then go into pros.
Cons:
1. The randomness of the selection of people you can recruit and flirt with can be really bad or really good. For example: On one restart in the starting town there was only a 24 year old i couldn't flirt with and no one to recruit. Yet when i restarted again i got a 21 year old that you can flirt with but no one to recruit to the town.
2. The seasons are way too short. Every 3 sleeps its another season IF it was at 4 or 5 days i think it would be far better.
3.  There isn't enough animals wandering around such as rabbits. i had a quest to kill 7 rabbits. i wandered around the area where i got the quest i never saw even one rabbit. i went back to where i placed my house i saw 1 rabbit and it wasn't the rabbit that you find in the trap the tutorial asks you to place down.
4. The chat needs to have more options rather than those available. For example: i had a weather comment when it was raining and the other option was even worse. The flirt chat options needs more as well. 

Pros: 
1. Great music
2. a good skill/technology system though i will say that there needs to be other things you can build that aids in certain areas.
3. Building system is easy and not too clunky. I will add that the ramp that pops up after you place it needs to be shown when your trying to place it.",1600982662,1600982662,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True,76561197986533088,445,26,969,1,969,1601150948,,

If they add configurable season times, a better conversation system, and boost performance, it would be a 7 or 8 / 10 for me. The developers have commented on configurable season times, but it's a resounding ""maybe"". They need to commit to adding this feature.

For now, save your money and wait and see.

Optimistically looking forward to changing this review.

58,76500333,english,"This is the survival game I have been searching for, for a long time. So some pros and cons:

Pros:
Survival, building, management game(not many of these and so few are actually good, this one is good)
Not a survival game based on the zombie apocalypse(over used story, very bland, people are sick of it)
Food, water, stamina, and cleanliness status', eating, bathing and keeping hydrated actually matter. (it would not be a survival game without these features)
Relationships, Family and death mechanics(you can sweet talk the ladies and make babies, so when you die you can become your child)
Temperature mechanics (you are not immune to the cold or the heat, gotta make or buy clothing to stay alive.)
Seasons ( all 4 seasons spring,summer,fall and winter. lasting 3 in game days each, with specific vegetation only available to plant and farm each season as well as what plants and other materials you can get.)
Recruiting NPC's that help you maintain your village. (you can have them do most things for you, collect wood/hunt/farm/mind ect.)
Animal husbandry and a deep farming experience.
The game is very engaging. It will have you needing one thing or another and keep you busy.
Quests, NPC's you cannot recruit have quests.

Cons:

Days are short, you have so much to do but have not nearly enough time to do much.
Carry weight is only 35lb you become burdened quite fast and it is annoying.
The crafting system is okay, but not really fun.(would be nice if they added mini games for cooking, crafting to make it a bit more immersive) It is just enter table select thing to craft and wait for it to craft.
Skill tree and technology, just lacks in benefits for the grind you have to do to get levels in skills.
Building is not sandbox, structures are prefabricated and leave me wanting more control over how my medieval village should look.
Some buildings require you to have more materials then you can carry(carry weight) to start construction.(very frustrating)
Lacks good building locations and the uneven ground limitation makes it hell to plan out your town.
Seasons are too short. (3 in game days per season, and the days are not very long either.)
Iron tool durability seems much the same as stone.(currently anyways, may change)
Needs more environments. Including some exploring aspect, better and more interesting caves maybe?
Needs more wildlife.(fairly new game so there is probably more in the works)

Will add more pros and cons as the game updates.

Pros:
Road map!
Daily hotfixes.
Communication.
Incredible graphics.
Excellent music (hoping for more tracks down the road as they can get a little repetitious very fast).
Vibrant atmospheric sounds.
Skills/professions, recruiting and town building.
It has an overall very nice feel to it and very well polished for being in EA

Cons: 
I won't go into the obvious things that will eventually, hopefully, be smoothed out (see below).
Minor bugs. I haven't come across any game breaking bugs yet. 
AI Pathing. I've recruited some followers but they don't ""fast travel"" to your town, they literally walk from whichever town they were recruited from. This is perfectly fine and lore friendly, but they don't actually ""move"" unless you're in the general vicinity OR it switches seasons and that now makes them appear. 
No surround sound? It could be my sound system and headset, but I can't hear animals either chasing or just running behind me

Minor annoyances:
The game does feel very fast paced at the moment. Which is also understandable as you're taking on all the tasks that your villagers will eventually help with and trying to generate some income and build all at the same time, but there's gotta be more than 3 days per season. Please..
Transportation? The road map already mentions ""riding"" so I'm hoping that addresses this minor inconvenience. 
Lack of variety in the lines for the casual conversations.

Day/season length is too short.  either the season needs to be 5 days, or the length of an actual day needs to be longer.

having a huge problem with the dialogue choices to get people recruited to my village.  most times, there are only two choices that the NPC hates equally.  

a haggle system is desperately needed.  having to pay 100 then only be able to sell for 20 is depressing at times.  the more you talk and do business with vendors should get you a little bie better pricing and approval rates should go up a little.

just a basic take.

27,76490119,english,"A brilliant game. Well put together for being an Early Access game. Heck - more developed as an Early Access game than other games that have been in EA for 5 years now.

But digressing, this game is pretty amazing and the developers are putting out an update to squash bugs every day so far, and even updating us two times a day some days. The graphics are great; thing a blend between KCD and Green Hell with building mechanics similar to The Forest and Green Hell. I mean, what more could you ask for? It's kind of like a more realistic Skyrim, set in a real era within our medieval ages - but you can build your own!

The controls are phenomenal and movement/animations are smooth. There's no clunkiness here.

The sound is alright. There is a gap here - because some animal sounds are great (foxes), some seem poorly recorded (bears), but in the end of the wintery nights - you can hear your (and others) beautiful foot prints as they crunch the snow under them (beautifully).

As for mechanics... The game has a lot in it already, such as a very fair number of buildings you can build for your settlement. Everything you'd need to start off with. But but but... There could be more buildings, and buildings could do more. There are a lot of Work In Progresses, where many of the unlockable perks (more on this later) and buildings that can take workers - but some of the buildings are ""broken"" and have no bonuses from having a worker in them. For example, the tavern can have a worker but they will only cook and not raise morale or generate revenue. There are no inn's, although the worker you would assign to a tavern is called an ""inkeeper"" - so if you travel to other towns and it becomes night time, there's no where you can ""rent for a night"" or stay at. There are some things that should be added on here at a later date such as bandits (confirmed), and better diplomacy between your settlement and other factions (which could lead to building a garrison or unlocking more features at taverns for state buildings).

As for perks... There are a ton of perks in the game, and an extra layer of perks called ""technology"" where after doing something so many times you can learn a tier of technology where you have to purchase the blueprints. The blueprints can be anything from a shovel to being able to craft full woolen outfits and sell them at a huge profit. The only thing I would like changed with the perks is that most perks have to deal with ""speeding up 'activity' by '%'"". I'd rather the perks make you better at any activity so you'd get more out of it (harvesting more resources instead of just harvesting the same amount faster) - or maybe a high crafting skill could craft double of the same item or maybe require less resources instead of just crafting the same 1 item a little faster.

Finally - NPC's, there are NPC's in the game, and you can talk to every one of them. Some of them (generally the NPC's by the fire in each town) can be recruited to your settlement after acquiring enough reputation and friendliness with them. But other than talking to NPC's to raise friendship or romance, there's not much else. And right now - every dialogue choice is 40-60 that you'll be given choices that will only hurt your reputation. Most players have resorted to having to quick save and quick load because trying to raise reputation is so finicky. There are quests that 2-3 people will have for you in each town, and you can get generated quests from your own citizens to help them out, but as for main story lines - there's kind of 2; a tutorial story line teaching you basics about building your settlement, and dealing with the governmental figure in the region. They're not bad though.

Better balance is (obviously) required. 

Economy - currently, I could have spent all my time gathering basic resources and selling and still make a lot more money than I did doing various crafting & cooking advanced meals, etc. 

Transportation - abused an obvious bug that you get teleported to your home between seasons, so I mined entire cave for 1500 kg of rocks, salt and iron and got teleported. Instead, increasing weight capacity when riding or developing a cart for transportation would be a great solution

World - bandits, etc are required. Also, too ez killing animals while finding them becomes a bit routine

Village - they are probably 100 times less productive than you, but consume firewood and food without any shame. If it is a management game as well, it has to become more real, I guess.

A couple of other points;
1) Trading - Currently the value of items are the same in each settlement. If the prices fluctuated between settlements then it would help players to travel around more when trading. This would help with questing/tasks. You could also focus just on trading (setting up a trading system) to make your fortunes if that is what you prefer to do.

91,76471662,english,"I have to say this game is a typ of game I have been waiting for, for ages now. I always wanted a first person medieval game where I can do quests and build my own town/farm/village. The amount of options in this game are insane, but we all know that we want to build a huge village and take over the valley. Our new home. 

Pro:
- This game looks great, build on the unreal engine no wonder. 
- The story build up on your first character is great. You have a goal for this game and it is not just the main story. 
- You can choose to do some surviving for the beginning years, gain knowledge and reputation by doing the side quests and more. Earn some money before starting your camp/farm/village. Or you can just hit it and start building your village straight away.
- The map does not look empty or boring. Each season has its own look and a lot of plants, growing trees and much more. Animals are always around you, you hear the small ones running away or midnight a wolf hauling for you before he jumps you and you start running away.
- The balance of daytime, nighttime and days in a season is well done. You do not have the feeling to be getting bored or running around for ages till the next season, but you also do not have the feeling of getting into a rush.
- Villagers actually work and you can see the progress of your fields.

Con:
- Sadly the villagers do not bring the gathered and earned stuff into the chests of the working stations. They put it straight into the storage. Would wish if they would bring it in the work station and the worker of the storage would start running from building to building to gather it from there. Maybe with a visual that shows how filled up a storage or workspace is. 
- The music is missing a bit of a mix and it sounds like there is only one or two songs. Would be nice if there where way more medieval songs in the background.
- Sidequests sometimes are the same, missing a bit of choice. But they are just sidequests.
- Villagers do not care if your getting attacked by any kind of animal, they just watch it happen.

I actually am to fanboy to complain about other things, in total the game is well balanced and if you think about how to solve problems there are non. Time is not to short, you just need villagers. Game is not to few, just have to be a good hunter. 
They are bringing in riding on horses and carts in near future, new events and a lot of content. 
Soon there will be bandits to fight against and who knows what else, maybe at some point a bigger map, small wars and others. 

This game is gem for every early medieval fan with the wish to create his or her own village/farm. And wanting a Kingdom Come with your own home to build up.

95,76473826,english,"So far after playing over 20 hours I think I have a decent impression of the game so far. I usually don't write reviews for games, but this game is worth the effort of writing one.

Basically you play as a simple peasant trying to make their life in the middle ages. You build your house, and later can even get your own village with peasants. Right now it's still in early access, which is very noticable. Keep in mind, all comments I make may change when devs progress further.

Pros:
- It's relaxing, the most stressful part is when you get sneak attacked by a wolf, but you can run away and survive
- In depth systems in development, crafting systems are very broad.
- Graphics are good enough that it's quite pleasant to play.
- I quite like the soundtrack, it suits the game

Cons (mostly due to early access):
- Currently balance is virtually non existent. The best way to earn money is to gather random herbs in the forest. Making gloves requires 20 leather (about 8-10 deer worth of leather) but sell for absolutely nothing.
- Poor in-game explanation of some systems. E.g. you can have a storage house, where a villager can work. But no explanation of what they do there.
- Frustrating to recruit villagers. Certain villagers will like certain questions/statements. But you will just have to arbitrarily remember what.
- So far not really challenging. Food is easy to come by, seasons (winter in particular) doesn't really pose much a challenge.

Overall I would recommend this game, it is worth the price (I maintain a rule of 1$ paid should equal at least 1 hour gameplay).

Night missions (side mission) hunting animals (Wolfs, Boars) are too few (they roughly spawn 2 at a time) and I have to find 7 which is very hard and all that work leads to 2 dynasty points? I'm stuck on 448 I have to get to 1k before I unlock the next mission and can progress.

There is too much of a gap between dynasty and I understand it takes time to build up but I have the perk on that gives you 40% extra dynasty points and that doesn't even WORK!

good effort but for time being i'm thinking of putting the game down so you can iron out a few of these grinds as a new player it upsets me but I understand its early access and these things take time.

see you have been active with ""patches"" which is a good sign.

Overall the game is decent a few tweaks here and there to allow the hardcore players to be rewarded more instead of just chopping trees and running around constantly talking to people to get my skill stat up is driving me crazy.. Maybe add a barter option where you could gain extra skill points and actually fix the whole 40% extra dynasty points form completing side quests.

Upon purchase I thought I could build my own kingdom and I do hope the developers have that in the future of the game. The interaction are simple and annoying, while using the same chat tree a million times. Not enough random or unique NPC's. The selling system is broke and unbalanced. I call this game the stick collector sim because I spend most of time collecting sticks to sell. I spent all day hunting to get enough leather to build gloves, paid 200 gold to get the right to build gloves, and I can only sell the gloves for 35 gold. Why bother with all that just collect 35 sticks in no time for the same money. It should reward items based on quality not just a set number, so the store system is broke. Like the interactions with quests although I have found some not allow you to turn in to get the reward. I also wish I could create my guy at the start, make it more RPG style in order to give my guy some sort of direction because you start with nothing and knowing nothing. The tech tree is also somewhat unbalanced. I have to do something enough times to earn the right to build that item and than I have to spend gold (more sticks) to buy the right to build that item however I magically know how to build the building that allows to make such items. Doesn't make sense to me at all. 

With all that bad you think I am bashing the game however I am not at all. It was well worth my money and I have spent 17 hours and plan to spend many more. Who can be entertained for under a dollar an hour? The games idea and setting I love. I made a mistake and build my town on one side of the map so I spend an entire day traveling to the far other side of the map. Things I learned if I decide to start over I guess. I have yet to have a kid however the game seems to be pushing me in that direction. My wife however spends more time at her parents place than mine as every morning she leaves me and than comes back at night, feels like real life marriage I think. ;) I added a couple people to my town/farm and assigned them jobs however they seem worthless and look busy but I see no results and unsure why it is important to grow your town if you still have to do everything yourself. As you can tell I am into this game which is a good thing as it shows you should also buy it and support this team. The graphics are good, the animations are okay and concept is great. Just needs some more in depth RPG elements, balance, better NPC's and bugs fixed. Other than that the game is on the right track.

Some pros:

-Graphics

-Over all look of the environment, in terms of the time

-I like how the quests keep you driven to progress

-Length of seasons. A lot of people complain about this, but if they were any longer they would be complaining much more. There are a multitude of different events that take place (mostly environment wise), that you would be waiting for, excessively, if the seasons were longer. 

Some cons:

-The AI is not very intelligent at all, that goes for all AI. 

-The conversations are repetitive and nothing short of boring. I loathe any interaction with the NPCs which really takes away from this games ability to suck you in. You really feel alone (I realize you are playing a single player game), the fact that its all written dialogue does not help with this. 

-The routines of the NPCs is essentially non-existent.

-There appears to be nothing you can't take down with just a few spears - this is highly discouraging. I spent a fair amount of time preparing for my first bear encounter, only to take down two effortlessly. Where is the incentive to make more advanced weaponry? 

-I feel like some of the stuff that should be easy is hard, and the some of the stuff that should be hard is easy. For instance, I can take two bears down with no effort at all, but if I want to make some basic leather gloves I need to spend 20-30 mins collecting the supplies. 

I realize that this review may be misinterpreted as a negative one, but honestly, it's not. This game has some SERIOUS potential to be great, and I feel like it wouldn't take too much to get it there. If they can find a way to make it more engaging and really make the environment come alive, this would be a must have. 

In conclusion, with the ultimatum being ""Do you recommend this game?"", I can't in it's current state. If it were for a lesser amount - maybe. However, if you want to help put up the funding to potentially make a great game happen, I HIGHLY encourage you to do so!

22,76464881,english,"Pros -
Eating/Drinking a reasonable amount, instead of 90 times a day like other games. 
Good progression system. You always feel like you're accomplishing something.
Very polished for a game at this stage. I have not had a single crash yet and very few/minor bugs. 
Sounds great, the music is well done. 
Good graphics. 
Huge map. 

Cons-
No Co Op. The biggest thing this game is missing. Nothing fancy would be required, just a friend or two being able to build and hunt with you.

26,76464142,english,"Let me just point this out before I get into my review. I am not a fan of RPG games nor survival games. My time playing games like The Forest should be evident of that but this game, this masterpiece is something different.

Never have I been able to play a RPG game. I don't see much to them. Yes, I see you looking at my time spent playing Mount and Blade and let me just tell you about 90% of that is for the multiplayer games of Napoleonic Wars. That being said when I saw Medieval Dynasty I was drawn to its concept. Live, marry, have an heir, die, repeat. On paper it doesn't sound like much but when you start playing this game, man does it feel like something else.

Upon loading in the forest in which you start, I am blown away by the beauty of Unreal Engine. With the ambient noises in the back round I feel like this forest is alive. Upon entering the town, I meet the village leader and he tells you what to do. ""Build house, supplies can be scavanged -oh and here's your Uncle's hammer, he won't be needing it anymore."" I do exactly what he tells me, I gather the supplies and find the perfect spot to begin my life. On the hill in which the forest you start in sits. I build my house and quickly break my Uncle's hammer, shoot gonna have to make a new one. I go to the crafting menu and see to make one its a couple sticks and log. ""Oh that's easy"" I say to myself as I go chop down another tree with an axe that will break in half if I just breath in its general direction.

I know I can marry and I do just that marry a nice woman in the town I first ventured to. Oh I can have her help me do things, oh sure let me just assign you to my tailor hut-

*NO FOOD, FOOD RESOURCE BUILDING NEEDED*

Okay let me just-

*MOOD DROPS TO 10%*

Okay its done please be-

*NO WOOD, BUILD RESOURCE BUILDING*

FFFFFFUUUUUUUUUU-

*save scum*

Okay I've built everything you needed, I even spent the last of my money on seeds to grow our food. So, how about that heir that I need so very badly?
.
.
.
Still working on that one, maybe my save is broken as my wife hasn't moved in with me and my game is telling me that I can still marry. Maybe I'm just brain dead who the hell knows.

After playing over 18 hours of the game I can say with full confidence is that this game is going to be a hit. When I started playing I was just in this world where I existed in this game that it was me roaming the streets of a small medieval village. Honestly even with the game being an early access game, the devs are hard at work making this game the best it can be. I've recommended this game to a couple of my friends and they all bought it and told me they enjoy this game. There is just something about this game that it just speaks to a niche market of players and oh boy does it talk.

Overall I give this game a solid 8/10. Not too buggy, AI is a pain the rear, building can be rough at time, but the core gameplay is outstanding.

Progression can be a little slow and there is no way to adjust your game setting to allow for faster learning or other modifiers which would be great to have.

Independent storage would be nice to have as chests get full very quickly and you need to build new places to have more which is limited until you skill up the respective trees.

I think the game has a huge amount of potential and while its early days, the new patches and updates have been flying in making it better and better. 

If modifiers were added or even the ability to customize your game world then it would be a huge step forward.

38,76461489,english,"The game includes typical systems found in a first-person survival game such as hunger/thirst, stamina-based actions, gathering/crafting/building, and even a few modest skill and tech-trees. What makes Medieval Dynasty unique is its inclusion of family and community systems. 

Before you start leading a community, your first order of business is to build yourself a house; ideally, somewhere flat so you can expand from this one house to a small camp, and eventually a town. While it is a survival game, it's not quite completely a sandbox. You will have to do quests for various NPCs. There are Main quests, side quests, and even challenges that can earn you Dynasty Reputation, a resource in Medieval Dynasty's community system. This is an indicator of how well-renown your dynasty is and will also be a factor that limits how big your settlement can be and which NPCs you can recruit to your camp. Recruiting NPCs will eventually be required to expand as the game seems to be balanced around not being able to do 100% yourself, at least not efficiently. While this system definitely shows promise and is a big factor of what would make MD stand out, the system itself needs work. As mentioned earlier, recruiting new people requires you to have a certain amount of Dynasty Rep., something that can only be obtained (at least to my awareness) by completing quests. There are only a few quests and seem to be seasonal. This means unless you really rush doing them from the start, you're unlikely to have enough to recruit anyone before the winter and once you do have NPCs recruited, they seem... slow. The AI for the NPCs display how Early Access this game is. I recruited an NPC that supposedly had a high gathering skill and he gathered... 2 trees in one day. That's barely two walls worth of wood and something that will take the player less than 5 minutes. Is it a dealbreaker? For some, maybe. For others, watching the dumb AI might be entertaining (idk, you do you). It does give me a glimpse of the potential this system has. It's like if Mount and Blade allowed you to do more granular town and resource management, actually building each building and/or watching your people gather the resource and build it. 

In this journey, you're also allowed to woo some of the 18-20+ year old women around the various small camps and towns in the moderately-sized map. The conversations are generic across all non-quest NPCs and you'll find that the same conversation line that works positively on one NPC may bring the opposite reaction to a different NPC. Through repeated conversation, you can eventually ask one woman for her hand in marriage then bam she lives with you and you can get a kid. I haven't explored this family system as much as the community bit so won't be able to review it as much. 

Other systems that aren't quite unique but worth mentioning: the game does have a currency but I don't think there's a live economy yet. The prices don't seem to change based on supply/demand and NPC gold resets every now and then. Combat is typical of a survival game in early access: Clunky with a mix of funny/weird/slow actions. Skill and tech-tree could use rebalancing as it seems a little too slow at the moment. Seasons are prohibitively fast: between questing, relationship-building, gathering, construction-building, and surviving, time moves too fast to realistically do everything in a ""year"". Whether that's the intention or not is unclear. What is clear is that this makes the game almost feel like a chore as there's not a lot of time to explore. The way I think about this is with Stardew Valley, you needed to plan ahead, but you still had time to do other things between all the farming. With this, you need to be constantly doing the right thing to be in a good position by Winter (small community + family + a few essential buildings + food + warmth). Definitely needs balancing on this front as well. 

Overall though, the game is worth exploring, imho. If you temper expectations to really just see the family/dynasty system in its infancy, I'd say it's worth a 12-30 hours worth of game right now. Whether that much game-time is worth the price is up to you.

52,76195379,english,"Positive Review to Negative: Here's Why..


This game isn't what you think or hope for.

After a good few hours more, I've come to realise a bit too late. This game has no current end-game nor does it reward your progress. From start to finish, its just the same continuous trog-along style that doesn't feel like youre actually achieving anything. Its hunting provides no valid progression beyond 2 quests and building a village is almost useless as at the end of it, youre not going to get very far. You'll chop down tree after tree until you need to go further and further away, if you find a large clear opening, you have to travel a fair distance overburdened for some time unless to run back and forth with tiny amounts of logs and sticks. Theres nothing in chests, besides 1 chest ive found in the entire game and from the sounds of it, youre not even intended to steal things as I believe the purpose of that 1 chest is to act as a placeholder for villager inventories as children age and such, the chest acts as a spawn holder for their item of use. However, this can be abused as since it regenerates every season (which are 3 days long), you can infinitely obtain money - (but dont tell the devs I know that). 

I was very skeptical of this game and honestly, I think my thoughts were placed correctly. The devs already have 2 games pre-planned upcoming and showcased a VERY basic roadmap. They have no plans for mod support. No plans for coop/multi, no intensive combat or armour/weapon plans (yes, they literally dont plan for armour from their own Q&A in a Medieval game). 

This game is looking to be the farming sim of medieval - - - remind yourself, what games tried that? Remember those games? Yeah... where are they now..... Theyre dead and some even got outed as scams (not implying this is, just that this game is not aimed to have a valid life cycle and is pre determined - in early access - by the devs to be dropped).

This game, honestly had high hopes for me. However, with developers already pre-planning the game's death - I cannot recommend this anymore as it is not going to be worth in the long run and is ultimately a game that will be wasted potential. 

Rest of review is a few hours into the game and first impressions..

(you may criticise me for my stance on this as potentially being dumb, however any company with 2 titled preplanned for 2021 while giving a roadmap into the start of Q1 2021 for a game they released in Q4 2020... you'd be dumb to not question the extent of their plans for this title - I want this game to be the better kingdom come like the next person - however this is not it. They do not intend nor aim for anything even close to such, this is a builder/survival sim with no genuine combat focus as by their own Q&A by stating they dont intend weapons and armour - unless youre gonna fight with bows and hammers...)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It's Good.

If they add Multiplayer, Servers even - Coop... OOFT, it'd be great. AI is a little iffy and I honestly feel there should be more combat as combat is like minimal to almost non existent besides agro'd animals (boars, foxes, bears very rare seemingly). 

Addition of workshop or dev kit would be *INSANE* and generally would fast-track this game development 10 times over. 
It is worth the funds and generally, I feel deserves alot more focus and support from devs as I notice they have projects upcoming for next year and such which makes the question - how long will this game be supported....",1600471687,1600910916,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True,76561198298572620,129,12,740,0,740,1600555799,,

I really wanted to like this game. This game is nothing like any other management game on steam. Its a refreshing, cool and relaxing take on a dynasty/open world genre.  You are a lone dude that slowly builds up his stock in life. Get married have heirs and keep the family business going. But geez the bugs are bad and the community is really toxic. 

The three day season thing is preference. I don't care where they take that but apparently that's what everyone cares about even when there are the following bugs:

1. Your farms disappear when you reload your save or an update happened. No warnings in the dev plan. I spent hours setting up an epic farm that would have set my family up for years.. only to reload and now its all gone. that was literally hours wasted and a gaaaah moment. 

2. Your stored inventory disappears. Spend a season getting ready for winter and all your firewood is gone when you come back the next day.... really hits you hard. 

3. Quests do not work.  Besides the main quest, I have only had two side quests spawn. One I failed apparently (needed to give some dude some cash) because I do not know why and the quest log did not specify there was expiration date or terms... 

4. Reloaded my save, and FBS drop like crazy. Its unplayable now. When I start a new game its fine. Rinse and repeat... sounds fun right? 

Conclusion

The game has potential, but the devs need to fix it and the community needs to improve. I will alter my review if the above items are fixed.  Don't really have hope for the community as people are just people after all but hopefully the devs can fix it so I don't have to keep going to the toxic community for ""help"". Yes I know its early access... 

Thank you for taking the time to read and stay safe out there.

It should be precisely the sort of game that I'm looking for right now, but unfortunately falls short due to some highly irritating mechanics.

The structure building works well enough, and it is relatively easy to figure out the gathering/crafting/farming loop, especially with the simple main quest guidance that the game throws at you. NPCs are plain, all similar looking, but do the job. The irritation comes in the form of the 'seasons' mechanic which while on paper looks reasonable, breaks much of the rest of the game.

Every three days, on the dot, the seasons advance. And not in a 'ooh look the leaves are changing color' subtle way, but in an EVERYTHING STOP! fade-to-black that breaks any side quests even if you picked them up that day, half spoils any meat you are carrying (no matter when you hunted it), and throws you back to your bed even if you were exploring across the map. This mechanic is such an unpleasant jarring departure from the flow of the rest of the game that I have to wonder how it ever made it in.

Edit 24/09/2020 after about a week.
This game has so many things happening within it.  Side quests galore and impossible to reach all at the same time.  choices choices choices!
Each time I die, I learn something different.  Ok on to pros and cons:

Pros:
Very big land to explore!  Almost limitless potential
Plenty of towns to do stuff in
Plenty of ways to die!  Keeps you on your toes and guessing
Crafting crafting crafting!
Romance!
The dev team updates the game regularly.  The small amounts of bugs I have encountered are not game crashing ones and a quick save and reload fixed them so far.  But it seems the dev team really cares abouts this game and has updated the game constantly!  I love that about a dev team.  It shows they care about his game and it is a passion project as opposed to a big AAA title that is designed to be a cash grab.  Will this continue?  Time will tell!
Cons:
No fast travel.
Very short seasons!  Only 3 days and its another season? Can we have at least 5 days or the ability to adjust how long a day is like in 7 days to die?
Despite the number of towns, they don't feel lived in.  There is not many people in the biggest town at all.  Its less than 10 houses of people.  Maybe its a system limit or something but the world doesn't feel lived in.  Travelling merchants would be nice.
The menus don't provide much info on what to do and what is going on.  The in-game info needs more details.

68,76453982,english,"Alright to sum it up, this game is very enjoyable with even greater potential - which they are fulfilling.

Now for a more in depth review:

Pros:

1) Graphics are excellent
2) Story plot - developing still but already enjoyable
3) Playability is there. If you want to go build a house or even a village but don't want to go out and do it IRL, this is the perfect alternative.
4) Medieval setting with continuation through your lineage, so awesome. I had this idea once for a game but you actually put it into play, thank you!

Room for improvement:

1) The game is still in development so there are some minor bugs (the quest where you talk to the lady that needs meat can't be completed)
2) It would be nice to have a guide, I cheaped out and didn't get the documentation package for the game, I regret that as it probably would have saved a lot of time figuring things out (like how to use your bag to spread manure or plant seeds).
3) Combat still needs a little bit of improvement. Your spears break really easy when stabbing (not a real issue) but axes don't seem to be usable at all (die boars die!!)
4) I have a lot of Mac user friends that want this game but only have Mac's. Trying to get them to buy PC's but yea.....

Overall I'm extremely satisfied with my purchase and would recommend this game to everyone. The development is ongoing and they're on the right path. Kudos to the developers, you have an awesome product and I look forward to seeing where this goes!

P.S. I don't know if you're planning to make this multiplayer, but if you do......................

79,76451348,english,"This game meets a niche area in my library that I always had, but wasn't sure what would fill it. It's slightly challenging, though it's more sandbox then it originally lets on. I am enjoying it a lot as of almost 9 hours played. I've played through about a year and a half in game. I'm married, I've built about 10 buildings and it's honestly a lot of fun.

Pros:
- Fairly large map for running around
- Cool building mechanics, very Life is Feudal.
- Graphics are quite nice
- Quests and a ""Story-line""

Cons:
- Fairly large map is mostly void at this time (Early Access 0.7)
- Would like to see some combat skills implemented some how. Allow that city builder aspect with Bandit's attacking you or something
- Some texture pop-in on Ultra settings. I can often see shadows of the animals well in the distance but their models won't pop in until a few seconds later.

All in all, the game is fun. There are a few things that could be improved, such as the difficulty of the game. The mechanics feel very simple right now - hunt animals for meat, plant crops for vegetables and cook them together to make a variety of dishes. Stock them into a Food Stockpile and now I've got about 3000 in-game hours of food stockpiled from just one full season of play. Also, the vendors will give basically 1g for just about anything. So, if you're strapped for cash and need a good meal, collect 12 sticks - bring them to the main town. Sell them to the Tavern Lady and bam, you've got a Flatbread which will give +45 to your hunger.

Other than hunger and water - the game has almost no challenging aspects to it. As listed above, the Hunger thing is pretty trivial. You can buy a water-skin (or make one). I would like to see more. Bandits? Travelling Merchants? Other than the few towns you come across, the world feels mostly empty. You can hunt rabbits, deer, bison, bears, wolves, boars. You can trap birds, and you can net fish. You can chop down that forest and build a village - and have people JOIN your village and do menial tasks to make resource gathering easy. You can visit other villages and trade. But that's all you can do at this point in time.

All in all, the game doesn't have enough ""game"" in it. The game is just not ready or close to achieving it's lofty claims. It's a glorified graphics demo. There is no gameplay depth to be found in either the menus or the game mechanics. Observe a few things I noticed just in 2 hours of gameplay which I felt tapped the entirety of the content currently in the game.

-you can now change keybinds, thank you devs
-you can't name your saves, they don't even have a thumbnail. They just go up 001, 002 etc
-no customization of character
-dwelling cannot be changed in any way, even to upgrade or move furniture
-items cannot be repaired
-half of the skills aren't even function
-no vehicles, such as boats, wagons, etc
-no mounts, fast travel or transport options for movement around the map
-visited all villages and NPCs on the map, all 110 including the children. No more than 12 buildings per village not including sheds. No two story buildings. Not even a gate on any village, just some log palisades with no battlements or guards. Since half are women or children, you have around 50 men which isn't even enough to form a company of soldiers (80-200 men).
-combat barely exists. There is no armor, no swords, nothing but basic spears and bows out in the world. There are no NPC enemies, just hostile animals like boars that run at you in a straight line. 
-NPCs are static. There are no classes for them to change into, like merchant, official or soldier. You can't build a kingdom with 110 peasants.
-NPCs are invincible and aloof. They don't interact with the world at all. They endlessly swipe at the same wheat all day or stand around. I lead a pack of wolves, which is a threat in a quest, into a village since it has no guards or gates. The NPCs were ignored by the wolves which only chase the player in a straight line. You can't hurt NPCs either, tried with stabs, swings, arrows and spear throws.
-NPC dialogue is as dull as a board. Same dialogue with every village lass on the entire map. Nice weather. Seen that noble? (I sure haven't). Working the fields is hard. Hunting tips? (it is annoying but hardly challenging). Besides the scripted quest dialogue, the villagers are pretty much identical.
-stealing just reduces your ""dynasty reputation"" with no physical consequences
-tavern doesn't sell drinks
-the backstory cutscene has almost nothing to do with the game, no wars, no germanic kingdoms invade, no bandits, your uncle is dead and left you nothing. There isn't even a revenge plot for your lost family.
-there is nothing beyond village life. No kings. No bandits. No wars. Just thatched houses and hand tended fields. You can't build anything meaningful beyond crafting stations. It's like fallout 4 base building but without the charm, world, and combat. 
-the world's items are the barest minimum the game needs to function:
-2 herbs, one insta heals 10hp and one removes poison. They grow like weeds
-2 grains, wheat and rye
-1 drink, water. Die of disease now since you don't even boil it
-4 kinds of fruit, none of which grow in the map
-2 kinds of vegetable, carrot and cabbage. strange choice.
-1 root vegetable, onion. No potatoes for you comrades....
-ALL animals turn into the same 3 things, leather, fur and meat. Fox pelt? Fur. Boar meat? Same as a rabbit. The age old, respected and lucrative leather making trade? I'm sorry, did you say skin the boar?
-ALL vendors have the same prices. They all suck too. 2 gold for some meat, a delicacy for peasants? The same 2 gold as 2 sticks or a random herb grabbed by the handful on the side of the road. The same in every single village and every NPC I checked on the entire map.
-All vendors buy anything with a stock of 1000 gold. What rich peasants. 
-skill grind is incredibly slow. You have to kill tens of animals for one skill point in hunting. Three hundred herbs for one skill point in that tree. Farm 2-3 seasons for some farming XP to get one skill point. All to get a shovel. Even an idiot can make a shovel in 2-3 years, much less pay 50 gold to nowhere to gain the blueprint after reaching the correct tier.
-tech is super slow just like skills (they are kinda tied together). It takes hunting 50 ish animals with spears just to unlock the basic bow at the hunting lodge tier, which is even worse than the spear. 


There is simply no path to becoming a dynasty ruling over a kingdom in the game. There isn't even a framework. All that exists currently is a barebones medieval styled survival game that isn't even hard. You can live on just picking up berries and shrooms. MY inventory has 300 berries and 154 shrooms, my house has hundreds more and this is just 3 days of walking to visit every single village. There are no command mechanics, no conquest systems, you can't even change an NPC's attire. The game is barely even functional as a survival game, there isn't any hint of a kingdom builder anywhere in this game. Even if I moved the entire population of the game (~110+player) into one spot, it would only rate as a small town, much less a kingdom, dukedom, viscounty, barony, etc. It'll take years for this game to even hope to live up to it's claims of working from peasant to dynasty. Don't buy it now, maybe 3-4 years in the future.

TLDR: Game makes ambitious claims and has lofty aspirations but is only a simple decent looking peasant who doesn't have a clue on how to become a ruler.

95,76448571,english,"Okay... So I'm 23 hours in.  

All in all I have enjoyed my experience.  I've built up a village, enticing the local peasants to come work for me through repeatedly talking mundane crap with them.  Some of them are rather picky over subjects of conversation, I chalk that down to them being simpletons and not understanding a more refined subject matter.  Pah!

I have endlessly toiled, using the fruits of the peasants labours to produce more refined goods as my own crafting skills grow.  I'm not a master yet, but through time and perseverance I'm sure I'll get there.  Of course once there I also need to become an expert diplomat when it comes to sales negotiations.  The wife comes in handy for that, somehow she can rewire my brain at will and make me unlearn and relearn new things like my mind was some kind of AI... Go figure?

Did I mention I have a wife?  I've met a lovely woman called Jadwiga who unbeknownst to me, came with the excess baggage of THREE family members who did nothing in my village and buggered off next door each day to toil away and then leech off my goodwill.  Family eh?
We've had our first child.  I forget his name, when he was born she told me nothing of his birth, called for no midwife... nothing... she was a proper trooper, probably chewed through the umbilical cord and everything.  Savage!

Anyhow.. I'm 23 hours in, I dunno how many years it is.. 4?  I restarted at some point before beginning this particular campaign.  I'm enjoying it.

15,76190632,english,"Review update #1: 28 hours in, wrapping up year 2 in game. Game is pretty addicting. There's always something to do and something to improve. 

The 'short' days make it so you need to use your time efficiently but at the same time there's no real rush to do any one task. You wanna build some buildings? Go ahead. You wanna go hunt animals? Sure why not. Wanna do some quests? Have at it. It's all up to you and the basic necessity requirements are easily manageable. 

The biggest bottleneck in the game is your weight management. Doesnt matter how efficient a farmer, hunter, miner, gatherer, or woodcutter you are. You're going to be limited by how much stuff you can carry. Get into the habit of only carrying around whatever you need for your current task. It'll save you time in the long run. 

Villagers arent as helpful as you'd think they'd be, but at the same time they are easily manageable so no harm in having them. Just make sure to put them in tasks that are ongoing (woodcutting, storekeeper, hunter) otherwise they run out of stuff to do when the materials run out. This is made more confusing with the lack of descriptions to how they work. Sometimes they wont do anything if the right materials are not in the right chest in the right building. Takes a while to understand how it all works.

Some people complained about stamina and combat with bows and stuff but that all gets better as you get better equipment. With a longbow (second tier bow) and iron arrows I can one shot most things in the head and I can draw the arrow as long as I could possibly want before loosing. On top of that they recently said they're buffing this as well so those complaints should go away. Can't wait for bandits.

Some stuff you expect to be easily available isn't. Wool clothing isnt accessible until you can get sheep (high tier tech) and even linen clothes require so much flax that you have to devote a lot of fields to it if you want to do sewing. It's unfortunate but it's something to work towards. The real problem is that if you didn't plant enough for one season you have to wait a whole year to plant again or buy the materials outright. 

Original Review:
4 hours in and I'm having a blast. The game doesn't really hold your hands though so some time should be spent deciding what to prioritize. A lot of the stuff is locked behind use-to-improve system where by continually doing a certain task will unlock more options later such as buildings and blueprints for certain tools. The latter require large amounts of gold to learn. So if anything the game is a bit slow to start as you spend a lot of time basically grinding for money and proficiency. I'm still using spears for hunting as I haven't unlocked bows yet and although I just unlocked the ability to sew, I missed the planting season for flax so I'll now have to buy expensive linen if I want to have a go at it.

There's a lot of promise here and really for an EA it's pretty well polished already. The quest system and challenges are already there but require you to explore the area to find all the available ones. Movement and combat feels just like KCD so it's feels great so far. The basic needs of food and thirst are easily managed (at least in spring and summer) so it's not too demanding for beginner players. Some resources can be difficult to find, but once you understand where they generally spawn it becomes much easier. 

Reading other reviews, the first negative review on the steam page is complaining about the 3 day season cycle and them being too short. I'm 4 hours in and still just starting my fifth day which is halfway through summer.  At this rate it'll be another 3-4 before winter starts and frankly I haven't felt the rush he's complaining about. He even suggested increasing the seasons to 15 days which would be probably around 15 hours of game time per season. Uhhh no thanks. This guy has no idea what he's talking about which would make sense as he played less than an hour. If I have to plant crops in spring and wait 30 play-time hours to harvest them for just my first year in game then I'm going to get bored long before I get there. This game is about building a village, expanding, hiring other villagers, becoming successful will take multiple years in game. Imagine playing 60 hour years...that's two months of playtime for the casual gamer. Insane.

However having said that, the ability to perhaps speed up the clock may be nice as currently the only way to skip the skip forward is to head home and go to sleep. But even then, I find myself working all through the night until i literally fell from exhaustion. 10/10 will be playing more and hoping for continual updates to the skill system and expansion of questing.",1600463677,1600888949,True,12,1,0.648736476898193359,0,True,False,True,76561198024125257,48,4,2997,1405,1726,1601878584,,

For an early access game of this quality and size the asking price is appropriate, almost perfect tbh. The game has a lot going for it and a whole heck of a lot of opportunities for it to become even better. I really enjoyed playing this game. It's not even that slow, it gets you into the main core of the gameplay pretty quick, it's got a lot of attention to detail and seems like a lot of big plans for the future. If you're into survival games and if you are into realistic medieval games, then I highly recommend you pick this game up and give it a try.If this isn't enough for you then I have a more in depth review of the game on my youtube channel.

Just saw this gameplay video 3 days ago and straight up to the store. I have been 30 hours of playing so far. I'm in the chapter 7 right now and Dynasty Reputation are pain in the ass.

pros:
- If you like sandbox + survival (but not so hardcore) + open world + medieval games, this is for you.
- Nice graphics and detailed texture
- It takes about 5ish gigabytes
- Immersive and explorable environment, but i hate the sudden attack from pack of wolves

cons:
- Several bugs, but they keep developing patches and minor updates
- You'll have endless walking. There no carts, sleds, wagons, or horses to speed your travel
- Dark interiors, you'll have to use your torch indoor
- Annoying NPCs

Yes it takes about that much time until you finally realise the game is not worth it.

For example, if you want to make a linen shirt, you will need two linen fibre, which equal 4 linen thread, which equal 40 linen. To get linen you need to thresh flax for 5 seconds each. So, to make a shirt you will have to wait for 4 minutes in real world, doing nothing (well I just browsed internet with my phone while waiting). This is a single player game not sure where the fun is when you have to watch the character repetitively threshing flax for 4 minutes, just to make a shirt which is so cheap in the game that you can barely exchange for anything useful. 

""Medieval Dynasty"". You imagine it's about kings, knights, wars, merchants... NOPE. This game is about being a peasant, wasting a lot of time on making cheap stuff so that you can use your sweat & blood to unlock more blue prints which cost even more materials and time to create.

71,76428268,english,"Well, this was a welcome addiction. I've played quite a few fully fleshed out survival games in the past but haven't enjoyed myself so thoroughly in any of them as I do in Medieval Dynasty, which is mind-boggling seeing as it's currently in alpha and still needs a lot of work make no mistake. It looks absolutely amazing and it has a atmosphere I can lose myself in for hours at a time, which clearly I have done. The music, though not offering a huge variation at this point, is lovely and the changes in scenery through the seasons look absolutely brilliant. Initially I found that three days per seasons had me a bit pressed for time but the more work I saddle my villagers with the more I find that it's more than OK. Choosing the right villagers for each task is vital, my resource buildings are bursting with mats and I could probably feed the entire valley for the better part of a decade, doing this will open up so much time for other things. Like planning out your village. Or town. Or city. Stone buildings for life.

This is a alpha version currently however, with some of what that entails. There are bugs, villager AI is a bit clunky, predators don't mind running after you under water at full speed (still salty, wolfy), trees vanish under ground, lack of content etc. If you go into this expecting a full and nearly flawless game, you'll be disappointed. If you go into this expecting a typical alpha version, you'll be very much pleasantly surprised. 

I've seen the roadmap and I am really looking forward to that, so I'll just finish up with some ""minor"" things I hope to see in the future.

[list]
[*]Tweaks to villager pathfinding, had to remove a section of fence as it kept launching a villager up on a roof even though it shouldn't have been in the way of anything. Was either that or the crossbow. T'was a cointoss. Oh, and a lady had a child but was still available for work which shouldn't be possible. She was carrying her baby around like a handbag so I sent her to mine rocks.

[*]Permanent lightsources! My village looks OK enough during the day but as soon as night falls it's instant Resident Evil vibes. So dark and gloomy. 

[*]It's been repeated ad nauseam, but I'd like to permanently remove stumps/trees and respawning clutter inside my village. I built halfway into a forest so every couple of years nature goes on the warpath and tries to retake the village. For now, I have a couple of iron axes that says otherwise.

[*]Making paths inside the village and adding misc. items to make it look a bit more busy. Some barrels over there, a table and some chairs over there, a pile of planks against that wall.. You get the idea.

[*]Being able to name your own child! Seems like your wife handles that bit for you, more power to her but seeing as I had a uh, hand, in making that it would be cool if I had a say too. Despite how brief my contribution may or may not have been.

You start as a young peasent who run away from war, and is left with almost nothing. You get a permission to build a house near the village, but not much else. You hunt, gather and craft to earn money and get permit for more buildings (You do it by progressing the main story line).

89,76423813,english,"TLDR -- A pretty game with huge potiential that is badly thought out and poorly coded in places -- lots of places. Will take a fair bit of effort to make sense. Will take a lot of effort to make great. Will take a huge amount of effort and a lot of rethinking to make legendary. 

Well, well, well. A good looking game that has bags of atmosphere, cool ideas and is fun to lose yourself in. But -- but, it has so many flaws. 

The first is that the interface to me seems designed for console. To move a stack you press 'f' 'e' and then 'f' again. No control click. No right click; move all. The whole interface is like this. 

The second is balance. Pretend you're a Dev and you are testing the game. You see that it takes a whole field of Rye, 300 grain, to make 30 flour. It takes 10 flour to make a pie. So a whole field of Rye, for three pies. In the process of planting and harvesting this Rye, you have used: manure, hoes, seed, leather bags and scythes which cost hundreds of coins and are now all broken - thanks to ridonkulous durability values.  You have to pay rent on the field. Each pie takes additional ingredients to finish and sells for around 14 coins each. So 3 pies is 42 coins. You tick the box - looks good.

Similarly, you buy 7 sheep and a ram totaling 24,500 coins. You collect the wool from these all year while feeding them. You get 300 wool. 10 wool per fabric, 10 fabric per Fur Hood. Each hood sells for about 80 coins, so a 240 coin return per year and 100 years to break even. You tick the box - looks good.

It takes around 4 or 5 minutes to pick 500 berries. Each berry sells for 1 coin. 500 coins for 5 minutes work. Tick the box - looks good. 

This goes on and on. What kind of Dev lets this through? What kind of Dev thinks, for one second, that this is ok? Well the kind that seems to have come up with this great idea and game. A game that, if worked on to it's logical conclusion, is a mouth watering prospect for fans of the genre.

Im running this little gem on a Lenovo Y50-70 laptop with a GTX860M and it runs as smooth as silk on Ultra. The Game looks Stunning, you can stand anywhere and be blown away by the way the world looks and moves from season to season, the lighting is especially amazing.

Ive put about 10hrs into it now (only 3hrs recorded by steam due to crap internet) and I would recommend you try it out, you wont be disappointed and if you are … get a refund. The Modelling is spot on, the textures are amazing and considering the game is early access, its probably one of the best early access games ive played this year.

The concept of the game is brilliant, as the name implies you make your own dynasty in the medieval times starting off with the clothes on your back and a few bits to get you started. Then its all up to you to build your houses, farm lands, buildings and find yourself a wife to start your dynasty. The lack of spoken dialogue during quest and general chat with NPCs is a bit annoying, but im hoping that will come in later updates, but it does not detract from the fact that the game is amazing.

Issues: 
1. Season speed is way to fast an you do feel rushed. My food storage was over flowing with 400 plus on all farm field stuff within the first 4 seasons before I got one person to join my village.
2. The amount of food one has to eat in survival games per given day would make my stomach burst open really.
Ever seen a animal over eat till its stomach opened up not a good thing to see.
3. As of yet have not seen a way to increase strength to carry more other than 1/1 on mule 5kg extra max 40kg I'm not seeing the reality of my character's size only being able to carry that little.
Iron tools should last 3 times as long as they are there iron not crude tools like stone and sticks.
4. Bows are way under powered an I find my self doing spear cause of its power and distance. Spear has more power and same distance as a arrow. I've owned bows and compound bows in my life time an hunted with them and I can tell you the bow is way off on travel distance and damage when hitting animals.
5. No lights in houses sets my mind on fire in anger.
6. Most people I find want to be a sewer so how can I make them happy with any other job in my village.
7: No key bind changing a must have priority 1 issue. 9/22/20 fixed thank you very much.
These 7 need attention at this time. 

So far I have a small village:
5 workers 
4 simple houses
1 small house mine
hunting lodge
sewing house
barn
tavern
chicken pin
pig pin
food storage house
resource storage house
wood shed

The game is great an looks great it is the start of something I was looking for runs great on my pc. Map needs to be min 5x larger than it is now with more animals, I see more deer and foxes than any thing. I will start a discussion page On my thoughts an input on direction from here.

Great job so far just few kinks.

I have played way too many early access that the devs use as a cash cow, release and leave for months before fixing problems then eventually leaving the game to die. THIS dev team however seem to really love their game. (Guess what, I do too!)  Engaging with the players almost daily it seems, updating and fixing several times a week, this gives me so much encouragement for the future of this game. 

Now on to the actual game. 

This game is beautiful! 
They have captured that medieval vibe brilliantly, and its totally sucked me into the world. 

I was walking back from town yesterday after selling some of my harvest, the sound of the snow crunching and compacting around my feet (great work with that btw DEVS) a dear and a fox prancing away at the sound of my feet as I crest the hill I see my little village in the distance, I smile, I actually smile because I love the little village I have built so far. 

I have a home for myself, a couple more homes for my villagers. There's a store house, a food store, workshop and a barn. Humble beginnings and all that.
As I keep walking I see my lumberjack hard at work collecting us logs to build our tavern, the farmer readying our field for the next season,and my hopefully future wife making stone axes to sell in town. 

I bought this game to be a perfect little time filler in between other things but it has consumed me so far. It has this very relaxed vibe that seems to bring you into the world. 
For me it's 's a perfect distraction in these troubling times.

Now, better get that Tavern done.

Unfortunately, some glaring flaws shine through that remind the player that it's early access, causing me to not recommend the game in its current state:

- LOGS. You need so, so many logs and have no current way to transport large amounts. When I'm building structures, I find myself having to go further and further from my village to acquire logs as the forest around my territory is thinned out. I emptied my inventory to accommodate the massive amount of weight, but it still a huge grind and lots of boring walking back and forth to build even a small structure. More than half the time I put into this game so far is just cutting down and transporting logs.

- No way to recover building materials if you need to remove a structure. I accidentally built two Food Storage buildings instead of a Food storage and a Resource storage... a simple, but very costly mistake. Removing the building netted me zero materials, so I basically just wasted precious logs for nothing.

- It feels ridiculous to need Food and Resource storage buildings to satisfy your villagers' needs. Why can't I place the materials in the chest in their house? While I understand that in the late game this can be quite convenient, when you only have a few villagers, it feels like a needless requirement.

- As other reviewers have said, you need to eat so much food to survive. The equivalent of a large animal, daily. While hunting isn't hard, it can be time consuming if you have a whole village to feed, as well as the many other needs.

34,76412544,english,"While I feel some more hours could be needed to get a greater understanding of village mechanics and marriage I am going to write this review with in my opinion a good grasp on the fundamental game. I am going to start out with the flaws I see in the game then move onto the positives that I see and end it all with how I think this game can improve and my thoughts on the roadmap.

Medieval Dynasty starts out with one of the worst openings I have seen in a game, I rolled my eyes at the ""war"" which was ravaging the country and how much of a cliche everything seemed. You start by heading into a small village and getting your first quest and the quests are god awful. Fetch quests of going from point a to point b then going back to point a were some of the 'bigger storylines'. Side quests are rip-offs and never worth doing and the main quest doesn't make sense at all with the skill tree enforcing this. (even calling it a quest makes no sense as there is no storyline and is just build this and this). Why should I build a hunting lodge before I have built food storage and resource storage, there were far more important things I should have been doing than building a tavern cause I just unlocked it and while that is partially my fault I think the game should do more to articulate what is important for your character through the questline. The NPCs follow this trend and are just the same except for maybe like a few different ideas. What I mean by this is that each NPC interacts with you the same, they give you the same greeting and you back are forced to give the same lines. In these lines, the game tries to build character personality with NPC reacting to each comment in a good way, bad way, or neutral way. It's a bad system and most of the time doesn't make sense IE my wife who although apparently loves her clothes, and the dedication put into the craft doesn't like nobles clothes. Then the animal also decided to follow the example and is some of the worst AI I have seen. Wolves will walk towards you slowly the moment you start throwing spears in them, Bison will attack you for just existing which to me seems off-putting and when hunting animals there isn't any tension. Once you have skinned your animal and collected the prized fur and leather that comes with it you bring it back into town and surprise the prices are absolutely absurd. Sorry, I can only give you 4 gold for that fur but please come pay 10 gold for corn seeds. And whoever decided to put the unlocks for skill tree, unlockable only with gold needs to go into the office and change that this instant. With all this being said, I would likely hate this game but for some reason. 

I have had this game for only about 3 days and have already poured 13 hours in which is unusual for me non, to say the least, and I find myself wanting to get that one last building or that one last guy in my farm constantly telling myself I will log off after this. I have seen the comparison to Kingdom Come Deliverance due to its graphics and that is noticeable the game looks nice. I find myself waiting for winter cause I just love the visuals that the game has and you see this right off the bat. And this combines with the gameplay loop to give you a nice and peaceful gameplay experience. It's the perfect game that you can just play relaxing and forget about things going on in your life and just enjoy the game. The gameplay loop of chopping trees, hunting, farming, and the building has kept me coming back and I want to see my once small house along the river grow into this vast village, seeing these buildings and the place grow is such a cool experience. The map is large and actually fun to explore, I haven't had much incentive to explore the map however every time I have I have loved the atmosphere brought forth by the game. The core of this game is just so enjoyable and the foundation the team has to build is such a strong fundamental. I also think making this game 30 dollars is very nice and while at the current moment I would get it around 10-20 I think the team is not aiming for a cash grab or anything. The team has already started to put out patches which is very nice. I personally have only run into one bug that was by no means a big deal. Overall this game has the potential to be one of the best sim games on the market and I just hope the team the best in trying to achieve that. 

That's the majority of the review and know I just wanted to give my thoughts about what I think should be done to combat the problems I stated. 

For the first problem of the opening, I think the main thing to do is just adding some customization. Bannerlord I think is a good example here where you can build your story of how you ended up in the North while also giving you different playstyles to try out this allows the ditch of the original cinematic and gives more role-playing opportunities. The questing I actually believe is on a good path just needs small rethinking. In its current stage, there are quests of different characters' stories that inhabit the towns nearby. That's dumb don't do that; instead, make the stories about the NPCs that will inhabit your town and that you have a connection with. I feel much more attached to John who is in my town then John three towns down even if I did a fetch errand for him. Once you have moved the quests to people in your town you can start to do things such as hunting with John or finding a fishing spot with John. If you want to keep the war story maybe have a quest about what happened to John during the war. You don't need to do this with every town member as I feeling eventually the goal is to have tons of people in the town but I think a few would be really impactful. This goes hand and hand with the conversations and diplomacy. To be honest though just make an NPCs role more pronounced if he is a farmer you can ask him a question about where they sell pumpkin seeds if not in this town. If you meet a hunter, you can ask him where the foxes are found. Meet a widow, well she can tell you about the fair maiden John who just moved here but is an excellent wife. Stuff I think would be very helpful. With that should also be the incentive to explore, if a hunter tells me where wolves are I should be able to mark that on my map and head there. And once you get there the animal has good AI. I didn't state this in the dislikes but I think adding two days to the season or at least having the option would be a good choice and then in that you can change the economy. Fur would be a lot more popular in the winter, whereas in the summer it wouldn't be needed at all. Not just a straight 3 gold. (also raise the price for animal parts for god sake).

Finally, Toplitz has released a road map for the game heading forward and it looks nice. Riding farm animals I think would be a great benefit, especially if the game adds horses cause horses are needed. I am not sure what events and challenges are but they sound interesting at the very least. The production of the resources of alcohol and other stuff could be a strong late game money maker. Bandits are what most people have been talking about however and personally if Bandits were put in right now it would be terrible. The bandits are a great idea but need things to go along with it. Walls, being able to equip your townsfolk, maybe guard positions. From the photo, it looks like bandits could just be some three dudes you meet on the road and I don't think that would really add much to the game. Instead, a group of bandits attacking your town would matter since that is your town, and that is your stuff and people that can't respawn. There is great potential in this game and I just hope they carry the momentum of these early days with them.

Pros: 
+Absolutely stunning graphics
+Very realistic when it comes to a survival based game
+Active development. Unlike other Early release games the developers are on the ball and they listen to the players. Updates almost every day
+Great price
Cons:
-Not many flaws with this game but a few suggestions to improve on a great game;
-Oddball glitches that occur with NPC's(i.e. villagers sleeping standing up or people sitting in the middle of the path on invisible chairs.
-Out of balance season times. 12 game days equals one full year. Way to rushed to enjoy...But I read that the developers will be balancing this out somewhere in the last 3 months of 2020
-More realism with the environment. Whacking at a sheer rock wall and getting 3 stones and a limestone is a bit unrealistic.
-More animals would make this perfect. Birds, fish, snakes, and reptiles of some variety would definitely open more avenues for hunting and crafting. A bird trap and fish net/spear are available but I have never seen a bird nor a fish. 
-More vegetation or at least make the present vegetation interactive. I have seen chicory, cat tails, and numerous other sporadic vegetation but only 3 plants are collectible without growing them on farm plots. 
-A transportation system(cart, horse, wagon etc) would greatly improve travelling between POI's.
-On a personal note due to my need for creativity. Cookie cutter structures are a bit monotone. Being able to customize more than just the building materials would be awesome. Also creating more user friendly areas that allow building(i.e. level terrain or a way to create custom structures to adapt to the hilly terrain).

I know this sounds like a whine-fest but they are just suggestions to perfect an already great game. Thanks to the devs for creating a unique alternative to zombies or dinosaurs.",1600828320,1600828320,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True,76561198355841687,16,1,5134,2919,2068,1601608536,,
58,76408582,english,"Do I recommend this game? Yes. But...

If you're happy to pay £18-£23 for a game that will keep you entertained for around 12 - 25 hours, (£1/£1.50/Hour) then by all means, go a head with the purchase. You will have fun if you're into this genre and you will get engrossed in it. But then you'll just stop.

You'll enjoy getting yourself set up, building your first village and investing in who you want to work in it.
You'll enjoy laying it out, and doing the side quests and getting it to look pretty.
You'll enjoy the atmosphere, hunting game, and growing your dynasty as you explore and unlock more things.

But then, all of a sudden, you'll realise there really isn't that much more to do.
All of a sudden you'll realise just how bad the AI is at operating in its current state,
you'll realise that after all those villagers joined your town, and they're all working for you, that you still aren't making any gains in your resources.

In it's current state, this game isn't finished, but it never said it was. The game is enjoyable, but it's just not there yet. The management side for me, was one of the biggest draws to this game. I want to make a village, have it thrive and use that as my base village to leech off of, so I can go and make a better, bigger, more planned main village. However, at the moment, this just isn't possible.

So, would I recommend this game? Yes, I would, BUT, don't go expecting a completed game. I think if the developers stick to what they're trying to achieve, this game will become a classic - We've just got to hope they stick with the original vision. I love sandbox games, and I love management games.

What does the game need:
+ Better UI displays, making it clearer what villagers are up to, where you need to place tools and what symbols mean
+ More buildings orientated around the growth of your city - E.g. Inns,  (Enabling sleeping in other cities, drinking in your / other cities, money to go back into your city), Stores (So you don't have to keep going and selling berries to the nearest town), Guest houses, (for passing hunters, miners, travellers, traders), localised laws, etc etc.
+ Life, it needs character - At the moment, your villagers wake up, go to work, and reappear before the nights end, to go to bed. That's as close as you'll get to your villagers. After you've got yourself a wife, I saw no point in even engaging with any of them apart from the odd quest to benefit my dynasty points. I want villagers to have dinner together, to hook up together, to celebrate years end together, things like that.
+ Transportation: At the moment, if you wanted to go live in a nice empty space next to a river, you'd have to do SO many walks back and forth to build up your buildings. We need something like The Forest has, that enables you to transport logs quicker than only being able to carry the max of like 13 I think? Further more, if you decided to base yourself somewhere away from the starting town, you'd have to continuously travel back and forth to this town, just to follow the main story line.
+ Difficulty: I just started a fresh save, and within the first 15 minutes, I had killed numerous deer, 2 wolves and a bear. If you've got a spear, and you can aim at a head, all you need to do is crouch up to them, and hit the head. GGWP you win.
+ A more detailed explanation on how processes work: For instance, if you were to make a lumbercamp, and set a worker to it, you'd presume that would mean that worker would collect you wood. And for a while, it 'wood'. However, if you do not continue to put axes in the chest of THAT lumbercamp, then eventually they'll collect sticks instead of wood. But, your only way to notice this, is if you keep inventory of your resources and log that your logs aren't going up, whilst your sticks are. I built a workshop and assigned someone to that, but I've no clue what they were doing other than lowering my sticks. I put someone in a tavern, I think they made food but I'm not sure. Do they needs tool? I had people working my farms, they'd do fine when there was something to harvest, but they never managed to re-sow anything. I had someone working as a farmer in my barn, but they never processed any rye into flower - It's just all a bit unclear.
+ Travelling NPCS - Apart from the people in the town, you'll encounter no one on your travels. This makes the whole area seem very.. empty. I want to see people going from town to town, trading or visiting family. If carts or something similar were added to this (I'm sure it's planned), this would help a lot.

TLDR: Yes, I recommend the game if you're willing to play around 10-20 hours in it's current state. But, just please be aware, this is an EA, you're putting your trust in this developer (which I recommend you do at the moment, the updates have been coming in thick and fast), they've stated their intentions of what they want this game to be, I just hope to god they make it, because this could be bloody fantastic!

Sure has it's bugs and glitches and potato NPCs, but I'm very impressed so far. Worth the buy, you'll get hours worth of fun even at this early stage. So far the only battles you will see are with wild animals, and most of the lethal ones are met in rather small areas of the map, you mostly have to stress about survival of the weather and sustenance, so it's peaceful living. Lots of grinding to do, ""challenging fun"" micromanaging of your village and it's resources and a pretty world to explore. The game still has it's issues, but hopefully they will be addressed soon, so far there has been many updates after the publishing. 

If you lack patience, then this may not be the game for you, since you will be walking far and wide getting logs to build, and your inventory is very small (then again how realistic is it to be able to carry 100 kg of wood at a time with ease?) and many of the materials you will need aren't easily accessible. I took it as a challenge and so far I'm building myself a steady income of goods. Even if the techs and resources would be made easier, I hope it stays challenging enough to be interesting. NPCs are pretty dull, their AI needs lots of work and conversations are repetitive at best (it took me a while to understand the mechanic of the right conversation choises are tied to their skills) and how my villagers and MY WIFE refer to me as a stranger is just plain weird when they're living in my village, eating my food and burning my firewood. The world itself looks nice and pretty sure will get enhancing in the future, some NPCs are clones (and they look like potatoes, but it kinda fits the medieval theme, no botox back then in the good old days). When I hyped this game to my friends I called it a walking simulator - it takes time to move even relatively short distances (even when running) and there's a lot of ground to cover. Prepare to make whole day trips to more distant villages, even if the game claims the distance as few km. Pretty sure we will get horses and/or carriages in the future (would solve the log carrying issue/challenge depending how you looks at it). 

The game doesn't hold your hand in good and bad, which makes it both interesting and frustrating at times.

(Things that definitely piss me off. No horse. Having to walk constantly. Having a quest where I need to pick berries in the middle of the winter. I then fail the quest because there are no berries in the winter.)
Some suggestions for the game are as followed: 
A quicker way of transportation maybe a horse sometimes the journey is far far away. 
When I am building it is very hard to find an even surface. Maybe make a way to un root the trees you cut down and also dig up the dirt to level it out. that would be cool.
When I finally married my farmland wife. I found out I needed to make a woodshed and a food storage and I had no clue I had to do this. SO in turn my wife left me :( (this is not a suggestion but I was a little sad I didn't know this beforehand I am traveling across the lands to find my wife again as she disappeared into the wilderness lol)
Would be cool to see a tavern in other towns where you can pay a little to sleep overnight instead of making a fire. Also, meeting the town folk and chalking it up would be a blast. 
Maybe test out some bandits but not sure if they are needed unless i experience it for a bit.
The NPCS could be doing some more interesting things. Maybe have some approach you. Or a lady approach and flirt with you.

- Game foundation is already very mature and it seems that adding content is very easily done and short term.
- Great graphics.
- Game makes you work for anything you want/need.
- You can build almost anywhere you want.
- You can harvest anything you see.
- Plants change with seasons (berries are unripe in fall, but ripe in summer, different mushrooms per season, etc).
- Some hidden mines and such.
- Very fast bug fixing and patches by the dev's.


Cons:
- Unbalanced: its more rewarding to get 2 stones and a few sticks, build a simple wooden stone axe and sell it, then to sell tailored clothes.
- Unbalanced part 2: you need way to many hides to make a simple pair of shoes.
- The NPC interaction is very default, every NPC has the same chat options.
- Everything is behind a lock system, it takes a lot of grinding to open something up and by the time you got it, its gonna cost you coins per recipe.

This game is very slow, and during my second attempt at playing the game, I realized that this game was unnecessarily large grind.

Things I would like to see improved would be, 1 I need to be able to build a chest without building a house its kind of silly that you get 1 per house and if you need more storage you have to build another building. Im fine with the relatively low carry weight its more realistic I know i cant carry 20 logs so thats fine but I can certainly build a box without building a house around it. 2 animations are a little stiff, Im not the kind of gamer to get hung up on ultra realism but when I'm being chased by a wolf or a fox and they kinda just float towards me its a little silly.
3 Quest/waypoint ,Specifically the night hunt quest there was no marker to indicate where I was supposed to go hunt at night and the quest description just said ""Nearby Village"" even a area thats shaded on the map or something would have been helpful being that there are at least 2 villages I consider nearby to the starting village and neither had wolfs or boars close enough that I could find to try and complete the quest before the sun came up.

After playing awhile, think about all the places you have been and decide if a different location for your community would be better. Ideally you want water, animals to hunt, clay to mine, forests for wood and reeds nearby. Being somewhat central to other communities is handy and most people seem to prefer close to the starting town.

PROs:
You get to build your own settlement from the ground up
you get to hook up with a rather plain looking medieval chick (after days of asking her the same questions, and pretending to be interested in what she has to say while pursuing other interests as well, pretty realistic if you ask me) 
the game world is decent, not kingdom come deliverance pretty, but if KCD had a younger slightly less attractive sister that you decided to plow through so your buddy could hit it.

CONs:
Animal hunting is rather joking at this stage, I dont care what steroids youre on if I broadside a deer in the lungs with a long bow and iron arrows that bitch is gonna drop on the spot, not sprint off at the speed of light while you run after it and shoot it with 4 additional arrows. 

the amount of time it takes to get someone to join your settlement is not great, I have 4 NICE houses, a tavern, enough food stocked up to feed you and your questionable possibly inbred family for years, nice open fields to harvest AND any job you could want.. but you wanna stay in your little house, and sit around the town fire till i score a 70 on your like-o-meter, fuck you peasant.... 

Finally the the amount of time it takes to level up and gain technologies.... that needs to be revamped, i can build a FULLY functioning farm, to include animals crops, craft my own clothing, make damn beef stew from scratch (literally grew all the vegitables and slaughtered a cow to make it) but I cannot build a fishing net because it takes 500 points in hunting to make this happen and you might get lucky and get 3 points per animal you slaughter after you chase it through the forrest for 5 minutes trying to finish the bitch off...

In closing even with the cons, this game is REALLY fun to play and become immersed into, I will take it in all its glory and just hope that some of these issues are addressed in the future.... so again if you like these types of games... buy it and help the development process so we can get some good shit in this game like maybe a horse... or even better a horse drawn wagon....

This game is very well done for an alpha, which is a breath of fresh air with some of the disappointing games that have been hitting the market. Dare I say, where the game is now and where it can go, it will be a contender with large titles one day. Does it lack some content? Sure. Is it super in depth? Naw. But its fun and pretty advanced for alpha stage. It feels like a strong mix between Rising World with some basic elements from MC and Green Hell. At the time of writing, its a little pricey. But it is still worth the purchase now at this price, as in the future it could very well sell as a $60+ game. Its well worth the shot IF YOU ENJOY SURVIVAL CRAFTING GAMES.

If they really vamped up the game giving more Quests and ability to do a little bit more it be a complete game even without being the epic game of Kingdom Come.  


*CONS

- BORING  WINTERS !!!!!!!
- AI conversations stale and random reputations  without logic

 PLEASE HAVE A FAST FORWARD as an option for this if  your in your house.  

Currently the game has you stuck in your house during winter early game which is so BORING!  I got 45 minutes of NOTHING... I can't leave my house, I freeze I can't go hunting, I can't build I can just sit in my house eat rations...  You don't unlock clothes for winter up front no matter what so i can't literally do anything.  You have less than 3 minutes outside you die.  
Maybe your supposed to have a torch or something.  They also don't seemly allow single women to work in your town, only married men.

Bugs:  Few glitches on using cooking fire in house,  also chess bugs playing there then not there kind of bugs.   There's a few Quest with issues so standard early access stuff but nothing totally breaking the game.
- 


*PROS

Great Graphics
Good Size to World
Interesting Progression in Char Dev + Building unlocking.
Low Bugs
AI movement pretty decent and logical.
No Zombies!

Here we also have a Niche market not FED is AI NPC towns building up your town, no other game I seen do this if they can feed that market they really will succeed.  Only thing I seen close to that is MINECOLONIES in Minecraft but it's a mod.  The factory games and building games with automation usually have ZERO AI NPCs it's just a machine.  So really this is a good start.

The game definitely needs more quests, maybe voice actors, few more oddities in game (quest, lore, religion),  (fortification or upgrades) ,   I have not played their other games so I don't know what engine and ideas I could rip off from their Lumber Jack game.  The trees right now IMO mechanic sucks for hitting felled trees TIP for players crouch down to swing since you can't hit these as you should be able to standing.

Sorry I haven't played it long enough to say more than that but I expect certain things in game if not already like CART  /   TRADE ROUTES / extra.

GAME TIPS:  Don't read rest unless you going to buy it and don't mind tips.

 There is sort of a limitation how far away you can go from first town. Reason is they have the Story quest coming from that guy now you can ignore that but unfortunately you have to go back to him all the time to pay taxes.  So you don't want build your town far from the first town because they basically have a long walk every tax season I wish you could pay another town if your closer or a mayor or something of any town.  The problem with winter is it's boring since you freeze so easily despite you just left your house.  You end up just waiting to try to sleep for many minutes if you don't have proper warm clothing or whatever other mechanic I don't know maybe a torch. 

  The TAXES - strange yes I build a bunch of buildings got taxes on all them yet no people there so next play through I won't build anything other than a house since it taxes you on all your buildings or I will half build them and not finish any of them if that allows them to not register  as a tax, since I am not getting people to join my settlement yet have half a city built. So reputations is key. 

Reputation takes a long time and some unknown random in conversations unless you do quests.  The conversations can go in either direction up/down.  But all non quest conversations are either cut short or greatly limited and children / teenagers unless a quest is impossible.  

Also they have a cap on your reputation or affection per day so you can't find a wife easily but must build reputation and affection at same time.  

 I noticed some resources renewable other ones you don't know if they are like trees.  I don't know if trees grow back still it's undetermined but seems not, all other things seemed to.  I really don't care if they don't grow back just worried when you get area cleared for town do you have to worry about trees again.  The stumps are annoying wish you could dig those out with shovel maybe next time.",1600485759,1600810204,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True,76561198055676270,175,67,2338,811,1390,1601943306,,

I have had my share with gaming - both on console and on computer. Just of the recent years survival games has got my fully attention. I just have to state right away - as a big fan of Skyrim - and NO, this is not a comparison, simply more of setting the standard of what I do expect when gaming - Medieval Dynasty is already as in early access one of the golden moments I ever had with a game! I can not remember since when I had this extreme feeling of just kind of dying to get back in to this world of Medieval Dynasty. When I sleep i freaking dream about it. I absolutely love this game from the very beginning, and with active devs like we got here, I can not wait for some bigger updates. Cos yes, because this is early access you must account for bugs. It`s just a natural part, but I guess most people who like early access, love the bugs too. All in all still, there is tons of details, this world is absolutely stunning and it`s very very realistic. I just struggle using the words it deserves to be very honest. By the end of this product, I will be very shocked if not this game get at least 9 of 10 from me.

I tend to be a bit slow picking up the flow of these games but I started getting the hang of it after a false start. I am enjoying it so far. It is not a fast paced game and there is a lot of grinding involved. I have had to pause the game and watch some viewer help videos to learn some hints and tricks in getting past so beginner mistakes but have enjoyed it overall. There are a few things I would like to see adjusted that would make the game play a bit less ""grindy"", but the one that really sticks out to me is the amount of meat you get when killing an animal compared to its size and the value of the food to you. For example, If I kill a Rabbit, I get between 3 or 4 pieces of meat. Fair enough. However, if I kill a full sized deer, I still get 3 or 4 pieces of meat. Apparently, the developers have never hunted and collected meat from a Rabbit and deer before, or they think a deer is the same size as a rabbit. Also, at the rate you burn up food, my hunger bar was halfway down and I had to eat 4 deer to get it back up to full; or 4 rabbits. See what I mean? Its rather funny actually. In real life ( which I do not expect this game to copy exactly), four deer would have enough meat for a good part of the winter. 
So I believe with a bit of tweaking, this can be a very entertaining survival game. I will continue to play it as it is and revise my review as the game changes.

I've only played a fair amount of the game so far (20~ hours) but I am really enjoying it! It's a good mixture or rpg and simulation/strategy game play. If you enjoy the grind, ruling your own village, exploring a large map, learning new skills and buildings, constantly fighting the battle of hunger and replacing tools along with many other things, I'd recommend it!
There are however a few slight issues and downfalls of the game but at the rate Toplitz is fixing bugs and talking about issues, I'm sure they will be flattened out at some point!

51,76389883,english,"I really want to love this game but currently after around 5 hours the single player grind is getting quite brutal.  The game starts off fun, I found a nice little area next to a lake to start my village.  I built a house and started hunting and trapping rabbit/foxes.  Next the game wants you to socialize.  Right now social interaction is picking from a list of dialog and hoping the guy you are talking to likes your answer.  There are no right or wrong answers it's just RNG and you can only do one interaction per day with any npc.  This means if you want a wife or new villager you are walking back and forth for weeks having the same stale interaction.  There are also currently no voice lines so you are just reading text looking at a blank faced NPC that might as well be T-posing.  Another issue I have is with food.  While food is abundant enough it's hardly diverse and you have to eat 3 rabbits 20 mushrooms and 5 bushels of berries just to make it out of morning.  Once you have completed your starter items to progress in tech and to make money you basically have to keep crafting tools and selling them which makes for alot of grinding and running back and forth with towns.  I'm at a point where I can spend a couple hours chopping trees and grinding tools to progress in tech and move on in the game or I can walk back and forth with a village and try to get a wife, both of which aren't appealing me to start the game up again.

57,76388059,english,"This game is much to early to be trying to actually play for enjoyment, great concept and premise but its all just really boring right now. NPCs are bugged and don't react as they are intended to in conversation. Player-built assets (my precious field and crops!) disappear at the change of the seasons. Quests are effectively 'make your way through our menu of buildings' and 'hunt these same animals', skills are really basic without excitement - 'axe durability lasts 10% longer', 'can chop wood 10% faster for 10 seconds', it all seems really placeholder for as they fill it in with proper mechanics and fleshed out gamer experience. If they work on combat (all weapons are tragically hopeless against foxes), the only thing that works is throwing a spear which makes it pointless grinding for your first bow, let alone this potential recurve bow available later. Did I mention the disappearing field I built? When I had sunk time into growing crops on it? And the fact that it costs an arm and a leg to buy the prerequisite materials to be able to grow crops, not realistic at all. The economy needs some serious reworking and expanding. You can buy eggs though... not for any real purpose but you can buy them... oo and flatbread... if you see flatbread, get it, hummus is missing though, inside track is its in a future update.

Basically top and bottom of it is they haven't begun to think about the actual player yet, there isn't anything particularly enjoyable beyond the first maybe 3 hours of getting used to building and hunting. I personally think this is too early to be on Early Access and they should care more about what they are putting in front of customers.",1600794904,1600794904,False,2,0,0.533898293972015381,0,True,False,True,76561197982741697,36,1,609,0,601,1600795012,,
58,76378039,english,"This game as concept is great and have not only potential and already possess mechanics that are implemented to make it enjoyable product. Definetly a game for for those seeking a little bit of survival and management in medieval setting. Here are positives and negatives:

Positives:

-Crafting – Those looking for crafting galore will not be disappointed. From primitive tools made of branches and stones to iron tools that you yourself can mine and craft in workshop that you yourself built. Want to make tavern? Sure. Want to make sewing workshop?Sure Want to build a henhouse and focus on egg production? Sure. etc....

-Skills- Good amount of skills Crafting, Building, Farming, Hunting and diplomacy. Mostly enjoyable but diplomacy (perhaps not sure if WIP) and  hunting (definitely) needs rebalance.

-Graphics – Very pretty looking- not the best thing minds you but very atmospheric. Beautiful environment. Nothing but sink in. Very immersive.

-Soundtrack- Just like above very atmospheric soundtrack that accompany you through the game.

Negatives:

-Balance of economy/crafting - The most complicated issue. I will try to explain with the example. 
Imagine that you hunt a rabbit, so you get I skin from him. Looks for best boots crafting req. It costs 64 skins. Ok, lets hunt some deers (it’s not like you need more advanced tools either its very easy to kill most animals – at least for me). 1 deer is around 4 skins. Ok 16 deers later (around 1 hour later). Makes shoes. Sells them for 88 coins. That was not fruitfull. Ok gather berries next to shop owner. Gather 415 berries (around 5 mins) – sell them for 415 coins.

 That’s the start from amount the time that is required to produce anything more sophisticated – from iron tools to boots and nets for fishing. And if you decide to buy materials or half ready products yourself – you will find them but in limited quality and steep price. Don’t get me wrong here. Btw just saying - grind is something Im used to - and grind itself aint an issue. What I mean by that is that what you get for that grind compared to simpler solution to make money like gathering of berries and sticks. Just berries and sticks – berries and sticks…

-NPC production – Don’t get me wrong here whole system is neat and works fine, except production vs time and npc tasks vs requirements to work. So lets say you want to worker for working in the field so he will plant it for you. They need housing – fine– but they also require food - reasonable - additionally they require resource shed -ok?- and food shed -wait what?- you need also woodshed in the forest and additional npc so he can continuously give wood for villagers -ehm- and for good measure if you are low on food you need to build hunting hut or fishing hut and hire one more worker-slow down-did I mentioned each of those building cost you taxes as well as field AND apparently workers(unconfirmed info). 

That’s for 1-2 workers for the field – sure you can avoid some of those things like cutting wood yourself and gathering food yourself and pay taxes with berries and sticks. Compared to what they require, do villagers produce much? Not at all, and i mean overall, not only compaing to what player himself can produce which is even more… and of course compared to the limited time and sometimes you need to help them (they are kinda buggy) – but it takes you time to do other stuff and here comes another issue.

-Time- Many have written about problem of in-game time and only 3 day per season limit. To a certain degree its true. At the beginning of the game its not a problem – but when you try to produce stuff, find something or talk to someone and there are more quests and tasks it becomes a problem. Especially when day is over and it teleports you to your house and map is quite big. Additionally there is no fast traveling (not that needs to be) and no mounts (those are WIP). You feel that you need to hurry constantly. Days are short make them count.

But hey its just balancing and devs already said that they are thinking about changing time progress - it will take them some time tho...

-Bugs- Suprisingly not many, exception are kinda derpy NPC workforce. Which Im not sure if intended in certain mechanics. Also npc floating and getting stuck and thats it...

Keeping in mind negatives I recomend it. Core gamplay is here and it works fine compared to many others EA on steam. Telling the truth i was suprised with stability and lack of bugs. Balancing is off and better to do stuff by yourself rather than hire npcs.

74,76382092,english,"This game has a few things down great, including:
+ Graphics
+ UI
+ Sound/music

However, it also has numerous issues:
- Villager AI is awful and doesn't tell you if there are problems or what they need to work
- Getting villagers to farm on their own is near impossible. There are a few things they can do but need constant babysitting
- Villagers don't seem to move or progress if you move away from them (e.g. I came back from hunting for the day and no progress had been made)
- Some tasks barely gather any resources (Like 6 logs in the entire day)
- Sidequests and challenges only give 1-2 reputation, but the goal is to reach 750 and main quests give 100-200. The side quests are sometimes very time consuming too, and not worth it in many cases. 
- There is no choice early on which reduces replayability. You can't choose to be a miner and progress into a blacksmith, buying your food in exchange for goods. You have to start with hunting and farming because blacksmiths and mines are locked as ""high tech"" stuff
- You are locked in the number of buildings you can have and to expand this limit you need to do the main quests. Which is fine, except when the goal of the quest is to build something. So you have to demolish one of your buildings to fit it in.

In short, the game needs:
Huge amounts of work on the villager AI.
Rework of skills and addition of path options to start with that are all economically viable, so you can be a hunter/fisher, a farmer, or a miner/blacksmith for instance. (Currently only mass producing flax is viable)
The time consuming side quests to give 10x more prestige (like 20 or 30)

I mean, it's really hard to get NPC on borde of your new settlement (even harder to get someone into marrying you) and when they do, they don't add anything useful to it. They just made the taxes I had to pay higher. I thought that when I had NPCs, they will work for me and facilitate my resources gathering and processes, but no. Am I doing something wrong? Because they just fake work all the time. The hunter, hunts, but never brings anything to the settlement. The lumberjack hits trees, but also doesn't bring any wood back. By the way, after 2 years (in game) the trees never respawned.

There are other problems at the moment, like the cost of things. Everything is extremely expensive to buy, but extremely cheap to sell. Last spring I didn't have enough money for the taxes (expensive fake workers) and to gather enough money in time, I was just colleting branches to sell for 1gp each. In a feel seconds, I had enough to get 150gp. If I had to craft something to sell, like a stone axe, I would need 10 branches and 2 stones (hard to find out) and I would sell it for just 28gp in a NPC with I had 90% positive relationship. It's just absurd.

As I said it, the mechanics are there. The idea exists. But, at the moment, seems pretty incomplete to be enjoyable. Maybe afterwards it will be a good game, specially if multiplayer was added.",1600735912,1600780803,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True,76561198085637309,99,12,955,0,955,1600780720,,

95,76374118,english,"After reading through some other reviews to see how other people have experienced this game I can say there have been some unfair criticisms of it so far. It's fair to say there are some drawbacks of this game as its still in very Early Access, but it's a bit too far to say its unplayable. Due to its current state there is a certain way to play this game. How I've survived has been finding a quiet space in the middle of the map, close to some other villages for resources and away from some wolf & bear hotspots to start making my village. After planting crops in fields, I have foraged or hunted for the season. Once you start getting some sort of vegetable you can combine it with raw meat to make a meal, two meals just about fills your hunger meter. Hunting can be hit and miss but most headshots will take down animals or atleast stun/slow them enough to take care of them. Hitting them elsewhere is a mixture of crippling them to needing 10 arrows. You can sell berries/sticks/reeds and whatever else you get on your hands on until you start getting rich and completing missions to get your reputation up so you can extend your village and recruit more people. You get to do this while experiencing four beautifully crafted seasons in a nicely detailed map. That's the gist of how I've made my cabbage empire. I really respect how the developers have fixed things so quickly as well, and most things I've came across now can be fixed with reloading the game. However, there are negatives you do need to work with. The AI villagers are a huge work in progress, some will just stand near places such as the hunting lodge but will generate raw meat from hunting. Your dialogue for recruiting villagers and a wife is also very difficult to navigate as you appear to have the personality of a butter sandwhich making most people hate you and only giving you a small chance of success at times to win people over. The 3 day season cycle is a little restrictive, making most of the map hard to explore while you are attending to your village.

The whole building system is also tedious.

You start out with being tasked to build your own house and soon you find yourself establishing your own little settlement.

The devs have been patching it almost daily since launch on Steam.  I look forward to seeing how they continue to improve he game.  That being said...

Problems:

Chat options are limited, repetitive, and somewhat predictable... yet not predictable enough?  (Hard to get gains... could be improved to perhaps a player based mini game of sorts.)

The theft system is super basic.

Gaining dynasty reputation outside of doing the main quest feels very difficult as it’s fairly hard to find enough side missions.

Many of the skills aren’t finished.

The technology tree could be expanded upon.  The method of obtaining tech could be improved.

Melee combat feels like trash.  Ranged with a spear is pretty good.  Haven’t tested archery yet.

AI management is super clunky.  Figuring out how to get your citizens to do what you want them to do isn’t intuitive.  (For example workers need tools which you need to place in the appropriate storage chest or they won’t do any work... but they never tell you that.  Maybe the NPC could say “Hey... I need tools.”  Farming is all kinds of buggy and clunky.)

Various other bugs.

Going to keep playing and watching for updates/hot fixes.

The most important mechanic in the game is wooing women to make them your wife and attracting settlers to your village.

You can only try talking with an NPC about two times a day or so. This leads to progression towards earning a wife/settlers for your village a complete crap shoot. Most new player guides online just recommend quicksaving and quickloading to save scum your desired results from NPC dialogue. What is the point with this design? I enjoy dialogue and role playing games but only when there is real consequence/reward to NPC speech. In this game currently (September 22, 2020) you're artificially encouraged to fight the game and game the result you want from dialogue. It is unenjoyable, bland, and completely unrewarding.

This also totally ignoring the lack of control rebinding, bad controller support, small looping soundtrack, walking simulator gameplay, repetitive settlements, bad animations, horrendous combat, inbalanced economy, etc.

I haven't experience very major bugs or kill bugs that ruin the game. 

I saw a negative review I want to touch points on that.

-Hunger/Thirst-

3 days is an entire season - based on that the hunger rates is acceptable. 


-Hunting-

Hunting is relatively easy - two shots with a spear (long range) will kill anything mostly - sometimes you have to shoot 3 or 4 times. Dont bother doing short range with a spear, its practically useless. But nonetheless, I can get about 80 meat in 1 day. 
Hunting is extremely easy and you would expect wolves or bears to have more health, but its like killing a deer. The health of animals needs to be adjusted for added challenge along with spears should be nerfed as its pretty much Overpowered and you don't need a bow.   


This game is very playable with fantastic music to make the game more immersive. Anyone who says otherwise just doesn't know how to play the game. 
As its a EA game, it does have minor bugs but I haven't faced any game killing bugs.",1600743161,1600753211,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True,76561198043903112,263,29,3108,726,1416,1601192794,,
32,76364790,english,"The game is fun, sure. Has survival elements, and a bit of sandbox feel to it when building your house/buildings. The problem starts when you encounter all the bugs. 

-Can't delete a building if you misplace it until you build and complete another one. 
-Side quests uncompletable, (specifically ""night hunt"")
-Thrust with the spear only works when you're basically on top of something
-Mob AI is iffy, they stand still and you can headshot them with spears pretty easy
-putting manure without planting a seed wastes that plot if it isn't used, then you have reuse manure on it 

Downsides to the game that need balancing are the reputation gains with AI. Its too random and for very little. You can get a +5 rep then when you talk to them again you get -5 and you cant talk to them anymore. The tax rate is pretty insane for early game. The game is pretty promising but there are waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay too many things bugged out and unbalanced with the game currently. Beware when buying because you need to walk everywhere so you'll easily exceed the 2 hour limit for a refund. Wait a year or 2 to buy.

Besides, one could argue that it is also unlikely a man would sow clothing in the Middle Ages. So why not have more option for the other gender?

For an early quest, I hadto talk to a hunter in the woods.
Got to him. He says ""Have you ever had an arrow in the knee?""

We laughed. I took my curved sword and killed him. Curved. Swords.

Well just kidding here (except the part of the arrow in the knee, the reference to Skyrim is there).
It is a first person survival medieval game with village building elements, including building your own village as you wish (of course) as well as inviting people to live in your village. Then, you can address roles to each one of them, you need control your food stock, tools, build houses for the newcomers.
Very cool idea, very well developed so far.
Definetely having fun in this early access, being crude as it is now. Looking forward to more updates!

MY PROS
- very good idea of village building + managing
- very nice graphics with good optimization
- nice weather effects like fog in the morning, rain, etc
- grind grind grind - not easy to develop your village at all! - which for me it is a good thing

MY CONS
- NPCs are pretty much dead. They just walk around and do some activities
- Dialog to get more ""charisma"" is terrible. Need to guess which sentence they will like. Example, saying ""hey, nice day for fishing aint it? huhu"" can give you +10 with an NPC, but can give -5 with other. Totally luck
- Yes, bugs and glitches. 
- Cut trees faster not working
- No horses. 1/3 of the time you spend walking

The other biggest thing I could say about this game is it doesn't feel empty. With some other ""survival"" based games, you can feel isolated and alone. The NPC's seem to give this game some soul and even though it's not voiced, it feels more immersive than some bigger games.

67,76358785,english,"I want so badly for this to be a good game, but as others have stated: in its current condition, I can't recommend this game. 

The Good:
- It's pretty relaxing; there are no immediate threats. 
- Inspection mode is a super cool tool! Please expand to include a bit more functionality! 
- The landscape and assets look pretty good; the water also looks amazing. 
- The reputation system with the npcs provide an interesting weight to how you behave in villages. Please expand!

The Bad: 
- Combat seems highly unbalanced. Spear are better than bows at thrown range, but have a laughably small melee reach. I hope I'm not the only one who expects a spear to have longer reach than a dagger. 
- Food becomes a noticeable nuisance very quickly, as in please don't make me hunt two large animals (and cook them) per day. Shouldn't I have other things to do?
- Too few options for interacting with the villagers including but not limited to the vital reputation quests, random lines in order to raise their impression of you, wife fostering lines, etc. 

The Annoying: 
- I liked the soundtrack the first... two times I listened to it? But it's short enough that it becomes too repetitive too quickly. 
- There is no way to rebind the key controls. 
- Consistent movement and action bugs (suddenly can't crouch, jump, or sprint until you re-launch the game). 
- Please... add a bit more stone you can pick up by hand into the landscape. It doesn't need to be Ark levels of stone gathering, but spending 10 minutes looking for a single stone to finish crafting... feels bad.

Overall this game has the skeleton framework of what it's trying to accomplish, but without some serious re-balancing and quality of life changes, it will never get there.

Yes, it is buggy, but the Developers are amazing & tackle the bugs right away!  There's been several hot fixes, at times more than one a day even through the weekend.  

Not only are the devs constantly addressing bugs, but they've also snuck in some quality of life fixes, too. If you're put off by EA games b/c of poor devs but have your eye on this game & that's why you're here, don't be afraid!  This is a great team.  They even communicate!  Amazing!!  

Back to the game...

If you played Banished, you'll find this game eerily similar. I'm seeing some of the same concepts that are in Banished implemented in this game. There's a similar path for your villagers to follow in crafting/manufacturing that you find in Banished.  

For example, building placement is important as it is in Banished.  You have to place your forester's hut (wood shed in this game) in the forest.  

There's storage/crafting buildings that are part of a chain in the crafting/manufacturing process, as is found in Banished. 

You want villagers placed in jobs to best utilize their skills.  Same applies in this game. 

Your villagers need access to food & firewood to be happy.  

In a lot of ways, this game is like walking & living among your village in Banished & that is something I always wanted to do!

Building your own village is fun!  It's sandbox-ish in regards to being able to place buildings where you want, creating your own village layout.  Even though you are using static blueprints for your housing, you have options to change the building materials & can edit the exterior walls, window & door placements (minus the workshops - those are completely static).  You can upgrade your homes, too (again, eerily similar to Banished).

As you level up your skills (done through using skills), you unlock upgraded buildings (crafting stations/storage/homes), which unlocks schematics that you can purchase to craft more advanced items.  You also unlock more crafting/manufacturing buildings this way, too, advancing along the path the dev's intended.

Having villagers help farm supplies is amazing!  The typical grind found in survival/crafting games is drastically reduced, giving you time to do quests, recruit more villagers, build, craft, & work on your romantic relationship(s).  

The graphics are very good & immersive! I love how you can even watch the NPC's interact with it.  

The seasons are currently short, but there are thoughtful reasons why.  However, they do plan to either give us an option to change their length or plan to lengthen them, overall.  Not sure which, other than it's being talked about.  Currently, the seasons are only 3 days long. I'm finding that to not be as much of a drawback as I first thought it would be due to how things are implemented/impacted by the seasons. 

The quests are creative!  Sometimes NPC's follow you, sometimes you are following an NPC.  It reminds me of quests in the Elder Scrolls series.  You aren't just rinsing & repeating the same thing over & over again (for the most part).  

I also love how they incorporated reputation into this game (gained via quests).  It matters! It's how you grow as a village.  

There's a lot to say about this game, but I have limited space.  I think I hit the major points, though.  If you do not mind running into a few, temporary bugs, I can definitely recommend this game.

93,76351736,english,"I adore this game! The stunning visual of this open-world survival RPG game adds a nice touch as the players explores the grassland, forest and the mountain regions from sunrise to sundown. I think the in-game graphics is comparable to larger titles such as the Witcher 3. There are no monsters or evil villains in this medieval times, you are simply a peasant who lost his homeland to war, and now you are starting out fresh at a new village. 

The game offers 4 seasons, with each season lasting for 3 in-game days. Similar to other survival games on the market, you have a hunger/thirst/health/stamina meter bar at the bottom left of the screen. You can drink water via nearby rivers and streams, and you can set up traps or hunt for food. While most wild animals you encounter early on are harmless, wolves/bears will aggro if you get too close and chase you down, so prepare a few wooden spears before you go explore. You can take out almost every animal with a single head-shot with a few exception.

Two complaints I have: 
1. The villagers in this game looks very similar to one another. The only way to tell them apart at times is by their hairstyles, height and their age. It's also frustrating when you are ready to court/flirt with one of the ladies, and they turned out to be married or underage. A lot of the eligible bachelorettes just look plain bland and unmemorable. 
2. The lack of items to steal from NPC. One of the fun elements in an RPG game for me is to browse the storage of other NPC's houses, and see what valuables are worth taking. The moral dilemma of whether to steal is also fun as it usually have an effect/consequences on the player's reputation/relationship with the NPCs. However, in this game, almost all of the storage boxes in people's houses are empty with the exception of one box that had some farming tools in it. You can steal the crops right in front of the NPCs and they wouldn't bat an eye. This all made this game less interactive, and less fun.

This game allows me to run around doing small tasks for people while also building up my own town and surviving in the medieval times. I get to do this at my leisure without the constant issue of running into some asshole who feels the need to kill me or destroy everything I worked hard to create and gather. 
This game seems to play alot like Skyrim in first person.
The graphics are beautiful in my opinion. The devs have done a great job creating the world in this game. The character models look very good too, but lack many differences and could probably use some more tweaking to make it feel like your actually talking to a different person with each interaction. I don't mind that I have to read the dialogue as I play alot of games like that, but voice acting at some point would be a great addition to this game for a more immersive feel. Some of the sound effects are pretty generic but I have not run into the issue of hearing things repeat over and over as some have mentioned in their reviews. One bug that i find completely hilarious is the floating towns people at times. When you approach a campfire in a town and see a person in the sitting position floating in the air, that shit is hilarious. 
There seems to be a decent amount of game in the woods for hunting, though more diversity there would be fun. The required blows to kill the animals seems about right and the process of hunting so far isn't that bad. 
Controls seem to work pretty flawlessly and i really appreciate that. I use a combination of ps4 controller and M/K because that's just how I play and is switches perfectly between the 2 with no issues. 
Sometimes when cutting down a tree it takes a few extra swings to make the connection which is slightly annoying but not a huge issue as I'm sure they will tweak the collision for that at some point. 
I really hope there are mounts at some point because running through the map can seem very tedious at times and a horse or something would really help, not to mention they were a pretty regular part of life back then.

Physics need a little love, as you can jump very high, items roll downhill too fast and fallen trees move too easily. Water displacement when player is moving looks amazing, swiming not yet implemented. 
Soundtrack is beatifull as well, wolves will freeze your blood at night and ambience is pretty immersive. Your footsteps are also enabled on right or left channels, depending on the direction you're walking and head position - thought that was original.

Anyways now to judge 

Pros
Good Game play
Awesome Graphics
Decent Story 
Huge Map 
Tricky game but worth it 
A lot of things to do and still more to come

Cons
Animation needs work still real good 
Needs Horses cause walking and running is a pain especially going to  far place
No Carts to carry more things 
To hard to gain relationships to get settlers
To hard to get a women to like you enough to marry

51,76334989,english,"This game is absolutely addictive! With that said, it has some rough patches being in early access. 

Economy
The economy is a little wonky. For example, you can make a pair of thick leather gloves, which cost 20 leather, that sell for 35 gold. Or you could sell the 20 leather for 40 gold. Even if you have a worker collecting materials, you profit more in sewing by selling the materials than a crafted item.

Picking berries, mushrooms, herbs and gathering sticks becomes a way of life because it is easy money. 

Quests and Dynasty Points
Some quests are just plain buggy. Either they don't go to your quest journal or you can't turn them in. I'm currently 8 seasons into a game where one of the main quests (Alwyn's Story) never showed up. I am not going to restart my game until they do another update on quest fixes.

Dynasty Points are tough to get with quests being so far and few between and the payout only being 1-5 Dynasty Points per quest. Additionally, the Quest markers on the map are sporadic. Sometimes they show a quest available in a town, sometimes they don't (although there is actually a quest available). Currently, the best method for finding a quest is to visit each individual town. 

Challenge Quests - I have yet to see one of these. 

Despite these issues, this is a really fun game! I have faith that the developers will fix the problems. 

Tips: 

- Get Inspect Mode Buffs ASAP. They make foraging easier as well as avoiding aggressive animals. 
- When travelling long distance to a town, gather sticks, herbs and mushrooms along the way. There is a vendor in every town. Sell off everything and make a profit from your journey. 
- Always keep a few spears on you as they tend to break. If an aggressive animal rushes you and all your spears break, an axe works at melee. (So do other tools)
- Selling berries is easy money, but save some in your chest at home. They don't rot and some quests call for berries out of season. 
- If you have to make a long trip to a town before you can afford or make a waterskin, take a route along a stream. Most towns have a water source nearby.",1600701416,1600701416,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True,76561198030022691,47,1,8125,5440,1974,1601876365,,

The wolfs should be hunting YOU, yet you can walk up to one pat it on the head or poke it with your amazing wooden spear a couple of times to wake it up before you get any type of attention.

When you finally get the attention of a wolf you can out run them leaving them wondering how a human at only level 3 with no extra movement speed.

I did not even want to think what the rebel attacks would be like on the AI on the animals...

So, for some nice points of the game. The building side is not bad at all when it comes to placing your first house. And it is nice that the game has money and shops in the game to buy some cows, and things.

There is a lot of potential for this game, but as a survival building game, it's not bad for a people who havent plaid or cant play Ark Survival Evolved and need a more simple game.

Firstly I do want to point out that it definitely needs more work, there are a number of bugs such as animations and resources, however I would like to point out that within 2 or 3 days quite a few patches have been released solving quite a few bugs.

The game is very playable and quite robust. I the grind is very enjoyable, chopping down trees, hunting for animals, building structures all feels rewarding when you complete your first few buildings and it continues that rewarding feeling when you've started your own village and getting people recruited.
The leveling system/technology mechanic is also intriguing and with some continued development can become a rather unique mechanic.

The dynasty part of the game is also one of my favourite mechanics. I am not only an ageless character that lives on no matter what but can choose a wife, have kids and build a dynasty. The children will carry on the legacy has been built by their ancestors.

There are some things that need improvement and somethings that are missing completely. Firstly, you can only walk and run... No horses, no carts (from what I have seen) and no way to set up productions lines between buildings or villages. Secondly, actually communicating and convincing people to join your village seems more tedious that it should be. It should not be as easy as ""hello, join my village"" but having to go back and forth everyday trying to convince a npc to join your village and then the npc may not be there the next day and then you have to start all over again, it gets quite annoying.

It's kind of slow paced, as you have to gather your resources to build different buildings around your settlement, but it feels rewarding when you accomplish them.

But the words pop up on the screen right away, and you don't have to wait for them to scroll, so you can skip it if your not interested it what they have to say.

Currently they don't have much in the way of tutorials, so you have to figure out some stuff on your own, but they do have a lot of information you can read through in one of the menus. A lot of the basic stuff is kind of easy to figure out, like basic crafting of things( ex: stone axe, rabbit cage, etc. ), but the town management is a little confusing ( not knowing which buildings to build in the correct order, and which ones to assign the workers too at the beginning ).

Others, can be a bit game breaking like being unable to plant more seed on plowed fields. All that aside, I have been playing this game for a few days now. I like the system it has in place, managing villagers and the diplomacy feature reminds me of oblivion but, it also can be abused. For instance you can just reload a save if you don't get the correct responses, and even though I had like 15 % on my marriage chance I just did this until she said yes. I also abuse the unstuck feature to just teleport to the middle of the map, and do this frequently since my base is near by it rather than lose half a day walking back, cause the days are too short. I would say there is a real game here though and I noticed a lot of survival games lacks things to do other than survive and build a pretty base if it doesnt have open world pvp.                                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                      
 For a single player game survival game it has a surprising amount of things to do.  I do feel the seasons and passing of time needs to be balanced, longer days and nights and more of them. A gripe that in winter the water isn't frozen. That could be a mechanic on its own, ice-fishing? Thin ice, you fall in and it lowers your temp by a huge amount. There could be more transparency with the upgrade path. An example. I had to ask a forum on how to get salted meat, cause I couldn't find that information anywhere.

61,76303880,english,"For the time being I'll not recommend it. YET!

The game looks very good and i definitely see a lot of potential here. Thing is that as far as the survival goes, this is a very unbalanced, hard to crack nut at times. Producing food, for example via hunting, is overly difficult. You may almost lose your life to a boar or waste several spears on a buck and then still go very much hungry after roasting and eating both animals. 

The tools also are extremely aggrevating. You need several trees to make some single tools and then they break in no time - it interrupts the flow of the game to an unnerving degree. Wanna build a house? well - chop abput ten trees and then three more for the tools you'll need just to finish that.

At the moment this is a stat-bar-maintenance-simulator and weapons-are-made-of-glass type of game, which hinders progress just a tad too much. 

Building your settlement, your dynasty, also feels a still steep still. You keep getting missions to build houses, workshops, storages etc. without really needing them. spent about a year - so about twelve days - building, gathering, hunting and then building some more and suddenly I'm supposed to pay more than 300 coins in taxes. trying to convince people to join the village also was rather tedious and when i got someone to come along, she left after three days without having done anything in the job I assigned her to.

The daily updates and tweaks are a promising thing though. If the Devs keep it up, I am absolutely convinced they'll turn this into something very worth playing!

Some suggestions to close with: 
-Maybe make it possible for a player to have some time to scout and get into the different mechanics before he has to settle down. The game feels a bit rushed in that regard.
-Specialising the village at one's own pleasure would be nice. I'd like to be a fisherman rather than  being a hunter? Let me do that then instead of forcing me down all the other crafts and industries first. 
-I know that wooden tools cannot - and should not - be as durable as stone or iron ones. But it would make for a much more gratifying experience to not be forced to either limit your carrying capacity with a load of tools or constantly pause to craft new tools when out foraging. Spears are a particular problem there - it's very annoying if you stab a pig three times to have your spear break and then having to fell an entire tree just to make new ones - which is really tricky if you stumple across more than one boar or wolf...
-think about the random nature of the interactions with NPCs. It's so annoying to have pretty much no control over how to engratiate yourself with the people you'd potentially want to marry or get to be your villagers.

Keep it up!

64,76303185,english,"Surprisingly competent. It's an Unreal Engine game and especially during dawn and dusk visuals can look stunning. No complains about optimization either. Game run smooth at all times with no stutters. I'm yet to experience a crash either. Honestly, game is technically in a better place than any Bethesda game has ever been. 

What this game is hard to describe. It's is a weird combination of Bannerlord, Witcher, The Sims and Banished. It's scope is pretty ambitious and so far the execution is pretty good too. There are few raw edges. The UI can definitely use some polish. It's clearly designed with controller support in mind. Which is not really suitable for these type of games. I get the studio needs to make as much money as possible but having a single UI for console and PC didn't work for Skyrim. It doesn't work for this either. 

The quests are just weird. They should be adding to immersion. Instead they are pure immersion breakers. I'll assume they are just placeholder and will be replaced.

If i had to guess i'd say the native language of the game isn't English. Quite a few weird phrases and grammatical errors in text. Not a big deal. They can fix those slowly. 

While it's definitely not release quality, i'd confidently recommend this game if you're into medieval life simulators. Even in it's current state, it'll provide you with at least 8-10 hours of enjoyment and considering so far the devs have released at least one patch every day I'd say it's not gonna be an abandonware either. 

I don't think the developer will be able to implement all of the systems they are hinting at but when you're aiming for the stars, even if you fall short, you still go further than anyone else. In these days where ""open world"", ""early access"" and ""survival"" have become synonymous with cancer, it's great to see someone still hasn't given up on genre. 

I'll watch this games development with interest. It truly has a chance to become a sleeper hit like Banished. As a developer myself, i'd say this game still need about a year and a half to become truly release quality but they have built a great foundation.

70,76302136,english,"So I'm not normally one to review games (you can check my profile, I've only ever reviewed Rust), but this game makes me feel the need to write one, in a good way.

First off, Dev. team? You guys are the greatest. This game is like a cross between Banished and Kingdom Come: Deliverance. Even on lower graphics settings, the game still looks phenomenal. Sure, there are some things that are missing, and it's not as in depth as it could be, but let me stress this point. This game is EARLY ACCESS.

I REPEAT: EARLY. ACCESS. If you don't know what that means, or understand what that means and don't like it, do NOT buy this game. It gets annoying to read negative reviews that complain of bugs, missing features, and things that could be added or improved upon. My dudes, be constructive. Suggest things politely, and thank the development team for their work. Now, for my review:

This game does a pretty great job of combining survival and resource management with sandbox building. I'm still very new into this game, but I'm already enthralled with what's currently in the game, and very much anticipating what's to come. MD will humble you. Don't believe me? Go chuck a spear at a bear (10/10 would do again). The game does a good job of guiding you on the basics of building construction and town management, without holding your hand in a way that would make it mindless and boring.

I will say, as I mentioned above, there are some bugs and missing features. Just this morning, I discovered one of the villagers of Borowo was practicing witchcraft when she zoomed into the air, then warped back down onto one of the house roofs. Some of the perks don't work, some of which the devs know about and some they don't (like after I construct a new axe, sometimes it doesn't apply my 10% woodcutting speed buff).

Devs, again, thank you for what is already an absolutely stellar game. IF you guys are interested, I have a few ideas that I will happily elaborate on them (like, rather than making the seasons have more days, just make the individual days longer!), and I have noticed a couple bugs (like the Animal Overcrowding quest not having anything to do), but I also haven't looked for a ""Bug Reporting Thread"" or anything just yet, so that's probably on me. :)

I hope it progresses to be so much more but am happy thus far. I do hold similar wishes that they extend the seasons by maybe 2-3 days. I also don't understand where they were going with their item value system. I understand it's early access and many things are possibly being looked over, but skinning an animal results in getting meat, leather and fur. From that, I hope they incorporate a tanning system for skins instead of them just automatically becoming leather, but I don't understand why neither leather or fur in the game are of high value to any merchants. Not only are they not high, but extremely poor value to merchants. Furs, if not leathers as well, are highly valued commodities in this time period and I hope they make the effort in reflecting that. They seem to do so when you start to make fur clothing and can sell it to merchants, but the furs themselves would still be very valuable. Hopefully they include specific furs along the way for more value, as bear and wolf would be more sought after for their difficulty of acquiring. But, like I said, the game is awesome so far and I've only run into one quest so far that I've had troubles with (killing 2 wolves at night for a town. The missions states it needs to be done at midnight and then i wait forever to do it which drains my food and water just standing there and there's what seems to be a wolf den just right next to the village for the quest but I search the entire den and no wolves. So, i loaded back and searched all around it. No wolves. And around the villages next to it at night. Still no wolves. Interesting quest to be given when they seem to have no wolf problem at all. Lol) and it isn't that big of a deal. Hopefully this brings awareness to the developers if these things haven't already been brought to their attention or they've noticed on their own accord.

Unfortunately, this one needs to bake in the oven a bit more before I play again. The main issue is the day / season time. 

EVERYTHING feels rushed and is about 3 times faster than it should be. How fast food decreases, how fast time goes, and the seasons only last 3 days. It seriously feels like the developers sped up the game speed to test the seasons and then forgot to turn it off. I started the game, explored the village and then started looking around for a spot to start my village. Before I could even do any real scouting, the first day was over. So 1/3 of the Spring season was gone and I wasn't even sure where I wanted to live. So I sprinted around the 2nd day until I found a flat part and built like a mad person. Barely got my house built on day 2 and then was planting crops on day 3 in the dark before it turned into summer, since some crops can only be planted in the spring. Just way, way too rushed. 

It also suffers from the balance issues that a lot of other survival games like this have, where they make it artificially hard by making food worth hardly any nurtional value. For example, you can kill a big buck and you'll get 3 or 4 meat. When you cook that meat, each piece will be worth 5 or 6 food (out of 100). So an entire stinking deer barely even registers as a snack. 

Overall though, I can deal with the minor bugs and the other balancing issues but the speed demon day / seasons timers are just a deal breaker. It's not fun and I honestly, truly cannot comprehend how the developers thought that was a good idea.

For an Early Acces game. The game is really well done. The sound in the game is a bit on/off and form time to time it feels like there is no sound.

When you pass through the seasons. (3 days per season) perhaps a bit short but it makes the world alive. I don't think the seasons could be longer than 4 or 5 days... The ""Fruits"" of nature is changing - if you collect berries in spring that will kill you - in the summer a nice feast and healty for you. Collect to sell or add to the chest and you have them for the winter. In the fall collect mushrooms to eat and store for winter. Make spears and go hunting for deer, boars, rabbits, bisons, wolfs... so you can get fur and leather form which you can craft all sort of usefull stuff.  

Don't think you can make everything the first year. You can't rush it. Play the game as RPG take you time to enjoy the colours the seasons have (Green, more green, colours of fall, snow), talk to people, flirt, trade and make quests. And slowliy build your reputation among the people and start your own town.

- nice graphics
- snow crunching sound good

- economy in shambles
- day/season system too fast
- the whole talking/romancing system is shit. it's all time-gated guesswork.

It feels like it needs some sort of follower/ companion count that you go through before getting to the village one, the ability to assign them simple tasks and share a resource pool without having to build a billion buildings and micromanage their needs too much.

18,76293230,english,"Okay, so this game is great!  I waited to review until I have 20H in to get a real review.
I want to start by saying those people with <10H complaining about food, just don't know how to play.  By the end of the second year, my little village with four people had over 6,000 calories of food in the storage.  Just don't eat cooked meat with nothing else, add in some onions or carrots and your cal count goes way up.  Honestly, with a rabbit trap, you can basically survive without hunting.

Okay, the good:
-Right level of difficulty.  Nothing comes easily, but nothing is that difficult.  You have to make choices and work towards what you want to accomplish.  With limited villages and limited buildings until you complete quests, you have to pick and chose.  However, you can do everything, it just takes more time.
-Graphics are great
-Sound is great
-The whole dynasty with getting married and having kids and passing it all down is great!  My family is about to have a kid.
-The pacing.  Many people complain that there is short day and only 3 days per season.  This is actually good.  If you drag out the days and seasons, then you lose out on all the crops growing and harvesting.  People must be used to games where you can cut down 47 trees, process the wood, and build 6 buildings in one day.  This feels more realistic.  It may take a day and a half to build a bigger building and that is okay.  Time goes on and you can keep building the next day and then the crops are actually growing.  You drag it out and sure you can get more done, but you also lose a big part in the farming pacing.

Things that could use improvement:
-Storage, storage, storage.  There never seems to be enough.  It looks like it is currently turned off for some buildings that makes it playable, but if they ever turn that on, it is going to STINK.  I feel your house and all the buildings should have an extra 0 on the end of their storage numbers.
-Progression track, a minor issue with pacing to get manure.  Basically you need to farm a ton to be allowed to get pigs.  20H in I still don't have pigs.  However, to farm a ton you need manure to farm.  So, the only thing you can do is pay a TON to buy it and use it.  It isn't a game breaker, but it is for sure a concern point.  With today adding the ability to destroy farms, maybe until then you can destroy and make new farms to make it work.  I'll check it out.
-Some quest are impossible based on season if you don't have things like berries stored.  Forcing you to lose dynasty points at the end of the season.
-Hunting deer is a little too difficult.  I basically don't do it unless a quest makes me.  Boars are 10x easier and takes 10x less time, same with Bison.
-Bows: basically your stamina runs out instantly and makes bow hunting useless.  Now to mention it does less damage than spears.  I leave the bow at home and run around with 4x spears and hunt very well.

I might have listed a lot, but these aren't deal breakers and need tweeks more than entire reworks.  Totally worth playing.

Things I haven't tested out yet:

-How animals work?
-How does fishing work?",1600625667,1600625667,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True,76561198030839836,1203,17,3087,964,1258,1601147465,,

Pros:
 1. Beautiful world with a variety of vegetation and trees to explore
 2. Depth to the building system.
 3. City management features such as commanding followers to create specific items you want to sell with neighboring villages. 
 4. Fun quests that are meaningful to development. 
 5. Devs are updating and bug fixing though I have experienced only a couple, they are already fixed. 
 6. Strong and clear roadmap for coming months with exciting upcoming features. 
 7. Robust progression and trait system keeps you entertained for many hours.

Cons
 1. Keep in mind: alpha, but lack of dialogue content with villagers is illogical and just silly most the time.
 2. Animal tendencies and frequency can be frustrating especially the wolves quests
 3. Lack of general points of interest in the wilds, only villages are important and unlike KCD no real points of interest so exploration is mainly for mining or killing bears and wolves.
 4. The knowledge section could use a lot more help to guide players in the managing of villagers working for you as well as how to salt meat :) Maybe personal problem but I figured it out no thanks to internet :)

Overall, very addictive albeit simple game, but a lot of things to do and the dynasty system should make it a long term game.

- involved in every aspect of the game, always something new to do

- story waits for you so you can progress at your own pace and focus on the things that interest you

Cons: 
- limited information regarding missions, need to know which missions need to be completed in a time frame etc 
- really, really need some sort of wagon

the game has great potential, the whole idea of ​​surviving its dynasty in the Middle Ages is great, I played about 20 hours but for now it has a lot of disadvantages like:
forests should have more life and more wild, you should insert horses and donkeys in the late period of development of your village to help with travel and crarrying stuff, walking through the water is very unrealistic as swimming in that era, building homes and other buildings is fun but the buildings or terrain should adapt to each other because if I wish make a house or a farm on uneven ground I can't build it. I had problems with the farm I can't delete it or if it would be more realistic it just doesn't allow building on it. my workers I put to work don't contribute anything to my village like logs and food which are very important, there are a lot of bugs with farm as well, as with manure which can only be placed by npc. all in all the game requires a lot of work and I believe it will come out in one of the best medieval games.",1600623702,1600623702,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True,76561198858044410,9,1,1097,15,858,1600949971,,
27,76291536,english,"Definitely has potential, but isn't worth playing yet. The game is too slow and the arbitrary limits are frustrating.
I spent an entire season running around picking up feathers to make arrows because you can only have one bird trap. I can't finish the quest to build a barn because I've already built 8 buildings and can't build any more. What's worse is I don't even need half of the buildings because their crafting options overlap with other buildings and even your character's own crafting options. The weight limit is mostly reasonable but when you need to be holding 10 logs to even start building a tavern, you're going to be walking around at half a mile per hour praying you find a place flat enough to place it some time today. The economy is super weird; venison is worth as much as a single berry but if you strap some rocks to sticks, you can sell a stone axe for a lot. The trade penalty is sharp and doesn't make sense for trading goods in a village. Progression is slow and arbitrary; you cant buy the bow blueprint until you've picked enough stuff up off of the ground.

5 things that would improve this game that devs could do in excel:
 - Keep weight the same, but make building placement free and make building the foundation/ frame cost the building's original cost. Also, increase the durability of the wooden hammer.
 - Reduce the trade penalty to 20% and have a charisma node that's 5% reduction of the trade penalty that you can take 4 times.
 - Spend some time balancing what things sell for with their effort or rarity. What players hunt or grow should be worth less than what they pick up off the ground.
 - Get rid of the trap limit
 - Remove redundant buildings. (players get tricked into wasting effort and it feels bad)

Overall, you can see the blatant ways the developers have slowed down and drawn out the game and honestly, I'm mostly fine with it. I need to do some work for my reward; its a good game model. But the roadblocks are too harsh and make no sense. I think this game could be fixed by changing the numbers.

29,76289871,english,"This is a really enchanting game. It's pretty complex so there is a learning curve and being early access the devs are still ironing the game out. I know a lot of folks are squeaking about introducing raids, bandits and whatall but this this is really not that kind of game, and my advice to them would be to go and play Kingdom Come Deliverance or something similar. Even in early access it's already pretty solid, surprisingly so. Basically you start as an orphaned young guy fleeing from war and you arrive in this area with pretty much the clothes on your back and little else. I've only got fifteen hours but the objective is to found and manage a new village, find a wife and spawn an heir and thus ensuring your line. Graphics are great, there;s the odd floating person or object, but that is the Unreal engine, not the programmers fault. The soundtrack is in my opinion, pleasant but indifferent, but then I'm a guy who usually turns game music off, unless it serves to warn you of impending danger, HZD is a good example of this. Gameplay is easy and responsive, social interactions can be a bit unpredictable but then again aren't they usually... At this point you can't redefine but the keys are very standard so this is not at all a problem. Like I said before, this is not a hack and slash, and I would be disappointed if it became one, but having said that, there are enough wild animals around to pump up the heartbeat. Hunting is great once you've mastered it. At this point I'm still doing it with a pointy stick but I take down bison and wolves fairly easily despite that. There are things I'd like to see changed, for example the seasons are too short and you literally devour a deer in one meal, hopefully that will be addressed.

Saying this is a mesh of KCD and (Insert Thing Here) So far isn't accurate. 6 hours in and i've yet to meet a combat challenge outside wolves (if you don't sneak up on them), or complex reciept that took some time and thought to craft (ala your alchemy skill in KCD).  KCD is all about the simulation. Taking a second to open doors, and watching your character actually reach out to do so. Picking a bunch of herbs then finding a book (after learning how to read, of course) and learning how to combine them, using which methods, to get the result you want.

This is more like what Life is Feudal would be if it was wholly first person, sprinkled in some Stardew Valley management tasks and skimped on the dialog. This feels like what you'd build if you was creating a new lands mod for Skyrim, and wanted to eschew the robust systems already there, and focus the player on the actual day to day of the common folk. 

  None of this is bad, mind you. It is surprisingly stable for a 0.1.0.5 version, the dialog exists, systems of both diplomacy and village building all exist. But they seem to be a bit obscure and buried a bit deep underneath the surface for your average person. It's graphically pleasing and will scratch that itch for the ""one more day"" type of gameplay that many people find addictive.

 However; If you aren't ready for a long-haul of trail and error updates, missing features, and a slightly boring loop. This game might be a miss (unless it's 50% or more off). There's a weather system that i've experienced a grand total of 1 time. Your day/night cycle exists- but so far it's only purpose seems to be existing, and frankly a stopping point for your daily progress (as npcs largely just refuse to speak to you at night. The night is dark enough to put a big hamper on activity, and thus far i've found nothing that is specifically nocturnal). Speaking of progress- Seasons do change, which determines your entire planting/harvesting/farming cycle. But because they last a grand total of 3 days/nights, the season changes seem perfunctory at best, and hampering/restrictive at worst. 

  Now i've given it a thumbs up, but told you here not to buy it: Yes. That is correct. I've lost 6 hours in 2 days with this game. Getting into the groove of survival is satisfying. Questing (yes there are various quests available) is satisfying so far. The base loop is going to be boring for most, the path forward for progression is gonna seem too obscure and hidden behind layers for most. The lack of facial animations and low-tier AI behavior is gonna turn most off. But underneath all of this crunchy nonsense is a gooey center that delights all the right portions of my brain. If the devs treat this game right, expand on and adjust the core loop, and really lean into the simulation side of this game (ala KCD), this could find it's little corner and dominate it.

I've just hit the 30 hr mark and it's all ticking along nicely so far, I decided to jump in without reading too much about the game as I wanted to see how intuitive it is. 

While it is a complex game, the Dev team have made it so much fun to play, and the depth of gameplay just keeps you coming back for more.

So far in my 1st 30 hours of play I've relocated my 'farm' 3 times.  It's a case of play and learn to do things better, one thing that I did find frustrating was the lack of a delete option for the farm tiles, but then I discovered if you just don't use the tile it will eventually return to normal land after a period of in-game time has passed at which point it reverts to regular terrain again.

I have found some quirks with the conversation dialog in the game, I've noted the dialog doesn't consider that some of the NPC's have joined your village and the option to invite them to join your group remains available when they are already in your group,  it's nothing game breaking, just something that seems unnecessary, I'm sure over time things like this will get ironed out.

74,76280640,english,"I think for an early access title this is probably the most solid I’ve every played. In fact, I think it’s one of, if not the best. 
The gameplay, although slow and grindy is really soothing and everything you work for has some sort of pay off. You’re always working for something, and I think that’s where this game shines. The skill trees are daunting at first but if you take a while to read carefully and explore the menus, it’s simple to understand. I’m heavily invested, and I think I will be for a very long time. 

One thing to keep in mind before buying into this is that it is extremely slow in terms of progression. There are survival elements like nourishment and hydration, which at the current stage is little unbalanced. It runs out too quick, and you need to eat A LOT if you want to fill your hunger bar up. Eating I don’t think replenishes your health, if it does it’s very slow, with a plant being the main way to heal. This has only hit steam so it’s not really a gripe, it’s just something to keep in mind. 

The graphics are good, however it’s a little taxing on ultra for my 1070, 4790k and 16gb of RAM. My PC is old though but if you have a similar setup, I have my game on medium with post processing off/low. It runs smooth even in high populated areas, and the game is still pretty to look at. (But I’d love to see it on Ultra of course)
Controls and UI are a little janky and clunky, the crafting menu however is really intuitive and easy to open and navigate, I’d like the ability to use items like food in there though, instead of having to press tab and use the food menu. Just so I can eat on the run.

I have no real negatives for this game, I think all the things I’ve stated above are simply teething issues, but I haven’t had any game breaking issues. Haven’t felt the need to rage quit. If you learn it, you’ll have a pretty chill time.

List of things I didn't like:
1. The water in the lakes isn't very deep, would love to swim or atleast have an O2 meter when I get submerged into the water.
2. Days are too short, you get a few days each season, so you kinda have to rush things a little.
3. The animals AI for pathing and running around needs to be checked, sometimes the wolves will run to a place and just spam their howl.
4. Noticed some of the villagers might be witches. Saw some of the kids levitate over their beds while sleeping, some of them also had their eyes open while sleeping. Rather interesting lol
5. Meat gives you few ""starvation"" points, so you end up spamming the F button while eating meat, I quickly went onto making stew instead so I didn't have to break my F key.
6. Some of the texts and descriptions have to be looked over. Not many issues here, but I still had some situations where the text annoyed me cause of lack of info.

- Diplomacy with people is non existing, illogical and boring, impossible to get people to move to your village! The reaction to some conversation options are dum, and the reactions sometimes weird.

-Dialogue for NPCs are really not existent and the quest options are few/far between and often times buggy to the point where you are unable to complete the quest. Not even reloading can fix this issues and it hurts to run around for an hour for a quest just to fail it due to a bug. 
-The skill tree needs refinement, and the points/level up system is a HUGE grind. Some skills are still in development and not implemented.  
-As others have pointed out, playing the game feels extremely rushed due to the season being three days and the day night cycle being quick. You cannot stop to look and enjoy the games very pleasing atmosphere or else you waste valuable time.

-Taxes on my buildings or structures/farm plots. I would be fine with this IF the villages who live in the houses I BUILT paid some sort of tax to me. Why am i footing the bill?

Farm to get more blueprints for farming.
Hunt to get more blueprints for hunting.

Building feels satisfying enough, but the only flaw is once you build at a location. It is semi-permanent.

The Gathering of material feels good, where you need stamina and energy to gather. But there's a small problem with the weight system. I understand is close to a real life scale. but when i gotta build a Dynasty please don't put a cap on it.
When you don't give me a way to lug all the logs with a cart or a horse to carry it.

The quest though, simple but due to traveling from Point A to get quest and Point B to do a Task. Takes a long time... Due to how much time it takes to walk on foot to travel.

There is not enough time for you to actually do quest and effectively build a Dynasty. The time cycles are just too short.

The graphics are excellent (thank you so much for using Unreal and not a different engine!) and there are zero issues there. It is optimized very well and does not suffer from any of the 'usual' tears/streaking/etc that many other games do.
The survival system and crafting are both straightforward, and although it is fun as is, there is a bit of a learning curve as you discover through trial and error how to exactly unlock new technology and implement it.
Hunting is basic, and I do hope there are additions made (like lures/scents). Crouching does not seem to have an effect on hunting, but I could be wrong.
The animations of animals and people throughout the world are very basic, but I am hopeful that that will change as the game develops. It would be great to have it voiced, or at least have some background ambiance sounds from the townspeople and tavern.
The quest system is basic but good because it works. In this day and age, that is more than can be said for some AAA games.

9,76270568,english,"So firstly I would like to point out that I see most of the bad reviews (the few that there are) complains about the nutritional value of food, the speed of seasons and how difficult it is to get people to live in your village. I have not been playing that long, around 13 hours total, and I already have enough food to sustain me and the two people living in my village. It is really not that hard to get people to come live with you. You just need to talk to them for a couple of days to get better acquainted with them and have enough dynasty rep (by completing the main challenges or quests) and then bam you have someone to join you.

With regards to the season speed, I think it is slightly too short but saying that you can't get anything done is just an absolute exaggeration. I am getting lots of stuff done in the time that you have each season. At the beginning it might feel a bit short but believe me later when you are actually farming you are going to appreciate it more. Because waiting for example 10 days for a season to change would mean you would have to wait 21 days in order to harvest your crops, which is way too long. I would suggest maybe increasing it to something like 5 days. So that you have 20 days per year.

But besides the ranting above this game is absolutely amazing. The graphics are really nice and polished and I have had almost no bugs. The only bugs I have encountered are NPC bugs where they are for example standing in A pose or they are slightly floating etc. But nothing game breaking. I had the black screen after season change issue but the devs really quickly addressed that and fixed it. 

One thing that I am struggling with is actually getting gold. I can't see a way to access a steady flow of gold early game except for example crafting a bunch of stone axes and selling them. And then all of your technology upgrades cost a whole bunch of gold. So it can be a bit of a grind to get gold to unlock technology. But I guess that comes with the game genre.

A relaxing, atmospheric, realistic, medieval survival/management game. I've been having a blast with it so far and I can absolutely recommend it.

The point of the game is basically to build up your Dynasty (shocking). You interact with other villages, build your own village, find a wife, have an heir, manage resources and production, farm, grow animals, hunt, gather. All while improving your skills, which will let you unlock new perks and blueprints.
I would say that this game is more of a RPG/Management game.

And just to add to this: I saw quite a few people complaining about the ""short"" seasons in this game. Don't be deterred by this. They are long enough (at least 1/2h per day, with 3 days per season) for you to take care of your village, run any errands and explore the world. The games is not a rush! You don't need to have everything built in one year! And if the time wouldn't advance ""fast"" you could never get to play your heir, which is kind of the point of the game.

You cannot do any sort of labor without it being completely depleted, which is INSANELY annoying if you are trying to get across the map in any sort of timely manner, or get any other work done. There are upgrades to make your stamina better for certain activities, but it is still incredibly irritating especially with the amount of tasks you have to constantly being doing.

Next, is the levels/tier system. I like to build what I want, when I want, my way, and the game currently does not allow that what so ever. Do you like to be slightly ahead of the game? Tough. You can only build something when the game says so. My example of this: I apparently got a wife too early in the game because when I assigned her to my house, she automatically started starving to death because there was no ""food storage"" building which mind you I was no where near unlocking. It feels very tight, very structured, restraining. But that is just how it feels to me, you may think it is fine.

It is a work in progress game of course, so I hope it will get better. And as others have said, it is very grindy and rushed and you do not get much time to actually enjoy it.",1600493221,1600577109,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True,76561198194828809,32,2,3601,2397,1204,1601359154,,
35,76260141,english,"Barely 13 hours into this game and I'm already in love with it. The graphics look amazing, the gameplay is nice and smooth and the NPCs are actually diversified! In most games NPCs only come as adults, or maybe with one age range of kids. But in M.D. I have seen late teens, mid teens and preteens all running around which makes the villages so much more believable because I'm not left wondering where everyone is. Granted, I do believe the current towns need to be expanded a little, they are awfully small.

Making money early on is easy peasy. Just grab as many herbs and berries as you can and you're instantly rich. Whenever any tool is about to break, make a new one then sell the old one. 

Combat could use some work, spear #1 goes through the neck and the animal either runs like mad or turns to maul you. Spear #2 goes through both flanks, same thing. But spear #3 goes right through the left eye, the animal sometimes will just flop over but will sometimes slowly start to lumber away or at you. Neck and head shots should be instant kill. But I'd like to see more significant trauma when damage occurs to the legs or torso. If the back legs are taken out, then the animal should not be able to sprint away at full speed and, if the organs are hit, then the animal should run a short to medium distance before bleeding out. Not reappear 3 seasons later with that spear still hanging out of its side.

The base building is amaze balls! But I do have a few issues. Rocks should be added to the craft recipes for the buildings since they do have rock foundations. I'd like to see the various workshops snap to the sides of houses for ease of placement. Crop fields currently sit angled differently than houses and workshops which drives my OCD nuts because my fields are all crooked and I'd also like to see the crop fields terraform the terrain so that the fields are smooth, maybe add a rock retaining wall for crop fields on more angled terrain. 

My biggest concern though is the 3 day seasons. Any side quest not completed by the end of the season is failed, even when I'm on my way back to talk to the quest giver after finishing the task. Given the incredibly short window, that's quite annoying. I'd like to see seasons increased to 7 to 14 days with all side quests spawning by day 3 so there is enough time to complete them before the season change fade to black.

Lastly, I love character creation. It's my favorite aspect of gaming, so I'd like to see a small bit come to M.D. Nothing too crazy, like Bethesda's many sliders.

EDIT: while playing for another 2 and a half hours tonight trying to enjoy what will probably be a fantastic game in the future, I literally crashed 5 times, spent half the time restarting stuff and redoing the same ingame stuff.

44,76258499,english,"This game really does have potential, I like the concept and the feel for it and was genuinley surprised at how the graphics looked. However, there is still a lot of work to be done, but if the developers do it right I'm sure this will be a hit.

After playing for about 45 minutes, here's my take away.

For the more so positive things, the graphics were a nice surprise and a good feel. The camera movement was immersive and felt as if I was actually moving with my character. My favorite part was hunting actually, it was difficult to find animals but that was perfectly fine, because it made me feel as if I had to actually work for it to survive and plan accordingly, when I finally got that kill I felt accomplished. Overall, its a great start to a early game.

Now for what I think needs to be added/modified

Before even getting into the game, I wish there was a male/female option. Not for customization, but just having that option would nice for female players I feel.

First, the AI needs a bit of work. The wildlife, specifically the deer, seem very choppy and have a instantaneous reaction rather than a reactive reaction persay. They just go from 0 to 60 in 0.1 seconds which threw me off a bit, however for the rabbits this felt more appropriate since that is how they react.

Also under this topic, the villagers didn't seem alive really. While I did see some working, and moving about, most of time were locked in place on a seat, or just standing at their front door for the whole day. I don't know, it seemed more like a statue village then a functioning one. Also, I understand this is very early release, but I hope they implement voice acting for more immersion would really take it to the next level.

Speaking of immersion, I think more enviormental sound effects such as wind and such would help a lot. Sound is essential to a feel of a game, and I think there is room to grow a bit. However, the music was a really nice background setting, there might be more tracks that I didn't hear, but I think having some slow music as well would help when your just wondering and such.

In a UI stance, I wish the map showed exactly the quest names next to the ! indicators, that why I could keep track of things. The inventory and initial look was bit overwhelming at first, but I got used to it rather quickly.

Overall this game has a lot of potential like previously said, I think it has a bit of a standard to rise to, but I believe the developers have great plans in mind.",1600573468,1600573468,True,3,0,0.523178815841674805,0,True,False,True,76561198269280374,14,4,48,0,48,1600572690,,

59,76254784,english,"This game is well worth a buy for being Early Access
I am not sponsored nor have any connection to the company or devs of this game but here is my Review.

Pros:
- Graphics 9/10
- Sound 9/10
- Playable 8/10
- Great progression system.
- Alot of Things to do for a early Access game such as Quests, Mining, Hunting, Building, Farming and more.
- Its well Balanced making it not easy but not hard to complete Quests, Gain Exp, Explore and Build
- Whats the graphics like? it is one of most smoothest Clear Realistic Fantasy Detailed graphics
- Shops have a limit that you can buy and sell and also you cant really cheat to make money fast so it keeps it as a progression system which is what i am sure all of us would want.
- The devs of this game are really on top of bug fixing and its so quick and early there one of the most focused Companies to there community from what i have been seeing 


Cons:
- Unfortunately there is only a few cons to this game
- Not enough animals.
- the Seasons are to short but there not so bad.
- Needs more buildings , items and more but i am sure they will be adding alot more :D
- I think it needs a In game time actual time not the bar so like medieval time.
- Multiplayer would be excellent but i do see why they don't have multiplayer!
- Maybe a Workshop feature would be handy for the people out there that wanna add a little more to there games

Things i would love to see implemented into this game:
- Bandits.
- Sandbox Mode , so you can freely build and what ever but in saying so make it a different new game feature.
- Adjusting system to change the seasons, day/night cycles, threats, prices and more.
- Workshop feature so we could possibly add some things to this game that may add new features that devs may not want added only saying this as alot out there may say they want a Medieval school to teach there citizens how to hunt, fish, gather resources etc by doing so it makes there more able to gather anything and have better chances at success or if they don't have that feature it may make this a bit easier once your at that point in game.

You can use deductive reasoning and assume the symbol with the bow and arrow means hunting, and the hammer and anvil mean crafting, but if you see a fish and fishing pole, then a knife and fishing pole, are those symbols also crafting and hunting? Maybe survival?  And maybe there is a smithing skill I don't know about?

I wish the game had more direction and explanation.  And the seasons are stupid short.  And you go hungry way too fast, and have to eat way too much to fill the bar.  I have to kill like 10 rabbits a day to stay fed. Who the fuck eats 10 rabbits in a day, I am not playing jabbah the god damn hut so maybe increase the value of cooked meat for fucks sake. 

The dialogue needs work, there are no voice actors, and you can literally have the same conversation/dialogue response with someone 3x in a row.  So if they like the weather, just keep choosing that as a conversation option and you continue to get conversation points, regardless of how mundane and boring the conversation is.

All of the women look the same, so don't bother trying to find that 18 y/o dime piece for your wife.  You will just find Helga 1 or Helga 2.  The only difference being Helga 1 has black hair and Helga 2 is blonde.

Did I mention the seasons/days are too short? You are playing running simulator 2021 half the season.

The combat system is equivalent to Minecraft's - nothing about it, and can't defend.

No clear way to make money in the game, and way too long to start being able to build your village.  You should have at least 1 villager through a quest in the beginning or something helping you. I didn't get my first villager until about 7 hours of gameplay.  Then they immediately left because I didn't have a food resource building and a normal resource building. 

They don't tell you that you need those buildings by the way until after you recruit a villager.  Then, the mother fucker will leave the very next day and you can't recruit them again.  I found him standing in the middle of a field one season and when I tried talking to him, it said he didn't want to talk to me. K

So 3 hours later, I built the necessary buildings and recruited my first villager - for another 3 hours, I spent the time researching how the fuck to get the villager to do something besides stand there and look at you.

Also, when torch is close to 0 durability, do not make another torch.  The new torch will break almost immediately.  You have to wait until the old torch dies then make a new one.  An annoying bug.

There are other bugs and glitches but I don't have the time and aren't worth mentioning at the moment.  I will update again after more hours of gameplay.


Old: 

I hated the music, so I turned it off.  Now that I had to restart my game, I no longer can turn off the music. Not only is the background music annoying, it is LOUD. You can't hear the environment, or anything else for that matter. I can't adjust the volume whatsoever.  The sliders move, but nothing saves.  Not even the master volume.

How can you release a game and you can't even properly adjust the settings yet?  That's not even half of the issues and bugs with this game.

Great concept, but way too early of a release.

81,76249055,english,"The Game is fun and I enjoy it in most parts, but the balancing issues and some bugs are really frustrating so I can't recommend it at the moment.
Following things need to be improved in my opinion:

- Workers in your village are useless (even after the patch) They need to be heavily improved in order to make them viable.
For Example: Lumberjack comes Home after he spent the whole Day in the Woods and all he did was chop 1 (!!!) Log. Awesome! It takes me 4 seconds to do the work of his entire day!

- Taxes are too high. I need to grind and farm stuff just in order to pay the taxes. That may be realistic but its not fun at all.

- I am also tired of having to search the internet for how things work in this game. The explanations in the game are not enough to actually understand what needs to be done to get your buildings working. (For example, putting an axe into the chest of the lumberjack hut was mentioned nowhere)

- Conversations are annoying. It's like trial and error and the amount of times you can interact with people is limited!
I found myself quicksaving before I wanted to talk to an NPC. I asked how their day was and they didnt like that so I loaded my saveslot and tried a different option. That is just tedious and annoying if you want to recruit villagers.

- There is not a single chest in this game that contains any kind of loot. I like the idea of stealing stuff in general but there is almost nothing you can steal. The Game can be hard at times so you might ""borrow"" something from your neighbours in order to get things done more quickly. But nope... All I could see was some wood scattered on the ground here and there and some other basic items.

- Since the latest patch there was a constant rain sound effect playing during summer. I had to turn off the volume in order to get rid of it.
- Fields are so annoying. There is no way to rotate them or delete them... come on.. Please add more customizing.

- The Game needs voices. At least some basic stuff - Voice acting isnt that expensive and it would add a lot to the atmosphere. I'm a developer myself and I hired voice actors myself. It's not that bad :)

- The Music in this game is quite... annoying? I love harps and medieval stuff in general but this soundtrack keeps playing in a way I just dont enjoy. I loved the stronghold OST for example. I dont know how I could say it best. I just can't enjoy it for some reason.

- Why is there no FOV Slider? 

- at least some type of weather would be great like snow or rain. It would improve the game too!

Also I dont understand why people say they want longer days or seaons? It's getting boring rather quickly in my opinion and I am glad when the season changes so I can finally harvest my fruits from the field for example.


I think that's all for now. Please don't get me wrong! The potential is there and the game is a lot of fun, but I keep getting frustrated by various things and that's a shame. The game is very good but it could be even better.
I played these survival games for a long time and I am really fed up lol. I gave this one a chance and I wrote this review because I care and I'd like the devs to improve it.

88,76247450,english,"I actually enjoy the game but there are several features that are incomplete or just not implemented yet.  I think either the length of time for a day or the number of days per season needs to be increased also.  Unable to remove fields once you place them, a wonky work around for removing tree stumps, workers that don't actually work...and a lot of other glitches.  Food can be tough to get if you aren't good at throwing spears early on and it seems pretty weird that an entire log gives you one spear.  Reminds me of old cartoons where they chop a tree down to make one toothpick.  You unlock crossbow bolts to craft but not a crossbow and later you unlock a bow and arrows but you can only craft arrows in batches of 50.  The feathers you need for those arrows are difficult to come by early on so even though you know how to craft the arrows, you will not have enough feathers to actually make them.  Once you start gaining your own villagers, you spend all your time collecting resources to keep them happy because they don't do any work on their own yet.  I received a mission to kill 8 rabbits at one point and only found one during that entire season and failed the mission.  The gameplay seems very busy. 
 You are supposed to go talk to people and complete tasks but the days are so short that you either complete tasks or go get resources for survival and somewhere in there you are supposed to craft stuff to sell for money that you need to unlock crafting blueprints.  There are just so many small things that may seem petty but add up to make this game frustrating enough that I don't want to recommend it just yet.",1600553435,1600553435,False,17,0,0.580547690391540527,0,True,False,True,76561198006518725,896,5,886,317,569,1601146119,,
89,76247386,english,"For an early access game that had only been out for 2 days prior to me buying it, i can honestly say im thoroughly impressed. honestly it is almost shocking. I hardly ever leave reviews. This game has an interesting idea of how it starts, In my opinion its a combination of ""The Guild"" series and ""Ark Survival Evolved"" combined. The guild stems from the dynasty function and building up your character and earning respect and money. Ark stems from the resource gathering and crafting functions. 

I am not too far into the story myself, only in chapter 6 or 7 id say. But Story is a bit loose honestly because the chapters are more for guiding you along development of your area than it is actually driving a narrative story. The interactions with each individual NPC is different in how they react. As the seasons progress you can see the NPC's age with the passing years. 

Villages the NPC's moving and going about their tasks for the village, The only thing truly missing from the villages is background conversation between NPC's. When you walk into a town you can hear the animals , see villagers farming the fields going to the tavern, Sometimes sitting on a lit cooking pot fire (that's my favorite to laugh at).  The villages themselves are both full of life and deathly silent at the same time. It coudl be remedied by adding in NPC's interacting with each other in some manner or another, as this is early access i only hope to see this in the future. 

The gameplay is a bit difficult to get used to at first mostly because the basic materials you need are sometimes hard to find in the dense foliage of the forests. The Time frame of the game is a bit slow paced i did notice a way to speed up the cycles of the Seasons, so this is a game that you can sink hours into just to pass one year in the game. 

The graphics are phenomenal from what i have seen. The animals have detailed fur once you get up close to skin them. The water in the river doesnt have much texture to it compared to the streams you see throughout the wilderness however. Archery and spear throwing is a bit difficult to get used to due to being difficult to jusdge distance very easily especially when hunting a moving target, whether it is dear, foxes, rabbits, Wixon (bison), Wolves, Bears, or Bears.

Not mention the physics engine going on is great! too many logs to carry for a building you need built back at your base? Just try looking down the hill toward where you want to go and open your inventory and drop all the logs as one Log, then jsut watch the log roll on down the hill. Careful though it can catch on trunks and rocks and roll backwards if it comes into another hill.

All in all i have very few to no complaints with the game as is other than the Villages having more interactions between NPC's and people talking.  Maybe add in some texture to the big river in the middle of the map. you can unlock a lot of buildings that perform different tasks however unless you just grind out gathering a bunch of materials or equipment to sell to merchants to unlock their technologies, or getting people to join your settlement ( still working on getting people to join me though).

93,76246963,english,"(Playing version 0.1.0.5)

There are a massive amount of games that try to tap into that sense of rags-to-riches, each with their own pros and cons. Some games have petered out into Early Access hell, others have managed to break out into truly enjoyable experiences. My hope is that Medieval Dynasty becomes the latter.

As this is just released, I'm patient with bugs, glitches, and unfinished features. I think this is what Early Access ought to be for, after all, though the $30 base price is kinda steep. You're basically pledging to finish this game and make it stellar, and if not your name will absolutely and deservedly be dragged through the mud. Don't let the bucks go to waste.

You start out with nothing more than a bit of food, some meager coin, and (a minute later) a building hammer. With that you're tasked to start your own settlement. You build houses, farms, workshops, storages. You get to know villagers and entice them to join your cause. You venture out to the other established cities to trade, take on personal favors, and more. As you perform various tasks, you earn points towards skill points to enhance your character and make certain things easier, as well as unlocking technological advances to unlock better buildings and craft higher-rated items.

Certain things are left undone; spear-fishing, certain skill talents, and at hte moment there's only really one character with a ""story quest,"" where you basically guide them on their own personal journey and do favors for them. This allows, at least, a taste of what is to come. Again, since this was only released a few days ago, I'm not going to touch these.

As far as concept goes, this game is great. Besides boundaries around the game map itself and the cities' ranges, you have complete freedom in where you choose to settle. Certain areas are better than others, often places with a large amount of flat land and resources nearby, but you're not want for choice in this game. The controls are intuitive and easy, and the menus for the most part are easy to navigate and get the gist of. The execution is definitely here, it just needs fine-tuning.

Still, there are some aspects that are difficult to overlook. For one, moving between cities is an absolute chore, especially with the way time works. Each season is split into only 3 days. While I haven't had too much difficulty accomplishing what I've wanted to get done, it's left me feeling with a sense of urgency. Increasing it to 5 or even just 4 days would probably alleviate a lot of pressure. Spending an entire day just getting to another city to buy some manure is rough. The introduction of carters or a horse would make movement less boring for sure. 

Another complication is the sheer amount of resources needed to get certain things done, or to skill up. Anyone who has experienced hunting in this game quickly found out that to level up your hunting skills, you have to basically exterminate several forests' worth of animals. This leaves you with a lot of meat for food, but also a lot of leather and fur that you can't actually use until you unlock the technology to craft with them three technology tiers in. The amount of work and resources required to craft even simple tools such as a spear or a fishing net is absurd, especially when they only have 3 or so uses. Lastly, the lack of a comprehensive report on your village makes management confusing. What resources did your people gather today? How much? How efficient are they, given their skill and resources around their job building's location? Are they missing a tool? Are the people assigned to the resource storage buildings actually doing anything? The game does not tell you, and you're left wondering if anything is being done at all.

Overall I think the game shows a lot of promise. As far as whether to recommend it, I do, but you have to know what you're getting into first. This is the earliest of early access, and so if you're looking for a polished product, this is not it. If you want to get a taste and offer suggestions, by all means. The creator seems to accept advice and criticism; it's been a few days of release and there's already been at least 5 hotfixes out clearing up most of the game-breaking bugs.",1600552669,1600552669,True,1,0,0.504085302352905273,0,True,False,True,76561197996875113,144,1,1121,38,1076,1600903475,,
94,76246581,english,"I like this game because of the medieval aspect. I own another game from them on PS4 and PC called ""Farmer's Dynasty"". A major theme is women are for marriage, cooking, and production of an heir. You can't pick another gender for the main character and you certainly can't pick one for marriage. It seems a common staple of their games are similar, play as a heterosexual, white male, survive, work the land, and find a women to produce an heir, and do other simple chores. Women are not a choice as the main character, they are only used for breeding, and other wifely duties. The hunting is weird, aim for the head to take a deer down. I believe, I've read that the developers want to try to maintain as much realism as possible, so maybe look at the slew of games that they have already made or are advertising and it has the same theme each time. The discussions turned my stomach something awful because when someone would ask for future updates that would include anything other than ""male, white, or heterosexual"", they would be met with a variety of answers that would suggest that they get over it and realize that the realism in the game could not abide a woman hunting, farming, or doing anything but breeding or menial work. The same went for homosexual existence because the digital world couldn't allow for a non-heterosexual couple to breed or have kids. My point is that I like this game for the survival and cool medieval theme, but the lack of blatant exclusion of other types, races, and consistent downplaying of female role's is gross. I know it is early access, but the theme is consistent in their other games as well. If you don't believe me then look at their other Dynasty games. It is their game, they can do what they want, but people should know what they will be getting from these developers before they shell out hard earned money in the hopes that something will change.

I don't like how often you need to drink & eat, thats just annoying. Specially because you have to eat a dozen pieces of roasted meat to fill 50% of your hunger. Also the devs said they think it will be in EA for ~6 months. Thats way too short imo. Please give it time, don't rush. And the important location information is kept secret from normal buyers, you have to find & remember them yourself without supporter package.

They seem to copy & paste alot from their other games, it just looks like they try to grab all the money from as many generes as they can. Ridiculous!

2,76182616,english,"So far the game is a lot of fun and actually a little addicting. It does most of what it says correctly, especially the survival, and what your own character can do.

There are some bugs of course, which I hope get fixed rather soon, and I don't want to be too harsh on that since it is day two after the early access release.
The building, farming, etc all works fine, but as soon as you grow a little bigger and get your first workers is where it gets a bit weird. So far, it seems like my workers all do nothing, they just see to use up my resources without contributing anything and the NPC-village AI is a bit too idle as well, but a dev already answered my bug report on that last issue.

One negative thing that I have noticed that has nothing to do with a bug, but gamedesign, is as some others have already pointed out the 3 days per season system. 
I like playing this sort of game as a calm, chill evening, but I feel constantly rushed. Some quests only last for one season, and you fail if you don't do it in those three days. And the days go by so fast. 
The map is quite large, which usually is a good point, but travelling between two villages cam cost you a precious day - a whole third of a season. I really hope they add a choice for how many days a season will have. I feel like 5, 7 could be good additional options.

27,76185853,english,"A fair review:

This is an EA game, but it is getting quite a few updates right off the bat. That being said, it is FAR from polished:

1. Crash/hangs at sleep/save, losing progress (SAVE before you sleep!)
2. Loading games often missing things from before (IE., i had plots sown and now they are empty). Same goes for quests: my progress on side-quests has been abandoned (I wasn't even on the quest anymore after logging back in).
3. Dialog is very cheesy, and chatting doesn't make sense - there are no clues as to WHAT a person will respond positively or negatively to.
4. The world doesn't feel very alive: people seem to aimlessly roam town with nothing actually going on. From what I can tell so far, NPCs don't wander between villages, so it is very static-feeling. It would be great to see vendors walking the paths, etc...
5. No speaking: I'm old-school, and don't get me wrong, i love the old text-based games. But it's 2020. Record some simple audio - even some basic ""hi"" or ""hello"" when you initiate a conversation with an NPC would make it more engaging.
6. Melee combat is very off (i've stabbed rabbits on screen but they aren't hit).
7. It's simply too easy: vendors have unlimited $, so you can just go out and collect infinite herbs and vendor them, buying whatever you want. Thus, it becomes a very grindy-experience.
8. Obviously some sort of NPC-based threat as well.
9. We need Inns in towns!

Most small companies have no business touching Unreal, but Render Cube knows what they are doing. Even in alpha, bugs are at a minimum and so far none are game breaking. It is stunning AND optimized, so my older computer never lags or stutters. The terrain textures are some of the best I have ever seen in any game. I want to touch the pinecones.

The other thing that makes me want to cry with joy is the biological accuracy of the game. Whoever was in charge of the botany took their job seriously. Everything about the environment is accurate, and I even see meshes in the game for future herbs, such as Dandelion, Chicory, and Poppys. If they include the ability to make tinictures, poultices, teas, and other remedies in the future, I will never be able to leave my computer. I will live out my dreams of being a woodland healing hermit until I die. 

This game is the culmination of all the aspects of Harvest Moon, Fable, Oblivion, and The Forest that nature-loving , home building, community growing individuals like me love. I'm going to assume they will add horses at some point, and when they do, its over for reality. I live in the forest hunting foxes on horseback now. 

My only complaint at this time is with one or two of the in-game songs. I saw another review complain about the soundtrack, and I thought it was a stupid complaint... Until I played for almost 8 hours. I do really like one of the songs! However, there are a couple songs that are quite dark and ominous for no reason. Noises in them have even caused me to jump thinking I was being ambushed by wolves or something. It does intrude on the relaxing sensations in the game.  One song even has a middle-eastern flair that makes no sense in the setting. This aspect of the game does need some review before release. The movement is too jerky for my liking right now too. It makes me slightly motion sick and could use some smoothing. I appreciate the bounce in the walk, but it's just too severe as it is right now.

Otherwise, the game is in alpha, so things are incomplete and a work in progress. That's understandable and I cannot wait to see the finished product.

Survival Tip - Hostile Animals
- Wolves take 1 spear throw in the head to kill if you throw your spear at their head once they run up to you
- Boars will attack you if you go too close; one may take up to 2 spear throws in the head to kill
- Wisent will take up to 4 spear throws in the head to kill and they hurt!

When you have access only to spears yet: craft and keep multiple spears in your inventory. When you throw one, the next one is automatically equipped from your inventory, so you can throw them rapidly right after each other!

Invest your first 2 Skill Points into the Survival tree, the 2nd one up called 'Survival Sense' is a real helper. It will allow you to highlight mushrooms and healing plants on the ground! The plants will heal you even in combat: opening your menu will pause the combat.

Not enough space in inventory for your logs? Do not worry, nothing will disappear when you drop them, ever! Just leave the logs where they fall or drop them on the road where you can see them easily.

This game starts me off with walking through some woods where I can pick up pretty much everything between where I spawn and the village I have to walk to two minutes down the road and you better believe me when I said I did. 

So what kind of game is this? Well the trailer is actually pretty straight forward; you are some guy trying to make a name for himself and that name is going to start with some hearty hard work and a nice town that you will eventually work out. You have RPG styled perks/traits where you work hard and benefit for it, maybe put a point in things not breaking as easily when doing this type of work, etc.""But wait, what about the building? I'm here for the building!"" Well friend the building system is what a lot of us are used to in games where you have items in your inventory, you pull out your trusty hammer, and you smack the bejeebus out of what you are currently working on until its built. Radial menus let you modify some things, pick some options, maybe less normal wall and more window, etc.

All in all it's a really gorgeous game for the price point and though I'm only a little bit in I haven't stopped smiling so far. Only real complaint right now is there is no Borderless Window setting so having to work that around with a Borderless program but otherwise wow, this is a pretty swell experience already!

PROS 
- Graphics and performance are good for an Alpha build
- Crafting elements are good with a variety of craftable buildings, tools etc
- Animations are good for an Alpha.

CONS 
- No ambient sounds in game at the minute
- No voice over for NPC's just text
- No swimming animations
- Seasons are too short
- AI is a bit janky at times

Overall this game has some real potential to be in this good of a state for Alpha, if the devs play this right the game will be a huge success, they have a solid base to start from with this game and I like what I see this early on in development.

91,76200278,english,"I have 16 hours over 3 days as of this review. My playtime began on Day 1 of Early Access Release. I can easily say love this game.

I've read people describe this as a Survival version of Kingdom Come: Deliverance, and honestly that's not a bad comparison. 

It blends aspects of RPGs (experience gain, skill trees) with Survivals (crafting, hunger/thirst management) and Simulation (Village NPC management) in the later game.

[h1]It's Early Access[/h1]
That said, it's one of the most stable EA titles I've played. The only crashes I've experienced are when you sleep between seasons - but it autosaved at the same time, so I was simply able to re-launch the game and proceed. [b]Additionally, this was patched the day I wrote this review and now seems to function correctly[/b]

I run a Geforce 2080 Super and play the game on the highest settings with no frame-rate issues. The draw distance is absurd, and the lack of flora ""pop-in"" is satisfying (in that there isn't any).

Four seasons and the pacing between them feel right. Crafting is relatively intuitive early game. At the mid-game stages, it can start to become confusing, and I imagine that will be refined as development continues.

Some skills are still in development. The balance of tech tree unlocking is currently a bit of a wreck, in particular the farming tree. With no access to manure until much later in the farming tech grid, it's extremely difficult to make progress once your cultivated ground has degraded (manure restores it).

You also gain the ability to do many things long before you reach a point where they actually become available. Case in point: Upgrading a house with daub walls. You can see the menu option to make daub once you build a barn - but you can't actually unlock the schematic to [i]make[/i] it until you've advanced far enough in one of the trees to unlock the ability to house geese. Again, I imagine this will continue to be refined as development continues - the point is, all the base mechanics are [i]there[/i], but some feel a bit like teasers at the moment.

[b]Expect standard Early Access bugs[/b]. With the exception of some odd villager placement and the season-change crash that has already been fixed, the other bugs I've encountered have A) been rather tame (such as values suddenly becoming decimal as opposed to whole - something that was also patched on day 3), or visually minor (such as a deer's legs not functioning correctly when the corpse rag-dolled down a hill). All easy to forgive for me.

Either because the NPC vanished mysteriously from the overworld, or because the NPC just refuses to let me turn in the requested items. 

This game has potential, and maybe some day this review will be positive, but in this current state the game is a buggy mess.

Everything requires an absurd level of grinding to accomplish, in order to even get a bow or even build any useful workshops you have to essentially spend hours walking and throwing spears at deer and skinning them to crank up points to get anything. 

Quests have you spending ages walking to a corner of the map, to click on an NPC and then walk back to the start point to click on an NPC to spend ages walking to the other corner of the map. And thats if you get lucky and don't get ganked by a pack of wolves that you can't do anything against because your only weapon is a shitty wooden spear because you can't make anything else yet. Or if the quest even works and the NPC hasn't fallen through the map or wasn't killed because the game spawned a pack of wild animals next to him and killed him.

The idea has potential, give it a year maybe and see the progress they've made, but for 30 goddamn AUD this is kind of a joke, the game doesn't work and has barely any content in it, and the content that is there is either buggy and won't work or takes hours to grind.

In the medieval times things were not easy and this game shows just how by letting out just enough information to have you figure things out yourself for a bit. Once you have discovered how things need to be done, it is still not going to be easy because it also shows you ""knowledge only works best if you can put it to practice"". So many things you need to keep in check though and you will be quite busy with everything.

The good things listed neatly in a row for you:
* Graphics - I have to say, they are great. It gives me a bit of Kingdom Come Deliverence feel and that is just what I personally am looking for.
* Controls - Easy to get and remember, see... just what an old grumpy gamster like me needs :)
* Lag free! - And this may be very important for most of you gamers out there... You have no problems just walking on... No matter where you go, if you go through water or over land... you will smoothly get from point a to point b.

Downparts (which I think are still under development, since it is early access):
* Glitches - Though they are not many... some may just be important enough for you to have a pause in certain development of the things that may need achievement. 
* Duration of day - Personally I think they could make the days or at least the seasons last a little longer. Currently it is set on three (ingame) days before a new season dawns and that is just... Not really giving it the feel it could have if the seasons would last you a bit longer. Let that winter be a bit of a struggle to get through and the autum this long rainy time before the winter realy comes to show you what survival is about.
* Coversations with NPC's - I do not know if this will be changed or if this was intentional but I did found that the options given when you are conversating with an NPC are a slight on the sparse side. But who knows they may add some over time.

All in all:
This game has great potential to be marvelous if the developers are given that chance and... more importantly, have the meanings to do so. I love it and I really hope you all out there... do too.

6,76223955,english,"I wish there is a maybe option, since this recommendation comes with lots of *

I'd only at most maybe recommend it in this state. All I hope is the devs will listen to feedback. The most pressing issue I've seen so far, is the music seems to be overwhelming. If you play this I'd recommend turning it off. By default it is set to low, but it is so omnipresent no matter the situation it starts to get annoying to listen to. Another music specific issue I ran into is I got the feeling that when I first loaded the game up I think two tracks were literally playing on top of each other. The music is also very disconnected from what is really happening. I was walking towards the village and it was playing a tune as if I was leading a war party of adventurers on the way to Mordor (obvs before getting to Mordor where you'd expect music to get more tense)

Speaking of sound there are things that make no sounds and they should. Tree falling down being the first thing I ran into.

A final issue on sound, I dunno if this is because I have surround sound, but things sound weird sometimes. When I look around it sounds like some sounds disappear too quickly or fade out in an not so smooth manner

This is also one of those games where the tutorial says you require x amount of items to start building a house. NAH. You need more than that. Way more.

Some requirements for crafting are a bit silly. I need a log to craft a building hammer? What? Some ""logs"" are the size of me. How does that make any sense?

The way time passes and seasons pass need options for customisation or a complete overhaul. 3 days that pass fairly fast per season is ridiculous. I am going to assume the reason they did this initially is so that they and people playing the game can give them feedback on how each season feels and works.

Also the beginning on getting you set up I'm going to assume will also be overhauled because it needs to.

Personal nitpick but besides the fact that water could looks better when it approaches the ground, I hope they change the way you approach to drinking water. I can drink from static water and not get poisoned. Dunno how realistic minded they want the game to be, but that's a big no-no in medieval times. Water that isn't from a river is most likely dirty as hell and cannot be drunk without bad things happening to your tum-tum. This was such a big deal that even children were drinking beer back then (beer of course being a lot lighter and more tasteless than now)

I hope there will be future options of more blank slate character or maybe a non-story starting options where you can either start as an established individual in a community already or an absolute worthless beggar.

Another thing that I can think of, dialogue is rich but may need some pruning here and there. Some feels like I'm getting too personal with people I don't know, so it might need more options for casual small talk.

One final thing and I dunno if I'm alone on this, but this might need a lot of optimisation work being done. I play Call of Duty modern warfare regularly a lot as well as a game that this is closer related to, bannerlord, and holy sweet Jesus none of them make my system chug as much as a runaway train with pretty intense temps on my GPU. No reason for this game to be this demanding to my system. Needs fixing and I'd say this is a top priority personally.

The building system is simple and almost Rust like, which is my favorite system, i've actually been looking for a game with super similar building mechanics.

The seasons are 3 days which are fairly short but it's day 2 of release so I can assume there will be game options that you can set before starting a playthru in the future or something to compensate, if the game stays with three though the days are fairly long in game to be honest.

No voice acting yet but the dialogue is super extensive and I don't mind reading it anyway.

14,76222078,english,"On the basis that this is clearly, very early in build.

It is a really relaxing experience.
Graphics - Typical of the unreal engine.  Beautiful. Not the highest textures I have seen but it is beautiful and well done.
Sound - Nice ambient bird song in the background, reasonable but not great sound in other areas.  Text based dialogue only

Gameplay - A very relaxing experience and well worth picking up to support the game.  The character development is early on in the cycle but so far it made a lot of sense to me and gives you that drip feed of progressing which is quite addictive.  The mapsize, while not being huge is bigger and more open than many, if not most similar games and I personally really appreciated that.   

The survival element is not overly punishing but it does keep you focussed.
I like the way farming works quite a lot but found this pretty hard to get stable before the game went into full on crashing all the time. 

Okay so one of the big downsides right now are the bugs. For me they sometime stop things interacting or may just simply crash the thing entirely.  So dont buy if you dont want to support a game which has some of the best potential I have seen in an EA game for quite a while.  

One thing that I find very lacking so far is the building aspect of the game. It is too much based on very limited prebuilt structures.  I would expect to see more opportunity for customisation.  I suspect that will come later. 

Overall, this is shaping up to be a really great game. Very unusually, it is really relaxing to play.  With more depth and content as it develops it would be a contender for game of the year as it will be a pleasure to come home, kick back and step into a relaxing and interesting world.

KCD with better survival and craft elements. 
For Alpha this game looks and plays great, however there are quite a few improvements that are needed which are overlooked in recommending this game as it stands. 

The biggest issue for me is the day/night cycle and short seasons. The game needs to be played at a hectic pace, significantly taking away from the ability to enjoy and absorb how good the game looks. 
If the pace was slowed down to allow time to invest time into each of the mechanics of the game, you could easily get lost as a distraction from every day life for hours and hours! 

Animal and NPC AI is quite simplistic, a lot more needs doing here, e.g. to give the NPC's personalities and life to the open world and the way you interact with it. 

There are other minor bugs and issues (e.g. how much food you have to eat and how much you collect from animals needs an overhaul), but the two previously mentioned would be what I consider necessary improvements.  
I am currently waiting before I invest more time in this game, as I can't really enjoy it until I can slow the pace down.

I would hope to see, as with other games of this genre, that all of these components (day, night, seasons, hunger, thirst, crop yields, resource abundance, decay rates, animal populations, etc..) we will be able to tailor to the challenge and how we like to play as individuals.

Now for the negatives on the game being early access. The map is massive and quests ask you to treck a long way to do certain objectives without a horse and the days only last for like 30 minutes a time. i think days should last longer so that the player feels like theyre not wasting most of thier day travelling.

There is no voice acting yet
Some systems of the game dont work, eg the knife as a weapon
There is a lack of story
Seasons only last for 3 days at a time which is pretty silly, 10 days would make more sense if not the full month.

So far I only have two issues. The graphical performance in this game is harsh. It looks pretty good but you will need a strong PC to get up to/above 60 FPS. My other issue is with the save feature. The game rarely autosaves and it is pretty easy to get mauled by a wild animal and lose 15-30 minutes of progress because you simply forgot to save. Just get in the habit of saving after every goal you finish.

65,76204100,english,"This is a fun game, but don't get it yet. Right now, this is one of those Early Access titles that is actually a lot of fun to play despite not having implemented all of its features. But, unfortunately, it has some game-breaking issues affecting what I consider to be the core gameplay elements. Namely: Other than farmers, workers don't actually seem to do anything.

When you first start playing the game, this may seem like an 'eh, whatever. I can work around that.' kinda issue. Unfortunately, it really isn't. The reason for that is the requirements for wood, taxation, and settlement expansion. After you raise your settlement building cap to 16 and really start to get going with construction, you will quickly realize that you are using a surprisingly high amount of wood. Because the lumberjack currently does not seem to be capable of gathering logs for you (except in the case of a minority of community members), you will have to allocate an increasingly large chunk of your gameplay toward collecting logs. At my current point in the game I am using approximately 12 maple trees for my wood upkeep per day.

Sure, this seems to be more of an inconvenience than anything else, but you will very rapidly run out of trees in the surroundings of your settlement and be required to travel further and further away, limiting the amount of time you can spend doing anything else. This is significant because you are required to do certain ""Chapter Quests"" in order to progress through the game. One of these quests requires you to achieve 1,000 Dynasty Reputation and have 10 buildings constructed. It MIGHT be possible to get 1,000 Dynasty Reputation prior to expanding your settlement, but I imagine that would take several in-game years and would largely prevent you from experiencing the core gameplay elements.

So, like I said, it is fun. Just don't get it yet. Keep yourself informed on the fairly frequent updates popping out.

Now some technical stuff:

Graphics - 7/10
They are good, but there are too many things and people that look exactly the same because devs reuse too many textures.

Sound- 2/10
If you use a headset to play games, don't. Or, at the very least, turn the volume down to -10% so the wolves don't murder you IRL the first time they howl. I'm not joking; turn the volume down or you will regret it.

Gameplay - Broken/10
Too many things aren't properly implemented yet. Wait for some updates.

Story - Um?/10
Things happen, but a lot of it doesn't make any sense. Why are there hard barriers to prevent me from building another shack prior to reaching X Dynasty points?

Hopefully the game takes off and voice acting can be added and maybe a bit more back story added - as it is I don't find myself overly caring about the character, case in point I don't even know what his name is off the top of my head.

From a technical side, much more polished than some other early access games without any major game breaking bugs other than a couple of times after sleeping and there is a season change it is forever black screen - but closing and restarting it is the newly saved game. On that note, yes, 3 days for a season just seems weird.

This is to be expected with early access but this needs some major smoothing out. Also in desperate need of faster travel method, be it mount, ferry or fast travel. Currently half the time is spend running from place to place. The seasons and days are also quite rushed, making it difficult to take in the scenery which is really quite nice.

Game itselfs runs pretty smoothly,you don`t need a supercomputer to run it , so it`s a big plus.Graphics are quite nice, same goes for audio.Also it is a single player so you wont encounter a any unplesant and unwelcome ""guests"" who can ruin your game experience because of reasons.Co-op could be nice though so you can play with friends but I think it will come later( I hope)so you can play with  friends.Other things which bother me a bit was that while in vicinity of your house if you want to build/craft something, all nessecary items needs to be in your inventory-I hope devs will implement a change so your stash at your house could act as your personal inventory.

The game itself is a pretty standard survival game with the USP of you not building just a house (and a shed for your animals or whatnot) but an entire village, where you then can recruit villagers to help with gathering or hunting or something.

The game looks nice, sounds nice, feels nice. It's still pretty early access i think, especially when it comes to bugs and balancing. The game crashes quite a bit and AI tends to bug out. Right now your character eats like a wolf on ecstasy and needs the equivalent of 4-5 Does/Warthogs/Elephants per day. A full meal of mushrooms consists of 100 (!!!) mushrooms a.s.o.

The world map is nicely done and crafted with love, though so far there isnt enough to find. while it looks nice every inch of the map is the same, theres no reason to go anywhere but the starting location, villages are all equally (boring).

So in the end I can say this might be an amazing medieval life sim one day. Right now its more for supporters than actual players i think, but you can already tell that this game is gonna be good one day and i cant wait for that day to come.

92,76198548,english,"'Realistic' Medieval peaceful survival-crafting thingey (So no fights with humans/or crafting of armors yet, not sure if planned later).
Focus seems to be mainly survival and creation of a village and farming reputation in villages, so that they join your village. No idea where the game will go to in the future or if it'll stay like this.
The world feels kind of bland and empty still, although it is fun to hunt animals or discover new ones, but the range of animals is due to the realistic nature of the game rather limited and hunting makes up for a large part of the game at the start.

What Kingdom Come: Deliverance lacked, this game has. But what Kingdom Come: Deliverance had, this game lacks(Aka: Fighting, armor, story).
If you could just merge these two games together, that'd be great.

The game is still early access and you definitely feel it, but you can still do quite a lot peaceful survival/simulation stuff, although some quests and features still seem bugged.
I'd say this is worth about 10 to 20 hours of fun at it's current state, we will see how the development continues.

If your interest is mostly building, crafting, survival, creating of a village, you'll probably feel great with this game.
But if you additionally want fights, crafting armors, castles, you will be disappointed. But I'm not sure if that stuff will be added later.",1600477775,1600477775,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True,76561197986038106,359,16,1011,647,363,1601186998,,

I'm instantly skeptical of any game that drags out the start past the two hour mark knowing that devs know that's the refund window. After just cresting 2 hours played I STILL don't have a village and I've only done the generic survival sandbox dance and ran extremely long distances between little villagers to talk to people, then run back.

I'm honestly just floored that this game has so many positive reviews with such a glaringly poor gameplay loop start at the beginning. There needs to be an option to turn the ""tutorial version"" off and just let us start up our own town.

It is atrociously poor advertising to promote all the city building and village managing, and then locking that content behind a time wall so people can't refund it if they don't like the management side of things.

Major league red flags. DO NOT BUY. Add to wishlist, keep an eye on it for updates.

1,76196093,english,"Keep in mind this is an early access review. While currently i'm expressing a lot of negative; it's still a very neat game.

I'm bored. I've hit 13 hours and I just feel no desire to go on much farther.

I started the game. ""Alright; on your own. See ya alligator"". Cool? Would have liked a house in town or something to learn the game from.
Oh wait. Getting anything is ridiculously easy just tedious. Make a couple wooden spears, throw em with right click, boom, you're taking out whole herds of deer, bears, bison, foxes, etc. I have SO much leather and fur. But, I can't use any of it because I haven't paid to unlock the tech? Building skill experience seems to unlock nothing except extremely minor QOL stuff. Tools wear out slower, health is slighty bigger, some things are highlighted in special vision mode.

Okay. Build a little house outside a cave I found exploring. Neat. I'm going to be a little mining town. Uh. 13 hours later, and I don't even have the building unlocked to store food because I wasn't planting food. Why would I plant food? I have like 500 things of meat. Can't get any villagers to help because I have to have a food storage building, and I can't just give them food or put in their house. So, start planting crops so I can grind some experience I guess.

So, i've built a small complex. A workshop(that gave me absolutely nothing new except the ability to throw rocks). A hunting lodge that lets you build a bow/arrows. But, you need linen? I've visited every town and have found no flax seeds. Besides, aren't bow strings animal sinew originally? So, I can't make bows unless I buy linen, or figure out how to grow it. I don't even know how much grinding to get any kind of metal going.

At some point I just realized I had SO much grinding left to do. Nothing provided any challenge. I could kill a bear with a wooden spear just walking backwards slightly. I had no attachment to my character other than losing out on grinding progress. There was SO much grinding left to do to get anything. In things like ARK or Conan you have online communities to speed things up, or setting xp rate changes.

Playing KCD I really wanted a village to manage, and to live the life. ...I think I might have hated it. Because, that's this game.

Picking on another game; project zomboid. The flavor for me is the challenge of staying alive. Getting resources is risky, and costs resources more often than not. Hydrocraft adds a TON of stuff to do; but you learn how to forge iron from reading a book. Not spending 13 hours in real life chopping trees repeatedly.

I'm hopeful for this game in the future, but currently it's a grindfest kept alive only by the honeymoon phase of getting a game you really wanted. As soon as that ends, so does the game.",1600473070,1600473070,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True,76561198007702125,578,6,1210,0,792,1600628911,,

 Ive been having a good time with most every part of this game from building and crafting, to questing and dynasty building everything works so well given that its still in alpha stage and came out literally yesterday. Graphics look amazing (can be a bit demanding, my nitro+ 5700xt at 1440p gets about 30-40 fps on ultra) building and crafting are fluent, with typical survival games i feel like have a house that almost looks floaty, with grass popping through the floor is really just a big nuisance and take away for me, but that doesnt happen here which is a big plus for me cuz im a freak like that. really Ive been having a lot of fun with this game. With that said, there are a couple of things that grind my gears and I believe needs addressing sooner rather than later so i recommend this game to every person who takes the time to read this.

Firstly, when questing, youll often have to take a whole day to do just a couple errands or little odds and ends deals for quests, when it involves traveling a good distance away it suck because 1, you have to run the whole way there which really isnt too bad if not not over 1000m or however the measure distance, but if you have to talk to someone for a quest, so far, whenever ive tried to talk to the person at night, even if theyre still out side i get a ""this person isnt interested in talking to you right now"" which then means i have to sit all night and wait cuz theres not point in running back to my house or another village cuz then I'll be right back in the morning, which leads us into the other issue i have that makes me unable to recommend this game.

Time. Seasons. Sweet baby Jesus I cannot believe it. For the love of all this good and holy please make seasons more than 3 days. Im constantly rushed to get as much done in a day as possible because WINTER IS COMING and i feel almost unable to enjoy the game for what it is because im always sprinting all over the place trying to complete quests and gather materials because the season are so short. Crops and natural edibles are season dependant so if i dont get alll these crops planted before autumn im screwed, unless I buy crops that can be planted in the Autumn but i dont wanna spend more money on crops. I gave up on the ones that gotta be planted in the Spring (you start in the spring) cuz I didnt have enough fucking time.

Hi!
 The Forest solo player here. I like the game alot. Try it. I won't say what I like 'cause most likely you do liek the same.  Just saying what I found interesting, bugs, issues and quest story issues.
So I played the game for over 10hours and here what:
Holding the stone axe reduces your extracting animation and you are able to harvest berries, brances and mushrooms twice as fast as bare hands. Walking and running in water, not swimming. 
Rabit,fox,wolf,doe,buck and boar can be one-shoted with a spear. Buffalo or furry cow needs 2 hits in the head. Does are hardest to kill if you fail to do a crirical hit or oneshot. When ciritical hitted the run slow and are easy to track and kill. Go for boars, buffalos, foxes or bucks. Wolves are over rated. They are scary if they surprice attack you. That happened to me in one village D: but over all 1 shot in the head and its done.
Heck you have a crosshair while in the forest you did not and had to get a feeling there the arrow/spear would hit. The spear likes to the left when thrown. 
The 3 day season is a bummer and should be an option and adjustable.
Ok, now quests. Careful when you take them, if you dont complete the quest before the season ends it will fail. It sucks and now I have to give a berry were its spring and in spring you have unriped berries. Instant fail for this one -7 rep.
I took the quest from Uni---egost and helped a villige in need but can't find the fking Uniegost in Gostavia. I've be looking for him for 6days now and he is not there. Maybe jsut maybe he will appear or he wont because I did not go to finish his task in the same season...so be carefull...I'll have to test that, but It will be a pain cause I've developed some skills and have 7 buildings and thats already my 2nd go...
Oh,right. Have fun taking a wife. U wont be having one soon. They are like...women. Well, I'll just have to wait and develop my diplomatic skills and level up Romeo and hope it helps.
Oh, and dont rob. Thats why I had to start over again. -99 rep. Not cool. 
You just take some food have 2 spears in you,axe,skinning knife and just go harvest berries.
In my exp this is the best way to earn gold fast. Each bush gives you 3-5 berries each one 1 gold.
A field of berries is around 300+ berries :) . Just dont forget the have your axe in hand to harvest faster.

Crafting tools, building houses, farms, traps etc. doing tasks for people in other villagers, making friends, getting a wife ;) And much more to come soon! [/b]

[h1]If you hate reading! ( short review )[/h1]
Cop:
+ If you like middle age time, survival, crafting, hunting and building.
+ If you don't mind a early access, unfinished games with bugs.
+ If you played and liked kingdom come deliverance ( this game is more open world and less story focused. )
( there is [u]no[/u] combat besides hunting so far and [u]no[/u] multiplayer, [b]will be added in the future.[/b] )

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]

Starting off all by your own, doing tasks in villages to earn money or food and other stuff, slowly making progress to start making your own village and start creating your dynasty.
The game has a fun story line in it ( main quest ) and side stories.
Hunting is really fun, different weapons to use variety in animals and some good mechanics like sneaking to not scare of the animals. 
Movement is pretty good might need some polishing but nothing that makes the game annoying to play, graphics look actually stunning good, better than i expected, love the change of nature in the seasons, and that npcs actually put on different clothing in different seasons like fresh light clothing in summer and rapped up in fur in the harsh winters.

[h1]Verdict:[/h1]

Really enjoy it so far, has more than enough content for tons of hours of fun already!
It is early access so of course it has some bugs and stuff, but hey even games that are full released for years are worse, based on optimization and content.

[h1]Pros:[/h1]
+ Great look graphics.
+ Enough content for the price.
+ Interesting historical game
+ Good optimized

[h1]Cons:[/h1]

- Quests bug out often. ( not able to complete them )
- Interact options with npcs ( inproving relations and flirting is kinda weird )
- No achievements and trading cards.

Theres plenty of potential here, certainly, so it could end up being a real gem if the developers are passionate enough about it.

PROS
+ Very nice graphics and performance is very good for an EA title.
+ The concept of the game is great, it just needs to be way more fleshed out. Currently its not nearly as deep or complex in terms of crafting etc as other similar survival games like Life is Feudal, for instance.

CONS
- First and biggest disappointment is the building system. Its all pre-fabs - you can't design your own buildings, you can only decide where to put them. Thats pretty much the only creative freedom you have in setting up your village.
- The current variety of buildings and professions (for your villagers) is very limited at this stage.
- Theres no furniture and you can't furnish buildings (they come pre-furnished) or even furnish the outdoors areas, other than with fences. Maybe more will be added later down the line, like tables and chairs, paths/roads etc.
- Theres a low build limit on the number of buildings you can build, so don't expect to be making big towns or cities.
- The map is very small and dotted with occasional npc villages around which you can't build, which limits the overall build space.
- Seasons last just 3 in-game days, so the pace of the game is very fast and you can't get all that much done in a season.
- Farming hasn't been properly implemented yet, which is surprising considering its a village sim.
- You can only remove tree stumps by placing fields over them, which is a bad way to clear areas.
- NPCs are very two-dimensional, all with the same look and the same 3-4 lines of basic dialogue and no voice acting (yet!). They also bug out a lot.
- Currently its difficult to get any of your villagers to do anything in your village because the functions either don't work yet, or they bug out and just stay asleep / in their homes and starve.
- It is currently far more efficient to sell basic materials to npcs in exchange for good quality food than it is to hunt or grow your own food, making the survival aspect a bit redundant. Just make a fortune from selling sticks and herbs!
- Bugs. Its EA, so theres a lot of them, but some are game-breaking and will prematurely end quests or just completely black-screen.

However this whole game and the roadmap is unfortunately set up for one character. The game can easily be fully explored with one character and completed. Buildings do not take more than an in game day to build. The only thing that time is necessary for is for planting and animals.

The Guild/CK games have things that must be completed within a lifetime but also only across generation. This game does not have anything related to generations yet its name and advertising focuses on it. As such, I believe the devs do not yet fully understand what this game is trying to do. The roadmap is focused on little things like hunting, mining, fishing. These are not things that relate to the actual point of playing this game of generations.

I love simulator especially builder kind of games, and I also love Medieval era. Medieval Dynasty got everything that I need and what I always want to see in one game. I couldn't be happier, really. A wonderful and promising early access game.

[b]Beautiful and fun, simple yet still much more to be learn, in early access but full with content and look promising with it existing content already. A perfect mix of Simulation, Colony Builder, Survival and RPG. Overall a wonderful experience, I highly recommend it to anyone who interesting in these kind of game! ♥[/b]

[i][b]Here are some Pro and Con that I gathering or experience it so far.
Pros; 
- You can build your own settlement; From huts to fence, brick by brick (Although we only use wood here :P), invite other folks to join and become your townfolk, assign them to helping and doing activities around your town such as farming, go hunting and running your workshop, there is also a tax system (I haven't get to that far yet, but will update when I do so :D).

- Family; You need to find your character a wife (or find a wife for yourself, I don't know, I don't judge :P), this system is similar with a game like ""The Guild"", as your character do age and get old so you need a heir that would continue your dynasty, they can also helping you around the house, cooking and tend to your wound.
 
- Fun simulation and survival; Building, farming, hunting (Or go vegan friendly gathering wild mushroom, berry and wild vegetable is work as well :P), crafting, trading, taking care of your animals, taking care of your reputation, most of all taking care of yourself, build your skill and talking with townfolk around the map to improve relationship are never been this so much fun, it feel rewarded. 

- Beautiful world for you to explore; A wonderful landscape that look peaceful and realistic. Season changing, rabbit running around, deer drinking water, wolf howling and hunting in the night, livestock animals walking around the town, people tend to the farm and so on, Enjoyable Medieval sight to be see. 

Cons; 
- Big learning curve; ""What am I suppose to do next?"", ""Where do I find this and that?"" it quite difficult in the first time for me, and it feel like the game want you to discovery things on your own, but I believe many people won't have this problem. However, it would be better if the game would explain it more and have some sort of help/tips that can be access later.  

- Time and season; It not that bad, but it seem so fast, I go hunting and gathering for a few thing in just about a short walk away from home and it already evening when I return, also wishing the season to be longer than just a few days. 

- Hunting; It difficult for me, I sneak in, throw my spear and running around try to chasing some deer, silly me can't do it right and the whole day in-game I just manage to hunt two deer xD. 

- Most townfolks just walking around and siting still in the tavern or fire pit around the map, however, I understand that this is early access, but it would be better if they would chatting, eating or drinking too. :P[/b]

""Some"" game breaking bug that I have found, and some funny glitch, but this is early access game and dev. always put out the hotfix, it really not that bad. A perfect early access game with some content that still in working progress. If you love Medieval and love a game like Stronghold, Banished, the Guild series and want to see or play it from different perspective, ""Medieval Dynasty"" could be the game that you been looking for. :D

The game is full of quests which when completed unlock the possibility to build new buildings, you also level up the skills of your char with the goal of surviving, getting married, have a son to continue your dynasty when you will eventually die.

I read criticism for the 3 in game days length of a season, but consider you start as an 18 yrs old, it takes you half a day to collect items and build a house and it takes 12 days to have a year pass. You can expect to live for around 40 more years which is 480 in game days which is a lot, so despite some fine tuning possibility I find it ok.

Of course you will find some minor bugs here and there (I found some bugged quests and a black screen when seasons changed) but the devs are very active and responsive (the black screen has already been fixed).

I've played early access games before and most of the time they have been sloppy and poor. Not this time. I've only had the pleasure of playing Medieval Dynasty for two hours, but it's slowly becoming one of my favorites. Here are my pros and cons thus far:

PROS
- The game directs the player off to a good start. Makes it easy to understand how the world works.
- The health/stamina/hunger/water gauges are well balanced. Not to difficult, but not to easy.
- Graphics look amazing for a small developer.
- Both crafting and hunting mechanics are on point with other like games.

CONS
- The villagers (NPCs) seem robotic. They partake in the tavern at night, but just sit there and do nothing.
- No hotbar on the bottom of the screen to remind you what you currently have equipped.
- While you are able to turn buildings you are making around, you are unable to turn crop fields.

BUGS
- The only bug I came across was after the third day, I went to sleep and the game froze on a black screen. I'm assuming the game world was changing from Spring to Summer. Something that should be looked into.

CLOSING REMARKS

This game still has a long way to go, but it's off to a solid start. I can't wait to see what else is in store for us in the months ahead. I give Medieval Dynasty a solid 7/10!

The crafting and gameplay are also fairly logical, so many of the gameplay elements don't even need an explanation. A refreshing change to the usual overly complex crafting systems.

Granted, it is still in Early Access, but it's quite well done so far, there are a few problems with interface, keybinding and so on, but these are minor at best and easily resolved I suspect.

Yes it has bugs and errors and a lot is still missing but i did not expect to play this game these last two days as i just wanted to ""try it out a bit"". I tried it out... for 16 hours.

The good:
The crafting, building and rpg elements that are implemented are either good already or atleast promising.
The UI is good already, only the village management ui could use some work imo.
The animations are quite good already mostly.
The music is pog.

The not so good:
AI, both villagers and animals have a VERY basic ai at the moment, meaning its pretty erratic at the moment. 
The economy is not very well balanced, i made a fortune with berries.
The map, i mean this is personal preference but it feels pretty gamey to me, not realistic at all.
The technology system, personal preference again but i dont like how you have to buy ""blueprints"" to craft/build certain things, i mean who am i paying there.

After i saw this game come by in my que i was interested, watched some of the videos. Then i watched a Dev playing it live for about 5 mins, watched him die by eating unripe berries. It even said unripe berries are poisonous but he ate like 30. I started looking at the reviews and i saw someone say: if you like Banished buy this game. I like banish so, i bought it to check it out.

So far i love this game, it is indeed like Banished but then first person. It has some kingdome come ish effect too. so yeah i totally recommend it if you like those games.

i only found a few bugs so far. One bug really annoys me allot. I was asked by Wojbor to kill dangerous animals around the village. I had to wait till night time so i just went building some houses. At night time i went out and killed 4 wolves and 2 boars. 6 kills are needed for a gold reward from Wojbor. As i went back covered in blood from being eaten by wolves i started talking to him. He thanked me and said hell give me a little extra reward from himself. I started to like this guy so i thanked him and the convo ended. As i went to check what the hell he gave me i noticed he gave me nothing... Better yet he still has the yellow question mark on him. When i talk to him the same conversation comes up, i killed the animals-thank here is a extra reward-thankyou-NOTHING HAPPENS. I kinda need money since i dont want to go out and sell berries again for 1g each. i hope this get patched soon.

Other bug is when u go to sleep the screen goes black and nothing happens, thank god when you sleep it auto saves so when u alt-f4 and restart it you just woke up from when u went to bed.

- The Idea of Dynasties and living in medieval times (basically a distinction from the hundreds of other survival games)
- The landscape, it's just beautiful!
- skill trees and leveling through activities (it just makes sense)

Things I dislike:
- very short seasons (like everyone mentioned before me)
- not very much to do (subject to change)
- everything you can do takes a long time to finish (hunting, walking to another village)

The game itself has alot of promise!

I also have concern for HOW MUCH ALIKE alot of the game and its assets are to Kingdom Come Deliverance, The font, some of the menus, item icons, animations, world assets. I worries me that this could be an issue like WarZ had way back when it was called that. Until I know that 100% these are their assets and not stripped from else where I cannot support it.

I talk to ladies always in order to get diplomacy and relationships up - I need a wife. This will take years in present game play. However, I need also certain building for farming or fishing.

So with the current balancing in the game I will play it for a very long time.

41,76161075,english,"After 8.5hrs of straight play I am in mid winter and so far it's great, I took breaks OK? Never was into survival games, however, I am hugely into city building and sim like games like sims 4, Cities Skylines and such. There are a few things you should be aware of:

There is  head bobbing when you walk. If you are easily nauseous, steer clear, this feature isn't optional (yet). There is no third person view and I read somewhere this isn't gonna change anytime soon. You cannot rebind keys, if you are left handed, this may be a hindrance. This is single player, with no plans of multiplayer yet, I honestly prefer coop cause stranger danger!

There are bugs here and there, not game breaking, but immersion breaking to some degree; people float around here and there with their arms sticking out, one of my quests bugged out so I can't ever turn the quest in to this one dude I have to give a branch to (lol), I killed a doe and it's body weirdly contorted out of shape, and little things like that. 

Things I would like to see improve/added and I am sure might/will: 
Towns people aren't lively enough. They all sit around looking as bored as you'd imagine someone in a bare bones looking town would. I would like to eventually see more towns people interacting with the environment or other towns people. The dang cows moo and moo and moo and moo when you get near them, and in UNISON. Tell them to shush it! I'd like to see different prices for stuff I sell the further I go out to other towns; yenno, if I pick up stuff that is common in one area but rare somewhere else. 

Seasons are too short. I think someone said it was like 3 game days and I would like the seasons to have a slider option for length of days within the seasons. I personally would like mine to be 10 days of a season...especially if the small villages become towns, then a true medieval city, survival and planning of food stocks and such would be more challenging.
High key would actually like to see added third person view, and with that character customization in the future.

The landscape is absolutely gorgeous. I sometimes just stop when I am on a hill or by a lake just to admire the landscape, but you gotta watch out for those boars as they will sneak up on you and stab your butt.

47,76159522,english,"I've played this a bit and will continue to watch it VERY closely, I loved it for the (Currently 5 hours) I've played. I have a few things that are just nit picks really but I can see the game improving A LOT as they continue to develop this title. I'll start with some good things, something I noticed right away is that the game is really well optimized for being early access, I by no means have a top of the line computer so I really appreciated this. I like the way they lay out the first few quests and then really open it up for you to do stuff on your own. I like the interactions with some of the story line characters, they knew your previous family member who lived in the valley before and it kind gives you an attachment to the world that I like. Some things that I think could be improved, first the building aspect. I understand why they don't want you to build near a village, so it can allow you to expand, but just starting out seems like you want to be close to one so you don't have to go so far to trade. Maybe add a marker or something that allows you to tell the game when your actually wanting to build a settlement so you can have a house near the village in case your actual settlement is to far to travel back to or what have you. Next, when actually building a house I found it hard to find a place to put my starter home, it requires a flat space which surprisingly there isn't much flat space around the starting area I had to go a few miles out to find something maybe allow the foundation be a little more forgiving on what ""flat"" is. I checked out the road map and I wasn't reading completely and that is my fault but a horse would REALLY help with traveling, walking everywhere was a majority of my playtime and i have to rush back to my house before night so I can sleep. Next, the seasons, the days are semi long, but I feel like maybe up the days per season like maybe a week? I want to enjoy the game and not feel like I am rushed to do everything in three days. Next, the grind, tech points are the thing i see making this game grind like Conan or Ark I can see some people are into that but maybe a setting to Increase the gain, or lower the amount it needs, I wanted to get into the settlement building but I could never get to it because I never had enough tech points (Five hours, and still have not got to it uuuggg, lol). Next, I see people saying its a lot like Kingdom Come, from a Medieval RPG standpoint, I see that, I don't think the combat is fleshed out yet so I can find any similarities there but it gives me those vibes. Speaking of combat, its just point and hope the spear hits for now, the road map said they are adding bandits so maybe thats when combat will be overhauled.
TL:DR : Story stuff, COOL! Building things, Meh. Crafting, its a grind sometimes but, GOOD. Traveling, BLOWS! Combat, not implemented yet. It's not Kingdom Come, honestly I like that I never really got into its combat anyway so hopefully they don't go that way.

49,76159056,english,"Considering this game is Early Alpha, it's an Early Alpha done right! Yes, there are a few issues, which I will get into, but in essence, many other developers could learn a thing or two.

Done right:
-Beautiful Graphics
-Serene relaxing music.
-Crafting
-Just the right amount of tutorial, what I mean by this is, you get a few notes pop up when you do something new, like open the tab menu (inventory, map, journal, skills, technologies) but for me figuring out how to craft a farming plot for the first time, isn't just getting a hoe and scrapping away at the ground, you have to go into crafting --> building--> farming then marking out the area you wish to farm and then go at it with a hoe. 
-Building buildings - this is in relatively unique, sort of adapting on the Stranded Deep kind of building but also not, you choose what you want to build, a home for example, they are prefab building which you cannot change, at least as far as I am aware. you put down the blueprint using a base cost, then whip out your Hammer and go to each individual wall, door, window, roof section and hammer at it whilst you have the required amount of materials on your person.
-Combat is alright, only thing I have come across so far is wolves and boars, and the wolves were interested in the deer's in the area. Boars just charge at you, but 1 well placed spear throw to the face and they went down.

Done wrong - Or needs improving:
-Dialogue - Currently along with other reviewers, there is no voice overs, in the opening cut scene I found myself reading out loud in a voice I felt it deserved. Talking with NPC's can be a bit stressful, you are trying to  create relationships with them and the options you are given seem cheesy or not well structured. Without the voice over its impossible to judge what option will give a positive reaction. For example, if you could hear the voice of one of the villagers and could hear a disgruntled or annoyed tone to the words, you could probably make a better informed choice in your response. Also, given that the Developers are from Austria, the game is not 100% correct in English translation.
- Model movements, at distant when you can just start to see NPC's or wildlife, they either jutter across the screen or they move without animation, just sort of slide about. I also had a moment where I was stood in a settlement and a sleeping person just casually went by. 
-Eating and drinking, For me, this seems like you are doing this far to often, however, given that a season is 3 whole in-game days, I suppose the ratio is probably right.
-Travelling. I would imagine a some point they may include horse's, but for the moment, travelling between settlements takes a while.
-Other bugs. Okay so far, I have had one crash.. and it wasn't even a crash, the first time the season changed, i decided, it was getting dark and I would get some sleep in-game and wake up in Summer. however the screen just remained black. I ALT+F4 after a while, reloaded the game, and low and behold, the auto-save must have kicked in when I initiated the sleep process as when i loaded back into the game, it was the first morning of Summer

What other reviewers are saying and my opinion. A couple of reviewers not, just on Steam are saying that 3 day seasons are too short, I think it is just right, it gives a certain urgency to make sure you have food for the winter. Also, when you can, you get to have villagers join your settlement, and all the hard work you've been doing, now becomes their tasks; Want someone to do all the farming, make them do it; want someone to cut down forests to bring in wood, make them do it; want someone to hunt for the village, have them do it.

My verdict; a solid 8/10. Just remember it is Early Access, expect the game not to be perfect. But it's pretty bloody close! Hats off to Toplitz.

-Pretty bug free, ESPECIALLY for an Early access survival game

-The game is beautiful

-Crafting is quick and very easy to learn

-RPG elements make this game stand out from other survival games but it needs work

-Generally has a lot of potential
CONS:
-After 3 hours it seems like the levelling system in the game requires a fair bit of grinding for very little reward

-The writing is so bad its funny at times, but its easy to look past

-Seasons should last 5-7 days, 3 days is pretty absurd, it makes the game feel less laid-back and makes me feel like I never have any time to be standing around taking in my surroundings (some people might like this concept)

-RPG elements are straight up BORING, you can have four separate conversations, with 4 different NPC's and I can guarantee you ATLEAST one of those conversations will end up being the exact same... You aren't using voice actors, so there really isn't much of an excuse for such little dialogue in this game, which seems to be trying to make a fairly big portion of the game based around this crap

-Grind kinda feels pointless; if there were opposing kingdoms you had to worry about, scouting out your land, and eventually sieging your kingdom, while you build up your own army almost Age of Empires style, this would be my new favourite game... For real. I'm not sure if the devs ever plan on taking the game down that route but I think it would give players a lot more motivation to grind to make their kingdoms the best they can be

Overall, as of right now I can definitely see myself putting a good amount of time into this game, but some crucial changes being added to the game such as more PVE/PVP, better RPG mechanics/elements  outside of talking to lifeless NPC's, and some changes to the pacing of the game, would definitely put this game in my top 5 favourites.......

63,76155095,english,"So far, this game is meeting and exceeding my expectations. The graphics are beautiful, very easy on the eyes. A lot of the aesthetic of this game reminds me of the best parts of Oblivion, from the lush, green scenery to the inventory menus. This world feels very filled out, especially for an early access game. Forests are actually dense, plant life is lush and plentiful, the villages feel pretty realistic. I have yet to encounter any bugs, just some minor spelling and grammar errors in some conversations with NPC's.  One of the more underwhelming aspects of this game is the music, which is rather boring and generic. I think this beautifully designed world would greatly benefit from better music to adventure with.
Building is rather fun, you place the foundation for the building you want wherever you want to, gather materials and hammer everything together. In the future, it would be interesting if the developers added a way to customize the design of the buildings rather than just placing them and building them. 
Seasons are such a great feature, I adore games with seasons, however the seasons in this game last 3 in game days. I hope they add a way to extend the length of the seasons or just extend them in general. 
Survival aspect is pretty well balanced and realistic, I find it enjoyable rather than annoying. 
I feel the price of this game is fair for what you get right now, especially with the sale. I am really pleased with this game so far and excited to watch it develop even more. For an early access game, this feels very well polished and easy to enjoy, and again, it's just beautiful.  This game is crafted with love and care, undoubtedly.

PROs:
- Survival games. I tend to have more of an affinity to it.
- An open world game. That's neat.
- You can build your own town...
- It is very enjoyable for the first few hours.
- Skills that are trainable to receive perks. 
- Grinds. I like grinds.
- It has seasons!
CONs: 
- A few bugs here and there.
- Technology leveling is hard. 
- You can't run your first town without food storage, which you need 5 farming tech... but you need to be able to get manure... where you get that is beyond me. 
- You need reputation to build your town.
- You need to do quests to build up your reputation.
- Walking Simulator
- Lack of difficulty setting and length of the seasons.
- You can't kill NPCs. RIP
Conclusion: It's a decent game for a game that is in Early Access. I like it but it needs to have a better tutorial and more easily accessible how to page in the game (I know it exists somewhere..).

I’ve really enjoyed it so far and only had two bugs that made the gameplay a little rough and have already been patched! The cracking noise, and finalized loading screen bugs were fixed already today (on day one) so I’m already loving the ongoing support for this. Here are some pros and cons and a couple of helpful tips:
Pros:
•	Starting the game, you immediately go and feel that full sense of beautiful environment (like that feeling you got from (LoZ, Breath of the Wild).
•	The graphics, water, and shadows are really amazing for how intuitive this game is, and my older PC runs it just fine.
•	Hunting is a little difficult at first but is really satisfying when you land a spear right in a deer’s face!
•	The way that construction works in this game let’s you customize your own village but not have to spend all day looking for a specific resource that you have no idea where it is (I’m looking at you No Man’s Sky). The building doesn’t take all-day long and still gives you that satisfied feeling like you really just made a masterpiece.
•	The learning curve isn’t hard at all. If you understand wood, rocks, herbs, logs and basic tools you’ll understand it pretty quickly. 
Cons:
•	The music reminds of me Runescape or some medieval game from the late 90s/early 2000s. I hated the music so much I had to turn it off and put on Spotify
•	This isn’t really a con because it’s so hilarious but the swim animation is just you walking in water which is fine (given that this is early access). 
•	The dialogue options to increase your relationship with other villagers is a little wonky and you really have to guess as to what the right interaction is. This really isn’t a game killer, but kind of annoying.
•	The wolves continue to scare the s*** out of me every time I run into them and have now made me spill my coffee on two different shirts.
•	
Some tips for a newbie:
•	When you cut down a tree, some feathers will fall too. Keep those feathers.
•	If you find a herb that you need look around, there are a lot more near it.
•	Get the Survival Sense perk before anything else so you aren’t looking through weeds trying to find healing herbs.
•	You can throw the spear (I hunted for a while before I realized it, derp). 
•	The wolves will scare the s*** out of you.

I was enjoying this game until I was randomly attacked by wolves.  I managed to kill 2 but the 3rd one got me at the last second.  Yeah, I probably could've been a little more careful or prepared or whatever, but when I died I realized...

There is no auto-save?  I just lost the last several hours of progress because I'm spoiled by most games having an auto save feature to reduce frustration in these situations?

This game is grindy in a good way.  I've spent the last couple of hours building several houses, a field, hunting boars and rabbits, wooing random women, and I have to go back to my last manual save?

No thanks.  Yeah, it's my own fault, and the game is in early access so not all features are here, but the fact remains:  I'm p****d off.

Good choice of game engine, whith great potential.
Hope it will not be in early access for long time.

The main disapoiting for me is short seasons, only 3 days. It's not serious. It should be adjustable in game options or changed to at least 10-15 days for example.

Can't rebind (Hopefully they add this option, I always have crouch on shift and sprint on alt so not being able to change it is pretty strange)
Tree trunks just sit there, 
Tree cutting unintuitive in general, axe is returned to side each swing rather than continuously swinging, holding down left click doesn't work

Have to hold E to pick things up, annoying when there's a lot of stuff (Some items you just press E and not hold, I think they should just do this for everything)

Building house leaves a frame, you have to equip the hammer and use it to finish the house (this is hinted but its kind of weird that you just wack the invisible walls with a hammer, guess its okay though)

When you finish the house a bunch of things just magically appear inside of it

So overall really good game and a lot of systems are in place already, pretty much no bugs in early access that I've seen so far, not the most immersive game out there but graphics are amazing and looking forward to seeing where the game goes!

This game is finally bringing us the Medieval, Open-World Survival game that we have been waiting for.You start off as a small nobody, running from war and injustice. You find yourself in a nice peaceful river valley where you can hope for a new future. I finally settled down by a small stream, and the big river and decided that this would be a nice spot for my new home. Little did I know that you would basically be able to build an entire village. You start off as a small shed, but you have the ability to recruit villagers, assign them tasks and make them work in your village.

The graphics are very well done, and optimized and the game truly looks great. Economy: Craft, Scavenge, sell, buy, create, and rob... all of these things are fair game in Medieval Dynasty. So far the economy doesn't have a big impact on what you do in particular. Prices do not go up, or down, depending on whether you sell/buy items. I'm assuming though that the devs would implement such a system. Building: All of the structures are pre-built structures. You put down the foundation and general shape of the building, take out your building hammer and complete it with various resources. You are able to edit walls to different materials (clay, wood, stone) and you are able to edit where you want your door, windows or just a wall to be. Travelling: Everything is on foot, luckily the game looks great, and the distances aren't too great, so I don't really mind.Hunting: Fairly simple as of now. Set up traps, go away for a bit, and a bunny will magically appear in it, already dead... poor little fella. You can also throw your spear and bunnies who will die right away. Deer's take more than just one spear... and then there's Bison/Buffalo's who I tried to kill but I decided to run instead because he didn't enjoy being poked in the head by a spear.Survival Aspects: Hunger and Thirst are there but it doesn't seem that drinking affects you as of now. Eating fills up both, hunger and thirst for now. I would also like to see less food consumption. I currently have to eat 6 pieces of meat (you get 3 from 1 rabbit) to get from 50 hunger to 100.

It's a little slow for my liking, but that's personal preference and I'm still enjoying the game regardless.I have noticed a few bugs though, some are quite frustrating, others not so much.The main bug I've noticed has been when creating a campfire in the wild (not at your home), you  are given the option to sleep through the night. When you sleep at a campfire it will teleport you back to your home bed, where you wake up. This is frustrating as you often have to travel for a good while to reach another village for quests etc. and it means you have to walk all the way back to where you just were.Other bugs: Clipping into tree stumps and getting stuck. It takes a little while to get out, usually manged to get out by spam jumping, swinging my tools and hitting things around the stump.Eating ANY food in the game, even if it says it only satisfies your hunger (not hydration), will still bring your hydration levels up - equal to the amount that the food recovers your hunger. E.G Oat roll heals 45 hunger. Once you've consumed it, after a second you also gain equivalent hydration.These are the bugs I have encountered so far, only the campfire bug has affected my game-play, which is sad, but it's a new game and in early access for a reason.

54,76128978,english,"TL;DR version at the very bottom. So 3.3 hours into this review and let me just say this is an amazing game. It's a little clunky with the animal pathing and animation, but I forgot this was an early access game. I just finished Spring time in the game and I'm looking forward to seeing how the other environments change the world. I love the depth in crafting and building. It does have the feel of Kingdom Come Deliverance and that's a great thing.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Pros:Always something to do. with the 3.3 hours I've played so far I've been busy helping villagers and tending to my own progression. Nice to look at visually. Animations of cutting trees, crafting objects, and using tools are solid.Audio seems to be a pro and a con of mine.. as it is okay just needs some polishing (I'll explain in a con).The UI isn't cluttered with useless information.The Map is vast and the foliage is very well done.. doesn't seem to be too much or too little and looks natural.I love the Medieval genre and the survival/rpg aspects are just icing on the cake.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Cons:As I've stated before the Audio is both a pro and a con simply because the music can become ""out of place"" if that makes sense, doesn't feel real medieval-ish. the crackling loop bug that happens every so often (they literally just fixed this as I was typing this).Animal pathing could use some work as well as the sounds they make. they (wolves) are very hard to lose when fleeing from them.. even going across the river they'll continuously follow you until either you or them are dead. I can't stress this enough but SAVE SAVE SAVE SAVE! If you die and you can't remember the last time it saved... you're in trouble.. because it's going to knock you down a couple pegs and discourage you from wanting to continue. You can't remove tree trunks and after you've cleared your land it makes it look bad. So a way to clear those would be great. Horses would be amazing for a future update, as a way of travel due to the long distances you must travel between quests.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------This is all I've gotten out of the 3.3 hours I've played out the game... I'm really looking forward to the future of this game. It has some really great potential to be one of the greats in terms of survival/simulation. If you have the money to spend on this game.. I'd definitely pick it up keeping in mind that (at the time of this review) it's in Early Access and you will encounter some bugs.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------TL;DR: This game is great and you should pick it up if you like Medieval style survival simulation.",1600362432,1600362766,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True,76561198069887802,191,5,284,16,196,1601049556,,
