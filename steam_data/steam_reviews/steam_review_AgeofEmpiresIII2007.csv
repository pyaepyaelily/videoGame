30,75342804,english,Underrated Age of Empires game that was dumped on by older Age of Empires fans who felt this game was to mainstream or to simplified or didn't require as much strategy and felt to easy. They were way to harsh as Age of Empires 3 may not be as complex as 2 but 3 is an amazing game in it's own right. Age of Empires 3 campaign is based less on historical events and battles that happened and was more like trying to tell a historical fictional story with real historical figures and factions like the Knights of St. John and the Ottomans. The Asian Dynasties is the best expansion in the whole Age of Empires 3 package as it has the most game play mechanics and content. i highly recommend this game and everything that comes with it! This is a perfect Age of Empires game for newcomers who may be intimidated by the pacing and mechanics with the first two Age of Empire games excluding Mythology.

48,76731631,english,"The year is 2008 and I am 10 years old. I've just gotten out of school and have all the lunch money in my pocket, because I'd never eat.

I enter the LAN House, pay R$5 (less than a dollar) for an hour of time and go sit on one of the brown stained office chairs in the back. I'm not here to read and write emails, and I don't have friends to play CS 1.6 over LAN, so Age of Empires 3 it is.

Unironically, I had decided to follow my Dad's advice to stop playing violent video games (GTA San Andreas) after he found out what I'd been spending my lunch money on. Play something educational and real instead, he said. Naturally, a game about pillage and conquest; New World Order conspiracies; and hundreds of bodies seemed a better fit so I fired this up instead.

Ten year old me was never good at resource management, so finishing the campaign took an obscene amount of time, if I didn't get frustrated with a mission and call in cheats instead.

Skirmish mode kept me busier for even longer, but it was all the same and it grew boring eventually. Factions had a few different units a piece, but to be competitive you had to collect cards for each nation. Cards allowed you to send provisions to your colony, such as resources or powerful units, that you couldn't get elsewhere. The only way to collect new cards was by playing each nation, putting you at a disadvantage compared to a high level nation that you'd been playing for a while. And some cards took a long, long, long time to acquire. It didn't help that the AI was very passive on the lower difficulties, or a souped up monster on the higher ones (because it cheated). 

Returning to it nearly 12 years later has been nostalgic, but not in a good way. Limits that were there before are still there. Limited cards in your deck, limited unit counts, limited buildings, limited outposts, limited ships... Naturally, there are mods that address this, but I wanted the experience as intended. The campaign itself has good structure, but the missions usually boil down to a simple formula. You, the player, start at a very disadvantaged and underpowered position and have to go fetch, build, or destroy something. There's not a lot of variety to it. And when they do try to add variety, such as the mission in the Andes it is just plain awful. For example, in that mission you have to go hopping from campfire to campfire to avoid dying from exposure. On top of that, you can't recruit any soldiers, just 'find' them on the map. Perhaps a good mission for Company of Heroes, which is a game all about tactics. But in AOE 3, you often have little control over your units and who they attack. And if you try moving them away, most units slow down to a crawl, so the enemy can hit them without taking damage (even cavalry).

Overall, I'm happy with the entertainment this provided to me as a kid. But, now this one needs to go back in the dusty old toy bin of sacred childhood memories.

-A wide pick of civilizations to choose from, and it is recommended that you play the Asian Dynasties version as you will get 6 more nations.

This game is something else. The graphics are striking even today, with really cook Havok-based physics, sweet graphics, it has a soothing effect stemming from its setting, the wonderful map design and down to its artistic style that make it a great game. The saddest thing about the game's history is that its developer Ensemble Studios has been shut down by Microsoft (the utter despicable cretins), but the best thing is that Age of Empires III: Definitive Edition is dropping on the 15th of October. 
From a gameplay standpoint, it is very complex, expansive, the Home City Card Deck is a strategy-deciding element and you are extremely motivated to play the game a lot, only to unlock cards and build your deck. You end up with utterly unlike decks if you are going against one opponent, if you are part of a team, if you play on water or land or if you decide to rush, turtle or boom. 
All-in-all: Awesome Game with almost endless replayability, thanks to it being a package in which you can fight your very own way by using your own strategy and perks.

24,57499357,english,"""Age of Empires III"" was once thought to be the swan song of a very admirable and endlessly enjoyable classic real-time strategy series, but now it just remains as a very quality entry in that now revived franchise.

""Age of Empires III: Complete Edition"" is a game which holds the core game along with all the released expansions packs, including ""Age of Empires III: The WarChiefs"" and ""Age of Empires III: The Asian Dynasties"", both of which are quality additions to the main experience. Though this is not in the same vein as the ""Civilization"" series in terms of complexity, this game is still undoubtedly strong in its own right, however it ends up being a more mainstreamed alternative experience, even when compared to its predecessors. Nonetheless, this game is still more than quality, especially if you want to sit down for an hour or two rather than multiple hours in a single match. The nationalities all have their own distinct leader and culture, and have advantages to be wary of, as well as disadvantages that you can exploit given you tackle the enemy right. The graphics are nothing to look down upon either, even by today's standards, as it beautifully paints these colonial battlefields on which you and your enemy's blood will spill. 

There are a couple of grips I have with this game, and one specifically with this Steam version. The first that applies to any version you get is the campaign itself. Though the gameplay is good, the campaign designed for the player to practice in and get something out of is subpar at best. Usually, one will just play the Skirmish mode and ignore this portion completely, as it is confusing and rather boring to say the least.The other issue that is more specific to the Steam version of this game is that there is an inability to access online multiplayer, which is a possibly major chunk of the game and a deal-breaker depending on what you prefer. Steam will give you a CD Key, but this is completely worthless in making an online account due to its invalidity. This can't be that hard to fix, but it sadly isn't surprising that nobody cares enough to fix these issues with an over a decade old title. Therefore, we are stuck with either LAN connection or the single player experience. This, however, is not something to loathe entirely, as there is enough content here to keep you invested and entertained regardless of online multiplayer's absence.

Although we are now on our way to having an ""Age of Empires IV"", this was not a perceived sendoff worth complaining about, as even if it lacks extraordinary complexity, it has helped the series remain as triumphant as it has ever been. I would likely recommend this title if you prefer shorter games and faster-paced combat, as the other entries in this series can have games that last multiple times as long as the usual hour or two this game's matches usually last.

[RATING: 7.9/10]

[Edit: Through contacting Steam support, although a hassle, eventually I got a renewed CD Key that allowed for online play, as did my brother so we could finally play this together. Unfortunately, Steam Support gave him a faulty key that triggered his service provider's anti-pirating red flags and they sent him a warning about using his version of the copy. Although this is the only case of this I have heard about, as I am perfectly fine, it is something one should be cautious about.]",1574201285,1599210873,True,2,0,0.523622035980224609,0,True,False,False,76561198450765866,382,183,1546,0,1546,1582767173

26,75402906,english,"If you're looking for an AOE II experience, this would be considered a shell of its predecessor, especially with multiplayer Customization. Instead it's more of an RTS deck-builder where you play and get allotted new cards to further establish and improve your home city. While in game, you can access your home city for shipments that can ship anything from resources to troops to you colony. 

Speaking of resources, there are no more mines, farms, and wood-mills. Instead the villagers will just automatically collect wood from the trees without having to walk it back to your village, and if you want infinite gold or food, you can build a plantation or farm, where you place villagers to constantly gather goods at a slow rate. This streamlining of the grind for resources allows for less micromanaging and more troop building and exploring.

Oh did I say exploring? Yes I did. At the start of every match you get an explorer who's soul purpose is to wonder the map and establish trade routes that help you accumulate extra resources periodically, and to capture treasures that are scattered about the map, usually guarded by enemies. Proper utilization of the explorer early on can get you an advantage in resources.

All in all, solid game, but if you're looking for AOE II but improved, you will probably be disappointed. All of the changes that the developers implemented completed change the infrastructure of the game, making it feel different on a fundamental level.

46,43283273,english,"*Do Not Purchase This Game! On October 15, 2020, Age of Empires III: Definitive Edition will be released for only $20! If you don't think your PC can run the new version, or you just want an in-depth review of the current one, keep reading.

If you still want this game before October 15, I'd say it's pretty good. It has 14 civilizations, a card/ability building feature, and really cool physics. If you're looking for a game like AoE2 though, this feels completely different, from the playstyle to the units.

-Card/Ability System: Each civ has tons of cards they can unlock, from free units, to new abilities. Each group has a lot of cards to choose from. You start out at level 10, and as you play more and level up, you can unlock more cards. You can also create multiple decks, like a deck comprised of eco cards, or a deck containing a lot of military ability cards. Overall, it's a really cool system that adds some pretty neat progression to the game.

-14 Civilizations: There are 14 civilizations currently in the game, each coming in a group. 
   -Europeans: The Europeans have access to the late game building, the Capitol, 
        containing some late game techs that have fairly large bonuses. They also have 
        access to forts, which are very powerful defensive structures, and they have access to 
        factories, which produce resources or artillery.

   -Asians: The Asian civs come with a wonder with each age, giving each civ unique 
        bonuses. They also have access to the consulate, granting them access for a few other 
        civilization's units. Each Asian civ has very unique bonuses.

   -American Civs: These civs tend to revolve around campfire dances, which grant unique 
        units and resources. These civs also have bonuses with building outposts with native 
        tribes.

-Graphics/Physics: In terms of graphics, this game doesn't seem too outdated. the Definitive Edition will definitely look a lot better, but for what this has it's not too bad. Cannon balls have hitboxes that send units, trees, and pieces of buildings flying. The physics of buildings falling looks awesome. Pieces of buildings are slowly chipped off as they are damaged more, and completely collapse once they are destroyed. This game is also 3D, so it is possible to rotate the camera (though I wouldn't recommend it - it's hard to move the camera in the default position once it's moved). 

-Gameplay: In terms of gameplay, this game is really cool. There are 5 ages, each allowing access to new cards, techs, and units. There are a decent amount of units to choose from for each civ, and all of them have a unique purpose. Each civ is different from the others. Each one has unique units, unique access to unit upgrades, and unique bonuses. There are lots of maps to pick from, and every experience is different. My only problems in terms of gameplay is the static population limit of 200, and the fact that there can only be 2 teams in a game.

tl;dr: I'd give it a 9/10. It's an overall awesome game with unique gameplay, awesome mechanics, and unique civilizations. Again though, I'd wait for the definitive edition unless you don't think your computer can run the new version properly (you can check at the bottom of the AoE3 DE page to see if you can run it).

52,13810152,english,"Overpriced, but still a good game. A follow up to the 2'nd Age of Empires that everyone loved.

 Among many this game has some weaknesses that make it not so good. Some things were simplified, such as gathering resources - now there are 3 instead of 4 of them and your villagers don't have to come back to the lumberjack or the city center to store them. 
Many smaller tweaks and adjustments, and of course a heavy focus on musket fights, artillery and the transition from Renaissance to the Industrial Revolution and fatrher away into the 19'th Century.

 It's a shame that there weren't any additional elements added to the Steam release of the game thus far. Maybe in the future...
Controls being one of the more touchy ones. For instance, to change the hotkeys you need to manually go through each tab. There is also no Steam Cloud either.

Moreover, the persistence of the hometown leveling feels like a gimmick. It's useful in the singleplayer campaign for a sense of progression, but not so much in the skirmishes/multiplayer part. 
Also, it's a shame that the Steam release does not bring any unification of the multiplayer accounts. I always keep forgetting the login/pass for this game. Microsoft seems to focus a lot on AOE 1 and 2 remasters/remakes that it forgot about how bothersome online multiplayer can get in this game.

This game is 10+ old. But this edition is by far the best one yet (until GOG publishes it). You get all the expansions. Working multiplayer with a community that still lives. And of course that same old strategy many remember and honor as ""one of the best"".

The modest presentation of its ancestors passed away. I'd say that the magnificence of the soundtrack itself says a lot. The Musical score is composed by musicians Stephen Rippy and Kevin McMullan. 

If History is of any interest to you, if the New World conquests/Asian campaigns were something you're keen on, get this, especially when on sale!

84,73088499,english,"Before you buy, realize that there are lots of problems with this game. I recommend this game when it is working, but not in its current state on Windows 10. Right now the game stalls when saving, gradually loses unit sound, voices, and eventually music. You lose control of your grouping, selecting controls (like adding a person to the selection, etc.) and eventually the game can even lock up. Even when exiting and forcing Steam to close it can still make it so you have to reboot. I have fooled around and fixed some of the issues, but the game is still a dud in its current state. If you have an older OS you may be in luck. OK, enough warning, now a review.

This game, while not its predecessor, is still a great game. The single player story line is not historical, but is still a fun story that takes place over several generations of a family through a historical setting. The add-on War Chiefs follows the same family, but a different storyline. The Asian Dynasties add-on features 3 different Asian countries in their own scenarios. I didn't care much for multiplayer, so I won't review that. The overall game mechanics are decent. Path finding is decent, but units still often get stuck, twirl around, etc. It's easy to get attacked and not realize it. Sometimes there is no warning other than a small amount of ""bad"" color on your mini-map and you all of a sudden realize your base is being sacked. Difficulty is settable and I recommend Easy for people new to the genre as it is pretty easy for new people vs. many other RTS games. A last meh moment is when you realize resources are littered EVERYWHERE, and I do mean littered. You'll want to harvest stuff just to get it out of your way. Fortunately in this game the characters can harvest where they are rather than having to run back and forth to a building, so that's a big difference vs. many other RTS games.

But hey, that's just me and my preference. It's my way of having fun. And I recommend this to anyone with a similar taste. Some cons that it does have is that 200 population limit, maybe some other civilizations may have more, but I've yet to encounter it. Yeah, I just want more troops I guess hahaha. Also, maybe the camera can have the functionality to be zoomed out a bit more.

 If you like the Command and Conquer series, I'm definitely recommending this one. Not just this game either, but the whole franchise!

When it first game out, I don't think the RTS community was ready for many of its novel developments--at the time they seemed more like gimmicks than depth-builders. After a decent amount of multiplayer, I can say with confidence that Age 3 gets away from multitudes of redundant research and unit types, and that it instead hones in on a multitude of play styles that work well alone or in groups.

Pros:
+Strong campaigns
+Solid, highly replayable multiplayer
+Home cities give needed sense of progression/collection
+Games are easily (win or lose) doable in small chunks of time, perfect for aging or new gamers
+Most races play differently enough that you can choose how you want to win, build a strategy identity, and coordinate different styles and bonuses with human players

Cons:
-UI did not age well
-Graphics are okay as long as you don't zoom in
-Weird sound glitches that will blast your eardrums out periodically
-Can't build walls over trade routes
-Some units are highly overpowered, like horse guns (although all are able to be countered)
-Some friends on Linux have connectivity issues with Age 3's proprietary online system (ESO)
-AI does not do so well on maps that leave them landlocked sometimes

1. Lots of hackers/ Zero maintenance  : Its frustrating how you put 1 hour in playing and when you almost win opponent can escape defeat and you can go out-of-sync. Voila! your victory did not count. All effort in vain.

2. Low online player base: Hard to find players specially when i play Asian Dynasties. 

3. 'ESO Connection was lost' : Your ESO connection can get lost even after Victory Now. So no matter how hard you try to rank-up, you cant.

Everything in the UI is oversized as if designed for the elderly or visually impaired - AH, but the icons themselves are convoluted enough that you really cant tell what you're building all too well.

Gone is the soft gridding system where you could measure your placement of objects in the world. Now things snap-to, which is great for building houses, but terrible for building literally anything else.

I like that my people, the Cree, have some soft representation in the game, but that would be it's only redeeming quality. 

The movement speed of all units is sluggish at best, and ""light cavalry"" on horseback hardly outpaced ground units. Conversely, mortar/artillery units move even slower and take up much more room on the screen.

Zooming is awful. You're pushed in about 50% further, removing much of the tactical advantage you had in AoE2. The weird concept of ""receiving supplies from home"" is bad. Just...bad. 

I'm highly disappointed that I couldn't return this game fast enough. I'd rather skirmish endlessly on AoE2 than play this game another minute.

Going into config files and changing the res on each game of the AOE collection didn't work either. i highly recommend anyone with a newer computer just wait for the definitive edition of the game to come out. so until then i have to give it a thumbs down since there are problems present that are game ruining bugs,1593548733,1593548733,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198035939257,157,1,5,0,5,1593548271

I wish more RTS games had an experience point meta game like AoE3.

Pros-

#1.Old school strategy game

#2.Many units to pick from and upgrades

#3.For a game that is almost 16 years old the graphics still look decent



Cons-

#1.2020 price of $39.99 full price you got to be kidding me.They clearly think they will make money off players who played and liked the game before vs getting new players to try it for that insane price


#2.The graphics are almost 16 years old so better check them out first



The Bottom Line-


This game is still good for people that love the genre.You into starcraft? You into command and conquer? You into age of mythology? You like stronghold hd and stronghold crusader? You into dawn of war? You into company of heroes?


Get it on a steam sale though I am not sure they ever have one?

If you can get the game for $10 or less you should be happy with that.

The world looks good in the updated 3D aspect, and the factions are very interesting, but there's something missing here in terms of personality and efficiency of play. The setting is still a fantastic idea, however. The art direction is strong, and you get a pretty exact sense of where you are supposed to be and what you are supposed to feel, that being a sense of colonial adventure. The sound design is solid but not as tactile or well-placed as the last game. The gameplay itself is little changed, and the changes they did make streamlined gameplay somewhat. This gameplay is sometimes stubborn and unit commands sometimes unclear, but beyond that functions well. Overall, Age of Empires III is a respectable installment in the Age of Empires series, but not really quite as good as some of the other options available to the player.

85,65046343,english,"In my ongoing and likely futile effort to write a Steam review for every game in my library (#308 out of 612)... it's time for Age of Empires III.

Behold: a mediocre game dwarfed by the shadows of its predecessors.

I wish I could tell you Age of Empires III were an awful game. That would make things a lot easier, wouldn't it? But it's not quite terrible. Don't get me wrong--it's not a good game, either. It embraces mediocrity in a way that few games ever do. And in most contexts, that would be fine. There's plenty of room in this world for mediocre RTS games, after all. Just... not mediocre Age of Empires games. That's just sacrilege, really.

So, what's the problem? Half of it is Age of Empires being one of the greatest real-time strategy games of all time. The other half of it is Age of Empires II being one of the [i]other[/i] greatest real-time strategy games of all time. You can see why this is one of those games diehard fans like to pretend does not exist.

For me, personally, two things made Age of Empires II: Age of Kings such a memorable, standout experience. First were the incredibly engrossing combat mechanics, where you were given large, fairly open maps with free reign to tackle as you saw fit. Virtually any strategy could be accommodated, and particularly dynamic contests between equally skilled players could last more than an hour, with dozens of different tactics and counter-tactics being utilized. And the other thing? The brilliant single-player campaign, which taught an entire generation of players--myself included--to love history. Age of Kings' single player mode was divided between several different campaigns, each set in a different historical period (and, very refreshingly, many were set in non-Western histories which are usually overlooked in popular media). Each campaign typically focused on a specific historical figure, usually a great general, and served equal parts character study, military history, and cultural primer. The game took many liberties with the history in service of accessibility and gameplay, and while I may not, now, agree with all of the decisions they made... for the time Age of Kings' campaigns were very progressive, very unique, and--most importantly--very refreshing.

And you know exactly where this is going: Age of Empires III has none of that. The maps tend to feel small and linear, the available tactics at any given time few (a real-time strategy game with little in the way of strategy) and the campaigns, such as they are, go full Hollywood. There's no respect for the history being depicted here, nor (by extension) for the players. Where prior Age of Empires games used their gameplay to explore history and make the stories of our past come alive in a way that static text could never hope to parallel, Age of Empires III sees its historical settings as mere backdrop. Set-dressing. It's uninspiring and inconsequential and utterly, relentlessly intolerable from any game bearing the Age of Empires game.

Age of Empires III is a disgrace.

It's a good starter RTS game for those who are new to the genre. It's simple and has straight froward mechanics which are easy to use and enjoy.
Compared to some other RTS games, I still come back to this because of how enjoyable it is and how how little I have to micromanage as well as not having to use massive brain tactics all the time. It's also more faster pace than most other RTS games, but fast as in not tediously slow where most other RTS games have very slow movement and less fighting.
It's also quite unique in the way that you get to build multiple structures all over the map and the treaty mechanic is really nice to have so you could build up peacefully until the treaty is over.

The sound design and animations holds up quite well for a game that is over a decade old as of this review in June 3rd of 2020.
There are many other features as well, not found in the regular game until it is open in the options, such as more HUD on production queues, detailed descriptions and advanced formations, which are really neat to play with, especially trapping enemy AI villagers who are deforesting everything lol.

I'm surprised that there's still a large community playing this outdated game lmoa.
There's even on going events as well as an Age of Empires IV in development as of this post, which I'm hoping to play with even more better graphics, mechanics and features on an already well designed game.

Overall, it's a great game that was well thought out, with a lot of unique nations to play and their own play styles, which is not common in other RTS games. Everything also comes with actual historical info which describes how they were invented, used and how they functioned in what era.

Make cities, forts, and train soldiers and war ships to defend your base with over 35 new maps to try out and explore! Create your own heroic explorer for your country and use him/her in skirmish mode!
Play the exciting 3 original campaigns stories with 2 new campaign stories to enjoy with the DLCS installed!
There is loads to do in this game and it just never get's old, always loved playing this game. One of my all time favourite!

In-game music is great and the graphics are pretty good and you can create your own levels/maps with the scenario editor! Have fun using brand new hilarious cheat console commands lol :-D

Classic World war game, much fun and is absolutely fantastic! Best age of empires game by a long shot!
This is a must have game for your steam library!
This is a really great game this but I would most like to see an James Cameron Avatar age of empires game as well, be even cooler :-D

Its just not worth it unless you like this time period, I dont, the ages before and after it were much more fun to me.

6,45441683,english,"This review is a little lengthy, so if you just want to know why I recommend this game skip the Results and read from there.

Age of Empires III not only lives up, but pushes forward the great series that is Age of Empires. Most people compare it as being weaker than its predecessor Age of Empires II, but I find that these people tend to not see the greatness in this game. It seems in this Age of Empires the game became more realistic, in that the Colonial Era was a point in time when no longer were kingdoms limited in wealth by the amount of gold they could mine. Instead it brings in new Cash Crops, which allow each nation to produce Gold outside of traditional methods.

Campaign:
This is a great game with an in-depth campaign that goes through the stories of a Scottish Explorer and his sons/daughters. The campaign is interesting and introduces different styles of gameplay from macro-managing to micro-managing with scavenging and hording. Definitely worth the play through, for Age of Empires III and Age of Empires III: War Chiefs. Age of Empires III: The Asian Dynasties is fun, but the campaign has nothing to do with either of the other two expansions.

Gameplay:
Age of Empires III offers a brilliant combat system that no longer requires precise delegation of finite resources, but allows for macro-scale battle. Allowing some players to turtle and others to expand, depending on your gameplay you can grow or stay at home. Mining gold and gathering food will always garnish better results than farming gold and food. Not only can you focus different resource harvesting strategies, but you can also use different strategies in your combat choices. You can buy mercenaries which cost only gold, or even capture native towns and create tribal units. This can allow you to vary your tactics based on your environment as well as your team.

Teams:
This game introduces new challenges with Teams that are complex and highly differentiated, unlike in the predecessors where each team essentially was the same as the last minus a few shifts in upgrade options and one special unit (plus two special upgrades). Age of Empires III and its two expansions offer a variety of teams which include peoples of Europe, Americas, and Asia. Age of Empires III includes the Spanish, British, French, Portuguese, Dutch, Germans, Russians, and Ottomans. Age of Empires III: War Chiefs then offer three more teams including The Aztecs, Sioux, and Iroquois. Finally Age of Empires III: Asian Dynasties adds an additional three teams the Indians, Chinese, and Japanese.

Hints:
If you actually want to enjoy this game make sure you edit your cities in order to get all the cards, as earning all the cards takes more than one lifetime. I have owned all three of these games before they were on steam and I put over +300 hours into it still to not have one civilization at maximum level.

Results:
If you enjoy real time strategy games, enjoy managing an economy, epic large battles, and don't like excessive micromanaging then this is the game for you. It offers brilliant combat with amazing scenery. The unit mapping is rather brilliant and the variety of maps keeps you constantly wanting to play more.

Pros:
+Fun campaign with a rather interesting story (for a strategy game).
+High level of variability in teams
+Allowing for turtle or rushing player types
+Good difficulty curve in AI (allowing boosting resource harvest rates to find the best balance of difficulty)
+Each civilization is like a whole new game
+On map bonuses to give reasons for exploring and moving quick across the map.
+Brilliant strategy diversification with special tribal towns on each map type, and special mercenary units for each map.
+Many different types of gameplay which keep the skirmishes from seeming repetitive.
+Loads of cards to choose from allowing you to choose if you want to Turtle, Rush, or Support.

Cons:
-Leveling civilizations is rather dull (just edit the text file)
-You cannot select your AI team members’ cards, which means they will just use resource cards, villagers, and soldiers (not team cards).
-Some civilizations seem unbalanced. (figure it out for yourself as we all have our views on this).
-Rather than producing names for the map choices they are named after states (which can be really hard to guess what type of map you will get if you're not familiar with US Geography).
-You can only have two teams in skirmish mode, which is really annoying if you used to like playing 2v2v2v2.
-You cannot have repeat civilizations; this means there is only one England per map.",1540520070,1589937253,True,19,1,0.668418943881988525,1,True,False,False,76561198373502045,105,144,5168,0,4885,1598894454

85,68332432,english,"My favorite RTS of all time.
Takes elements of Rise of Nations and combines them with the classic gameplay of AoE2, add a customizable deck building element, and add a dash of Warcraft 3 style asymmetry.

The economy resembles RoN, where each settler provides some trickle rate of resources, this actually makes the difference of food types meaningful as the trickle rate of farms is separated in tech from the hunting and herding ones. This is exacerbated by some civilizations having different approaches to economy (subtle, but changes game play enough to make it a unique experience) for example Indians require wood for villagers and receive them with any card from the deck building element mentioned above, Ottomans have free settlers for the cost of a slow spawn rate, and the Dutch require Gold but have a building that generates free gold.

When it comes to unique units, this game has a unique spread that really forces meaningful army building and considerations when teaming up with other players to account for your weaknesses. For example the Ottoman tree is nearly unique, they only share artillery units with the rest of the European civilizations, each civ get unique techs and unit upgrades that further accentuates their strengths and weaknesses. This leads to some really interesting army compositions, the Dutch favoring Ruyters (Dragoons), Skirmishers and Halberdiers, whereas the Russian player might spam a crap ton of Strelets only to use one of their unique civilization cards to transform them into Musketeers. Even unit tactics are diverse, for example Musketeers range attacks are great against all enemies, but for maximum efficiency you actually want to set them to meele and charge them into Skirmisher lines or even after shooting cavalry. A historical nuance that is delightful to consider.

When it comes to the Native American and Asian civilizations there is a lot of unique offerings as well. The Sioux are like the Huns in AoE2, and provide a really interesting game play variation, they are banned from a lot of MP tournaments as they are be exploited extremely well.

That is another note, AoE3 has a vibrant community called ESO Community. They have a standalone installer for a patch and provides plenty of interesting tools to play with.

Mods such as Wars of Liberty add to the content and extend playtime by adding even a new Age to play with.

Game goes on sale relatively frequently for about 75% off which is awesome, wait to buy it then and THEN play the shit out of it.

The multiplayer in this game is awesome, it's a fantastic game to play with friends especially during current events. If you have no friends, (like I did when I first started playing) you will inevitably make some. Still a good amount of loyal players playing the game.

Classical AoE game with a Rock-Paper-Scissors mechanics of units. It's not maybe that dynamic like other RTS games (Warcraft, Rise of nations, Command & Conquer) but it has a lot of options like Deathmatch where the game is more dynamic and less economic focused. 
Being good at this game requires a typical RTS skills but also due to Home City also skills of building a deck that suits your play style.

Campain is pretty boring, easy and short but was fun after all.

Graphics with this all cannon animating is beautiful also the sound effect of firing guns.

80,66921778,english,"I want to be fair with this game. I waited for this game for 7 years. Had great expectations. Obviously, we were all excepting a great sequel to Age of Empires II. We wanted enhanced graphics, a better AI, more balancing and some new mechanics but all we got was a halfass game. 

I still remember the day it came out. New campaign, new graphics, it seemed that we were all happy to discover a new sequel to the old, but legendary, AOE II. It was comforting that the IP was still alive. 

Nearly 11 years after the game’s release, I was looking for a new RTS to play with my homies. Suddenly, because I was not using Steam back then, this game appeared on my recommendation list. Charmed by it, we gave it a shot. Oh boy how wrong we were. This game was and still remains a huge disappointment. 

The AI in this game is pure trash, no improvements. The graphics were okay for its release date but now, they are clearly outdated compared to the new enhanced graphics of AOE II: Definitive Edition. What about the campaigns? I haven’t seen such boring and unimaginative storytelling in a RTS. The game is set to cover the beginning of the colonial times between 1500s to the 1850s. Where did all the great storytelling go? Why imagine something new from scratch when you got plenty of incredible stories, dated from these centuries, that you can develop? Was it too difficult to take example of the highly successful storytelling of the previous title? 

There is no reason to play this game. If you want to truly experience nostalgia, go play Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition. It is really amazing how a game with mechanics conceptualized 21 years ago attracts more interest and attention than this halfassed game.

95,66898183,english,"This was a difficult decision to make, but I would not suggest this game. I would suggest Age of Empires 2. The main problem with Age of Empires 3 starts with the campaign. Age of Empires 2 has a captivating campaign based on real live historical generals and battles. Imagine playing Montezuma, Joan of Arc and Vlad Dracul Tepes. It's amazing. Age of Empires 3 is completely fictional and they pretty much introduce the Illuminati into it. It's like watching a bad Nicholas Cage movie. The balancing in Age of Empires 2 is next to none. I doubt DOTA 2 is as balanced as Age of Empires 2. Age of Empires 3... Not so much. The completely different build orders, units, strengths and the card system lends itself to giving decade long players a huge edge (and incentive to spam the same civilizations and units). A lot of strategy was taken out of the game by  removing mining camps and lumber camps. One of the very best features of Age of Empires 2 was the midgame and endgame strategy based around harassing other peoples resource camps. Ya know... Killing their peasants that tried to sneakily build a commune stashed in the corner of the map by sending a few hussars. Age of Empires 2 succesfully manages to make each civilization unique for different types of gameplay.. Going to rush? Pick a civilization with starting farm technology and extra food. Going to boom economy? Build a civilization with an economical edge. Going to be defensive? Pick a civilization with stronger buildings and walls. Age of Empires 3 probably can't really be played this way because a few civilizations completely dominate the game, and a few players who have been playing them for years have full card decks for them. If you don't have the cards then I guess you have to collect them but competitive play shouldn't give long time players a handicap. It should give new players a handicap. At any rate, I'm hating the campaign. I'm playing it and I hate it. It's depressing in every way. I play Age of Empires 2 campaign and I get to live vicariously through the great Inca warlords. I play Age of Empires 3 and now I'm suddenly battling a secret organization controlling the great non-existent battles between the Ottoman empire and the Scottish. I mean......... Seriously?! 

If Age of Empires 4 turns out like Age of Empires 3 or Dawn of War 3 I will never play a Relic game again. Relic is still one of my favorite game publishers despite their attempt to use Dawn of War to break into the MOBA esport market. They will be my least favorite if they try to turn Age of Empires 4 into anything but an enhanced version of Age of Empires 1 and 2. Crossing my fingers.

The multiplayer platform is also not very well designed, and I particularly complain about how hard it is to look up your multiplayer username (if you've forgotten it) and reset your password. Also, when you're prompted to enter the game certificate/key to authorize multiplayer, there's no way to quickly copy and paste it; that is abysmally designed. The game itself is fantastic though, and this is certainly a far better port than the Mac version! The campaigns are interesting enough, but the best part has remained practicing with the skirmishes with AI on the numerous maps. It's remained my favorite RTS title. It has been a consistently rewarding, well-balanced game that has kept me coming back to it since it first came out.

Campaign - 4/5
Story - 1/5

It's a good game, but nothing grand.

- The nations don't feel as generic as in the AoE 2 but the map and army scales are smaller. It plays more or less the same as the previous games, with some smaller tweaks. E.g. you can now train up to 5 soldiers at once. Graphically the game looks very good and the battle animations, especially when attacking buildings  or ships, are great. That said, the game feels mediocre in comparison to AoE2 or AoM.
- The campaigns have interesting scenarios but the story is very childish and historically inaccurate for the most part. Not to say that AoE has ever payed too much attention to historical accuracy. (Quite the opposite.) There are some scenarios that depict the historical events but even those are tweaked so they would fit the made up stories. Ensemble studios probably wanted to repeat the success of the AoM campaign, but that one was full of monsters so it wasn't that big of a dieal. While fighting russians in apalachians during the early 17 century, and selling it as history, goes a bit over the line. Or fighting the Ottomans in the Caribic. There are many idiotic things like this but these are the most notable ones. 
- The expansions are good, with unique playstyles for the new nations.

P.S. I can't undersstand why they have named japanese mortar ""morutaru"", as the japanese would pronounce it, but rickshaw, which is originally a japanese word is still spelled rickshaw.",1585320639,1585342420,True,29,9,0.608708500862121582,0,True,False,False,76561198030193228,130,95,3418,0,3418,1585315355

I reccomend AOE3 to anyone wanting a casual, colonial RTS with musketeers, cannons, forts, mercenaries, and so on. The original game includes 7 European civilizations and 1 Asian civilization (although is plays like the traditional Europeans), Spanish, British, French, Portuguese, Dutch, Germans, Russians, and Ottomans. The expansions also include 3 Native American civs, Iroquois, Sioux, and Aztecs, as well as 3 Asian civs, Chinese, Japanese, and Indians.
The game also includes the ability to ally with natives, and offers treasures which are guarded, but grant resources, units, and upgrades.
The campaigns, including 3 acts for the original, 2 from The War Chiefs expanding the story, and 3 for each of the Asian civilizations in The Asian Dynasties, are fun and have decent story to them, but have little in the way of challenge.
Finally, you gain experience from killing enemies and building units. Experience is used to increase home city level which allows you to pick new cards to add to a deck, and gain shipments which can send a single card per shipment. These cards range from near useless to game breaking, and it all depends on the civilization you play.",1534571137,1584351819,True,0,0,0.520247101783752441,2,True,False,False,76561198127448002,20,1,53461,0,8817,1595114363

37,64780874,english,"Great game, I've been playing this since it came out and just recently played through all of the campaigns and wow, I can't believe I waited 15 years to play them! Amazing stories, albeit a bit cookie-cutter as they all follow the same model of one main character who gets backstabbed by another main character, and you almost always have a companion of some sort. The fictional stories are told quite well though, and are usually intertwined with historical events like the Revolutionary War or India's fight against the British, and even speculated events like Chinese visiting the New World (I don't know why they would sail Westward through the Indian Ocean, under Africa, then through the Atlantic though instead of just going East through the Pacific lol). Some of the campaign maps are challenging and unique also, for example Valley Forge has you chopping wood and building houses in the beginning with your soldiers, but you have to make sure to go near a campfire to regain your HP as the ""cold"" will drain your units life slowly until you have enough houses built. All in all a great game, it's a shame that multiplayer has issues with it as I worked pretty hard back in 2006 to get all my home cities to lvl 100 or so to unlock all my cards in vanilla. The expansions are great though, Japan has a strong eco, India strong units, and China just masses tons of units cheaply. The Native American civs are probably the weakest though, but that's to be expected. Buy this game, whether it's on sale or not, if you love RTS you will love this! Also to the people saying it's MORE complicated than AoE2, this game is actually LESS complicated, 1 farm for 10 villagers thats infinite, 1 plantation (coin or gold) for 10 villagers thats infinite, I mean how much simpler can you get in terms of micro-managing your eco? The home city cards and decks look daunting and big but once you read through them all and know what they do you realize most of them you will never use, and other certain cards are must-haves, so deciding how to make your deck is easy, especially when you gradually level your home city and start replacing cards for better ones.",1583788426,1583788426,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198105582101,26,3,4686,0,4208,1585141318

AOE 3 may not have as large a roster of civilizations; most notably European ones, which is why I believe there is such disinclination towards this one. I feel that AOE 3 introduces a unique spin to the series with the card system of home city management. Each civ has it's own respective units, passive abilities; as well as buildings.

29,64161495,english,"I think this game's main selling point is its single player skirmish mode.
It's somewhat like AoE 2, where you explore and expand, and stop your foes from doing the same.
(no such thing as Wonder victory or Wonder race; you win only by domination.)
The game offers several ""archetypes"" of random maps, each of which is based on a geographical region in the Americas. In the beginning of a random map game, you are always informed what archetype is chosen by the game, so you know very well what geographic features and distribution of resources to expect, but still have to explore as you do in other strategy games to know how things are actually laid out.
The computer-controlled players can get pretty smart with their strategies. They don't cheat and manage their units on a per-unit basis, so in battles it's often possible to outmaneuver them when outnumbered. It's not easy though, because duh, micromanaging is kind of hard, and the game doesn't assist you a lot in this aspect. Also, computer players taunt you A LOT.
Since AoE 3 is based off the history of colonization, it features a ""home city"" system that supplies extra units, productivity or technology in-game for your colonial economy, via ""shipments"". Two elements in this system make it unique (not necessarily fun):
1. In each game, your home city can only supply you a prearranged, limited variety of things. You make the arrangement before the beginning of the game, and while in-game, you choose from within that arrangement what to receive. Each civilization offers a slightly different pool of ""shipment cards"" for you to pick and play.
2. The more you play as a certain civilization (and its home city), the further that city grows, giving you more options as it ""levels up"". As a useless bonus, home cities allow you to customize their cosmetic appearance as they level up.
The game does have some other features inspired by colonization, such as explorers (very weak hero units that don't really level up), controlling trade routes and befriending native American tribes, but those are rather inconsequential.
The campaigns are decent, especially the vanilla campaign, which gets quite engaging and somewhat emotional at times. The expansions, by comparison, are rather forgettable.

55,63953946,english,"I like this game and I've played a silly amount of hours. If you like strategy and beating up on people with armies, then it will do the trick. 
I mostly play the Age of series, so I can't really compare it to any of the Shogun or similar titles. Within the Age series, I do much prefer Age of Kings. I consider it's military leanings and more diverse unit types to be superior to III. One thing that III suffers from is the time that it came out. Computers were not that powerful when this game was released. The developers deliberately went for a 'realistic' look to the models and environments in the game. Sadly, this game is a victim of the times. The unit count is low compared to Age of Kings and to try and spice it up, there is a card system that tries to variate the gameplay. It works, and allows you to have different decks for different occasions/locations/opponents. Kudos to Ensemble for trying to give you a different game experience and not just ladling out more of the same.  it's a valid way to try and get away from some of the formulas of Age of Kings. I just don't agree that it was any better than that game, and the lack of military focus has weakened it further. 

Another problem is the time frame chosen. The Colonial period gives plenty of story and character examples to work with. The downside is that you don't get the full range of bizzarely entertaining units that occur in Age of Kings. There were never any gigantic crossbow elephants roaming around colonial New York, and the game feels more hollow for that omission. Thankfully the Warchiefs expansion adds in Asian and American Indian units to spice up the battles.

So, to sum up. AoE III is a brave attempt to expand the remit and tactics of your now standard 'Empires' game.  There are problems with unit numbers and a lack of variety in fighters due to the history period chosen and the technological limits of when the game was developed. Overall it's a win though and well worth playing. 

I've been bitching about the game, but it's still a lot of fun. The voice actors have a whale of a time with their lines. Cuauhtemoc sounds rather un-hinged, as he constantly chants for ""Blood - MOAARRR BLOOD!!!!"". The voices of the other generals are suitably dripping in scorn and contempt towards you, the player. Thus further motivating you to want to march across the map and cuff them across the back of the head with a Congreave rocket. 

Although I prefer II, III is still a great military strategy game and comes well recommended.",1582404546,1582404546,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561197974847980,140,6,25023,0,24773,1598040073

46,62772925,english,"Aoe 3 was the latest entry into the Aoe franchise up until recently with remasters and aoe 4 announced. Aoe 3 is set in roughly the 1500 - 1800s era and mainly focuses on European colonization of America. The maps are all set in various locations in America with some extra asian maps as part of the Asian dynasties expansion that comes with the complete collection. There are 14 civs in the game, 8 European, 3 Native American and 3 Asian. The gameplay has a big focus on gunpowder units and artillery and the game is generally determined on how well you can micro your gunpowder, cavalry and artillery. It is certainly the most different Aoe, it takes away alot of the past mechanics, mainly with economy management, but adds several new ones, it still feels like Aoe, but it is rather different. You have a home city that you can send shipments from as you gain xp in the game which include resources, units, upgrades, and building wagons. This system is fun and compliments the games era and gameplay really well. You can also build plantations which are like farms for gold so you can have unlimited gold. You can now train military units in up to blocks of 5 as well. These new mechanics and several other new ones really change the gameplay, its fun, but for the upcoming aoe 4 id rather go back to aoe2/aom classic gameplay. The campaigns in the game are pretty terrible and instead of being history based they are much more character based and fictional.",1580534602,1580534602,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198191517641,69,27,5303,0,1308,1592566323

I thought not. It's not a story the Jedi would tell you. It's a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life… He had such a knowledge of the dark side, he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying.

The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural.

He became so powerful… the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. Ironic. He could save others from death, but not himself.

- There is progression. After each game, you earn experience for whichever ""home city"" you're playing, which allows you to buy new cards to customize your civilizations. This is possibly the games greatest strength, as it makes playing each game actually mean something.
- Each civilization feels different from the others due to their individual strengths and weaknesses, though many of their units are shared. The DLC civs are all even more different with new and unique unit/building types.
- The game's balance is off, so some nations can be better than others, which means PvP suffers. I don't play for PvP, though.
- The gameplay is different from AoE2, so don't you go into this expecting more of the same. It's still an RTS, and there are many similarities, but many things are different. (For instance, settlers instantly deposit what they gather, so there's no travel time.)
- This is a time period that is seldom represented in games (around the colonial era), so it feels fresh.
- Microsoft rarely offers this game for sale, so if it's on sale, and you're curious about it, you should pick it up.

21,61938173,english,"Really good game but the price for the whole game is ridiculous. It should be no more than 20 bucks for a game that is nearly as old as steam.

In relation to what AOE3 provides that the previous titles don't, is the introduction of a 'build a deck' feature that allows you to customise your shipment cards as you gain XP and level up. A really good feature added in a nutshell!

Collecting resources is much faster in comparison to AOE2. Villagers/settlers now collect from the resource point. They do not have to walk to a mill or build a mine to collect various resources. The resources collected go straight into your total resources immediately. The market will substantially improve the pace of collecting resources. 
 
Advancement in era of focus means the units themselves are stronger but, much of the mechanics in AOE2 still carry over. e.g. Capitol replaces the improvements you found in castles etc. 

Ships are so good! They are big, strong, and very good at protecting water resources. Be weary as some units and buildings are very good against them! (Outpost and Fort). 

There are cannons that are deadly against infantry as long as you protect them, their high damage is crippled by their low HP to balance the game. 

Infantry are more formidable and get much stronger as you improve them. 

Different colony/factions have different strengths. British have superior navy and do get the extra settler per house built etc. 

AI is kinda dumb so dont expect it to be good enough to train you to pro level, you will need to master the hotkeys! For a game that is almost 15 years old, I can't really take points off for the AI.

Look at guides for each civilisation, but starting with the British civ is not a bad idea to get used to the game mechanics. Relatively easy to master.

My only two big criticisms are that I wish it had more civilizations (even with the expansions there's only like a dozen total civs, which seems odd given that the civs mostly aren't super different mechanically, unlike Age of Mythology), and that the main campaign is kinda hokey.

79,61173189,english,"A good game but not a good Age of empires game as it feels like an entry in the series that was made by EA if they had bought the Age of empires franchise. Like I said the game itself is good as the overall gameplay is enjoyable and some useful changes have been made. However the story/campaign is utter crap. This is because it borders on sci-fi (when Age of empires is meant to be historical) and has some serious continuity errors. 

Basically the story takes you through three time eras: the late 16th century, the 1750s and some point in the 19th century (the story doesn't say but I assume its the mid/late 19th century). Across these time eras you follow multiple characters and the main plot revolves around a fountain that can alledegely provide immortality if drank from. This alone is stupid because as I said, Age of empires is meant to be a historical game. For example in the Age of empires 2 campaigns you get to follow some well known historical figures from the medieval era as well as take part in some famous historical battles from that era. Whereas in Age of empires 3 you follow the some forgettable fictional characters looking for a mythical fountain. The campaign barely gives you an explanation about the eras that your in so after completing it I felt like I had learnt nothing. My advice is if this is the first Age of empires game you are buying, don't buy it and buy the earlier entries instead as they are much better. Only buy this one if you are curious to see how dull it is compared to the other entries.

P.S Originally I wrote the explanation of the continuity errors in the campaign in this review but it was so long that it looked like an incoherent rant and you would honestly deserve a medal if you took the time to read it.

+ Home Cities-from where you can send shipments
+ The concept of Experience Points(XP)
+ Trading posts and alliance with natives according to the map you play
+ Collecting treasures etc.
It also has other minor changes like five ages to advance through instead of four and each civilisation having more different/unique units.

Some cons: pathfinding is pretty weird and buggy, it's way too expensive for such an old game that isn't well integrated into steam. Thankfully I got it really cheap with winter sale and additional 20% off with winter tokens.

Recently about 4 months ago i started playing online and wow I've been hooked since. For people who have never played AOE before i recommend playing offline and watching youtubers such as samurai revolution and learning some strategies. I've seen new players struggle and its mostly from not knowing the basics, but gaining experience through playing is the best thing you can do. It might seem overwhelming at first so try and use the same civilization to master one then move on to another.

if you like a challenging, real-life-time city build game, then this is your game.

if you play on Hard mode or Above (for me any mode lower does not exist)  you are in for quite a treat.

the AI is pretty strong and knows what he/she is doing.  the best way to counter CPU's is to go full murica and build a wall around your town, then rush wall upgrades.    now you can relax and do whatever you want for the next 30(up unto 60) minutes.

If you dont feel like doing this, you'll either get completely destroyed, or can use your cpu allies ( if you play 4v4) as bait to try and survive.

the civs are also very good in being a nuisance and trying to taunt/annoy you with various comments.

As in overall gameplay and graphics the game is really nicely made and the game is easy to play, hard to master.

A brilliant RTS with the main campaign covering anything from the Medieval Ages to the Civil War (including Pirates (Yar), with the  DLC Expansion's focusing on the Native Americans, Iroquois, Lakota (under the name Sioux) and Aztecs (The WarChiefs) and the Asian Civilisations of the Indian, Chinese and Japanese (The Asian Dynasties).

Gameplay is fairly simple, albiet fun and enthralling at times. Multiplayer is still functioning, although it's a smidge difficult to find a game at times if you're unlucky. Not to worry as there is Single-Player Skirmish which is pretty much the same as MP but with AI instead of actual players. Battles usually range from 20-40 minutes depending on how many players (2 to 8 being the min and max) and how good said players are

Cu.stomisation is fairly limited, with the only things being a Card Deck to use in battle and your Home Town which is purely for Aesthetic purposes

Regardless, i'd give the game a 8/10, would play again :P

Played the first version for years, now since 4-5 years we play occasionally with my wife.
We only play online so 100% of of my playing hours are online. It is odd that I see some people blamed online stability but we never had any issue. 
There are always minimum 500  to 1.000 people online so you will always find someone to play.

Still playing age of empires 2, recently bought definitive edition but age of empires 3 is a different game and I love it too. As a strategy fun, playing AOE series since the launch of the very first game in 90s, I fully recommend this game.

I gave this a thumb up because I enjoyed the singleplayer as the campaign is pretty good. This game requires the least skill from all the available age of empires titles and is pretty easy to learn, so if you are new to strategy games this might be for you.
But that's really about it, the singleplayer Randommap isn't all that interesting as the AI isn't really all that good and pretty easy to cheese if you try it.
And for multiplayer the whole Deck mechanic that they introduced for AoE3 doesn't really work out as a few civs are just way stronger than others. Also the gamehas very few players that play online and finding matches might be hard sometimes. That is my point of view after about 30ish matches.

-If you are looking for a campaign that isn't half bad pick this up, but also pick up the other age of empires titles since all of them did a very good job with their historical campaigns.
-If you are however looking for a competitive OR casual multiplayer RTS pick up age of empires 2 instead.",1577236218,1577236540,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198150260014,160,17,314,0,314,1531142189

While Age of Empires 1 and 2 were all about advancing through the ages to achieve an edge in technology over your opponents, AoE 3 has you set in the same age throughout the game. You can still upgrade some technologies to get an edge but not nearly as much as you could in the other games. It honestly feels dumbed down and too easy. No need to set up mining or lumber camps to collect resources from far away, your villagers magically send them directly to your town center as soon as they collect them. There's also no need for mills for food or farms, now you have one big building that produces unlimited food as long as villagers are working there. Another thing that was added are trade routes, now you don't need to request resources from allies, you can get them for free by building a trading post along the trade route.

Well.

I quickly came to the conclusion it's rather a cheap cartoonish dumbed down version aimed at younger kids who can't affo- wait. This is actually not a cheap game. But then why is it so rubbishly made?

They had every single foundation there, lying in front of them. One of the most successful RTS games of previous decades. And what do they do? They throw the blueprints in the fire, hire some orangutans to point at random suggestions, and completely change everything. EVERYTHING.

It's so dumbed down. I can't even begin to explain it. You have basically ONE faction, with 3-4 different skins. You can build:

- 20 houses (no more, there are building caps! What the hell!) 
- 7 watchtowers (...), market (5 upgrades, all of them improve gathering speed by a slight amount, how creative)
- barracks (you can build cartoon ranged, cartoon spearmen or cartoon swordsmen. That's it.)
- stables (2 different units which... well... not much effort went in to differentiate them neither trait nor appearance wise)
- armory (2 units again)(you can upgrade units... with the same uninspirational boost you'd expect aftera hearing about the market, and the icons are just military ranks, saved some money on that too I guess)
- Dock (fishing ships, caravels and galleys. and ""fire ships"" which are basically eternally burning wrecks and make no sense whatsoever)

So yeah. That's it. Not kidding.

The diversity of the originals are gone, the 2.5 D nature of the old game has been replaced by poor 3D something that reminds of Populous or something (except that it's not as fun), it reminds more of Age of Mythology, but again without the diversity, and for some unexplicable reason, they chose to put the setting in colonial times. Not only colonial times, but what look as the same year even. There's no change to your civ. The only thing I noticed changing appearance is your walls (once, after an upgrade) and your towers (ditto). Your units will always look the same. Your enemies' units will look the same (there's differences when you zoom in, but the horrible 3D concept makes it nigh impossible to notice if you don't make an efffort).

Ok time to let the simplifying go for a second. Or not.

Because now I want to talk about ""how to play"" and the campaign. 
It will introduce you to how to use your mouse, as if you've never used a computer before, and that's it basically. The highlight was probably finding a unicorn rider easter egg in the tutorial while exploring (any effort to prevent the player from avoiding their ""triggers"" or otherwise cheesing or avoiding their intended linear objectives have been poorly implemented and borderline seemed to be done in a hurry).
Actual important information, like how to repair your ships and buildings, is completely neglected (there's a button on the lower right, and there's also a cooldown timer after having been in combat, and ships apparently auto-repair when close to the docks) Enemy armies will spawn at random places, sometimes right on top of you, if you don't pay extra attention to actually trying to follow what you think they intended (instead of playing your own game) or not spawn at all.

Unit pathing is even worse than AoE II (how is that possible?!?), ""luckily"" you usually won't have any interesting amount of units active at the same time.

Side objectives are an interesting add, but they are extremely poorly explained sometimes (missions regarding units can be particularly hard when the unit in question gets lost, or you never knew where it was to begin with, I'm talking NPC style, no name or indicator above, can be next to any amount of other NPCs, no pings, no nothing, no minmap markers except treasures and ""tribes"") The rewards are also extremely neligible, might as well had added an extra gold mine but I guess this is the one place they decided to implement some diversity and then made this too in a hurry. (Would it hurt to make them actually hard and have noticeable rewards?!)

Campaign is made in (now) generic WCIII/Age of Mythology style, albeit with even worse dialogues and incoherent settings and fantasy (WCIII and earlier was great in this regard, AoM not so much but still loved that game because at least it had a fantasy setting and not historic, and the rest of the functions of the game made it very enjoyable)

I don't know what more to say.

I tried to give this game so many chances, and I'm really good at always playing a game through, but I just can't see myself doing this. I regret buying this, and I feel extremely disappointed that they did this so half-hearted.

A few voice actors are great, others seem to be hired family members or overzealous first-timers.

I would refund it, but sadly I played this way too long after buying it. I feel almost a bit angry about the choices they've made, especially with the butchering of other great titles in the past 5-10 years.

If you loved AoE II, for the love of god don't buy this. Get one of the new AoE remakes instead... they're still great fun, have an active multiplayer base (which this game will never have for obvious reasons) and even though they are just that - remakes - at least you know what you will be getting!

Hope the rest of my day will be better than this....

An absolutely [u] great game [/u], but it's not even as good as AoE II at all! I mean it! The campaign feels so similar to Mythology, which isn't bad I would say, but it does not have this certain ""feeling"" when you are playing the campaign missions on AoE II - but it's okay. Lots of story telling and good amount of mission, thanks to the complete edition. 

Missions are done fairly quick, which is a bit boring. 
Gathering resources was cut down massively to make booming way easier than ever. (I know it's an old game, but it has to be said).
And to be quite honest, it gets very boring after a while. Multiplayer (well, about 10 years ago) is the only reason that kept me playing this game.

78,58787243,english,"This game is old, but still has booming player numbers. I logged on a Friday night, and there were 967 players online. To put that into perspective, Black Ops 2, a major success in the Call of Duty franchise in 2012 (which had over 100,000 players online at any given time in its heyday), now has about 700 players online on average. This game is from 2005 and it has more active players than Black Ops 2 currently does...

This is testament to how great the game is. From the panicking micromanagement at the start of the game, to the early rushes, to the late game cavalry charges, to the explosive finales within the enemy's base, AOE3 offers matches that feel accomplishing. You look at the clock at the end of the game, and you think to yourself, ""No way that was 50 minutes, I felt as though I just started!"". AOE3 keeps you engaged THROUGHOUT the whole game, if you feel bored, or are sitting around twiddling your thumbs at any point, you are probably going to lose the match. The graphics are outstanding for their day, and still hold up today. I have never gotten a headache from low quality graphics while playing this game.

This game is also an absolute blast if you are playing with friends, you HAVE to work with your allies in order to win. You will likely have to send reinforcements to your friends' towns against raids, and may have to share resources with each other to keep your team afloat. In my opinion, nothing is better than fighting a losing war and having your comrades literally send in the cavalry to save you, then counterattack with hundreds of troops into the enemy's town... In conclusion, AOE3 is a brilliant, masterful, real-time strategy game that I would 100% recommend to everyone interested in the genre.

the hours shown do not represent how much i played this game

had it on CD prior to steam and i got it at a lower price than what it is on steam now.

38,57464022,english,"Age of Empires 3 is quite fun and it doesn't nearly deserve as much hate, as it so often receives. The game is based during the period of exploration, which means you'll be presented with the historic and technological experiences, that you might expect during that era. From guns, to cannons, to industrial trains and the more ingenious hot air balloons. Each component is cleverly intertwined into the game, with historical hits and misses, depending on the faction you choose to play.

Now, whilst most of the game is quite fun and intriguing, there does exist a very big hit or miss, surrounding one of the core game mechanics; where' by you'll either absolutely love the mechanic, or you'll absolutely hate it. That is, the leveling up gimic, which places a Yugioh-esque - build your own deck card system into the game. The card system in this case, is tiered and each player is allowed to choose upwards of 21 cards, to put in their deck. Now, based on the cards you choose, you are rewarded different benefits, within the game, depending on what Era your Civilisation is currently in and how much Experience you have been awarded. Now, the problem with this mechanic, is that certain cards are hidden behind a level requirement, which means, assuming you are a Level 20 and the requirement, is Level 45, you naturally would not be able to obtain the given card.

All in all, regardless of where you stand on the card gimic, the game is quite a solid and fun experience, that can be enjoyed, both by yourself, with your friends, or even online with the mostly positive AoE community.

I'd definitely recommend this to any RTS or historical fan out there.",1574153491,1574153491,True,20,2,0.682868123054504395,0,True,False,False,76561198050785308,316,3,1250,0,1250,1537249388

Let me preface this review by saying that I’m an avid fan of the franchise and not a good player who knows the game deeply. On to it then!

I still remember the day me and my brother waited patiently to download the demo for this game with a dial up connection. We couldn’t get it done in the end. We Had to pester our parents to get us a broadband plan to finally be able to try this game out. I was hooked from the moment I started the tutorial. For me it was worth the wait for an Age Of Empires game after finishing aoe2. And I loved the addition of trade routes and the trivial fight to maintain dominance over them. The tech tree, variety of units and the total number of resources to be managed are not huge like in the case of aoe2. This helps people pick up fast.

The Game has a semi-decent campaign, and a fun new card system. the expansions have a wider range of features than the expansions from aoe2. i like it but it still doesnt come close to AOE2.

Age of Empires 3 moves away from the ""jump right in and play"" setting of it's previous iterations and introduces a card and deck system through something called your ""Home City"" that allows you to send ""shipments"" whilst you're in a game. These shipments can be anything from extra troops, special buildings or even resources that will help give you a leg up against your enemies. 

Age of Empires 3 only got better with it's subsequent expansion packs; War Chiefs, which introduced the Native American tribes as playable civilisations and The Asian Dynasties which reintroduced classic civilisations such as Japan and China and also introduced a brand new one: India. The introduction of these civilisations increased the playability of the game and also brought in a number of new campaigns.

18,55698807,english,"This game is certainly not new, so I'm not sure how much point there is in this review, but for those of you out there who haven't yet had the experience and think you might, I would recommend going for it if you like medieval-themed RTS / light strategy games.

The graphics can still be made to look nice, and while there isn't really proper mod support there are unofficial mods which can improve things and add content. In fact, the graphics is one of the stronger selling-points of this game I feel, as the satisfaction of blowing my opponents' buildings apart -piece by piece- with cannons and other heavy artillery is just SO very satisfying. More so than in any other game of its type I have played.

Game play is easy enough to learn, but has enough depth that it's not something most players will master in a day. There are important choices to be had as far as which units to make in order to counter the units your opponent is making. Yet it's not impossible to win a game despite not knowing the counters, especially if you're particularly good with the mouse and can anticipate your opponent in terms of troop movement and general strategy. There's not as much micro-managing of non-combat units as there were in previous Age of Empire titles, which I personally appreciated immensely. The included map editor is fairly versatile too.

There are, however, things that will annoy some players -- a lot. For example choosing which cards to put in your deck (yep, it's a light card game too), and unlocking new cards, was not an experience I enjoyed. It felt out of place in an RTS like this, constantly drawing me away to a completely different screen to pick what card I wanted, during which time I was not watching the battlefield. It also somehow feels like there is less to do in this game than its predecessor, and although there are numerous different societies to play they (for the most part) don't feel as different as they do in other RTS games. Having more than two teams did not seem to be allowed without an unofficial patch - something allowed by the previous title in the series as I remember it. Also, while you can have the computer randomly pick a map for you, there is no option to dynamically generate maps, which would have added something at least uncommon to the genre. All in all, it is more of a trade-off, rather than an improvement, when compared to its predecessor - doing some things better and some things worse.",1571638410,1571638410,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198287522845,54,31,1926,0,1926,1549183776

That said, I think the game is better than AOE2 personally, I like the combat and city building way more.  That said, I wish there were more AI options and that there were much bigger maps with larger population caps.  Also, there should be a way to have more than one of the same type of Civ fight in a personal game, I know that may be off given the leader personalities, but just make their portrait match their unit color or something.  This would also mean there would need to be some tweaking to unit limits, but it would be worth it!

From there, I would like to say that the game holds up well, even if it's in the shadow of AOE2.  I like that the Civs are much more unique to each other, and the card system even makes two of the same Civs have a chance to play very differently.  This is one of its best aspects.  No two of the same civs feel too alike, even when you face off with with people all using the same civ.  I hope they find a way to keep this idea going in the next game, even if they drop the card/home city system.  Maybe make a special tech tree that opens and closes unique paths, allowing people to ""steer"" a civ.

At that rate, I also love the era and the Native Americans have always been me fav to play as.  They get little representation in media, and here they are not only playable, but so much fun!

When I bought this game on 10/14/2019, The steam requirements for this game said OS Windows XP , and I have windows 10. This game (( WILL )) work on Windows 10 with some very simple configurations of Windows 10 ...............
THIS IS AN EASY CONFIGURATION!!! ..... On windows 10, all you have to do, is go to the Control Panel >> Programs >> Programs and Features >> Turn Windows features on or off (this should be on the left hand side of the window) >> Legacy Components (make sure this is checked, and the DirectPlay folder inside of the Legacy Components folder is checked as well). After doing this, the game will run perfectly fine.
I would also suggest that you download DIRECTX 9 .... It is an older version of DIRECTX, but it has always worked the best for me !!
My risk paid off, and now I am playing this game on Windows 10, and having a blast !!
I VERY HIGHLY RECOMMEND Age of Empires® III: Complete Collection !!!",1571189988,1571189988,True,23,1,0.727124631404876709,0,True,False,False,76561198997293841,12,1,63213,0,234,1587940275

I had bought this game when it first released and had great experiences with it. 
I really like how the developers have made the online mode in this game, with its player profile and player statistics.
Also I like how you can level up your nation, unlock new cards and build a deck. It was something very new to strategy games. Even if some players didn't like it, I think it had its place. I wonder why not any other RTS game copied and improved upon this system.

31,53598694,english,"Age of Empires 3 is a great take on a classic Age of Empires. The complete edition comes with both DLC which is great as the main campaign is only about a third of the game making the DLC awesome to have. The graphics were pretty good for their time, path finding is a bit buggy at times and occasionally siege units don't fire and reposition when they have perfect view of their target. The Campaign has a pretty decent length taking about 10-15 hours per campaign sometimes longer depending on skill and what difficulty. The skirmish mode is great and the diversity of units and playable factions is something that is enjoyed in most Age of Empires games. The story is pretty decent, I mean it follows a historical path for a good deal of it with some changes here and there to make the campaign more interesting. All in all I would rate the game a 8/10.

It looses 1 point for the path finding and other handful of bugs in the game, and it looses half another point with the slightly outdated graphics. The other half a point is taken off because of the length of the campaign, I personally would have liked more campaign, coming from Age of Empires 2 there was a lot more campaign, with the prologue being just as long if not a little bit longer than the main campaign for Age of Empires 3. 

All in all I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys a good RTS with diverse units but would advise you wait for a sale to occur as the game is fairly pricey for anyone who may wish to play this solo.",1562289461,1571084820,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198139183372,228,10,4492,0,3819,1573100883

On the other hand Cards Balance out some defensive items like Forts.
-The City/deck system can be cheesed if you do not like grinding. (Open up your save in wordpad.)
-Every skirmish I have played My AI teamates lost to the enemy AI no matter what so I guess play on Hard?
-Graphics are good enough.
-Runs smooth on a Lenovo T430 laptop
-If you have played AOE II you can pretty much jump into the campaign and skip the tutorial. I did play the campaign..... 
-Workers no longer having to transport Resources to base/camp Is amazing.

-Units can annoy you, Pathing and Unit AI is a weak point in gameplay.
-I really hate how slow every unit moves.
Mortars and artillery are even worse. 
If your units are under fire they move even slower.
Boat battles are weird. Like the RNG on Boat damage is legit mindboggling, but not really game breaking.
-I played without any hotkeys at all, was not bad.

I know it is not a very popular opinion but i do think that this game is better that Aoe2. However even for one of my favourite games it still a a few flaws, an example of this is the deck system. This is exploited a lot in multiplayer games, the reason behind this is that you can spawn in troops without resources very early in the games. On the other hand it is great late game if you want any upgrades for your units. Another thing that annoyed me is the pop cap, i hated the fact that i was very limited on the amount of troops i could have. I know that this can be considered strategic but i do dislike it. Most all the worst thing about this game is the price £30 for a old game is BS. Honestly i will only recommend to buy this game on sale the price is shit.

I'm glad to say that my childhood love for this game still holds up (and that the game is on Steam, given that I lost my CD copy years ago).

A lot of people will tell you that Age of Empires II is the peak of the franchise. I didn't play Age of Empires II until high school- where a bootleg copy was being passed around as shareware- and while they're both undeniably good games, speaking honesty, I actually prefer III to II. There's just something about III, I'm not even really sure what, that grabs me in a way that II doesn't.

The graphics aren't anything to write home about, at least nowadays, but the game still looks good. It runs smoothly. The unique traits, buildings, and units of different leaders and cultural groups are enjoyable, and make it so that playing as different leaders legitimately feels different. There's enough challenge that it's not a pushover, but not too much to make the game more frustrating than fun. The gameplay and unit balance are solid as well, and the average game time is neither too short nor too long.

Before I have ever played it, I have always hated it just because basically every AoE2 player did.

AoE1 has for me a very big amount of facettes,
AoE2 as its younger brother a more difficult, but clearer image that promises organized waves of satisfication.

I’ve played rts games since Warcraft 2, Command & Conquer 1, and Lords of the Realm 2.

How is it different? What stands out?
The home city system: you can name your explorer, name your city of origin, choose what shipments to unlock, and which to bring with you on the skirmish. There is a rpg element in this.
Colonists, native americans and asians have different play styles and gameplay mechanics.
Units of different nations look different. This is a minor thing, but is major to me. I detest playing as asians or arabs, then training a swordsman, and it comes out of the barracks looking like a european in chain mail, kite shield and broadsword. It feels lazy, unrealistic, and reduces immersion.
You can hire strong and expensive mercenaries for coin.
You can hire cheap and expendable bandits for food and wood.
You can train native allies that don’t consume your population size.
AI leaders speak to you (with voice acting).

I do wish the hud was adapted for widescreen resolutions, without being so big nor the icons on it stretched.
Also wish the AI was a little better, a little more variety in their shipments and tactics would be nice.

All my previous PCs and laptops were too basic to play this game, so I spent a lot of years playing only Age of Empires II. I got so used to it that I was afraid that I wouldn't like AoE III, which was like a total mystery for little me. Now, I've finally bought it and... it's even better that I thought it would be.

First of all, this game is NOT Age of Empires II, so don't expect to play the same game with different eras and civs. It's got some recognizable aspects from every AoE, like the overall style and basic mechanics, and the design of many buildings. However, it's also got TONS of new content and improved mechanics that will make you realize how old AoE II actually is - not that it's a bad thing.

Although Age of Empires II feels grander in comparison, Age of Empires III is way more complex and detailed. It's got less civilizations than the previous installment, that is true. However, each civilization is different and completely unique... and also kind of customizable in terms of bonuses, which is cool. Also, this game has a new ""deck card"" mechanic that gives stuff as you gather experience during each matcch. All civs have some military units as default deck cards, which helps making matches faster and more entertaining. Some other deck cards include resources, forts, ships, towers, town centers, and especial bonuses like faster house building time. The DLCs add tons of new units and mechanics as well - way more than AoE II DLCs used to offer, honestly. You'll have to learn quite a bit of new stuff to understand the game (if you come from AoE II), but once you do, the game is a lot of fun, and it turns into the classical RTS experience.

If you love RTS games in general, like Rise of Nations and... well, Age of Empires, then you will not be disappointed with Age of Empires III.

Pros:
>Graphics, still hold up well by today's standards (released 2005)
>Controls, simple and easy to use
>Campaign modes have really good story lines
>Voice Acting is top notch

Inbetween:
>Gameplay very smooth but different from Age of empires 2 in some ways which might not be suit die hard fans of AoE 2 (Gathering resources is different and amount of troops)
>Camera - reports of some players finding the camera too close?
>The menu to choose the expansion packs sometimes does not load but you can right click the game in your library to select which expansion to play.


Cons:
> Online mode seems to be a bit of a head ache (especially regarding cd keys)
> Price seems very expensive for how long the game has been out (On sale it is really cheap, i think i got it for £5 in the sale)

Overall - A great RTS game that i enjoyed but some fans of the series do not like the changes to the gameplay from the previous game.

Yes, some mechanics make a lot of levels and skirmishes feel like a piece of cake, but that's not all there is to it. It accommodates fairly new users to the game mechanics while the veterans can just amp up the difficulty to make it more challenging and fun. And the adversarial strat processing and AI of AOE3 is WAY better than that of its predecessors.

First of, what is Age of Empires about:

You build and manage your own empire by sending settlers to gather resources and build
different buildings for improvements. You also build your army because there is only on empire at the end of the war.
Or you cooperate with others to win.
The best for you would be to check out some gameplay video.

And what AoE III offers?

- good graphics
- Trade Routes and Native Villages to work with
- heroes don't die, they stay downed at ground waiting for friendly to come 
- shipments from home city - a very great feature
- treasures - small amount of something guarded by 2 or 3 enemies
- special attacks (heroes)
- much much better terrain than II
- forts and factories

In conclusion, AoE III is a fantastic game which I highly recommend.

However I think it loses it's polish online. I wonder if it would be better if it had a larger community, but it is small overall. Skill levels are in great disparity which makes finding a balanced game difficult.

Community size is not the biggest fault however, gameplay is just a bit imbalanced. And any imbalance in a franchise that produces such competitive players will understandably be exploited.

It is still a fun game but it is unlike Age of Empires II which is well polished, has a bigger community, and is overall balanced.

But I get a message saying windows couldn't make necessary modifications (my system is in french, I can't type it 100% as it would be in english).

when I close this, I then get a failed initialization notification then the game closes. Everytime.

I've looked on internet, the solutions given require somethings that ultimately demand that I reboot my PC's system (to restore some issues my windows have... but those issues have never shown up to now. Only for this game).

I wonder if anybody else got this issue and how they dealt with it. Anyway, it's unacceptable that a game fails to launch systematically on steam. I have had the same story for GTA IV and now this.

Wait, you dont know what this game is about? I will shoot an arrow in your kn... 

It's a real time strategie game. You farm, build, attack, get killed, farm more, build more, attack more and win... that's it.

Story is actually pretty fun to play. You get to do many diffrent kind of things, not just the simple ""destroy there base""-quest. There is for example one mission where you need to explore a cave and rescue some dudes and the only possibility to get soldiers is by bringing those dudes back to the begin of the cave. Dosn't sound like fun? But it is, trust me.

But the best thing about this game is the ""AI vs Person""-Mode. 
I've spent tons of hours (had the game on a CD, game hours on Steam dosnt show my real hours) just by doing that, you can do 1vs7...4v4...1v2...1v1, just as you like and it's great.
There are also cheats, like ""truck truck truck"", you spawn a giant monster truck and can kill your opponents really, really fast. 
It's also a bit like rock, paper, scissors (most of the time). Canon gets killed by dude on horse, dude on horse gets killed by normal dude and normal dude gets killed by canon... or you be like me and spam musketeer because they look cool.

Oh, there is also an multiplayer. Never really played it. Played like two rounds, one match with a friend and another one against a randome opponent. 
Spamming musketeer dosnt work.

Also, you will hear one of these very, very often. Like very.

I think I only ever finished the base game as a kid so it was fun to go back and play it again.
I saw why I struggled to continue as a kid as the DLC missions were so hit and miss, yet, I can't put my finger on why. I enjoyed them all but it didn't seem to have that spark to make me really get into it like AoE2 or AoM did.

64,48884636,english,"This game is superb! Definitely an improvement from Age of Empires I and II! There's lots of maps you can pick with beautiful scenery, different nations each with their own leader that automatically quote funny taunts at you in-game, as your enemy or ally (for instance, if you destroy the Portuguese's town center, their leader, Henry the Navigator, will say,""You have razed my town center, you filthy swine!""), and, unlike, Age of Empires 1 and 2, there are only 3 types of resources in this game: Food, Wood, and Gold. In Age of Empires 1 and 2, the resources were Food, Wood, Gold, and Stone, but Age of Empires 3 doesn't include stone in this one. If you've played Age of Empires 1 and 2, you'd know that you have to build a mill at food, a lumberjack at wood, and a mining camp at stone and gold, just so your villages can drop off the resources. But in this game, you don't have to do any of that! You don't have to build any annoying buildings at resources just so your villagers can drop stuff off, you can just tell your villages to harvest the resources, and they'll just simply do it, without needing any building to drop off their resources! So much better! :) 

And not only are the graphics in this game much better than Age of Empires 1 and 2, so are the campaigns! In Age of Empires II, just about all of the campaigns require you to be an enemy of Jerusalem, which is just shocking. But in this one, the campaigns have extremely exciting, fictional stories. I don't like the Japanese, Chinese and Indian campaigns, but the Black family campaigns are awesome! There's 5 parts to the Black family campaign (each part has a bunch of levels), and each part stands for a generation of the Black family:

Part 1 is about Morgan Black, a Scottish Knight, in search of the Fountain of Youth. He runs into enemies and friends along the way, like Elizabet Ramsey, a pirate, Sahin, an Ottoman general, Alain Magnan (who Morgan takes orders from), and Spanish conquistadors. 

Part 2 is about Morgan's grandson, John Black. A villain called Warwick kidnaps John's uncle, Stuart Black, because he knows Stuart is one of Morgan's Black's sons, and might know the whereabouts of the location of the Fountain of Youth's water. So John and his best friend, Kanyenke, set out to try to rescue Stuart, and hunt Warwick down. Along the way, they meet George Washington, the United States' first president, and receive his help. John is married to a Native Indian, Nonahkee (who is actually Kanyenke's sister), and at the end of Part 2, she has a son, Nathaniel Black, which leads into Part 3. 

Part 3 is about Nathaniel Black and his army of natives fighting back against the British and especially the vicious Hessians, who take their orders from the cruel Colonel Kuechler (pronounced Kooch-ler). Kuechler even kidnaps Nonahkee, Nathaniel's mother, and Nathaniel and his uncle, Kanyenke, set out to rescue her. 

Part 4 is interesting, because the protagonist is not a man this time, but a woman - Nathaniel Black's daughter, Amelia Black. It starts with Amelia Black owning a railroad company. She meets a sinister Frenchman, Pierre Beaumont, who says he knows of a cave with gold, and will let her have a share of it. Amelia agrees, but, unkown to her, it's a trap, Beaumont is only leading her there to kill her. Kanyenke, the native from Part 2 and 3, knows this, though, and gets there in time to reveal Beaumont's plan to Amelia, and who Beaumont really is - the leader of the Circle, who wants the Fountain of Youth's water. Beaumont flees into the caves, and that's what Part 4 is about - Kanyenke, Amelia and her friend Cooper chasing Beaumont down, to bring him to justice, find out if the Fountain of Youth is real (only in a game :D), or just a myth, and, if it's real, get to the water before Beaumont does (Amelia says at one point, ""What will the world be like if Beaumont lives forever?""). Along the way, they run into Simón Bolivar, who agrees to help them with Beaumont if they will help him and his people be free of the Spanish.

And part 5 is my absolute favourite, every single level is really fun to do. The story is about Chayton Black, Amelia Black's son. Amelia Black married a Native Indian (you never see him in part 4 or 5, Amelia just mentions him when she visits Chayton, in Part 5), so Chayton has native Indian blood in him. Amelia has retired from the railroad company, and Chayton takes over. He meets an old man, Billy Holmes (who becomes Sheriff later on), and they work together to defend colonists from Sioux attacks. The Sioux attacks deeply concern Chayton, so he goes up into the mountains to meet with the Sioux's leader, Crazy Horse, to find out what is going on, and try to stop a war from starting. As you go through this story, you find out why the Sioux are attacking, and who really started all this fighting. Eventually, Chayton is faced with the choice to either ally with the Sioux, or with Sheriff Billy Holme. What will he choose?",1549749976,1560052485,True,2,0,0.523622035980224609,0,True,False,False,76561198377738658,20,32,14746,0,11755,1560053437

[h1] The Good [/h1]
AoE has always had a strong focus on economy and base building, and nothing since has done it quite so well.

Between the three expansions, there is a ton of single player campaign content with interesting scenarios to play through and a few different civilisations to play with distinct units and buildings.

The graphics are old, but the low poly models and sometimes amusing animations are generally clean and visually distinct, and it stands up surprisingly well at modern resolutions.

[h1] The Bad [/h1]
The stories in the campaigns are pretty awful, but at least give some context to the action.

[h1] So should you buy it? [/h1]

So what's the deal what is this game, who are you, where am I, what's going on here?!
Well it's Age of Empires III obviously. It's a game, third one in a series to my knowledge. It's pretty good. If you like brief reviews here ya go:
It's a city / civilization RTS resource managing game. Basically you get a town center, train townspeople / citizens, build buildings with them, use them to collect resources like wood, stone, gold etc. Of course you spend the resources on building stuff but you also upgrade things like unit health, armor, building weapon range etc. It's a pretty solid game, good graphics, good sounds (though not the best), I think my personal favorite aspect of the game is the difference structure wise of all of the buildings from faction to faction, Portuguese number one!

Because it works great on my half dead windows XP but when i try to play it on my window 10 pro it dont work, i even try using my windows 7 and it works from time to time then i DC.

59,43100913,english,"Age of Empire 3 is an old real time strategy (RTS) game that didn't quite live up to spirit of Age of Empires 2. The key being the lack of coherent empire building and too much focus on the Wild Wild West. It is very evident in the trade routes and the constant use of Native Americans as some side race.

Gameplay-wise, it's similar to Age of Empires 2. There are a few odd additions that spoil the empire building process like native camps and trade routes. The focus of the maps are very much on the Wild Wild West. 

While in the game, you can open a separate screen to access benefits from you empire. This is very silly as you have to open another screen that blocks your strategic view just to send additional bonus goods to yourself.

Conclusion, Age of Empires 3 is worth playing but the experience is less about empire building and more about playing a Wild Wild West RTS. I am hoping that Age of Empires 4 will be more exciting.

Note: I saw the AOE 4 ad with the ""New Zoom Levels"" feature. I want to slap the idiot that tried to pass that off as something innovative.

[h1][b]PROS[/b][/h1]
1. Age of Empires Style RTS
This is what drove me to play it.

[h1][b]CONS[/b][/h1]
1. The Trading Route. 
It's an eyesore. 

2. City Deck
Is it necessary? Those cards build units for you bypassing the need to build a building first.

3. Too Many Settlers Required
This is a relic of old strategy games. Having to micromanage additional groups of SCVs, settlers or resource pickers. There are too many Settlers required to gather resources. i.e. 20+. It is not fun to have to micro-manage cherrypickers.

4. Gun Saloon
This really ruined the whole concept of Age of Empires for me. This is not a Wild Wild West game. It says Empires, not 

5. Too Much like No Man's Land (2003)
I assume AOE3 and No Man's Land shared a few programmers? 

6. Ship/Naval Combat
If the ships can't be built to the correct scale or you can't balance the damage of the ships, don't bother adding them in. AOE is fine without ships.

[h1][b]NEUTRAL[/b][/h1]
1. No Delivery of Resources
Settlers no longer deliver resources, unlike Age of Empires 2. This is both good and bad. Good, because there's no delay in resource collection. Bad, because it removes the strategic element of reducing resources and forcing the player to extend further beyond their borders. It no longer squeezes the players to make the map smaller to increase the chances of conflict. There is very little risk to your Settlers and it removes the illusion that it simulates real settlers collecting and delivering resources.

[h1][b]SUGGESTIONS[/b][/h1]
1. Age V: Modern Era
I think you need the Age V: Modern Era with tanks and planes. This is the military end game where you blow up the turtle players and destroy their town hall, ending the game.

2. Upgrade Your Settlers
Provide techs that improve worker speed and make them visual. You already have it for German wheelbarrows. E.g. Loincloth Settler -> Fully-clothed Settler -> Wheelbarrow Settler -> Horsecart Settler -> Truck

3. Design for Turtle Play
The majority of players love turtling for some reason. Make it look like you can turtle for early game and then make them lose for choosing that strategy.

4. Historical Lessons By Empire/Kingdom
Every nation used to be part of some old kingdom. Like how China changed from Shang to Tang to Ming to Qing to the People's Republic of China. Or how Iran changed from Persia to the Sassanian Empire to Umayyid Caliphate (Islamic Iran) to modern day Iran.",1530109908,1554723942,True,2,0,0.512229502201080322,0,True,False,False,76561197998455537,516,640,1441,0,1441,1529593340

76,49746313,english,"This is more of a comparison and explanation than a review, however I do have to say this is an all time great regardless of your opinion.

AoE 2:
- villagers need to carry resources to and from their corresponding depots
- the shift-click AI is extremely rudimentary at best, which means you have to be more attentive to explorational or multi-tasking efforts
- steam workshop to work all the kinks out of the game (because, yaknow, skybox is objective trash)
- 4 resources
- the replay value is in massive armies and multiple battles, but very little meta of any kind outside of the stock team bonuses each civ has

AoE 3:
- villagers generate resources the second they're tasked to collecting one
- you can very effectively multitask
- you can rotate the map, although it does look incredibly awkward outside of the stock perspective. It's nice for seeing why you can't build something somewhere, though
- card system instead of team and civ bonuses, but the cards can be team or civ bonuses (which leads to a really sweet meta afaic)
- 3 resources instead of 4
- AI is kinda soft. Expert is like the only reasonable setting. In age2, just Hard is really challenging and will occasionally floor me.


Both:
- audio, music, and graphics go together incredibly well and stand the test of time (which is super rare imho)
- the balancing dynamics between all the units and classes, and the artistry that goes into the architecture, etc are all spot on in terms of feel
- both get laggy the more walls you build (lol)
- both have AI which gets stuck trying to understand it can't make a beeline through an area with no immediate way through
- both have AI with a weird infatuation with focusing on destroying pillars, but AoE 2 hardest has really damn smart AI.


Are there things I wish for both? Of course! Will they happen? Very unlikely. Have I been playing each before their official release dates going as far back as the 90s? Oh my god yes.
Will I keep playing them for as long as sanely possible? Not solely, but also my god yes.

This is an INCREDIBLY fun game to play, moreso over Age 2, as Age2 has very drawn out and less visually and aurally dynamic gameplay, for LAN parties.

But then they would take out combat options like having being able to make units stand still without having to go into setting and set it yourself. It took me 3 games to figure that out, I was so angry.
They have just made so many decisions that were just unnecessary.
Walls are useless because now every unit in the game can destroy buildings easily, outposts are okay.. use them every now and again and forts are pointless. Even ship battles aren't even that great because nearly every building has massive damage against ships.
And I hate that artillery automatically sets up when you click them to go a fair distance away from them.. There has been so many times where I have set them to attack but they decide to unset then move an inch then try to set up again even though they could've just moved without unsetting, this of course led them to their death by a single horse many times.. I wish that this was an option.. They wanted to make it easier and simpler but taking out things but it just ended up making things way more complicated as I had less freedom. I can press the set up button myself, it's one click.

Impressively long and not quite as dated as expected. The UI does take up an alarming proportion of the screen but thanks to larger monitors and higher resolutions this isn't really such a bug bear.

The game itself is quite linear and trying to ignore mission objectives to explore the map sometimes has nasty repercussions such as large numbers of troops tied to certain buildings being damaged, just in case you throught you were being clever.

It was also good to see the official expansions ported to Windows 10 that were too expensive for my younger self back then. It's a pity the game is set up as three ""Act""s that teach you to 
suck Overall this has been fun for the money and a good trip down memory lane!

When you launch a game, do not choose ""complete collection"" because this is a vanilla game.

You can also go to the game directory and choose ""age3y.exe"" and make a shortcut.

The real gem here is the competitive multiplayer aspect. The game was released in 2005, and still has a very active online community. In a few months the first ever competitive esport competition is being held. Age pf empires sets the bar for real time strat games. 

Also, this edition DOES contain both the Asian Dynasties and Warchiefs expansions, and to access them you need to right click on the game in steam. The AS expansion and vanilla game are usually only played, as the warchiefs was a little unbalanced for competitive play.

The Good:
Visually the game is stunning. The graphics look good and the animations are just a delight to watch especially when building come crumbling down. The buildings now actually look like they can fit people inside them.
Gameplay wise there are few changes such no resource dropzones needed, Home Cities which are some nice additions for the AOE series. Personally I found this to make the game more fast-paced.
Although AOEIII is not as popular as AOEII with respect to multiplayer the campaigns are really fun to play. The cutscenes and the writing make the story very engaging.
The music and sound effects are nice to listen and unique to the gunpower theme of the game. However I would rate AOM my favourite.
The expansions are fun to play.

The Bad:
The pathfinding is good but at times bugs out during combat when you target an enemy.
No grid based hotkeys. Since there is so much variety in units and buildings it is a bit difficult to remember the different types of buildings and units in each civs. This is simpler in AOEII.
It does not support Steam Workshop neither has Steam Achievements.
Those annoying confirmations when launching the game on Windows 10.

Overall a fun addition to the AOE series.",1551618018,1551618018,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198045587519,93,33,2029,0,2029,1551623332

I love the concept of home cities as well the overall historical setting of the Discovery Age. More so than any other AOE game out there, AOE 3 (and all expansions/dlcs) provides me with the feeling of a dynamic game, which doesn't necessarily end up as a resource grinder (like AOE1 and especially AOE2).

Age of Empires 3 may have been the end of the old AOE series, but at least the series went out with a bang....or did they?

I would only buy -75% of the price.

I loved the simplicity of Age 1, hated the upgrading festival of Age 2, but Age 3 I like.

It is a very functional little RTS, and it ""plays"" well, like a good RTS should.

You can group 50 units in one control group, unit limit 200, 50-99(+boats) of them are settlers.

The civs are all very different, which is refreshing.

The most annoying bugs are the following:
1. On ""attack move"" some units stop just beyond range and get bugged there.
2. After units kill a hero, they also gather around it and end the attack move.
3. AI does not repair buildings.
4. If AI main towncenter is destroyed it gets very paralyzed.
5. Ai hero does not build a new TC. If his TC is razed the hero will just stand there if he is revived.
6. When adding units to a control group, the front units ahead will slow into an intolerable crawl to ""wait"" for the rear to catch up.
7. Only elite AI will use wagons to build anything other than a fortress.
8. Allied hunter gatherers get bugged into shrine animals.
9. Sharing resources is only 100 per click.

Still the game is very playable, and AI modding will repair many things.

It might look the same, but it is NOT. The pictures might look very charming and pretty, until you start the game and see how bad the game engine and UI is. Also the gameplay has changed unnecessarily and unclear, extra tabs for city bonus,  huge & ugly UI, buggy units and unit menus in menus where you have to click back to get to the movement hotkeys. yea, it's long to explain but it is unplayable. In compare with AoE 1 or 2 I'm extremely surprised by how bad the unit movements are, they made the worst version possible of AoE. It is slow, it is super clunky, units get stuck by their own collision, attack&move is buggy, units getting stuck for no reason, grouping units (ctrl+1  2 3 etc.) is buggy and more. It is SO f.. frustrating to play. No wonder the AoE 2 population is much higher (check steamcharts.com) 

Nostalgia destroyed. if you think you were playing a following-upgraded-better version Age of Empires, no you are not. This is THE worst version of AoE. It just doesn't play like AoE2, it lags its clunky its slow.. it is so bad... 
Are you feeling offended? Calm down AoE3 fanboy, ""it doesn't play like AoE2 cuz it ain't AoE2. It is 3."" 
Wel... Normally a newer version of a game should have a better tuned game engine/gameplay/graphics. It has none of these. Game engine is way worse than AoE2, gameplay is just unplayable, graphics, it took you guys 5 years to make a 100 pixel unit to a 150 pixel unit, Hurray. 
No wonder they keep remaking AoE2 since 2007. They realise AoE3 is a flop, found out AoE2 is way better, so kept doing the thing that works. which is remaking AoE2. again and again
I would NEVER recommend this game! I recommend you to buy AoE2. 

I have no idea why people would recommend this game. I've got a feeling many people don't understand fundamentals of a good RTS. I might be whining this whole review but this game is actually this bad, it frustrates me. and I had to write this. Hopefully some of the devs will read it and reply an explanation why AoE3 is so bad...After huge success of AoE2. Maybe it is something in the budget, maybe the nongaming-management team making decisions they have no clue about, maybe you guys hired a new game designer/dev who is hopefully fired again. Maybe I'm wrong all above.

Now I could be wrong on this but it was 600 as of 2:30 AM and well that means in america everyone is asleep so yeah I dont blame it not having a large percentage of players. But... My main concern was when I was checking too see how many games were available if actually matched the online players. Well, if I remember right it was 14 games which could assumably consist of 1-8 players so even if all 14 games were 8 players each it would make it around 162 players total for the game but i really have to take half of the numbers away right off the bat. So 81 actually playing. That game was in my standards just overall dead. Now I never actually played the game but if its RTS I really dont want too invest a whole a lot of time into a game without a player base just to say im good at the game against AI. But more importantly is the player based may just be all the games in general to boost numbers significantly higher. Although I cannot confirm that. I will say this, if theirs less then 3,000 players on a multiplayer game that gives ranks so on so forth. It would be less fun because the likely chance of you being put with someone with more skill then you is way extremely higher especially with numbers around 100 players currently actually in game setup mode. Although I think I understood the ranking system meaning conscript would be newbie player. I do not want to go against someone who potentially spent 100s of hours perfecting the game before me, me or him having fun against me at that point would be completely hiliarous because yes ofcourse he would have fun until theirs no fun to be gained then having to go against me constantly just would make it illrevelant to play.

68,48847380,english,"Thank you, Steam, for putting all three AoE IIIgames on sale for $9.99! I was so happy. I couldn't afford the $40 price tag.

I played this game for hundreds of hours on Mac (pre-Intel chip era). I find the key commands and unit control of AoE III much more intuitive than the previous Age of Empires releases. AoE III only requires three resources (food, wood, stone) rather than four (+gold). This allows users to focus on the end game: building an army and smashing their opponents into oblivion! Watching enemies scream and cartwheel across the map when blasted with the Imperial Cannon never fails to bring joy!  

The learning curve for AoE III takes several hours (if you've never played Age of Empires), but the tutorials and single player campaign are engaging so learning isn't a grind. The first time I played it, I stayed up all night to finish the campaign. The Warchiefs campaign was also intriguing.

The card system is cool. For each XP level your civilization gains, you earn a new card for an in-game bonus (e.g., 12 Musketeers for free). There are over a dozen different civilizations in the game, plus six more with the two expansions. The card systems adds replayability to the single player aspect of the game that previous AoE’s lacked,  allowing your hand of bonuses to become stronger the longer you play a particular civilization. I didn’t enjoy being pwned in online multiplayer, so this was a fun way to relax and beat the computer on the Easy setting while still leveling up my cities.

Age of Empires III is a game developed by Ensemble Studios and published by Microsoft Studios and is the third game in the Age of Empires series

The game offers some pleasant graphics and really vibrant colours, although some ugly glitches here and there, it is pleasant all the same

The game does suffer with some repetitiveness at certain areas of the game but a fun game nonetheless

Age of Empires III overall, however, is a fun game to play, yet sometimes flawed, but is a great strategy game to play in short bursts!

[h1] RECOMMENDED :) [/h1]

As a huge fan of AoE2, I was super hyped about 3 when it was on sale. But it became a little disappointing later on. 

The game mechanics has become much simpler. MUCH SIMPLER. To the point that this forces you to focus on your military 99% of time instead of ""farming"" and focusing on infrustructures and defenses first, which is my usual play style. Microsoft also REMOVED UNIT FORMATION. Because Formation is quite useless in AoE2, instead of fixing it and make it useful, guess what? We're just going to remove it OMEGALUL

It holds none of the charm of the other games that came before it, and I don't know why, but I just don't find playing it fun. Then there are the problems with unit pathing and the camera. The camera is zoomed so far in that I find it not just annoying, but almost impossible at times, to play. Meanwhile, the units constantly organize and reorganize themselves; finding it difficult to get close to one another. While I like the idea of melee units being able to throw flaming torches at buildings to burn them down, rather than just hitting them with sword or pike, it causes huge pile ups that badly disrupt your attacks.

I don't know, maybe I could have recommended this game to die hard fans of the series, or new people looking for a good RTS to play, but I just can't, especially with the unbelievably high $43.99 price tag.

0,48602634,english,"This game is good. Not great but good. Campaigns aren't that interesting and main one (not expansions) follows some fantasy pseudo-historical plot. The game shines in good old comp-stomp battles.

The game is wild and unbalanced. It's a traditional empire building formula you see in similar ""Age of"" games but with some twists. Random maps are full of stuff you can control and exploit, like local tribes with unique units and economy upgrades. Factions are much more varied than in similar games, it's more similar to Age of Mythology in that regard. Even Europeans that are similar have some very big twists. 

But most importantly it has an interesting Home City mechanic. While other complex RTS feel like a Civilization game in real-time this one is a Colonization in real-time. You have a city for every faction you play and it grows in ""level"" allowing you to buy new ""cards"" you play during the game. Those cards may be a unique bonus for your economy, a free building, resources and so on. You can choose a different game before each game thus customizing your faction. During the game, you gain XP for practically everything and it allows you to get new cards and after the game, it can level up your city allowing for new cards.

This system is abused in multiplayer as there was easy to cheat. Having a higher city level doesn't make you flat-out stronger but it certainly makes things easier. So this system works best in singleplayer. AI is decent and interesting to play against. It knows when he's lost and has a lot of entertaining taunts giving personality to every opponent. You can train on lower difficulty settings against a passive AI to learn the ropes and then go higher using new cards and tactics. It allows for a nice progression as you get new tricks even if you lose a battle. Surprised few RTS ever used similar mechanics. Company of Heroes has similar system in-game but it doesn't have a progression between fights. C&C4 was similar but it had hidden basic units behind progression wall.

There are problems with the game, of course. UI didn't age well, it will look stretched on your widescreen monitor. Battlefield view is too small, I want to zoom out all the time. Fonts are pixelated too. But the game itself looks and sounds great, graphics are at a perfectly acceptable level even in 2019. Controls feel modern and comfortable unlike, say, AoE2 HD.

TLDR: Don't expect this to be a game to play forever in multiplayer and you'll be fine. It's fun, it's interesting, it's often sold at -75% and you won't regret buying it.",1548651139,1548651139,True,25,2,0.70332646369934082,0,True,False,False,76561198043840291,443,65,304,0,304.0,1542466316

11,48515476,english,"Age of Empires III deserves far more attention than it does. The Complete Collection is made up of three games, the original AOE III, War Chiefs, and Asian Dynasties. (After installing the game, boot up Asian Dynasties for all the content, though boot up the other two to see the different game art.)

From a setting standpoint, AOE III focuses on the 18th and 19th centuries, and you play civilizations through the telling of lost legends. From a gameplay standpoint, AOE III plays very similarly to predecessor Age of Mythology, where there is more emphasis on macro decisions. Most of your micro will probably focus on your heroes and their special abilities. Like other AOE titles, there are plenty of civilizations to play. Each civilization has entirely unique unit compositions and build orders, so there’s a lot to learn and remember. The campaigns include a number of cutscenes along with the scenarios for added entertainment. Don’t expect a challenge from the AIs in any aspect of the game aside from scripted events in the campaigns.

The expansions include shorter campaigns but have interesting stories to play along with. The biggest additions are the added civilizations that certainly diversify the possible play styles.

The music is awesome and should be its own soundtrack if it isn’t one already.

I have two misgivings about the game. One is that the Tab key is reserved and can’t be remapped for whatever reason, so my idle villager hotkey for AOE III is, well, the far-away tilde key.

The other strange thing, although I like the concept, is the card-playing mechanic. During a match, you can level up by killing enemy units or exploring the map, and when you accumulate enough experience, you can “play a card,” or call upon your “home city” to grant you upgrades, resources, or units. In addition, outside of the match, you can construct your deck by choosing with cards you want to have available in a match, and your home city level carries over between matches. Being able to carry abilities between matches seems unbalanced.

Microsoft might be Remastering AOE III like they did AOE II, but AOE III is a great RTS title on its own as it is. If you’re coming from other AOE titles, don’t let your experience with those games prevent you from enjoying this one.",1548297311,1548297311,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198143034343,150,60,1883,0,1883.0,1548215525

60,19543734,english,"Unfortunately, given its normal price ($48 for a game that came out a decade ago!), I can't say this game is worth it for what it has.

Why? Well...

1. While the maps are very creative, the circular world doesn't really work and makes some maps feel smaller than they should be. Although when compared to the other AOE games this is out of preference, you can't create your own maps either so most of the maps aren't great to play on.

2.  IF YOU ARE GETTING THIS GAME FOR MULTIPLAYER, CONSIDER MY ISSUE! I've had past trouble with the SOE servers which periodically disconnects on me resulting in a ragey loss (not due to my lack of skills in the game!). From what I've experienced, if you don't live in the northern hemisphere then you'll struggle to find a game that doesn't lag horrendously, assuming you're not playing with friends from the same world region. This might've been fixed since I last played (many years ago), but judging on the amount of people who actively play - I highly doubt they would bother!

3. Singleplayer is good, but may not be particularly challenging for some. I enjoyed it, but having played it years before I'm not as impressed with the high price tag.

4. Graphics were a good upgrade from the other AOE games, but both predecessors have just as much in terms of content and playability.

5. Units are created in batches, instead of the old one for every click method. This works for some civilisations/units, but otherwise seems unbalanced in some instances.

Therefore: get it on sale if you really want to have a go, but I don't think this game has aged well in some cases, and other games give IT a run for its money in terms of playablility and quality.",1449478091,1546665205,False,2,0,0.437776833772659302,0,True,False,False,76561198084871312,153,41,318,0,318.0,1434708761

AOE 3 is it's own unique game and it performs pretty well. I recently got it on steam and only have a few hours currently but I also played it many many hours when it first came out on hard copy years ago. Whether it's better or worse than AOE 2 is for you to decide, but on its own:

Good things: AOE 3 is a faster paced game than earlier AOE games running only around 1 hour for a 4 player game (I've had AOE 2 games that would run 4 hours sometimes). It's pretty easy to get the hang of the game and it doesnt require much micromanaging at all. the home city shipments is an interesting way for you to costomize how you want to play a particular faction and is for the most part, pretty balanced among all factions (except iroqoise, they're garbage and don't add much content from the minor tribe that they were before the warchiefs expansion). the asian dynasties expansion was a great expansion that added lots of content and new ways to play.

Bad things: if there were things they got wrong with this one, a big one is the massive loss of control over your custome games. no longer can you have 3 seperate teams or choose the map size andces resources and victory conditions. you also cant set computers or yourself to be a random faction in multiplayer anymore. they also lost all the fun and creative game types that they had before (king of the hill, regecide, that super fast mode). another downside is that because you cant create a faction without starting a new home city, it discourages players from jumping into a game and trying a new faction out because they want to level up their old one.

It has problems but this game is definitely worth the time if you are a fan of the RTS genre. its good for multiplayer and single player and i highly recommend trying it out.",1546293047,1546293047,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198128366710,107,9,269,0,269.0,1543112859

I had just loaded in my first game, as Germany because of Prussian Space Marines, which I know aren't in this game but I was in it for the meme to be honest.
I spent the first 30 or so minutes just calmly building up my first city, and fending off a few attacks, but then, god forbid, Henry the Navigator dares to kill my favorite settler, who I had mining outside my city walls. I quickly pulled a Reich and made a massive military in around 4 minutes, using it to completely slaughter his colony. It was a long battle, and we were about the same strength at the time, but luckily Ivan the Terrible(who basically was my best friend) came in with some cannons and helped crush the resistance in the town.
I made a little colony over it, getting some wooden walls and continuing to live in peace.
But that didn't last long, as I eyed Britain, who would quickly take apart my new little town within 20 minutes of it's existence, murdering it's inhabitants.
For some reason Suileman surrendered around here, I think Napoleon was able to destroy him, but this was literally his only action.
I knew what I had to do, I quickly built up a massive army, one that would rival the strongest of all time, and marched into the English colony.
I ran my Uhlars in, slaughtering it's inhabitants who were working the farms, to prevent further growth of their military, as my cannons and infantry chipped away at the outskirts.
Eventually, we made it into the main part, as Ivan and the Dutch came in and helped me crush the English resistance.
We came out victorious, but already I eyed my last target, Isabella of Spain.
I quickly rebuilt my army, as I had taken some heavy losses, and rushed into the colony.
The battle was short but bloody, but I came out on top.

59,47277555,english,"My thoughts after playing a game of this for the first time? 

It's okay.

The graphics are VERY dated, but that's to be expected with a 9 year old game. 
The mechanics are challenging to master but not so complex that you have no idea what you're doing when playing for the first time, especially if you've played an RTS before.
The games themselves can be quite long, but there's always something to do or work towards to keep the player occupied and not become super bored. Maybe you need to save up coin to upgrade something, maybe you have a bunch of units you want to build to wipe out your enemies, who knows.

That said, the mechanics for this game feel slightly less complex than the first Age of Empires, and the combat feels quite unsatisfying since ranged infantry and artillery style units are just so powerful. Couple that with a system that grants bonuses to players just playing the game that lets them get various ""shipments"" and it feels much more simple and as a result less rewarding compared to other installments in the series, at least in my opinon. It's still an Age of Empires game, but not exactly the best one to play.",1543853814,1543853814,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False,76561198058244505,208,36,78,0,78.0,1543823217

While I was not a fan of the gunpowder era as much as Ancient Times(AOE I) and Medieval Times (AOE II), the variety of units from European and Asian units are pretty cool, allowing some Ronin vs Musketeer type battles.

However, I don't know how much I like the progression and deck system in terms of multiplayer, as low levels are disadvantaged due to not having as much cards and call-ins as other higher level people(Think of the Company of Heroes 1-2, Dawn of War 2-3 type commander systems)

A crap ton of more restrictions are in the game compared to AOE II however, such as a limited amount of Castles/Towers/Town Centers/certain units you can build, almost limiting on what strategies are viable (but still plenty compared to other RTSes)",1543779469,1543779469,True,1,0,0.518518567085266113,0,True,False,False,76561198052250982,298,96,8912,0,645.0,1567274262

This game can be at 1 versus 7 or a free-for-all Or even even 4 versus 4, There has to be a minimum of 2 players, you and an AI. So there are lots of different teaming methods you can play with. Each game(of a 4 versus 4) lasts me about an hour and a half or so on the hardest difficulty. This game also allows you to save your game, so you can come back to it?? 6 weeks later if you wanted. Not only that, but there is mod support for this game. Allowing for custom maps, custom units, pretty much everything! I do reccomend buying this game as a whole!

75,28728915,english,"My personal favourite RTS game ever, to the people who say AOE2 is better I say this.
AOE 3 is better becuase
-It has a leveling up system so you feel like you've done something
-You don't need to set a ""gather point"" for your villages to collect resources, it just comes to you
-Builing takes 1 minute not 10 minutes
-Nicer graphics (doesn't matter gameplay wise though)
-A map customiser which I feel is better than AOE 2
-No DLC (you get it with the game)

Anyway on to the actual game:
Pros: 
-A leveling up system
-Great fluid graphics and several maps
-Loads of different countires and units
-Extremly easy to play (far easier than AOE 2)
-Get to customise your home city when you level up
-Your own explorer who is pretty much your captain but he's very intresting 
-People actually play mutliplayer
-Great difficulty levels ranging from beginner, which teaches newcomers how to play to very hard which is ""very hard""

Cons:
-Some units could be seen as overpowered *cough*cough* Imperial Bombard
-The campaign is fairly boring
-You can just cheat and gain high levels in single player skirmish

If you enjoy RTS games like the Total war series or Age of Mytholy then you have to give this one a try becuase it's one of the best. 10/10",1482877044,1542904004,True,2,0,0.522870719432830811,0,True,False,False,76561198348749290,136,66,43882,1677,7004,1602068217

the other detail like AI will have some trash talk with you, and also track last match result, it's really hilarious and big part to enjoy with it, made you feeling there a real person control that team, the deck system is new feature in that time, it's a special part but didn't draw much attention, a sad part which you may call it's a failure part of the game, finally the campaign it's soild but not much interesting, the excuted result made you feeling like played a history lesson, and really no well remember charater like warcraft 3.

85,23218118,english,"Following on from the monumental success that was Age of Empires II, this third installment brings the franchise into the light with jaw-dropping graphics and a style of gameplay that is a dream to play. The attention to detail is astounding, from everything to cracks in a townhouse just about ready to crumble, to the wide range of sound effects ranging from hilarously stereotypical comments from Isabella of Spain to Frederick the Great of Germany, to the sounds of cannons such as the Falconets. Even the different environments manage to evoke a sense of belonging, as if one is truly standing in the snow in Siberia, or sweating bullets in Caribbean - not an easy feat for a strategy game to achieve. The fact that no major installment have been released since (Age of Empires IV anyone?) is simply a testament to the replay value and endurance of one of the all-time greatest strategy games released.

The campaign has changed too as now it's not about the story of a civilization but more like a story of a Family. You don't play anymore the great leaders of our long history. Now you're following the story of the Black family from the great great great grandfather who was sent to the New World to his great great great grand daughter trying to expand her railroad company throughout the US and their feud with a powerful secret society willing to take over the world.
But you should not worry, once you taste it, you don't want to get back! I just love that game as it's such a nice breakthrough. Of course some things doesn't change: the AI is still throwing soldiers at you waiting to be massacred by your awaiting army as it never changes spot, you can still use cheat codes to get improbable but very efficient weapons (Gee that cannon firing explosive pigs is top notch as not only all your enemies are wiped out in a single shot but there is also that yummy smell of bacon all over you as well!

Act 1 and 2 were by far the best because it was just fresh to my mind. Act 3 was also lacking in a good story because by then it was obvious that Beaumont was going to betray you.S sadly I cheated half of the missions in the game. I  mean I did feel like I hadn't finished it properly; like it was cheated (because it was). My favorite act was act 2 because I sort of knew how to play it by then and it wasn't too hard (i still cheated though) But then I started the war chiefs. Act 1 was just a breeze but act 2 was fun up until then the second and third last mission I must have been stuck on them for a good 10 hours. I  remember a betrayal by Holme a bit because it was so obvious that he was going to betray you. It just felt wrong killing the Sioux though, because at the start Chayton said that he was half Sioux, but you spend half of the act killing the Sioux, but suddenly Chayton goes ""oh I don't want to burn down a tiny village"" and ends up destroying a massive one. So in the next mission, you kill Holme but straight after that this other dude comes along and says ""I don't like you, and know I'm going to kill you"".This leads me onto the final DLC. It was one of the best DLC's I ever played. It's mission's were so fun. I only struggled on like 2 or 3 missions. In act 3 though most of the victories didn't actually feel that good because I finished them so fast(only took me like 3-5 hours). But I made sure in the last mission that I did all the secondary objectives just so it would last longer because I really did enjoy this game. It should have only taken me 40 hours or so but it took me closer to 80 hours to complete. My most joins memories were when I used cheats because i was so overpowered and it was just funny, or when I would be on a mission for more than 2 hours and I would finish it, and I would shout in a proper British accent ""YOU ARE VICTORIOUS"".

[u] Buy: [/u]
- Great graphics (considering it's an '09 release)
- Easy Game play
- Storyline - Personally, I adore it. [spoiler] The journey with Morgan Black through the isles of Malta, the close bond of friendship with Kanyenke and the betrayal from Alain Morgan. [/spoiler]
- Not too grindy - I like games where I can invest a few hours and get something out of it. AoE III is one of those games where you can probably complete the main quest within 10 hours or get a single player civ. to at least level 25+.
- Level up - I love games where there is something to play for, in this case, there is Home City shipments. You level up your city to gain cards, each card grants unique upgrades and troops.
- Music - I'm a fond believer of ""Good music = Amazing game"". AoE III doesn't dissapoint. All through my childhood. and even to this day, I am singing the main tune. *baa baaaaa bee noo noo baaaa*  \^o^/

[u] Avoid?: [/u]
- Not too disimilar
- Less civilisations compare to previous games. If you don't own the expansions, you only get to play 8 Civilisations (6 more with expansions, 3 each)
+/- Resource Gathering - As we all know, in the previous Age of Empires we had to locate storehouses near economic points so we could gather resources faster. Well in AoE III they completely scrapped that idea. All resources collected now go directly into your economy. This is a positive as it makes the game less reliant on storage locations but a negative as it removes a reasonably big tactical element.
- Too little gamemodes - This annoys me a bit as I love to mess around on games and try new ideas and tactics but how can I when there's only two gamemodes? Deathmatch and Supremacy, both good in their own ways, but I want more. *Bear in mind that this point applies directly to Home Cities*

All in all, I [b] 100% Recommend [/b] this game. It's almost always on sale during winter/summer sales so keep an eye out. Honestly don't think there's much point in buying it full price.

25,43290042,english,"Severly Underated RTS Classic

On release, AoE III was an innovative game that failed to meet the expectations of the franchise's fanbase. Some of the mechanics of the original games were abandoned, and while there are still many similarities, the original game did have a very different feel from the earlier titles.  Additionally, while the singleplayer gameplay and campaign were fun, the limited number of civilizations made multiplayer predictable and unbalanced.  Some of the ensuing criticism was well deserved, but many of AoE III's shortcomings were more than addressed by its two expansions; both of which are included in the complete collection.

The complete collection is an excellent game that I highly recommend. The sheer number of available civilizations and customization options alone warrant acclaim for this innovative title.  Pushing new frontiers of the RTS genre, AoE III allows players to develop each civilization to accomodate various playstyles.  It maintians the classic four resource economy, but intorduces additional aquisition strategies to help propel you thorugh the ages.

The maps are symmetrical, you can just draw a straight line from your base and know where your enemy is. This is fine in Starcraft or Dawn of War, but what I liked from AoE2 was how Nomad and large randomized maps would force you to explore and tread carefully.

No diplomacy.

You can't choose a giant map and leave several player spots closed so you cant, for example, 2v2 on a 4v4 map.

The military squads are small, yet AoE2 has you field army's.

The interface is twice as big as it should be.

It looks great, and I suppose you can have some fun with the campaign, but gameplay wise and multiplayer wise, I don't think it surpasses AoE2.

I would say the advantage over AoE II are mainly that it deals with uncomfortable situations in the previous one (farm limit, ships limit, units different populations, things that should be changed in the previous game).

Launch the game as Asian Dynasties!!!
All other content is included and the game is vastly improved with more options, better UI and full unit stats available in game with no extra clicks. I don't know why that was ommited in the first 2 itterations.

89,24616153,english,"A decent reimaging of an old classic.

While not a classic in its own right, or a master class in startaegy. Age of Empiers III is a decent strategy game that manages to bring update the franchises play style and strategy components.  

To those who are familiar with the franchise its a lot of the same with a few interesting new additions.  To those who are not, its a pretty standard romp in real time strategy.  You have a city you build buildings, workers, gather resources-- pretty much what you'd expect.  

The gameplay is solid and very, very similiar to its predesesor.  It does feel a bit stream lined.  There are less things to build and research overall.  In fact, they basically combined stone and gold into a single resource, only leaving the player to have to gather and manage three resources (food, wood, gold).  Far from a bad thing, it seems like these changes stream line the game and speed up the play.  Other new additions like trading posts which establish trade routes place emphasis on controlling the map at all times and further keep the player active at all points in the game.

The really new:  RPG lite.  Affecting the gameplay, but technically outside it, AOE III has introduced a RPG-esque elements that allow you to level up your different civilizations and build ""decks"".  Technically cards, they are a series of upgrades you can pick off several techs tree (some unique to your civilization)  that can then be activated in the real game using experience gained in that game by fighting and kiling units.  It's not the most well implemented system, but it is novel and I had a great time looking through it, planning things out, and seeing how each civilization could specialize.

Overall,  its a decent game.  The graphics and UI are up to date.  There are some novel additions to the genre.  It isn't a must play.  But as cheap as it is, you may want to consider checking this out if you are a fan of real time strategy games.

Its a good RTS in its own right and brings something slightly different to the AOE series / RTS genre.

Dont look at my hours, I've only recently have bought AoE 3 on steam, my 3 boxed copies speak for themself.

Campaign is amazing, AoE 3 and its first expansion ""The War Chiefs"" tells the story of a Black Familly and their fight agains Circle of Ossus, mysterious order looking for Power in a new world. And Assian Dynasties tells 3 diffrent yet very interesting stories set in Japan, China and India. 
For those that finished Campaigns there are skirmishes on plethora of maps and possibility of leveling your chosen nation capital... and for brave enought, there is multiplayer :D

But let's skip details and be honest.
Age of Empires 2 had way better gameplay, most AoE fans aggre with that, when it comes to multiplayer, AoE 2 is way better, as it's MP scene is still alive and healthy while AoE3 faces many ESO connection problems, and lack of players. So if you want an RTS with healthy MP, go get AoE2!

Graphics are amazing! while I can't wait for definitive edition of AoE3 I still to this day enjoy this gem from the past.

And then there is my favourite part of this game... Map Editor! Age of Empires series always had easy to use hard to master map editors, 3rd one is no diffrent. The possibilities of this bad boy are almost endles :D Throughout the years I played many custom maps made by the community, from Colloseum where players have to defend against waves of enemies to survive, to custom RPG maps with own story and quests. Don't belive me? Shameles plug here, but just look for me on YT to see for Yourself some A class Eye Candy that can be made with this game.

So yeah, while AoE2 is better gameplay wise, give AoE3 a chance, story is good, graphics are good, soundtrack is just Epic, and for me personally its time period... the colonial era, makes this game one of my favourite game in existence... easily top 3 :D",1528168843,1528169005,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198028209852,153,3,9988,0,6108,1595734632

Before buying Complete Collection on SDteam, I've played only original storyline of AOE III, which I loved with my whole heart. This one will always be my favourite from all of them, but I was quite impressed with The Asian Dynasty as well - especially India. I liked the fact you can't kill some animals because it's against their religion and you pray for other animals, it's really an interesting concept, a little detail I adore.

 Have been a fan since the start of the age of empire franchise and loved all the games. This verison offers imporved graffics, faster paced games compared to the AOE and AOE II. 

 One of the best aspects of AOE III is the introduction of alliancing with native tribes. The native tribes give bonus and offer strategic points in certain maps. I also enjoy the more 3d aspects and the smoother animations comapred to the older versions although the 3d is limited.

83,41562908,english,"People might say AOE 3 is not a worthy successor of AOE 2....

....thats definately untrue. It truly isnt AoE 2 with improved graphics people hoped for in 2005, but its the better online game!
In one word - its comfortable! 
Somce features from AoE 2 were removed in order to make the gameplay WAY faster, so you dont need to waste hours playing one game only. Instead, most games online run from 10 - 20 minutes, so you can have several ""Rounds"" of pure economy AND war. Its great for people with not so much time at hand, still wanting RTS games.
But you can have really long games as well if you chose Treaty mode offering up to 40 minutes of no attacking each other.

The graphics were really ahead of its time, still looks excellent and highly detailed, the game physics are amazing when canons blast away units or lancers stab the cavalary to their doom.

Also the Home City System is genius! You get different cards over time to build you own individual (or several) decks, which will help you during your game. Eventually you have more cards than you can build a deck with, so chosing them wisely or in good order makes the gameplay unique for you and other players aswell.

Why do AoE 2 lovers then hate this game? Because they mainly play single player and the single player campaign of AOE 3 is completly boring and doesnt follow historic events. But to be honest, THIS GAME IS MEANT TO BE PLAYED ONLINE or MULTIPLAYER , and thats where AoE 3 is the clear winner - its a lot more fun!

After opening the .cfg file, search (there is a search function in notepad) for the word ""zoom"". You will find at least 6 entries for the word ""zoom"". Change Both Normal and Max Zoom to a higher number, I use 70, which I rarely zoom to this new maximum value.

The campaign is mediocre compared to the other series in my opinion. But where the game shines is its multiplayer.

86,38634385,english,"Age of Empires 3 tries some new ideas to break the monotony of RTS classics.  I have not played any multiplayer, but have beaten the single player campaign of the original and expansions.  The story of the original is a good time, but the expansions aren't as interesting.  Play styles vary considerably between chosen ""faction"", especially in Asian Dynasties.  


Positives

+Playing different ""factions"" provides a unique experience, especially across expansions.  Your play style has to adapt to new mechanics introduced by expansions.  Adds replayability and keeps the campaign fresh.

+Despite being quite different from AOE 2, has the completeness you'd expect from this franchise.  Game looks and sounds great while feeling complete.

+Less micromanaging your villagers.  Farms/plantations (gold) and even some ""wood farms"" allow you to set and forget villagers instead of having to worry about running out of mines/reseeding farms.  There are trade-offs for these ""lazy"" sources of resoures, but It's nice late game to not have to worry about it.

+Ships look cool.  Zoom in on em', they look impressive.

+Enjoyable difficulty curve.  I played most of this game on hard (I switched somewhere early in the original game) and it was challenging, but doable.  The cards helped.  You could make it harder by not using certain cards.  


On the fence....

-/+Card system...this is the main difference been AOE III and other RTS games.  You have a 20-card deck that provides ""shipments"", which can be anything from a couple of villagers to a trickle of wood resources to an upgrade or unit not available otherwise.  It adds another layer of strategy and I didn't mind it too much on singe player, but not sure how it goes on multiplayer.  You definitely have to use it, or at least I did when I played on Hard difficulty. 


Negatives

-Story isn't super gripping.  Most RTS games I've played, story is pretty weak, so maybe I'm picky.  The original AOE III campaign is enjoyable, I will say that. The acts tie together well.  It's not that the missions aren't fun or varied, just that the presentation is poor.  Characters don't really grow on you, and historical significance is only learned from reading (for the most part).  I understand why the expansions don't tie together and I'm ok with that, but yeah...not memorable.

Soldiers can shoot through walls and building. You can see it in 2nd or 3rd campaign mission when yanissars attack you and you're inside some castle. This looks ultra stupid when a cannon shoots trough the wall, especially when you clearly see how the bullet flies.

I'll try multiplayer soon, but anyway, I expected much better experience.

I was $10 short and my mom reluctantly bought the game for me after much convincing on my part. I booted it up and started to play around with the different civilizations/empires in the game. This game is the reason why I got into studying history. Certain upgrades or names in the game were inspired or referenced by events in history. As I began to see the connections between the game and parts of real life, I loved and appreciated the game even more. Don't let the low hours fool you, I've bought this game twice and have suck a good portion of my time into this game.

What you get when you buy Age of Empires 3

- A vibrant look at the 17th and 18th centuries
- A beautifully looking game (even after 12 years)
- A wonderful soundtrack/atmosphere
- Immersion into a world that no longer exists
- A great RTS/Base-Building game
- A game that still has multiplayer servers up on the Internet
- Age of empires (what more do I need to say?)

This game is even better when you have someone to play with or against. On occasion, the online service will run into problems and people may not be able to join your game and/or you won't be able to join theirs. I have only recently started to notice this problem (10/31/15) so I am not sure how common it will become. It usually just takes a bit of time to fix itself though.

As mentioned before, it's real-time strategy. You get to pick the Civilization that you like the most. These include the Germans, Spanish, British, Asian civs,  Native American civs, and a lot more. Each have their own strategies. In the game, you are pitted against another Civ(s), whether it be an AI or an actual player. Your civilization's economy relies on 3 things: food, wood, and coin. Your villagers, or workers, must work to gather these resources and build your colony. You can use the resources to create buildings, buy improvements, and train an army.

Eventually, you'll need an army. There are infantry, calvalry, and artillery units. You can also have naval battles with various ships if there is a body of water on the map. As mentioned before, there are numerous strategies for victory. I'd recommend trying out all the Civilizations and see which one you feel most comfortable with.

Overall, this game is godly. It will stand the test of time, and I hope that the online service will remain available for years to come (after all, it still has a sizable community).

This is the RTS formula perfected. Not overly simple like Starcraft or Halo Wars, AOE III makes you manage your Economy and your Military, quite like the real world. And the UI and gameplay tweaks from AOE II have now made micromanagement a thing of joy rather than frustation.

In short, you take a certain empire and play as it. You train soldiers and settlers and you can blow up your enemies
or, if you prefer a more peaceful approach, you can establish a tycoon on all those trading posts you built earlier.
In the end, when the dust settles, you gain experiance to level up your ""home city"", the hub of whatever empire you
selected. You can get more home city cards, which when you get enough exp. in game you can send for to get some freebies, and you can customize the buildings and/or who goes about your city. If you get enough levels, you can even
have your citizens talk in little speech bubbles when viewing your home city. Now I'll get to the more simple way of reviewing this game:

Pros
-Graphics are impressive.
-Home city customization is great.
-It's fun to play as each and every empire, which all have their own unique perks.
-The diversity of upgrades and units is awesome.
-Blowing up enemy building with mortars has never been more fun or entertaining,
-The campaigns are really fun to play.

Cons
-AoE II gets new expansions, even though it's really really old, but this one hasn't had one for a
long time.

This game is awesome. If it's on sale, have no hesitation to buy it.",1457899982,1511438852,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198119606229,62,5,8562,0,8253,1590145837

Age of Empires III focusses on the colonial and Imperial era (1492-1870). the base game is centered around the exploration and colonisation of America by European states. The expansions (all included in this complete edition) focus on the native Americans (Aztecs, Souix and Iruquois) and on the asian great powers (China, Japan and India).

Many people say that Age of Empires II was the best of the series, i think Age of Empires III is the best. Reasons for this:

- Ability to have an unlimited amount of gold and food allows you to infinitaly recrute your best units which makes multiplayer matches more interesting (compaired to Age II's lack of ways to have infinite wood, stone and gold, which forces you to use wood based terrible quiality units if you want to be able to spamm units for a long time)

- More intersting Civs: Yes there are fewer civs than in age II (Age III has: English, French, Dutch, Germans, Ottomans, Spanish, Portugese, Russians, Souix, Iroquois, Aztec, Indian, Chinese and Japanese) but the civs in Age III are far more unique than in Age II. For example: the English has the Unique Longbowman unit, the most upgrades for musketeers, rocket production and the ability to get a free setler from every house. The Dutch on the other hand have Banks that generate coin for free(no other civ. has banks), but a setler limmit of 50 (normal is 99), and the unique cavalry unit called Ruyter, which is the only cavalry unit in the game that only costs 1 pop limmit. This together with the low setler limmit allows the dutch to have a larger army (150 men) in the field than other civs (100 men).

- A story mode campaign with videomaterial of the game to simulate the story, in stead of the written stories of Age II. The campaign is much easier on normal difficulty than the campaigns of Age II on their lowest difficulty, but still challenging on hard difficulty


Now to be fair there are some negatives:
- The AI is much less smart and fast than in age II (in Age II i get destroyed by medium AI, in Age III i win against Expert AI half of the time)
- The graphics of Age III are actually worse than those of Age II
- Age II got remasted and now has mod support in the steam workshop, Age III hasn't
- Age III has a lot less maps than Age II, and Age II's maps seem to be better balanced than those in Age III

Over all it's still a good game, that is completely worth it to buy it (although it is of course advised to wait till a steam sale and than just buy the whole Age of Empires bundle)",1510753965,1510753965,True,2,0,0.541984736919403076,0,True,False,False,76561198090407986,84,9,22048,0,15488,1599342454

10,36347716,english,"In response to the many negative reviews this game has gotten recently (Click ""Read more"" for my own review):
This game needs compatibility mode when running on Windows 10 (I'm using WinXP SP3, but Win7 should work as well), and an ESO (Ensemble Studios Online) account can only be created from within the base game (no DLCs). ESO can be played fine on the DLCs, it's just that the account needs to be created from inside the base game.
Note that in the box that comes up when starting the game, selecting ""Age of Empires III: The Complete Collection"" will actually run the game WITHOUT DLCs. To play the DLCs, you need to select one of the other options. (The Asian Dynasties has all of the content of The Warchiefs in it)

My actual review:
+ Gameplay (Perhaps Age of Empires 2 was better in this regard, but this game still has great gameplay IMO)
+ Graphics (at least when fully zoomed out)
+ Destruction physics and ragdoll physics
+ Okay AI, with a wide range of skill level settings.

+/- graphics style (matter of opinion, look at the trailer and images to decide if you like it)
+/- somewhat long waiting time to start a match (usually 5-10 minutes for a 20-50 minutes long match), but not as bad as you'd expect for a game that was originally released in 2005 (retail version)

- AI cheats on higher difficulty levels.
- Online mode has a lot of unkind people, as there is no report system.
- Arrow keys bound to camera controls by default. This can be changed, but doing so takes a while.
- No way of rejoining left matches (if the game crashes, or if your internet goes out for more than one minute, then you're out of the match, and there's no way at all to rejoin it.)
- Ships are kind of weird (they're big and tend to clip into eachother)
- The AI handles ships very badly.
- Technical difficulties listed up above (Win10 issues, ESO account creation issues, and confusingly named options to run the game.)",1510075335,1510076568,True,40,2,0.782104015350341797,4,True,False,False,76561198048375117,107,8,17479,0,12737,1569099163

However, approaching this game later, and on a better system, I soon realised I was unfairly harsh on AOE3.
Firstly, it looks glorious. Sure, maybe not for todays standard of graphics, but even in 2017 the game is good looking and the worlds and campaigns seem enchanting and all differ from the other quite markedly. 
Second. The core of AOE is there, resource gathering, exploration, base building and military and unit management. With a few new features, that initially I felt a little gamey coming from AOE2, however, these features, such as having a home base which offers bonuses or allows for certain strategies all enhance the game and enable each civilisation to be noticeably different from the others.

For multiplayer I still stick to AOE2 and will look to give AOE impending new edition a try. However, for singeplayer, I gotta say, I believe AOE3 surpasses AOE2 and if that is what you're looking for, this game, with all the DLC added, offers plenty of enticing and appealing single-player gameplay.",1507636802,1507636867,True,1,0,0.49773755669593811,0,True,False,False,76561198097923141,260,12,927,0,741,1453499393

The big draw here is that you level up between games, which lets you unlock new and more powerful bonuses, which you can activate by doing things such as creating units or controlling train routes.

One huge plus for this game is that the countries play very, very differently. In the first two Age of Empires games, the civilizations were basically the same plus or minus a technology and one unit. Here, the difference is huge. Russians create units in ""batches"", the Dutch rely on gold instead of food and can build banks to create a flow of passive income. Those are just some examples - each civilization plays very differently and all of them are interesting. Except for Spain, but you can't win 'em all.

It's one of my favorite.

The Complete Collection offers you the 'Asian Dynasties' and 'War Chiefs' (can count as expansions).

Asian Dynasties is for people who like to play civilizations like China, India and Japan, let's say Asia Civ's and they offer you a more complexed gameplay but it's always fun!

War Chiefs is for people who like Tribes such as Aztecs, Sioux and Iroquois, it remotes to the time of the Colonization, it's so good to play yet it's complexed as well.

It offers as well some Civ's well known such as mine (Portuguese), British, Russia, Turky, ...

With this supreme PC spec, it's just unforgiven for the game to have such slow response. It's even worse than the Empire Earth series released a decade ago.

Moreover, the game pace is also very slow and not challenging. And to make it worse, the group selection is not working as it is supposed to.

67,34427584,english,"Age of Empires IV is coming out and after the disappointment of Dawn of War III I feel it's important for me to get my thoughts out in time for Relic to change their formula before destroying this franchise too.

[b]Age of Empires III[/b]
This game was a gem if you started with it like I did. I prefer it to AoE II, but had I started with AoE II my preference would probably be different. The general consensus seems to be that AoE II felt more dynamic. The maps were larger allowing different tactics such as flanks and the battles needed more micromanagment which could make a difference between victory and defeat even when you were outnumbered. AoE III automated a lot of the game and made it simpler for new people to manage armies, economies and upgrades. This could have been seen as a good thing had they increased the population cap and let you do more complicated war tactics, however it instead streamlined the game mostly into rushing in the second age. All of that said I have spent over 300 hours in this game before I bought it on steam and continued playing it here. The enjoyable part of this game that most of the AoE II players feel like they lost out on was the feeling that they created an empire and went to war with competing empires. They don't feel like a little skirmish, they feel like all-out war (AoE II moreso than AoE III) and that's what brings me back to this game. As soon as you join a league or go online people will rush and that removes most of the fun of building and maintaining your empire in the midst of a war you are intent on winning.


[b]Age of Empires IV[/b]
Relic is making Age of Empires IV, which I would be excited about 10 years or so ago. Dawn of War was amazing and Company of Heroes was pretty good too. DoW II and CoH II however were not quite as enjoyable and DoW III (which promised a return to basebuilding) was unfortunately more disappointing than both of them. I am nervous about AoE IV so I am writing this as a list about what you have done well and what you could improve on for AoE IV hopefully people agree:

[list]
[*]Make the battles massive without focussing on special units that turn battles, it takes strategy not gods to win wars

[*]The morale system from DoW works well in that universe, but it should be tweaked to account for hunger and weariness while marching or fortifying a location far from home without making them miss every shot and doing zero damage

[*][u]Emphasize base building[/u]. This is the feature that people want most. If things go badly (or really well) let me make a new town centre on an island. I want to have outposts where I can train men in for sustained fighting if I need to hold land in a specific area. CoH lacked the ability to build any meaningful forward bases and made holding land difficult. It should be on the attacker to displace the enemy fortifications.

[*]Get rid of the pre-game choices like CoH commanders. When the game starts it should be somewhat even, I don't want to feel like I have lost if they select Tank, while I select Infantry. The AoE III homecities were done nicely because the players who have spent more time can have better cards in their decks, but it is not game changing (besides the rushing cards). It is also nice to have all your options open so you can combat your opponent without having to close off other options you could use later on in the game.

[*]Longer games feel more satisfying. You can launch attacks if someone's score is higher than you to try and keep them down, or hustle your economy, but making it immidate combat that could determine the game is the most frustrating thing I have had to deal with online with AoE III. I don't mind losing if it feels like I did all I could, but if I was just caught with my pants down I leave unsatisfied.
[/list]

Overall Relic has made a lot of games that I have enjoyed countless hours in, but the older stuff has always been what I go back to.

Review: 6/10
For a top down {RTS} I must say this one is a love hate game.
For the love, countless hours can be spent in it. From the beautiful graphics. 
It runs smooth, and the sync with other player is on point and lagging out of the session is few to rare.
The amount of civilations that you can choose for is great, and you can level you faverits up to get better perks.
The perk system is nice because with level you unlock more perks that can really give you the edge in the game.
From starting with nothing and then perks, you can start with extra food build stuff cheaper and faster.
For the hate, you will call bull shit on a few things like canoes  owning a frigat frigate, or the other civs talking shit.
but other than that it is a good game with a high replay value.

1,33332096,english,"My earliest and most enduring experiences of gaming can be drawn back to the old 'Command and Conquer' and 'Age of Empires' days, where real-time strategy games were a dominant market that was seeing constant expansion and inovation. However as the years went on newer and fresher takes on strategy began to take influence and MOBAs or days-long grand strategy games took over.
Yet after over a decade of gaming I find myself coming back to my roots, and in particular the third and ""final"" installment of the core 'Age of Empires' franchise. Why? Well I'll tell you.
For many the original 'Age of Empires' is the epitome of antiquity, static and janky movements of soldiers, a low population cap and a small, unimpactful variety of Civs to play. Taking command of a unique civ means little to the gameplay, meerly a change of aesthetic and a neat way to warp events of history in your image.
'Age of Empires II' and its expansions are by a substantial margin the best heralded of the franchise, with changes to civs now supporting unique and more potent traits, unique units, tech trees, appearances and of course the dozens of languages spoken by your loyal subjects. Its true I still come back to 'Age of Empires II' for an honest and lengthy game of good-old-fashioned strategy, games lasting anywhere between 1 to 4 hours.
That brings me to this game, 'Age of Empires 3'. In my mind it is the best Age of Empires, that has adapted to the previous real-time strategy market with a plethora of units, buildings, cards and civ traits that change up the experience even more. Many my criticise the card system, wherein your chosen civ has a deck of cards you unlock at each age in-game, allowing you to improve your economic power, bring in fresh and rare units, unlock new technologies, or even start a revolution.
The variety and adaptability of gameplay is what draws me to this game, a sense of real immersion in my civilization as I level it with each victory, and watch the homecity grow to further my colonial conquests. Both expansions offer new stories for singleplayer and a handful more civs to play as, however I believe the Dynasties expansion to be the stronger effort.
Balance has never been a huge issue for me, however I would like to see a Workshop brought into effect for this game as it could use the love of its community to keep it alive.
I love this game, Spanish best civ.",1499399693,1499399693,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198077734919,239,3,18094,0,11498,1600767888

By the aid of the right deck settings, it is possible to turn the tide of the game when things are getting worse for yourself. For example, it is harder to finish your opponent with a rush since you have the ability to send a troop to counter the raiders. In addition, it is better not to be dependent to the amount of resources on the map solely. You can gain resources from many alternative ways (other than wood) without exploring the whole map. Also, each unit has its own pros and cons in AOE3. In  AOE2, training scores of cavalry would mean an unequivocal victory. Native tribes and their precious soldiers and technologies give an important advantage to superior explorers of the map. For example, you are British and possess the best foot archers in the game.

7,33301546,english,"PROS:
+Many nations to play as, each needs a different approach. Some nations are better for bursting, some excel at rushing.
+A huge number of awesome maps. Most of them are not only different visually, but also require different resorse management (for instanse, some maps have many bushes and very few huntable animals, while the situation is different with the other maps)
+Graphics are pleasant
+You can set the game speed before each skirmish. On fast speed, you need to be faster than your foe at all aspects. On slow speed however, you need to come up with superior strategy
+High replayability
+With higher difficulty, AI starts to play better instead of just getting abnormal boosts to everything
+The market. This building lets you sell your wood or food for gold and vice versa. What is fun however, it calculates of much of each unit there is in the game and gives you trade value of it. For example, if you spam the button 'sell 100 food for X gold', at some point worth of food would decrease to minimum.
CONS:
-Map Editor could've been better. Maybe it's just me, but I consider it ugly and uncomfortable
-The MP servers are empty, there's noone to play with.

19,32662882,english,"It is with great joy that I can say that this game does still function even so long after its initial release. My only complaint with this game after so many years is that the only way to get it to function properly is to undergo a process that most would never do on their own. 

On a Windows 10 operating system, it will likely not function upon launching any of the three versions, declaring that it 'failed to initialize'. To fix the error, you must navigate to your 'Apps & features' page, scroll to the bottom, click on 'Programs and Features' under the Related setting section, and in the resulting menu click on the 'Turn Windows features on or off' button next to the windows shield at the left part of the screen. In the NEXT screen, you must click the drop down menu for 'Legacy Components' and enable DirectPlay. You may need to restart your computer afterwards or take other measures such as running as an administrator or verifying your game cache to get this game to work. 

While it pains me that this solution is not properly displayed on the store page directly, there is a solution. Currently, only the efforts of the steam community can ensure that people realize that this solution exists, which is why I deleted a prior negative review. I did so because I ran into the problem and decided to create a negative review in the hopes that someone could diagnose a problem that I could not diagnose myself even after numerous attempts and rooting around steam for a while and missing the correct solution. 

I have nothing but praise for the game itself, as the campaign is really quite entertaining, and the 'new'(As this game is quite old) mechanics for the Hometown makes the game nearly infinitely replayable. I purchased this game during the Steam Sale for a very cheap price, but I would gladly pay the full price tag to enjoy this game. Also, play Asian dynasties as it includes all previous content, including the other dlc. I don't honestly know why you would choose to play the basic version unless you absolutely despised teh Asian/Warchief content, which can be safely ignored anyway if you are so inclined.

For those of you who might look at my recorded hours and scoff, I will inform you that I played this game for hundreds of hours from a CD, that being years ago.

Villagers don't transport good anymore which I think takes a little of realism out. Age of Mythology of course added this back in. Barracks can send waves of unit up to 5 out, which is nice if the base is under attack so the units don't get picked off one by one. Definitely a game worth checking out.

Pros: Interesting campaign, Favors exploration of the map.

Cons: UI and Screen resolution seems outdated.

And when it comes to the question ""do I recomend it?"" I'd have to say, I wouldn't really recommend it, no. But I have nothing much against it either. 

As a fan of Age of Empires II, this game just didn't deliver for me. They added some new features (compared to AoE II) like that villagers don't have to drop off their resources anywhere (like food at mills), and the hometown-consept. The hometown basically means you level up the civ you're playing, and it makes it so you only play one civ all the time so you get an advatage by having a high level hometown for that civ. The upgrades are also hard to locate, (and i still can't figure out where to upgrade walls to stone...) because the buildings aren't called the same for all civs, another factor making you play only one civ. I guess it's just that AoE II was so plain and easy, that all the details and extra stuff in AoE III really just confuse me. If I had spent more time on the game, I would have understood it better, and liked it better for sure. But since i already know Age of Emprires II, which, for me, was much easier to learn, I'll just play that. 

As for online, it is, let's say, challenging. And now I'm not taliking about beeing beaten up online, I'm talking about just even getting into an online lobby. I have managed (after much time spent on hosting) to play with friends, but I haven't tried playing with strangers. The stupid thing about the online function in AoE III is that you can't just play online through Steam. You need to create an Ensembe Studios Online account, which just makes it that much harder to play online.",1495364505,1495364889,False,1,0,0.401416420936584473,4,True,False,False,76561198135255883,26,5,1101,0,1101,1467632407

- simplified building & resource gathering

- lacks stuff that would make this game iconic like the first two

[b]Comment:[/b]
Do not be fooled by the hours played I have displayed here as I have played many many more. So to this date this is the last AoE games made. It has lots of new stuff and is very inovative from the first two...and yet...a bit boring compared to them. For some reason the developers simplified building stuff and gathering resources then they added home cards and reinforcements. At first it looked cool. But as you play it somehow distracts you, from the game, from the upgrades selectable in the buildings. It lost the AoE charm. By no means is this a bad game! But it falls short even with the great War Chiefs and Asian Dynasties expansion packs. I truly do recommend this as a RTS game because it is good, but it just lacks something to be really great...

Pros:
Funny cheats

Many unique units, with the right combinations of soldiers good to attack artilleries, artilleries good to attack buildings, ships, etc
Beautiful graphics
Map customization! Create your own and play against friends!! (or against npcs )
Funny cheats (monster truck, george washington)

Cons:
NPCs can be hard to deal with (single player) if you're new. They build so fast and are very aggressive to you
May be boring for people who like fast paced action game.

77,21908317,english,"Age of Empires 3 is a classic RTS that pits towns against each other in a race for resources and ultimately, military domination. The varied maps and civilizations allow many playstyles to be possible. On a desert map, trees may be scarce, creating a struggle to control the limited timber. Or, on a swamp map there may be very little land suitable for construction, leaving you to build several tiny bases instead of one fortress and leaves you vulnerable to attacks. An Ottoman empire can churn out villagers to gather resources quickly until they can build the civ's crown jewel, the great bombard, a massive artillery cannon. A Dutch empire can build banks that spawn gold, an important currency to build advanced units. Once you think you've played a few matches and think you've learned the best way to play a civ, you learn that you can bring a deck of ""cards"" in each match. These are free units or important upgrades that can be spawned throughout a game. Winning matches earns experience, which can be used to unlock new cards in a tech tree fashion, largely unique to each civ.  Some sivs might seem weaker at first, but unlock a bit of their tech tree and they become incredibly powerful. The graphics and physics engine were far ahead of their time and although noticably old, are not an eye sore on this brilliantly fun game. Age of Empires is at its best with friends, so I highly recommend convincing a couple pals to buy it with you. The single downside is that you cannot make more than two teams, so you can play 3v3, but not 2v2v2.

They’ve increased the number of general game options from AoM.

Artillery has a much bigger role – in previous game you didn’t really have devastating artillery

You no longer need drop points, a nice improvement to the eco side of things.

There are a good variety of maps, but you can’t preview them!

The AI is still maddeningly dumb – your troops will happily sit under missile fire and not fight back, they will let the enemy just waltz straight past them. If you accidently walk too far and reach enemy territory you troops will simply die. This can make combat frustrating as you have to babysit your troops continuously.

60,29895467,english,"I come from a long background with AOE1 and 2, so by comparison, this game was an overwhelming disappointment. The game is, for one, not easy to just pick up and learn. The traditional control scheme of gathering resources while building cities and armies is skewed, removing a large part of resources and troop-building altogether. Most of your income is transported from the 'homeland' to you over the course of a match, which makes sense from a colonial standpoint, but makes games painfully slow, leaves you feeling significantly less in-control of your empire, and narrows down the game into 2-3 playstyles regardless of your civilization choice. And while the game's visuals are nice, the scaling up of buildings and units alongside the 3D view leaves the maps feeling much smaller and minimizes the emphasis on careful exploration that was a landmark of previous games.

AOE3 is, essentially, not reminiscient of its predecessors in any way, and can hardly be called a continuation/conclusion of the franchise: The fact that AOE2 is STILL getting support and new, regular DLCs today while this game is largely left in the dust, speaks to how few gamers made the transition.",1486978988,1486978988,False,0,0,0.445493757724761963,0,True,False,False,76561198053716831,292,63,202,0,202,1385092915

76,29777660,english,"After the critically-acclaimed Age of Empires 2 was released and the expansion of Conquerors was extremely well received, Age of Empires III was bound to happen. And it did in 2009. Moving away from the Conquistador era, AoE III takes places around the 1700's when Settlers began to populate the American continent. 
For starters, the graphics changed from the sprites used in AoE II to a tridimensionally rendered objects in AoE III and that made it extremely unpopular for some, as the hardware necessities the software needed were not average. But all in all, the graphical performance of AoE III was extremely well done and on par with other RTS games of the era. Unfortunately, the RTS gaming era was about to end, with AoE III marking a significant decrease in interest the gamers had in this type of games. 
What was it? One wonders. The gameplay was extremely similar, and yet the charm AoE II had was somehow missing. The AI was not extremely hard and the games had all kinds of countries to be chosen from. 
The expansions made AoE III a bit better, with the return of ancient civilizations being an option just like in the Conquerors expansion. Unfortunately this made a small impact to the decreasing interest in this RTS. 
However, it still is a fun game to play. In 2017 it is a game that doesn't require extreme processing power and it is graphically pretty. 
The investment is well done nowadays. 
If you feel a little nostalgic and want to play one of the last RTS games of the era,

Buy it, play it and don't regret it.

[h1]Overall[/h1]
I played this game a ton in my childhood and I enjoyed it greatly back then and still do now.

[h1]Campaign[/h1]
The Campaign is quite nice and I really like how there are multiple ones and continuations of the stories.

[h1]Multiplayer[/h1]
The population has dwindled down over the years but it is alive and if you have any friends who play the game, it's way more fun. There are plenty of custom games/modes you can download if you get bored of playing against others and/or bots.

[h1]Inside the Game[/h1]
There are a ton of things to do within the game but if you ever get bored, there are many mods that expand the game further. I personally use Napoleonic Era but there are tons of other mods and stuff.

I cant bring myself to like the graphics in AoE II but i really do like AoM. 
Now for the review iself: 

Graphics: Nicely Detailed Envinronment with an (G)UI that is appealing and very straightfoward so you rarely get confused in the menus. 

Sound: Really nicelly recorded voice acting with very clear sound quality and excelent sound effects.... Although they sometimes seem a little bit too bland. 

Gameplay: You got a Map, Quick actions on a few buttons on the right of it and Basic information about your units such as: Unit count, unit health, attack, armor and relevant stuff. To the right of it a simple grid of commands to give to your units with very self explanatory action. Buildings can build more than one unit at a time allowing for up to five units to be deployed at the same time. It takes the same amount of time to deploy 1 unit and 5 units. 

Story: The game follows the story of a family known as the Black family. In which the first of them is a man Named Morgan Black. The story revolves around this particular family. This family also has relevancy in The WarChiefs. Although more to the side. ANd little relevancy in Asian Dinasties. Needless to say the story is very well structurally built with a fluent and smooth continuum without any drastic changes except between Acts 1,2 and 3. 

Difficulty: The game gets progressivelly harder as you progress further in the story. The same can be said in multiplayer except in multiplayer there is a point where the difficulty will stall as the game seems like its going nowhere.
The final missions of each act are Significantly Harder than any other missions in each act. 

GFX: I already talked about graphics but now is for a less apparent thing. The effects used are detailed to a certain degree and really gives that extra punch to make them even more immersive. 

Variety: The whole game speaks variety. All countries have thier own unique characteristic. For instance, the Dutch can build banks which produce coin/gold constantly, albeit a little bit slower than mines, but never run out. The French have a better kind of villager (Called settler in the game) that is called ""Coureur des bois"" it gathers resources considerably faster, but cost more and take longer to train/build. 

Total: Overall, this game is a masterpeice for sure. But you probably wont want to play it if you dont have enough time. Because this game gets very long sometimes.",1486146211,1486146211,True,11,0,0.614029765129089355,0,True,False,False,76561198105374098,171,9,4432,0,4170,1478056852

35,29308003,english,"First of all there are a few things you need to know about this game if you're purchasing it:

It is a fantastic game in my opinion, but if you're coming here from AoE2 HD thinking it's the same game, you're quickly going to realize it's not. It is very similar, but the gameplay is slightly more basic, and a lot of upgrades and stuff are moved to different buildings which can be quite confusing.


PROS:

The graphics are absolutely stunning compared to AoE2 HD, and you don't even need a decent computer to run the intense graphics which is great if you're on a laptop

Camera rotation is a really cool feature that was included, although you'll have to enable it in settings as it is off automatically

Everythings moves in a lot more of a real time, if you know what i mean. None of the animations are jittery and it runs really smoothly

There are some absolutely incredible mods for this game which improve certain aspects of the gameplay, and i highly recommend you check them out

There are many, many, many other great things in this game, but i'm not going to go through them all as that would take all year


CONS:

A lot less features like upgrades, buildings, units etc.

Certain upgrades can be found in the weirdest places, for instance upgrades for wood cutting and gold mining can be found in the market for some reason. Please don't ask me why cause I don't know

This one most likely isn't a con for most people, but I take issue with it. There are no lumber camps or mining camps or even stone for that matter. This might seem good as it takes away certain annoying things like having to build a lumber camp everytime the trees get cut down near it, but it take a lot of the realism away for me. Other people probably won't find issue with it though, so don't mind this one

Homecities to me are bad news. You'll see what I mean

No steam workshop

The steam overlay doesn't work for me on this game, i'm not sure if it's for everyone but it definately happens to me.

A number of other issues that you'll find for yourself if you decide to get it

CONCLUSION:

I DO reccomend this game, despite it's list of issues, as it is well worth it. Even if AoE2 HD is the better game, this game's graphics make it still very immersive and enjoyable, and well worth wasting your life playing it.

BUY IT NOW OR I TAKE ALL YOUR TF2 COSMETICS

50,29195457,english,"I wanted to like this game. However, Age of Empires® III: Complete Collection is a game that simply doesn't meet what I remember as a child and the awesome gameplay that I used to have to load from a disc (and still do own). As nice as the visuals in this game are, the gameplay simply is sub-par and I was bored very quickly into it, unlike the fast-paced action of the original game. In addition, Decks feel like a clunky and unnecessary addition to the game. The benefits they provide are not neglectible, so you can't enjoy the game as is; you have to play with decks in order to not be left behind, which is something I find unnecessary and tedious as an old player of the game.

This game is not worth it. Simply put, Age of Empires II is a better game, and for good reason. It is the same price as this one. Once I get the money, I will be purchasing AoE II: HD Edition with all of its DLCs, which is ultimately the same price as this. So go buy AoE II: HD Edition, not this game. Unless you really like the deck building, or a slightly more relaxed gameplay, this version is not for you.

52,29186097,english,"AoE 3 is the third installment in the series, offers an intriguing main single player story as various characters search for the fountain of youth. The single player skirmishes, custom made games, and multiplayer is the bread and butter of the game. In single player skirmishes, enemies are further apart, giving your base time to upgrade and build your army to your specifications before attacking enemy camps. You receive experience points when in battle, building, working, etc. Combat is much better than in AoE2, but unless you are playing on harder difficulties, the AI isn't as good as in AoE2.  This time around you  get wars dogs as well as cannons, and other weapons. You can build decks of cards for the shipments to your colony, forge alliances with natives or other allies to take over the new world.  There are a few things in the game that is annoying. 1. You can't put your soldiers in patrolling mode, you have to manually put them where you want them to be. 2. The npcs are dumber than a bag of rocks. Workers will just stand there while being attack instead of fighting back, soldiers will ignore enemies attack them while they are attacking buildings. 3.They have taken out most of the different matches from AoE2 like King of the Hill, Capture the Relic, Wonder Race, Deathmatch (where you start with supplies), and other matches that made AoE2 great making this game a dumb down version of AoE2.

60,29160696,english,"This game didn't recieve great reviews (mainly due to removing several features players loved from AOEII), but in spite of some things I miss, overall I consider this to be the best of the Age of Empires Franchise. Just make sure you pretty much ALWAYS launch the Asian Dynasties DLC to get all content and improvements (such as the ability to use all maps/factions and the ability to view unit/building health by holding ALT). It's the best looking of the franchise, and features a really nice new system where you can build 'hands' of shipments to send in from your Home City (you're colonising, so you can call in reinforcements!). 

This system adds in a new level of progression on top of that which already exists in strategy games, greatly increasing replayability and gives you a range of ways to play. This Complete Collection features a massive amount of maps, as well as a custom map creator and decent randomisation of attributes. All in all there are 8 Vanilla Factions (British, Spanish, German, Ottoman, Russian, French, Portugeuse and Dutch) Plus 6 Expansion Pack Factions (Sioux, Aztec, Iroquois and Japan, China, India) totally for a respectable 14 factions total, each plays differently and encourages a variety of unique tactics. 

Migrating from AOEII you will notice the lack of the diplomacy feature, instead just relying on FFA or a Two Team system to work (you can still request/send resources to each other, as well as help each other out with TEAM Cards or sharing certain buildings). Whilst I do miss these two features, AOEIII adds enough content to keep you contentwithout it, and there is a joy in fighting through Skirmish maps on different sizes and with different factions, as well as levelling up and unlocking more powerful cards for use in your next battle. 

All in all AOEIII is a great game, a must for RTS fans, and my overall favourite of the franchise. It's also pretty easy to mod the SXML files to fix up some of the odd balancing (Culverins and Ranged Calvary being U.P.) which also can be fun.",1484050495,1484050495,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198045839650,96,11,3436,0,1182,1523965637

Also, another great element of a strategy game is diversity of factions, buildings and units, and here again, AOE III comes out on top.

Variety of playstyles and maps, as well as civilization strategies
Scenario editor and custom maps widely available

Flaws:
Some persistent bugs (not game destroying or hindering, but still irritating like a sound bug here and there)
Balance issues in multplayer, some civs are just de facto stronger than others (although this isn't as significant for newer/less skilled players)

Would definitely recommend, the game has aged well and is definitely still kicking around!

-No formations like in AOE2, not talking about tactics, actual formations.
-Poor pathfinding, units get stuck and slowed down very often.
-Clunky, busy UI. Hotkey banners get clicked on accidentally often. Too much space wasted at top, everything crammed at bottom.
-Unbalanced units makes games often end up as a rock paper scissors with civilizations. Artillery is extremely OP and easy to win with, even against their counters.
-Not very many civilizations.
-Campaign plays completely differently than multi. It's also campy and the missions jump from too easy to too difficult.
-Card system breaks games.

Also ran the usual verification process and it always reports one file failed to verify but never seems to resolve this.  Steam support pages indicate this message may be normal...

And don't worry if you're being attacking, just quickly spam those Musketeers while you're being attacked, or kiss your town goodbye if you cant defend or spam the musketeers. (It's good to have a defensive army full of cannons, and anti-siege)

Revolting in the Industrial era is another neat thing you can do in the Warchiefs and Asian Dynasties expansion (which are bundled in this product) as it allows you to become a new nation, like America, but there are drawbacks.

Oh, did I mention you can launch a space program with a Cannon and a Settler?

This game has aged pretty well, and is still in playable quality for anyone buying this in 2016/2017. Just know that the models aren't the best looking things on the block, but let the physics and lighting portion of the engine paint over that little flaw. But in all honesty, the models look fine when you're zoomed out like you usually should be.

Paying full-price for this game is worth it, on sale it's even better.

The AI in the game actually remembers you, and they poke at you at the beginning of every match. (So it feels like you're legitimately fighting Napoleon.)

A Veteran AOEII/AOE2 fan would probably be kinda iffy about this installment in the series, but hey, it's worth it.

56,28723275,english,"One of my all time favourites. Great strategy game. The campaign is nice, but the skirmish matches are the best. The bots AI is a bit too op on Expert mode (they always know where you are). There were multiple games where I had to ""migrate"" my settlers to my friends base, or just spent the whole game hiding from the bots (which, again, always find us). 
Here's a small list of weird funny matches I played on, mainly when I was just starting out and was a noob: 
- Against a french player, he made a square with his horses and placed one horse of a different type in the middle of the square. The square was incredible fast and basically destroyed all my buildings in under a minute
- There was this one guy who made like 50 cannons (no other units) and they would simply destroy everything that I threw at them. After destroying my buildings he spent 10 minutes chasing my last settlers with his army of cannons.
- On this one game after I was defeated my friend hid his explorer on a treasure, in a way that it wouldn't be visible from above. After getting to imperial and researching spies to see the whole map, they spent 15 min looking for him until his explorer attacked a settler passing nearby.
It's a shame ESO online is terrible. The system is so old I can't even join a single game. This game would become so much better if there was a steam based multiplayer mode. As it is, I have to use gameranger to be able to play with my friends.
Also worth mentioning, if you lose your password for ESO Online good luck retrieving it.

I played this game a ton when I had it on disk back in 2006, and still play it do to its great replayability
The game is set in the colonial period, and boy does it make a good job of it, all the troops have their distinct languages when playing different nations (which there are a lot), even the mercenaries and natives have them, it really helps with the immersion. 
The home city deck mechanic is a cool way to use exp besides leveling up, it allows you to get a big amount of troops early on if you want to rush, or economic improvements to enhance your settlers or villagers and become and economic power house, pumping mosket man to no end. The amount of ways you can play the game is outstanding.
Age of empires also includes a single player campaign which is nice, my favorite campaigns are the ones from the Asian dynasties. 
the only thing negative I can think of is that some of the improvments are locked at certain levels, hoever avraging 2 levels per match more or less, your bound to reach level 40 in about 15 or so matches (you start at level 10 in the asian dynasties)
Still I really recommend this game, especially when it costs 8.00 dollars when it’s on sale.

Ps: remeber to start with asian dynasties by right clicking the age of empiers game in your steam library. if you click the others you are going to miss content you bought.

Very fun, can be casual or challenging, but a bit pricey so I recommend getting it on sale. Visuals are not breathtaking as the game is quite old, but they are not bad. You can build and train everything from infantry to cannons to massive war ships. It is not hard to get the hang of, and becomes very fun once you start attacking other players. One of the best RTS games I've ever played.

Oh, one more thing: In AOE2 you had more options to configure, as the limiting amount of population, for example. And de largest map it's not soo large as the large map from AOE2.

Limited, level-based, and less challenging than AoE2, it's not easy to fairly compare the two games. It feels like the AoE3 developers never really played AoE2 much, but were fond of playing the Warcraft series and based it off of that. 

In every game you get an ""Explorer"" which isn't much more than a glorified villager that never permanently dies. Your choices for game setup are 1-vs-1 team or a free-for-all. There are no in-game alliances, all your units and buildings are limited in number, and your max pop is about 200. Oh, and your home city can only earn 30,000 xp each game.

Despite these limitations, resources (Wood, Food, Gold; stone is nonexistant) couldn't be easier to gather. Buildings such as Farms, Rice Paddies, etc. offer unlimited free resources after building for one low cost.

The goal of this game is to level up your home city and earn ""cards"", shipments you recieve at no cost from your home city. You try each civilization out, level them up, and if you don't have a fiance, friends, or a family member to play with, you never play this again for a very long time.

If you like Age of Empires II, DON'T buy this game unless it's dirt cheap. You will try it, play it, tire of it, and return to Age of Empires II.

This game also has great multiplayer which encourages teamwork and communication through in game chat. This is everything I could ever ask for in an RTS. 

The only down side is the game has now been out for numerous years and the online community is thin so at times games can be hard to fine. There are times throughout the day that the community is active but it isn't always so. Just keep that in mind.

4. Many Kingdom you can choose to play, each has it own strategy, my favourite kingdom was Japan! The sakura and samurai !

Cons:
1. Less storyline and maps, but you can download them outside steam!
2. Less language preference
3. No more update

Summary:
Very nice and details strategy games, hope there are more update and new series of this game coming soon! highly recommended.

Granted, my inclinations toward story tended to drive me to mash ""To Smithereens"" over and over again so I could see what happened next, but I did gain a new appreciation for the strategical elements over time. 

Some units, when coupled with certain home shipment cards, do indeed break the game if you play against opponents who know the exploits. I enjoy the benefits and weaknesses of each empire, the upgraded resource gathering where one does not have to build a resource dropoff station, and the fact you can que up a series of units in a single unit-production building. 

The main story of the vanilla edition does tend toward the fantastic, which isn't bad, but I do appreciate the more historical, fact-based scenarios and campaigns of the first and second games. I do miss the Wololo and Rogan, but they do tribute these sounds in the pre-programmed multiplayer taunts. The soundtrack isn't bad; could have used a little more variety.

This game try to change the dynamic from the second, however the cards system and XP is just annoying.  I tried to like this game, but after the second mission of the second act II had enough.  Could be that the multiplayer have another history, but frankly I doubt. 

The GUI has many weak point in comparison to the previous game, one minor thing that I particularly hate was the fact that the saved games don’t sort by date or the fact you can’t delete them from the game. You need to go to options for disabling or enabling statistics data from other players. 

The campaign difficult and setting in hard is badly handled. It is supposed to be an A.I. without no handicap and no special extra resources. However, the amount of resources that the A.I. is able to gather are ridiculous. I had to enable the truck cheat only to damage the enemy infrastructure and kill all the villagers and still is able to respawn a great number of its army without any problem. In the time you need for getting a small number of everything, the A.I. already  has a full platoon (and when you killed them  the AI will be in half process of creating a new platoon with equal numbers), in the early missions the machine has access to better technologies than you.

The uniqueness of the races…. Is not that unique, you get more from the cards, and probably you can attach to two units in the game, plus artillery. 

The card concept is odd. Maybe part of my problem is because I don’t understand very well how that thing is handled, is part of the XP you get in the game (As a certain amount will give you a “Slot”.

Secondly, It is also the worst. Allow me to explain.

From a new player's standpoint, the game is interactive, it has a sense of immersion unlike most games of its genre. It is a fantastic world, in which (With the aid of cheat codes, and the map editor) you can create a story of your very own, and live in your own 3D world of history.

From my perspective, I still enjoyed the game, but not as fully as a new person to the RTS genre might. The story was fantastic, and I loved the continuation of the [spoiler] Black family tree, throughout history [/spoiler] and the way it is handled. But unfortunately, after the campaign, the fun ends. Compared to the first two game series, AoE3 is very simple, and the mechanics are very, Starcraft 2 in essence. 

I strongly recommend this game to everyone who enjoys a RTS game, but I also warn enthusiasts of the AoE franchise, of this versions simplicity.

58,12227796,english,"Age of Empires III is inferior to previous installments

It is Inelegant
It is a clusterfuck of dudes, many of whom don’t have counters or counter anything
Armory improvements lack the simplicity of previous installments

New additions add nothing to the game or actively make it shallower
	XP, shipments add nothing
The whole bullshit with treasures and treasure guardians makes scouting take more attention than it needs
	Villagers not having to drop off their resources is a wholly unnecessary change
	The shit in the expansions
	The whole city building shit just makes changing what empire you want to play as take more steps. Does this game really need a progression system?

These things were removed from Age of Mythology:
	The incredibly helpful feature where you could see how many villagers you had working each resource
The map not just cutting off at the edges
An engine that supported height variations in terrain, smooth edges around line of sights
Aesthetically pleasing visuals
Quick Select armies
	
The UI is shit, full stop.
The bottom right corner is the best place for a minimap. AOE3 also wastes a ton of space around the edge of the minimap
I’ll stop bringing up Age of Mythology when it stops being better than this game. In the above, the resources are located in the far left area of the UI, while in AoE3 they’re sandwiched in between the map and the selected unit.
It doesn’t show you the exact health count of the unit you have selected because this game wants you to go fuck yourself
The actual menu part of the main menu is crammed in the bottom left corner to make space for a city screen for the city building metagame no one asked for
The random map setup is crammed on a single screen and it absolutely doesn’t work

Other Shit
Let’s see what else the campaign is boring

I would always end up in Settler units chosen to fight with my troops. 
Settlers won't walk far to find new Trees or animals, so you often have to rejob them.

Just played through the War Chiefs campaige, better story-line there. Even though it was loosely based in history. But it was closer to true events than the first one(I.E.

The city customization was nice for the base game, and I don't know why they got rid of it for the subsequent expansions.

67,11515914,english,"Age of Empires series was supposed to be the best series around - as I've read through many and many reviews. Many people recommended this game and when I saw it on sale I gave it a shot. 

Basically, this game is like European Wars : Cossacks. Old style RTS. 

The only downside to this Age of Empires versus the second is the way you can choose formations in the second. It felt overall the second had more to control whereas the third sort of simplified things and tried to make the game easier and smoother. AoE 3 is your typical RPG, offering peasants (or settlers), militias, markets, church's, walls and gates to protect your city. I really can't see all the hype about this game to be truthful as everyone says. Yes the campaign stories are good, but I find that this game doesn't really set itself apart from other RTS's. 

If I had a choice between playing European Wars : Cossacks or this - I would most likely choose EW : Cossacks. Not to say that this game is bad, but the options that are given in EW far outweigh those of AoE for me. 

I would give it an 8 if it had something to differentiate itself from other RTS of it's class, but

77,24510755,english,"Age of Empires III: complete Collection is a small compilation consisting of Age of Empires III and the two expansion packs. I already recommend buying this over the retail version since there was an issue with it. If one was to purchase Age of Empires III then War Chiefs and Asian Dynasties retail, it would only allow the use of Asian Dynasties OR War Chiefs. So, one pro is that both expansions can be played at the same time.

Gameplay
Age of Empires III is an RTS that is set in colonial times. What is most appealing about the game is the beautiful graphics for the time and the amount of replayability. The effort that was placed in each nation was specific and displayed the obvious strengths and weaknesses of each nation after some experience. For example, one nation might be unable to build a tower type build, but have a unit or another building that allows better protection against enemies. This also limits the player somewhat since not all nations can just wall up and defend well like in Age of Empires or Age of Empires II. 

Story
Not much to say on this subject as the story is loosily based on true events and is sub-par at best. To say the least, you would probably play through it once and never touch it again.

Visuals
The audio is superb and feels right. The gun shots of the muskets don't sound like bb guns or anything, the ambient music is relaxing, and combat has its own fast paced music as well. Graphic wise, the game is very beautiful and seems to bring out the environments of the real world.

92,24347669,english,"I bought this game at a discounted price of $7 which is the only way you should pick this game up since the price will match the content in this game.

Age of Empires 3 is a joke without any DLC you have like 4 or 5 nations to choose from and a few maps, which would be ok if the game was not $40.

Next, this ""RTS"" game has many issues with the single player and multy player, first the multy player since thats the easist to cover, it doesn't work, like at all, i tried to get a game going with a friends since as I said I had bought it for $7 so if it sucked I wouldn't be too mad, but it just doesn't work at all which makes me mad, I would have been fine with there were some connection issues or latency since the games so old but no, just doesn't even start.

Secondly the single player which is divided into Skirmish mode and story, the story I found lack luster and not as interesting as AoE 2 stories, and secondly Skirmish mode, this mode got wrecked, Maps are way too small and we all know how Age of Empires AI was and still is SUPER agressive, well small maps just make that worse since you now have to rush around with your villagers to gather resources to get to the next age before the AI does and comes over with cannons and kills you.

Lastly is the card system, while I enjoy it because it makes the game slightly more easy to new and old comers alike, that still does not give this game a pass for punishingly hard AI and really no totorial since you would think that you would get one in the story right, not really their idea of a totorial is just throw them into the heat of battle and tell them how to make units, what building makes what unit, and the time and resouces it takes to make said unit, not what unit is best to kill what unit, you kind of have to go off common sense with that one, like samurai (you only have samurai if you get the asian DLC) what do samurai kill the fastest because it's not infantry like you think it would be, but they seem to kill light cavlery the fastest.

all in all if you pick this game up at a discounted prices like I did you can't complain too much but if you do pick this up keep in mind that this will be a solo game with some seriously cut content, but if your looking for a game like this and don't care about price get Age of Empires 2, it has more content, less DLC and is like $20 cheaper.",1468648386,1468648540,False,1,0,0.437272906303405762,0,True,False,False,76561198022053135,192,14,753,0,649,1516424715

I played the singleplayer campaign, but I haven't ever enjoyed a single campaign from the dozens of RTS games I've played, so I won't say anything about this one.

There are about 1000 concurrent players on the ESO servers at a given moment, so it's a little rough to find a game sometimes but it's not that bad. People play 1v1s, the larger team games, and the custom maps. There are also unique modes for the conventional matches, like Deathmatch, Regicide, No Rush games, etc. People usually only play No Rush games if it's not a standard skirmish. The custom maps are pretty fun in this game, especially Lost, but I wouldn't buy this game for the custom games. Look into WC3 for that.

I mainly play 1v1s, and while the game has some balance issues, the flow of the game is great. It has a really good scale, each civ feels unique, and the shipment system adds to the customization of your playstyle. The economic and military sides of this game complement each other well, where it's fun to try to secure resources with strategic building placement and such.

30,24163669,english,"Age of Empires 3 (AOE3) will always be my favourite RTS of all time. I have played this game since 2008 and on my disc copy (actually 3 disc copies lol) I would say I have played around 1500 hours or so total.

[b]The Campaign[/b]: The campaign is not a hugely different playstyle from skirmish or multiplayer but it allows you to feel more like you're involved with the people and characters than usual which definitely makes the campaign worth playing through. Each expansion has a separate campaign and I remember them being highly entertaining and interesting each to their own. The campaigns also allow you to use civs not playable in any other game mode.

[b]Map Editor[/b]: Not something I played around with too much, but it was fun to just create giant battles, or create your own scenarios and historical events.

[b]Civilizations[/b]: The civilizations are really interesting. So interesting, that my interest in European, Native American, and Asian history are based from this game. I play this game as an excuse for studying for my history tests but I can't say that it helped with much more than trivia-like questions. Anyways, This game makes every civilization slightly different from each other (The War Chiefs and Asians are much different respectifully though) and every one is recognizable by not only building styles but troops as well. Each nation is given at least one troop that is unique to their civ. In the original there is 8 European nations (Britain, France, Spain, Portugal, Netherlands, Germany, Russia, Ottoman Empire) with War Chiefs, 3 Native American tribes were added (Iroquois, Sioux, Aztec) allowing 11 total playable nations, and finally with Asian Dynasties, 3 more were added (Japan, China, India), with a total of 14 playable civilizations . Apart from the 3 civs that are just a little bit better than the rest (You'll know soon enough), it is pretty balanced when playing online (IF playing with someone with similar experience).

[b]Multiplayer[/b]: AOE3 was slowly getting weaker with age a few years back but with the game being more widely sold on steam, I feel the community has a chance to bounce back. Usually when I go on, there are anywehre from 600 - 1000 people on at a time. This doesn't count the community that play on places like GameRanger and other programs like it. Don't get discouraged by people baiting new players into their games when they are veteran players. Host a game and name it something welcoming new players, read the ranks of the people who join, to make sure the game will be fair and welcoming to you if you are new. Or join another low ranked players game or grab a buddy or two and practice between you all. I would recommend being able to beat Hard or Expert computers before playing online, but of course, it is your choice. Multiplayer is the best place to play, practice, and have a competitive and some-what stressful game of AOE3. :)

[b]Graphics[/b]: Honestly, in my opinion, the graphics are spectacular for their time and do not look anywhere near ""bad"" even in today's time. Of course they aren't great for today's standards but they aren't awful enough to turn you away. I actually find them quite nice and I am more than satisfied watching the ships travel the oceans, or seeing the parrots flying through the rainforests. The loading screens are really nice too, all 3 games have different styles. For example in Asian Dynasties there is one loading screen with the Indian Emperor riding on an elephant with the troops behind them. Or the Japanese loading screen with the beautiful Torii Gates. In War Chiefs, one screen is the Aztec emperor on top of a temple with his arms up with the people looking up to him from the ground. This game sparks not only interest, but imagination, its amazing!

[b]Soundtrack[/b]: The soundtrack is phenominal! I absolutely love the theme song of each game and I find myself testing my opera skills most times I play this game. The music is great, intense, and is fitting to the epic introduction to the game or the conclusion to the massive multiplayer game you just finished.

[b]Opening[/b]: The opening to each expansion has a really cool video based on the game. The War Chiefs has the European explorers searching the forest and them being ambushed by the Native troops. It's epic, and amazing to watch from time to time before jumping into the game! I recommend watching all 3 intros so I'll let you watch to find out what they're like!

[b]Extra Features[/b]: Unlike previous installments to the franchise (AOE1, AOE2, Age of Mythology), AOE3 introduces cards, card decks, city levels, city customization, explorer naming, and city naming. Cards can be purchased by leveling up. One level is one card unlock point. A deck can have I think 21 cards to start, and with every ten level ups, can have an extra card in the deck. Cities level up by playing with them, and EXP is given for every building or troop made, or enemy building or troop destroyed. Cities can be customized by upgrading the buildings, such as France's Notre Dam by changing colours, adding features, etc. A minor touch but still interesting enough to have your own sort of style with leading a nation in the game. Your explorer can be named so you can make yourself, a friend, or family member be the greatest European explorer, Native American War Chief, Japanese Shogun, Indian Brahmin, or Chinese Master that has ever existed. The same goes for cities, you can name them the small rural town you live in, or your country's capital city and make it the most advanced city in the world! All theses extra features expand upon the replayability and fun that you can have with AOE3. 

Note, AOE3 - The Asian Dynasties expansion was the latest released and updated. All Civs can be played on this expansion and the majority of the people play on this one. I suggest only playing the original AOE3 and War Chiefs when playing with campaign, or really dislike playing with or against the Asian Civs as they cannot be played in the others.

Also, check out Age of Mythology Extended Edition (AOM) on steam if you like this game, or if you're into Greek, Egyptian, Norse mythology. I prefer AOE3 myself, but AOM is my second favourite in the series. Personally, I would wait until this game, and/or AOM, go on sale to buy them but I still feel they are worth the cost. Like I said at the top, I have 3 disc copies of AOE3 that all work (long story) and also disc copy of AOM. These games ARE worth it.

All in all, I want to see AOE3 bounce back strong. If you're new looking for help, a partner to play with, or want to join a clan who are mostly active, just message me on steam and I hope to see you on the battlefield soon!

It brings back memories from back in the good old days with AoE (normal) and AoE 1
Thanks summer deals for a great buy! haha

But.. 
I did wish there would be achievements for this, in AoE 2 there are some (a lot) but none in AoE 3 which kinda disapointed me but didnt stop me from playing thought
This game has lots of things going on to make cool achievements from. But that is just my opinion here :P
Also, a couple more abilities for your city would be nice too, maybe as an extentional DLC?
I am not sure if this is a bug, but when i try take defend towers in my game, it gives me barracks instead, I would like to know how i can fix this because i can already buy barrack by default, so its givin me something totally useless and it says it can be used for barracks or defend towers yet i only see the barracks option when i try to build them.

+Better Graphics
+Bigger maps

Thats just about all i can think of for plus's.

When it comes to the minus's i'd like to think i have a fair comparison when looking back to aoe2 and this game.

The games AI is broken as fuck, the level up system is fucking stupid and dont even get me started about the varity of teams. A small thing that made AOE2 unique was the randomised team names where in AOE3 it uses actual historyical figures to play as, all of which are terribly voiced over. I can't stress enough that this game is a watered down yet stale game.

59,24076770,english,"[b] Have been a massive fan of age of empires all my life and brought this game as soon as it was realeased. I have played thousands of hours on the disk version of this game. I brought it on steam to purchase the DLCs and experience them. They are just as good as the base game; but i always go back to my personal favourite: the french! [/b]

Putting that aside Age of Empires III ensures that the Age of Empires is one of the best RTS series' on the market. The new card and shipment system has brought in an extra level of strategy. The cards can be instrumental between a massive victory and a crushing victory, and i have often been involved in battles decided by who has the better cards. They can be the decider in who rushes the quickest, or who has the strongest military, or assist in establishing a stable econonomy with resource cards. 

Trade routes and native training buildings also bring in more strategy, with the ability to train cheap, effective native troops who have no impact on your population (but still have a build limit). Trade routes pretty much replace and improve on relics and allow you to collect more than just gold from them and can be a good resource provider.

Units have been improved from 2 and nearly every unit has a strength against another type of unit, but for every strong unit, there is always a counter of some sorts. Although unique units from castles has been removed, you will find that in the base game, some civilisations will have access to some units while not having access to others.

Artillery has been improved (organers from AOEII would destroy every unit in a battle, friend or foe alike) and the artillery can play a much bigger role in deciding the outcome of a battle.

Ship Combat has also been refined and has become more fun to engage in, with access to ships that can train units, and having more than one ranged DPS ship designed specifically to destroy other enemy ships from a distance.

Overall, Age of Empires III is a great game and is my personal favourite out of the series. I would recconmend it to new players and veterans of the genre who have played the first 2 and are looking for something new. Although be warned, stratetgy masters from the first 2 games will also have to learn the new mechanics; you cannot just pick up where you left off in AOEII and think you'll be just as good in AOEIII, and vice versa. It will feel alot different when you go back and play the first 2 games.

-Active multiplayer community, so if you want to play with your friends, this game will cosume your time
-If you put the time into understanding the game mechanics and the strategies, it will pay off
-Very time-consuming
-History lessons (top right corner in the multiplayer lobby), very educational before you get smacked by two lieutenants.

Cons:
-You can't build massive armies(to the thousands), but I think that makes for a more simpler way to play

47,23527349,english,"A game from back when RTS games were still riding high, when ""base building"" wasn't a dirty word and factions were meant to be colourful and fun.  It shows its age now, but the core mechanics are still solid.

An unusual characteristic of an RTS was persistency; or how your play affected you in the next game.  AOE III had experience gain over time that would unlock ""cards"", which then could be called into play in a future match.  This also came with nice cosmetic upgrades for a ""capital"" city, which let players really feel that they were leading an army into battle.  Sadly these cosmetic upgrades were not in place for Asian or American civilizations in the expansions, although the persistant card unlocks are still present.

The factions are nicely done.  The European factions all largely play the same, with some emphasis on artillery, cavalry, or infantry between them.  Asian civilizations are also fairly similar, just implementing ""wonders"" as well as other minor changes.  I do like the emphasis on the Americans, who end up playing much more differently as they lack the hard defenses that others do.  Overall these different factions make for a high level of replayability.

This game is honestly one the best, no... I'm sorry, [i]THE BEST RTS[/i] game I have ever played. I liked this better than other games like dota and smite (though I am more of a historical strategy nerd) but I think that the mechanics of building buildings and being able to control of all of your units amazing. I would say that this game is a little overpriced, and that's why I got it during a sale.

[h1]DLC[/h1]

I like the complete edition because playing as the native americans or the asians is very different from the way that you play the Europeans, yet I feel that each country is still pretty balanced. The campaign is actually very fun to play, too.

[h1]Age of Empires III versus Age of Empires II[/h1] 

Now, if you are trying to decide between AoE II or AoE III, I would recommended this game (AoE III) only if you haven't played AoE II before. I've heard that this game is different from AoE II in ways that the people who play AoE II don't like, but if you have never been exposed to AoE II before you will find that the pros outweigh the cons of playing this game because most people who like AoE II mostly like it out of nostalgia.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]

In the end, this game and Civilization V are the only games I play frequently on Steam. So, if you enjoy strategy games of historical themes, get this one of you like RTS or get Civilization V if you like turn-based games.

Anyways, age of empires 3.... its just fantastic

I grew up playing age of empires games, from the first one up to this one, and each one was just so much fun, including this one...

Now It's not the most nostalgic experience, but it does bring me back to those days where RTS was amazing... everything about it feels good, the mechanics, the gameplay, it all feels nice compared to other RTS's ive played..

One thing that pisses me off is that you keep getting free villagers, and i don't really know (ironically enough) if i can turn that off or not, another thing is that sometimes i feel that resources run out way too quickly, or maybe i just suck at resource management..

I have yet to go through multiplayer (im not highly interested in it, i mostly play skirmish since im a loner), so i don't really have much of an opinion on it..

The graphics are good, i mean for a game this old i don't expect crysis llke graphics, and i feel that the graphics suit the game pretty well.

Played all of the AoE games and I would happily place this at the second place after AoE 2 HD.

Campaign: Campaign in short is okay but mind you I didn't complete it though. Its not easy either but it just didn't feel interesting enough to me so as of now I have yet to complete it. So take someone elses opinion regarding the Campaign.

Multiplayer: The multiplayer community is decently active, around 1300 to 1500 players are online on most weekends. Multiplayer is also one of the strongest points of this game as with 2 or 3 players against 'expert' mode Bots it can be really fun while being challenging and you can 'master' the game more quickly by playing with veteran players! So I recommend playing Multiplayer if you get the game. If the ESO Servers are down for some reason you can still play multiplayer on Gameranger and Voobly. Some dedicated players play there exclusively.

Conclusion: Besides the Multiplayer the Skirmish Mode can also be challenging and decently fun to play. Other than that all I would say in the end is that I can definitely recommend this game when on sale to those looking for a RTS to play with friends. Yes this game has some bugs on more recent Operating Systems like Windows 10 though it can be fixed. 

Also there are some issues like path finding and builders getting stuck after building structures though it can be taken care of if you build your Empire a little spread out rather can cramping your structures while making sure you have it well defended with castles on all sides.

NOTE : When you click on the 'Play' Button it will give you several options like AoE: Complete Edition, War Chiefs and Asian Dynasties etc. The full game with all the expansions is the Asian Dynasties option not the Complete Edition option ironically!

20,22656236,english,"I haven't had much call to write negative reviews thus far - I habitually only choose to say stuff about things I like, which would make my mum proud I guess - but duty compells me to speak out against Age of Empires III, and sundry, on account of the hideous let down it proved to be with regards to the duty of all sequels to take the best parts of earlier titles in a series and strive to improve them further.

Age of Empires is one of the few series in which I can honestly claim to have a comprehensive base of experience in on which to form opinions (TES, Deus Ex, Civilization and MGS spring to mind as other examples), in fact I don't think there is any game series which I have a more complete relationship to than this one. (I might say Vanilla WoW had the biggest impact on me, for better or worse, but that's not a series is it)

So this might be a bit rant'y. But I will try to also make it instructive.

This game is a massive betrayal and letting down of everything that made the opening two titles of the series, and their expansions, so fantastic.

Starting at the beginning: Age of Empires. Released in, I believe, 1998, this was one of the first full computer games that I ever attempted to play, since my family got it as part of a deal for a new PC, our first modern computing system. I wouldn't say that I played it, per se. I was a bit of a dumbass then and it took me a few months at least to realize that the trial version game I had been playing over and over again actually existed on the same computer in full version, if only I would insert the play CD located near the computer. The trial version however informed my relationship with Age of Empires, and informed what I came to really expect from Age of Empires: The mini-campaign we enjoyed (indeed, I believe it was a single mission - practically at least this is what it was because as a total nubcake I believe I never actually beat the mission, though I got extremely good at playing it) traced the birth of the Hittite culture, from gathering food from a carcass or two to entering the Bronze Age and raiding one - perhaps two? Broad Swordsmen to take the fight to our dastardly red foes.

The game was about history, it was informative, the graphics were detailed, the music lovely, the missions loooong and the scope for imagination limitless.

Then of course we all know what happened when Age of Empires II came out. I first caught wind of AoE2 when I was outside a PC shop in a shopping centre food court and I saw some lucky so-and-so playing the Joan of Arc campaign opening mission inside the window. As someone who had loved Age of Empires for so long (a couple of years at least) this game represented a quantum leap in graphics, detail, narrative, storytelling, scripting - everything! It blew my mind.

[i]But it was still about history. It was still informative - even more so - the graphics were so detailed that even now 16 years later they are still gorgeous to me, the music was even more lovely and the missions seemed bigger, longer, but also more accessible.[/i]

Age of Empires II: The Conquorers Expansion was the final shining badge of honour on the series, the ultimate RTS game. Adding a few tweaks to the fantastic Age of Empires II model - one click garrissoning, farm build queus - everything went into overdrive with the addition of the Aztecs and some other South American civilzations, as well as the introduction 'closer to home' as it were of such slightly less antiquated groups such as the Spanish or Koreans. The Hun campaign, following Atilla, would prove to be the most immersive and replayable of all the narrative-driven campaigns, supplanting Joan of Arc and Ghengis Khan from the base game.

So finally we get to what happened when Age of Empires III came out.

Well, initially it looked like another fantastic rebirth of this timeless, epic series. I deduced this from a raft of gorgeous screenshots - never before [i]or since[/i] has a historic setting been so beautifully presented. Turtled sunned themselves on logs, Native Americans rode dustily across a distant plane, Mayan temples towered above misty swamps. These screenshots can all still eb found online if one looks hard enough through the google image results. It was inevitable, I thought, a done deal: Age of Empires III was going to be the most beautiful, expansive, historically absorbing, atmospheric RTS game ever created. I was so proud of my series.

So what did I get instead? Well to prevent you from feeding money to this pile of excrement I will spoil it for you (at least partially).

The long missions and giant maps have been replaced by crap maps with ridiculous scaling and a totally inadequate zoom range, as well as the addition of a ton of third-party NPC settlements and the like designed to aid the flow of quick gameplay. The graphics that looked so unbelievable - like Crysis made into an RTS - in early screenshots lost entire fields of polygons, lost textural acuity by the boatload, giving us something that looked like a cross between Age of Mythology and freaking Warrior Kings. The gameplay, which had looked pacific, ephemeral and deliberate in the screenshots turned into a pile off bullspit, with hero characters and wonky missions structures completely doing away with micromanagement or preparations. Your villages didn't even walk anymore, you just sent them to gathering places and they just stood there feeding you resources. What the hell does this even MEAN?

But the biggest sin of all is what they did to the historical roots of the series: They took a pewp all over them. You wanted to relive the conquests and dying resistance of the Aztecs in beautiful, out of this world graphics and scale? Too bad. You get some coque and bull story about frigging jesuit knights searching for the fountain of youth. This spoiler is but a taste of the range and depth of the ridiculous plots that we get shoved down our throats by this ridiculous title, which ends up having our chief enemy during our South American adventure being the [i]trucking Ottoman Empire.[/i]

Don't even get me started on the massive gimmick and gameplay-hastener that is the home city concept.

No. Don't get this game. Get the AoE2 HD bundle available elsewhere on Steam. This game is god awful. You will get more fun out of Rise of Nations - a lot more fun - or indeed Age of Mythology which was excused from the sings of this title by being specifically set in a mythological universe.

When it comes to the third game in the series, most people completely ignored the good about AoE3. I recall all my friends going on long, nonsensical tirades against AoE3. Mostly due to two things. The first, and most often bi*ched about, was the new twist on gameplay. AoE3 gameplay is basically the same as the first two games except for one major difference; the home city. The home city is a mechanic in AoE3 that allows you to recieve relief supplies from your civs capital. Everything from general supplies (wood, meat, gold) to extra soldiers (some of which can only be obtained from the home city.) Why this mechanic should stir everyones bile, I will never understand. The second was the story. AoE2 had several campaigns in which you controlled historical figures and reenacted historical events. AoE3 has a single campaign (unless you have the expansions) centered around a shady, almost illuminati type group trying to seize control of the fountain of youth. Pure fantasy, but well written. My friends though, sh*t on it. Back then, AoE players were a bit like todays SMASH players. Speaking of multiplayer...

Microsoft has decided you must use there servers to play online. As far as I can tell, you cannot play LAN and you can't host your own internet server. The real problem is that microsofts servers dont seem to work, as they are down almost all the time. Check the community hub for details. Fortunately (for me) this whole multiplayer clusterf*ck doesn't effect me. I mostly play skirmish.

Another issue is the price, what is with some companies (bethesda and microsoft) that they feel their games don't depriciate? Age of Empires 3 was released in October of 2005, and as of the writing of this review, it costs 40$. 40 f*ckin bucks for a game released ten years ago, holy sh*t, the price has dropped a grand total of 10$.

I have followed and been loyal to the Age of Empires series since it was first released and I still think that I owe my whole career (foreign language teacher and translator) to this game as this is where I was exposed to foreign languages for the first time. 

Aside from that, Age of Empires just has the perfect blend of city building and combat mixed in with some micromanagement (especially in AOEIII) which has sometimes resulted in having multiplayer games lasting more than 4 hours at a time, 4v4. 

I will always cherish this game and come back to it, especially AOEIII as it's set in one of my favourite time periods in world history. I would recommend buying both expansions though if you have to choose, get the War Chiefs as it adds a certain 'something' that I don't think Asian Dynasties got quite right.

88,22088240,english,"This is the best Age of Empires game and one of the best strategy games of all time. Ships are big and beefy, cannons are cannons that do huge damage and splash and each civilization is unique. 

In AoE 2, you have crossbowmen shooting arrows at stone walls, battering rams hitting farm fields and making them burn, and swordsmen using their swords to beat down structures. In AoE 3, units have their own siege attacks and animations which fix that problem. Every civ's Church or religious building is a different model. Every civ has their own unique units and tech trees.

The Explorer is your colony's leader and sort of a hero-like unit from Warcraft 3. You get to explore the map, fight neutrals and claim treasures during the start of the game, which makes games less repetitve and more fun in the beginning.

The Home City part of the game is awesome. You can send shipments or technologies from your mother country to your colony. Every civ has a ton of different strategies.

Each map is different enough. Most maps have Native people and settlements that you can trade with or ally. Your mother country will give you additional support on some maps, like early shipments or free economic starting buildings. There are also trade routes that you can establish.

The game has good balance, almost rock-paper-scissors, with various types of infantry, cavalry and artillery. Also, farms and plantations do not need to be 'queued' like in AoE 2, fixing any annoyance from that game.

In conclusion, AoE 3 is the most improved and well made Age of Empires yet. Every civilization is unique and all the annoying or bad features from the previous Age of Empires series games have been fixed. Each time you play will be different and every civ has different strategies. The maps are all different. My favorite part of the game is the sound of distant artillery, which echoes far!

Age of Empires 3 has always held a special place in my heart. I've played since the first AOE so just liking what I have is not a thing here. I genuinly see this as an improvement and large innovation in the series. The pace is nice, and the fact that resources gather so long as your settler are gathering is a nice change that speeds up the game. the addition of deck and shipments is also very fun allowing multple builds for nations and different ways to play your nation no matter what you play. The base nations alone are also well made. some balancing is an issue as it is with most unsupported games but each nation feels different and has a new way to play and thrive. IE Russian= numbers over strength, France= cavalry and defense. There's quite a few ways to play your nation so don't be too focused on the ""meta"". Trade routes and native alliances make a nice change as well, most native upgrades are helpful and give you a reason to explore the map and find native settlements. Frankly the game I see here is great and I wish the community was larger rather than focusing on the past of AOE 2. The changes are well done and keep the game fresh.

42,21574790,english,"AoE 3 is a pretty decent historical fiction RTS.  The game takes place mostly around the frontier days, with the exception of the Asian Dynasty pack.  I'll be talking a lot about that expansion because it's vastly different from the rest of the game.  Voice acting is decent, as are the stories, predictable though they are.  The music is catchy but highly repetitive.  

85% of the game has no chill.  While it's not really all that challenging on Normal difficulty, most of the missions in the game have some kind of time or mechanical constraint that prevent them from being standard ""build then destroy"" affairs.  Normally I wouldn't complain about this, but themes are re-used so much that they quickly grow old.  ""Oh, I don't start off with a base again.""  ""Oh, I can't get any villagers again.""  ""Oh, I don't get any resources so I have to use trading posts again.""  So on and so forth.  

The UI is kind of bad.  It eats up a third of my screen on 1080p, and hotkeys (of which there are many) aren't discernible via mouseovers of the buttons, so you wind up having to go back into the Options menu repeatedly if you want to use them.  Attack-move seemed not to work properly for me, which was very noticeable but not a dealbreaker.  

Asian Dynasties involved very different mechanics.  Minus the UI, the production value, and a couple of buildings/progressions, it was almost different enough to be another RTS.  Some of the alterations were neat, others were bizarre.  If you play the Chinese faction during Skirmish mode, they can't build any common soldiers until they Age Up (upgrade the town hall), only siege units.  I'm sorry, what?  Whose brilliant idea was that?  

You see, although there are many factions, there are really only four styles in the game:  European, Japanese, Chinese, and Indian.  It's not merely a difference in units, or buildings, but the fundamental mechanics of how they work.  Because I didn't spend a lot of hours in Skirmish mode, it's impossible for me to say if the game is balanced, but I doubt it.

Something that appealed to me were the farming/shipment mechanics.  There's food, wood, coin, and a separate export resource if you're playing Asian Dynasties.  The way it's handled, however, you can build farms or receive shipments that are slow, infinite pools of any of those things.  If you run out of wild animals to hunt, build a farm or raise livestock.  If you run out of gold, plantations or rice paddies are infinite.   Wood is more difficult, but Asian Dynasties allows you to plant groves, or you can receive shipments in any case.  As a result, resource-management in the game is a lot less stressful than pretty much any RTS I've played.  

Another thing that stood out is the ability to train stacks of five.  If you have the resources, you can train five troops in one building at once, and when it's finished five will pop out.  The need for multiple barracks is basically absent.  

That's about everything that stood out for me.  I wouldn't pay 40 dollars for the game, wait for a decent sale, but it's definitely worth picking up for RTS fans if you don't mind historical backdrop.",1456875974,1456875974,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,76561198032528294,444,81,2248,0,2248,1456842826

Ah, yet another entry into the already incredible Age of Empires franchise.  There are few RTS franchises that can boast about having as much success as AoE has had, and there is good reason behind that.  After putting in nearly 100 hours into the game I can easily say, this one does not disappoint for the most part.  It's no AoE II, but it's close.  That puts this game head and shoulders above most other strategy games.  Ensemble Studios really did an incredible job on their final entry into this series, and they will be greatly missed.

[h1]Gameplay : [/h1]The gameplay of this entry in the AoE series is very similar to the previous two.  Build a base/town, build an economy, raise an army, destroy your enemies.  While it might be a simple straightforward process, it's a hell of a lot of fun.  The combat is visceral, the interface is simplistic enough for even brand new strategy game players to get a grasp on it in just a few short minutes, and the payoff is worth it, for the most part.  The only part that seems to have gotten worse in this entry, is the unit path-finding.  I don't know why or how this particular area got worse, but it definitely did.  Units will seemingly go completely out of there way to get to where you want them to go.  And villagers will CONSTANTLY lose track of what they are supposed to be doing.  The Idle Villager button was nice in AoE II, but it wasn't a necessity.  But in AoE III, you will be clicking it every minute.

There are several modes of gameplay in this version including but not limited to: Campaign, Single-player Random Maps, Multiplayer Standard, etc.  But all of them hold the same general process of base building and conquering your enemies.  The campaigns are lengthy, but slightly repetitive and the characters are not really that engaging, even in the expansions.  The real gem is the multiplayer.  There are several different civilizations to choose from, each one with incredibly unique units that have completely different capabilities.  So while the units are different, this forces different strategies depending on the civilization you have chosen. This creates a unique experience and feel to each civilization and keeps the gameplay fresh while extending it's longevity.

Of course when it comes to multiplayer strategy games, balancing is key.  ESO did a pretty good job of balancing units and civs to begin with, but there were a few missteps in the original that were fixed in the expansions.  So of course the final expansion, The Asian Dynasties, is the definitive AoE III multiplayer experience.  (I don't think you can even play the Warchiefs multiplayer anymore)  I do not wish to go much further in depth with gameplay simply because this is a strategy game and can literally be talked and discussed about forever.  So I'll just finish with this:  The gameplay is really incredible and enjoyable, while also being long-lasting.

[h1]Graphics : [/h1]This game was released in 2005.  2005.  I'll say that one more time.  This game was released in 2005.  And it STILL looks better than a ton of games being released these days.  The new physics engine that was put into place for AoE III is incredible and might be the best looking one in strategy games.  Buildings fall apart completely differently depending on what they are being attacked by and how.  Fire two cannons at two different houses, and they will be blown apart in completely different ways, even from the same angles.  This game was WAY ahead of it's time in terms of graphics.  You will often find yourself just sitting and staring in wonderment at the action that is taking place on the screen (when really you should probably be taking care of other things in the game).

[h1]Sound : [/h1]The audio is perfectly matched for this game.  All the way from the muskets firing, to armies being demolished by elephants, and to cannons thundering over everything else.  And you will hear those cannons from very far away.  Just this small addition, brings in a massive level of tension to the game (especially when playing with Fog of War on).  You can hear the artillery slowly encroaching on your base, and depending on your level of readiness, you are either swarming around trying to prepare or silently waiting for the first shot to be fired in a battle that will determine the fate of your town.

As for the music, it's OK.  I'm a big fan of the soundtracks in the AoE series as they have always meshed ever so perfectly with the gameplay and visuals.  This entry probably has the weakest soundtrack of all three games.  But it's not terrible.  Just OK.

[h1]Lasting Appeal : [/h1]This game has tremendous lasting appeal.  And ESO specifically built it that way.  By implementing the new Home City system into this entry, your City can earn experience and level up after almost every match, which unlocks new cards that you can put into your City's deck that provide bonuses that can be called upon during the match.  Anything from a passive bonus to resource gathering rates, to massive extra reinforcement troops.  The servers are still packed with players ready to fight and try to demolish you so don't be afraid of dwindling player base.

[h1]Final Verdict : [/h1]This game is definitely an 8/10.  Superb gameplay, fantastic graphics, awesome audio, and great lasting appeal.  Is it worth $40?  Probably not.

64,21381801,english,"Fun variation on the age of empires formula, many features are ""streamlined"" and aoe-lovers might turn their nose on that.
For example the workers don't have to make the trip back with the resources, this completely removes the skill involved (where once you had to properly place a gathering building, abuse sweetspots and manage workers, here you just tell the workers to gather X resource until it runs out) but allows for the game to run a lot faster.

Many changes in aoe3 are like that, a gameplay feature is changed or removed completely so that the matches last less.

But it's not just a ""simpler age of empires set in colonial times"", it adds 2 features that distinguish it from the ancestor and cousins completely: hereos and shipments.

Age of empires doesn't have ""important"" units, everything is sacrificable as long as you spent less compared to the enemy's losses worth. Because of this the idea of a powerful RPG-like ""hero"" unit is not only heretical it's illogical and goes against the concept itself, does it work in aoe3?

It doesn't and it does.
It's not really an actual hero, it's an explorer unit that you can use for scouting or for clearing ""creep camps"" that give you a bit (or a lot, if the camp is big) of resources that you can use to strengthen your army, or build buildings. 
Other than clearing ""monsters"" the hero can build trading posts, these can be used to connect to neutral camps that give you a (weak) unit to train and (sometimes good) improvements for your economy, or travel routes which give you experience and this connects us to the next part the ""trading cards"" system:

The experience points you gain through certain buildings don't go to your hero or any unit in your army, but instead allow you to receive ""shipments"" from the mainland. Meaning you can get moscow/amsterdam/istanbul (or whatever your home city is) to send you a shipment of resources, extra villagers, buildings, improvements, entire armies to help you fight.

Aoe2 (and aoe) while fun in its own way, suffered from its length, only at 10 minutes you get to age up, aoe3 uses the above to ""fix"" that, with enough skill, by 10 minutes you might hit the last age.

Not everybody can get there, but it's possible.

Other than the several races, the shipment system can be edited allowing for a deeply personalized ""deck"" and gameplay style, takes a while to get used to, but the standard deck isn't painful to play with either.

The servers work, and people still play, there's a consistent community that still gets to hone their skills.

87,21207623,english,"Note: I played this game for many, many hours using the non-Steam version, so the play time that you see above is not actually reflective of the total time that I have spent enjoying this game!

A very good historical RTS (real-time strategy) game that covers an era of history that is often overlooked in video games - roughly the time from the European Renaissance to about the 1860s (just after the Civil War in the United States of America). The game is much more historically ""authentic"" than its predecessor, Age of Empires 2 (which was set in the Middle Ages), because each civilization is now much more distinct, with its own architectural style and many more unique units that are special to that civilization alone.

Personally, I love the new historical setting of Age of Empires 3! I just really enjoy starting in the Renaissance with units that wield mostly swords, spears, shields, crossbows, and only a few gunpowder weapons (arquebusiers and early cannons), and then evolving my civilization all the way to advanced riflemen, bombard cannons, mortar teams, and ironclad warships.

The main new feature in the game is that of the ""Home City"", which is a sort of capital city for your empire from which you can summon unit reinforcements, resource supplies, and special abilities to aid in your battles. Also, you can force alliances with local neutral factions on the game map that can provide with further unique units, upgrades, and powers.

Overall, Age of Empires 3 is much more fast-paced than its predecessors, something that you may or may not like depending on your play-style in RTS games. The battles usually start earlier in the game and are much more intense than in Age of Empires 2, but there is also less ""grand"" strategy as in that older game. Basically, Age of Empires 3 is more focused on the micromanagement of individual clashes on the field of battle, rather than on the broader macromanagement of the resources of a sprawling empire. Personally, I do not mind this shift in strategic perspective; when I want to play a ""larger"" game, I can always go back to Age of Empires 2 (now, in an HD Edition here on Steam), but when I want a more intense experience, I prefer Age of Empires 3.

I should also mention the graphics and sound design. Simply - both are absolutely superb! Although it is true that the graphical textures are pretty bad when you zoom-in very close, from a distance everything looks truly gorgeous. The cannons smoke from the explosions of gunpowder and emit thundering ""booms"" when firing at the enemy; the water looks ""liquid"", and it reflects the sunlight; the sails and flags of ships wave back and forth in the winds. The overall presentation really cements the immersion in the battles and the historical setting.

The campaign is, unfortunately, the weakest point of the game because the story departs from the historical set-piece battles of Age of Empires 2; the storyline instead tries to tell a unique ""pseudo-historical"" tale of intrigue and conspiracy with its own fictional characters (something like out of a thriller novel by Dan Brown), but it just lacks adequate character development or compelling writing. Nevertheless, it is fairly lengthy, and the actual mission objectives for the various scenarios are well-designed, challenging (but fair), and overall fun to play.

You can also play skirmish battles against the computer outside of the campaign mode. The interesting aspect of these skirmish battles is that you can earn ""experience points"" as you play matches and upgrade your Home City as you progress, thereby unlocking new units and upgrades for any future skirmishes.

The online community for this game here on Steam is small, but still quite active and friendly, so playing online multiplayer is usually easy and enjoyable, although I must say that I do not have much experience with this side of the game, since I am normally a more singleplayer-oriented gamer. The multiplayer matches play out similarly to the computer skirmishes, in that you can upgrade your Home City as you play more and more games (your Home City for multiplayer is stored in your online account).

In conclusion, I have to say that I really have enjoyed Age of Empires 3 as much, if not actually more, than any of its predecessors or contemporaries. Although the singleplayer campaign is not quite a complete success, for me this game is just a deeply immersive and intense historical RTS game. I love the feeling of progression that I can get whenever I level-up and upgrade my Home City, and I really adore the vast number of special and unique units that can become available to your civilization as you explore the map or interact with your Home City.

My only hope and wish for Age of Empires 3 going forward is that maybe the Steam Workshop will be opened up for it in the future, so that we can access and easily install some of the great mods that have been created by the fan community for the game over the years since its release.

-simplified economy, you don't have to reseed the farms, no lumber camp the just chop the wood and it teleports to your base, plantation grant infine coins, factories produce for ever whatever ressource your want...

- simplified micro of units
 
-shipments where you make a deck of cards and receive units or bonuses after you earn cards by receiving xp, i feel like coh got inspired by this but mayber aoe3 were not the first to do this...

Its a familiar game genre that is easy to pick up and play from scratch, and i remember enjoying this first time round, on old low-res CRT screens.  It is so close to the Settlers that most people will already know intuitively what to do.  HOWEVER...and it's a big however. It's curious that the game hasn't yet been patched or updated to play in HD res, so if you've invested in a thumping good HD flatview monitor you'll have a somewhat pixellated view whichever resolution you opt for, or maybe just stick with AOE 2 with its twee retro graphics.  The control GUI takes up far too much of the screen area, and a lot of features on the map are heaped close together and appear confused.  Things you get used to during play.  I doubt they'll patch or update this version, more likely they'll go for AOE 3 HD and get us to buy it all over again for the higher screen resolution compatibilities.  I scratch my head at Steam, for not making these things clear in the game info.  Getting to the point where they've abandoned any pretence at quality control and are happy to sell us anything.

Final analysis: a glib good-clean-family-fun game by the Bill Gates Empire, except that families don't play games on computers, individuals play games on computers.

Age Of Empires are in my opinion some the best classic games for everyone who likes the genre.

4,20449407,english,"This wouldn't be a bad game, 15 years ago, and I understand it is an older game. However, given it's initial release date was 2005, I am going to review it's gameplay based on the common expectation of features, and it's current playable status based on compatability with modern computers.

Compairing this to standard RTS of the time that had been released prior to this one, starcraft and warcraft, it is seriously lacking. Units have no special controls that were standard by 2005 such as attack move, patrol, ect. your only option is attack and move, and hope your units are capable of figuring out what to attack.

The storyline is great, it's interesting and engaging, however quirky, and without adding spoilers, it tries to be historically accurate as far as timeline and unit names, however it is like the entire story and themes were created by someone who never achieved a higher grade than C- in history.

The hero unit voices are so repetitive it will make you want to not use them just so you do not have to hear them. 

As far as current compatability, this game works fine with current Windows 7 8 10, however my biggest issue is the size of the interface, it seems like despite the game being made compatible for larger screens, it didn't scale correctly, which makes the entire gameplay feel very claustrophobic on larger screans (higher than 1080).

I would give this game a 4/10, but most would rate it higher, it's worth trying if interested and you can get over the above mentioned problems, but for me it was just too many announces to really make it fun to play.

57,20212277,english,"Well, I don't think I need to explain the premise of this game. I am pretty sure that everybody here knows the huge legacy that Age of Empires has created for itself. Age of Empirers I (Released in 1997) was already one of the best RTS games around. So basically, in my opinion, these games are still some of the best and most enjoyable Real Time Strategy games around.

Back in the old days I used to play Age of Empires I and II on the computers on my school. We'd gather with friends around a single computer, and attempt to defeat the AI. Speaking of the AI, they're pretty good. They're strong and reasonably fair enemies to play against if you do not have friends to play with/ who own the game. When I found Age of Empires II I was ecstatic. Age of Empires II basically improved on every single part compared to Age of Empires I. 

Now, Age of Empires III is new to me. I've played it for a while now and it seems more difficult than Age of Empires II. It seems like they gave the AI some new tactics and a higher speed. I was unprepared when the enemy showed up in my town. Although part of that was also me being new to the game. I had yet to find out where to find everything in the new UI, what every building did and what every unit did. So I'll give it a few more tries.

But, knowing what amazing games I and II were, I know for sure III will not be a let down. Everything looks polished and just simply amazing. It's the logical next step in Age of Empires' legacy.

It's worth what you pay for it. For sure. Especially now during the sales.",1451732409,1451732409,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561197999528711,522,18,833,0,752,1528633415

86,20103604,english,"Dustforce truly is a work of art. I don't mean that lightly. The way it's animated plus its music gives it that title in my book. I can find myself playing one level for an hour, maybe even hours at a time. The frustration of losing levels is filled with relaxation and calmness because of the ambient music. The way the levels are crafted is truly mindblowing. They had a system in which you had to perfect a level to earn a key, and you would use that key to earn more levels. In layman's terms, to earn more levels, you had to perfect current levels. They ditched that and added an XP system in which you gain more XP to earn a key the more levels you play and perfect. I'm very glad they added this system and was skeptical about buying it. But now that I did buy it, I do not regret it even for a second. One thing I really love about this game is how you don't have to unlock base levels. In a sense, this game is open world. That sense is that many levels are available to you, and you can choose whether you want to advance into more challenging levels, or stay where you're at. To get an S in completion, you have to sweep up EVERY leaf, and to get an S in Finesse, you have to maintain your combo throughout an entire level. 

Another thing I absolutely enjoy about Dustforce is its expasive community. There are lots of Community Workshop maps for you to sharpen your skills on, and lots of people who can set a good example. I'm sure most of the people who get best times on all the levels have a Youtube channel, so you can probably catch them there. The community may or not be active, but it sure is good and friendly.

Overall, in terms of gameplay, music, artstyle, animation, and difficulty (it's not an easy game, but it's not that hard of a game either. It just depends on how much you want to play it), I rate this game:

10/10

However, if you grew up with AoE II and want to play it, get AoE II instead of AoE III. Really differet gameplays and feels.

2. The game is challenging and you really have to think up a strategy or a plan of action to counter your enemy's moves or he'll annhilate you.

3. The campagin was well written and I enjoyed spending hours of my free time to get trough it. I also find some of the cinematics entertaining.

64,19838808,english,"I spent years playing Age of Empires 2 + Age of Kings expansion. Since I'm not much of a RTS fan, I never liked other strategy games much, but AoE 1&2 were a pleasure for me. When AoE3 first came out, I tried it, but didn't like it. It was annoying to young me, because I was used to AoE2-like gameplay, and the sudden change was something I hated in AoE3.

Years have passed, and a friend talked me into buying AoE3. We started playing it together, and it changed my opinion completely. While he is a huuuuuge fan, I wouldn't call myself a fan, but I like the game very much. It's smooth, and has some interesting advantages compared to older AoE titles.

Although I'm still not a good RTS player, and I still don't really like playing RTS games, AoE3 captured my time. When played with a friend, this game is a great co-op opportunity. A variety of races, all with their unique units and strategies, makes this game what it is: A classic.

Although I loved the game, I must say that Age of Empires 3: Complete Collection is not worth buying at 37€. It's too expensive, and is old enough to fall below the 15€ mark. However, if you're like me, and like sales - buy the game when its price gets low enough for your expectations.

It's aged unbelievably well, and is worth every penny. Instead of a long winded write up of this colossal game, here's a list of some of the reasons this is the must-own version of this game:

[h1] Performance:[/h1]
[list]
[*] Beautiful Graphics
[*] Well Optimized for modern PC's
[*] Supports large Resolutions
[*] Supports high refresh rates
[*] Scrolling that's smooth as silk
[*] Plenty of graphics config options
[*] Controls are easy to configure
[/list]

[h1]Gameplay:[/h1]
[list]
[*] Nice tutorial system
[*] Great for RTS game beginners
[*] Great for RTS game veterans
[*] Robust yet easy to learn system
[*] Well written, and casted
[*] Good, Solid Campaigns
[*] All the Expansions
[*] Colorful and attractive art style
[*] Beautiful settings and worlds
[*] Wonderful soundtrack
[*] Intuitive sound effects
[*] attention to detail
[*] many hours of entertainment
[*] cool historical figures and eras
[*] Battle on land and water.
[*]...and it's so incredibly satisfying to build a massive army, and watch it crush the enemy to a pile of bodies and burning rubble.

This is not Age of Empires 2 or 1, or Age of Mythology - This is an entirely new breed of animal, so keep that in mind if you have played other AoE games. The game is 10+ years old, which is something else to keep in mind (because it's easy to forget at times as polished as it is).

51,19298988,english,"Age of Empires 3 is my favorite game. Yes, that places it infront of other video game giants, including Arma, Warband, Civilization, and perhaps more appropriately, Age of Empires 2.

It's not the graphics... it's definately not the graphics. They're not bad per se, in fact they are sometimes beautiful, but compared to the standard rts of today, they probably rank 4 or 5 out of 10.

AoE 3 is my favorite game because it's *fun*. Over the last decade or so, I've loved and then grown tired of dozens of games, Fallout 4 being the most recent victim. Age 3, however, is always fun. AI provides a challenge, the community is still amazingly friendly and going strong, there are tournaments where you can win cash prizes, plenty of mods, and a quite large amount of diverse factions. When you drop yourself into a game, both single and multiplayer, it's an engaging experience every time. Honestly, I can't even find the words to explain why it's always so fun, it just is. Perhaps it's the historical care given to each unit, or maybe the ridiculous cheats and snarky comments of the AI, I don't know. If I said every game was completely unique, I'd be lying; but that's not a problem, because Age 3 does what works.

I usually don't like writing reviews, especially ones over 9 words, but this game deserves at least a little bit of support from me.

Genre: Strategy - Real Time Strategy
Rating: 10/10
Personal playing period: 5+ years
Is it worth a buy: Yes. Even at full price. This is a necessity for any strategy players collection.
Girl vs Game: Unless it's some super model I'd definately rather play the Game.

Personal Comment:
This is an amazing game with endless amounts of game time. The hours on here isnt a fraction of my actual game time online and offline. Been playing this game since the day it was released and still play it and love it today. I even missed a couple of meals as well as toilet breaks playing this believe it or not. I have bladder and bowel control of a ninja thanks to AOE.

Online gaming:
The online gaming community is still very active and people of all skill levels are on it. You will find anywhere between 500 to 2000 people online at any given time. Beware though that even though AOE is helpful and awesome the online community are sometimes a bunch of cocktonsil nimrod supremists who think they're amazing whilst never having seen or felt a girl up close unless in a magazine. But if your skin is thick and you dont give a flying **** about other people you'll be fine.

Short Summary:
This is a real time strategy game that plays off in the medieval times. There are 8 standard civilizations, 3 native indian civilizations and 3 Asian civilizations. Each civ provides a different set of advantages and it takes time to learn how to utilise the various civs to their full capability. Learning each civilisation takes time and it is great fun doing that. There are countless amounts of maps that allow for the use of different strategies. The game also has a story rich single player campaign. I have not played the campaign yet but never felt the need to as the standard game modes offer more than enough fun and game time.
The game also has progressive improvement meaning the more you play the more items get unlocked and the stronger your civilisation becomes. This ensures that you want to play more and more in order to improve the strength of your favourite civilisation.

Learning Curve and Gameplay:
Easy to start but tough to master. The learning curve to start playing and learning the basics is very easy. Learning the various civilisations and their strengths is more challenging and may take a lot of practice and time. The gameplay is very simplistic in it being a basic RTS with click and place. Gathering of basic resources and using those resources are easy and self explanotary. A tutorial can be played to understand the basics but this game is very playable and a new player will get it after playing only for a few hours.",1448536398,1448538149,True,79,47,0.701944351196289063,1,True,False,False,76561198146931290,427,8,7132,0,3622.0,1564508466

60,19170422,english,"I played this game when it came out 10 years ago. The conventional thinking is that Age of Empires II is the ""best,"" but the truth is that Age of Empires III is actually the best.

I'll make it simple. Age of Empires III is better because it's newer and it's more of a game and less of a time killer. There is actually a single-player with a real story to the campaign. There are a ton of different units in the game and I haven't even gotten to the DLC yet. This version is more fast-paced and is equally as fun on land as it is on water.

There is one issue that isn't major, but it kind of is for me. That is the game hasn't been updated in a while and doesn't allow for steam overlay (shift+tab) and does not contain any achievements. I'm not sure if the game supports 4K either.

I am using WIndows 10 with a GTX 970 and i5-4466. There are absolutely no technical hiccups and the game runs very smooth.

Overall, great game that surpasses Age of Empires II in every way while looking GREAT for its age. Also, no major bugs or compatibility issues with Windows 10.

Here is the thing. Ofcourse I have played the game in single player, to build my level and XP, so I can have a chance when playing online with someone.

2,18682779,english,"This is the fourth installment of the Age of series (including Age of Mythology), progressing down the evolution of civilization. Historic real-time strategy games tend to stay around the Middle Ages of Ancient Civilizations. It’s nice to see a game in the colonial era of history.

Unlike Age of Empires 2, it feels like this game was crafted entirely with the idea of balance. Every civilization has an answer to any problem thrown at you. Most of the civilizations have a heavy and counter variant of each of the three main military groups (infantry, cavalry, and siege weapons). This game ‘should’ be the best in terms of competitive play, since the game mechanics are well rounded and nothing is too overpowered.  

But this is where the positive part of the compliment sandwich ends. 

If you were to compare each of the Age of games to days of the week, AoM is the ambitiously positive Friday, AoE2 is the kick-ass Saturday, and AoE3 is the lazy Sunday. Every time I play this game, I feel like I should be doing something else. “Sure, I could be playing this, but I could also practice bass.” (AoE1 is a non-existent day where Horse Archers rule the streets).

As I mentioned, this game is very well balanced. The problem with this is since every civilization has a well-built set of answers, nearly every civilization feels like they play the same. In the two expansions, the only truly-unique civilizations are the Aztecs (only infantry) and the Chinese (batch-based unit creation). The other two native civilizations feel identical to each other and play like a weaker European civs.  The Indians and Japanese have their gimmicks (villagers cost wood and houses attract animals to trickle in resources, respectively), but don’t feel that unique. 

Gathering resources is a complete yawn, especially once you’ve got your farms and plantations organized. It gets even more laughably easy when you’re Japanese with the shrines and rice paddies. Even if there is no wood left or it’s all in hostile territory, you can just order a factory from the home city to make you wood for free. Unlike AoE2, there is little reason to aggressively cultivate resources. 

The campaign is decently written (about equal to AoM), but it infuriates me to no end how you can’t change the game speed in the campaign. I’m used to the fast-paced speed of ‘fast’ in Skirmish mode. When I start a campaign mission, it feels like the game just chugged two cartons of molasses and is recuperating from the syrup hangover. They may have slowed it down because the AI can be a bit difficult, but I feel like they did it so people wouldn’t think the campaign is too small. 

However, despite all of my issues, I still love the game and would recommend it to anyone who likes RTS’s. I am a big fan of the home city mechanic where you gain experience when you play Skirmishes and can improve the shipments you receive in-game.

However, I wouldn’t recommend it to someone who is getting into them. AoM was more colourful and unique, and AoE2 was more intense and challenging.

Play Empire Total War when you want  a Simulation. But if you want balanced individual battles come back to this game - this game is more healthy for your mind than Empire Total War as you have to continously strategize - versus the action-based simulation of Empire which will kind of make you feel like a dope if you play long.

Multiplayer has a decent amount of people on normally, but requires heavy grinding for full experience. Revolves around getting food, wood, and coin. Food is used for all infantry and cavalry. Wood is used for certain infantry, all buildings, and most artillery. Coin is used for infantry, cavalry, artillery, and upgrades.

[h1] Pros: [/h1]
+Graphics are pretty good for a six year old game.
+Gameplay is pretty good for RTS with some features unique to AOE3.
+Pretty easy to set up multiplayer games with friends.
+Multiplayer has a decent player base still.

64,17883878,english,"Age of empires 3 is 10 years old already, so why am i writing a review now? Well, because it is one of a few games i have never really stopped playing. 

Ill be honest, it probably is one of the best, if not the best RTS game ever made. Some may disagree with me, but before you do, listen to why i make such a bold claim. 

Well, first off, being a success was a tall order for this game. Why? because of its prequil. Age of empires 2 was and still is amazing. I have yet to meet a single person who played that back in the day, even just once or twice, who have a bad word to say about it. because of this a lot was expected from Age of empires 3, and boy did they deliver!

They added a few things to the original recipe, and none of them bad might i add. First up, when it came out it was a graphical master piece, and even today it is not bad to look at, but graphics is almost not even worth mentioning compared to its features. 

Probably the most notable feature they brought in is the Home City(the one thing that puts this at the top of RTS) 
Basically what this is, is an off map support system that is decades ahead of any other off map support system even by todays standards. You have the ability to pick 20-25(depending on what version you are playing) shipment cards from 100-150 total available cards. These are age specific, with a limit on cards you can pick for each age, and they consist of unit, supply, building and upgrade bonuses you can send to the main map. You gain experience from building, destroying, killing things and collecting resources. This experience counts down on an experience bar until a shipment is ready to be sent. Through the home city you can refine and specialized your deck to your desired playstyle. you may also have more than one deck for each civilization, so there are lots of different ways to play each civilization. Almost anything can be viable in the right situation. 

Secondly, aging. Most games have the first age figured out. It fucuses on aquiring resources in order to go to the next age. Age of empires 3 however has another aspect to it. You are actualy encouraged to explore the map with your starting explorer(a hero unit that can be knocked out and held for ransom, but not killed). In fact you are almost required to. There are treasures all over the map that are protected by treasure guardians. Once these are killed you can collect a treasure. Treasures can give you a unit, a worker, supplies and experience. Depending on which treasures you go for, you may further increase the effectiveness of your desired strategy along with shipment choices. 

A third aspect to this game are trade posts. Trade posts are build either on a specified location on the trade route, or next to a native village. if placed on the trade route you may recieve extra experience or supplies everytime the trademan/coach/train comes by. If built on a native village, you gain access to training one or two types of native troops and some native research. Some of these are very powerful, indeed all of them can be powerful depending on what your strategy is. 

So much strategical choices, and then the unit training and the fighting havent even started yet!
When it comes to fighting there is a very balanced counter system at play. everything can be hard countered by something else, and fighting styles change from age to age. In early ages you want to raid your opponents economy as much as you can to limit him from doing what he wants to do. At this stage it is a good idea to have a few cavalry around. Later on when cannons come to play battles start where players to for the kill. At this time cavalry is your answer again, only generally cannons are defended by Musketeers or pikeman, which hard counter cavalry. To kill these muskets and pikes you need bows or skirmishers, which in turn get countered by cavalry...so the aim is to catch your opponent out of position. Fights are decided by positioning and reinforcement ability just as much as unit composition. 

And now i havent even started talking about the naval aspect! OOOOOH just check it out yourself lol. In short, this is a highly reccomended game. Its online population even after 10 years are still rarely lower than 1200. There are games to be found throughout the day, and they are relatively easy to find.",1441405488,1441405488,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198085783171,55,13,23357,0,10722,1561055676

I personally could not recommend the campaign in this game, whilst it has a semi decent storyline, it is not something you can really get immersed in, if you had some hours to spare it is still worth a play-through however. 
Where this game really does things well is the multiplayer, you have lots of different nations to choose from with lots of different gametypes, deathmatch, treaty (No rush), and supremacy (normal). The different strategies that you can run for each nation is outstanding and really brings a lot of forward thinking to the game, planning out how to rush a base faster than your opponent is something that brings a lot of thrill and planning.

There are no great ways to get resources, everything costs more and takes longer to build so you are looking at lower villager counts but higher resource costs, it is ridiculous. Much harder to build a good economy and military. Also there is the fact that you can build gunpowder units at the same time as archaic units. Why would you use crossbowmen when you could have musketeers? The two didn't exist at the same points and so it makes the game ""feel"" weird. Not to mention everything is in a frontier/colonial era.

39,17091340,english,"In the third game of the AoE series the battlefield moves from the great mainland of Europe, Northern Africa etc. to the frontiers of the Early Americas, where colonies fight each other to gain control of the New Lands. 
Compared to the second of the series, it feels like a lot of things are simplified. For example, gathered recources must no longer be carried to specialized buildings by settlers, but are automatically added to your stockpile, ranged units always hit their target, no friendly fire,....
However, this game introduces Experience generation and Shipments. Shipments are bonusses that are send from the Home City (in Europe) to your colony on the Americas to give you a boost in the battle. These can be recources (in the form of recource crates), soldiers, or even special buildings (like a fort). Shipments are earned by gaining experience, which is awarded when killing enemy units, construction, training,...
Another fun feature is exploration. Every colony has an Explorer that can scout the various areas your colonies might be. He can also construct trade posts, which can connect your colony to the local trade route (and receive some of its profits) or establish relations with the local natives (who can provide you with warriors and interesting bonusses). Each map has different features, so exploration is (as always) an important thing to do.
And last but not least: gunpowder. In the second game it was something only available at the very last, now it is available at the very beginning, in the form of riflemen, musketeers, and many different types of cannon. Because, let's be honest, it is a lot of fun to see a regiment of enemy infantry getting blown to pieces by a handfull of your heavy artillery pieces.

It is mostly based on conquering your neighbours. The campaing offers a very interesting story about templars and secret orders. Assassin's creed truly didn't come into my mind.

Oh, it's a strategy game if you haven't realized that already from the store page.
Prefers wasting our time by letting us build up colonies and armies. You should not build too large armies though if you are not willing to click on every single soldier one by one and then ordering them to burn down that so massively important town centre that colonies are being build around.

It is not some fancy cities skylines, or sim city. The part with building stuff by using the resources your colonist gather, which seems like slavery to me. Those poor colonists just keep hitting that one tree until they die of an ambush or something. Truly sad... As I was writing and trying to let you understand my thoughts, the game is not some fancy ultra-high quality modern game that took 500 people and years to make. It's a game from the year 2009 or 10? I don't know check the store page.

I don't find such a simple idea quite fun especially with the campaing mode which forces you to set up a new colony each mission which gets boring if you are a perfectionist with games like these which ends up with you spamming colonists and getting dem resources and building dem buildings and then building that army and the doing the objective.

82,16774561,english,"Whether you are a fast paced strategist or a laid back gamer, Age of Empires might be the game for you. Personally, I can't keep up with the many skilled players in the online PvP part of the game, however, I enjoy the more personal single player skirmishes that AoE has to offer. That is not say that the community is terrible, because it is just exactly the opposite. When I first was trying to learn the hotkeys and tips and tricks of the experts, there were many players willing to take their time and guide me when I needed guidance. 

As you may have seen from the trailers and videos of this game, there is much fun to be had. The beauty of being able to conquer another empire is a victory in and of itself. It is a great game to come home to and just unwind from the stresses of the day. 

The campaign mode can be quite easy, so I recommend trying to challenge yourself and set the difficulty a bit higher than you normally would. The AI in the game can be slow and unchallenging should you choose the normal or easy settings. Also, the story is very cinematic so try to watch the video bits if that's your thing.

Overall, I highly recommend this game. It is great for all ages of players.",1435556441,1435556441,True,5,0,0.565217375755310059,0,True,False,False,76561198116787202,27,1,24698,0,15539,1462607034
83,16761279,english,"Yes, it may be 2015, but this is still my all time favourite game! It is a very strategic game with very amusing aspects. It includes colonies; some being the dutch, german, ottoman and british ( there is TONS more colonies ) but each colony has their own ability, i will not spoil anything, but some abilities are quite amazing! If for say; you were tired of the normal version of the game; luckily the game has included little minigames, if you can find it, also there is the little cheat-cheats in the game, that you can activate before you start the game, click the '' allow cheats '' button. This game runs smooth on my old laptop ( which was made in 2004! ) and even smoother on my 2015 gaming one. This game can definitely be a time waster! When people might be in the game thinking to themselves ""the graphics can improve"", just keep this in mind: the game was made in 2005, but I can guarentee this: even in the year 2050, i will still be playing! Thank you and I really do hope you will get the game.

You have more buildings, more troops and very good campaign following memebers of the black family as you encounter the new world, historic locations and figures. Aside from this you can create your home city where you get supplies to use in the single player games to give your self a boost and can be selected from any of the civilization's and can name it whatever you like and your hero. The skirmishes are great as they can challange you and lets you build up your new colony.

The multiplayer is not as fun in my opinion but thats just me. You get to see historic buildings and ages, aswell as the evolution of trade routes from the start to the end in the imperial era, like in age age of empire's 2.

85,16754939,english,"Absolutely love this game. Probably in my top 5 favourite games of all time. A lot of people resentAoE III because it's such a radical departure from AoE II, but once you give it some time, you realize that this game has way more depth than AoE II could ever have hoped for.

Some contrasts with AoE II:

-Less Civs that are more unique: AoE II has dozens of civs, but ultimately all of them have the same characteristics, whether it be the graphical style, units, similar sampling of techs, etc. There is a good deal of difference between the Euro civs alone in AoE 3, each one plays really differently. Dutch for example has villagers created from coin and bank buildings that generate free coin. Russia generates masses of troops that are weak in strength. Ottoman vils cannot be trained and are generated automatically. When you add the native civs and Asian civs, the difference is even more pronounced. They age up differently, have different classes of units (Sioux for example are mainly cavalry only and Indians have various elephants), have different ways of aging up, have different ways of collecting resources (japan cant kill hunts, but they can build shrines), different ways of generating units (asian civs can ally with a european civ not ingame that gives them euro troops and aztecs can generate infantry from a dance pit). The civs take time to master. You can be an export Iroquois player, but you can fail miserably with the Portugese in the very next game. In AoE II, it was not so hard to transition between civs.

-Streamlined economy. While micromanaging economy can be fun to an extent, handling all those idle villagers has always been a bitch. building a mining camp in the middle of nowhere only to get slaughtered by a light cavalry always sucked. Villagers now no longer have to walk back to a resource depot. There are also many new ways of automatically generating resources like shrines, infinite farms/plantations (coin), whales and factories. This allows you to focus more on the battle than on your 5 villagers in the middle of nowhere. 

-Homecity: The card system looks simple at first, but ultimately the difference between a noob and an expert are the card shipments. The cards allow each civ to be even more differentiated. The same civ can become a rushing civ, a naval civ, a mercenery civ, a boom civ, all based on your card deck. You can choose to have early shipments of villagers or resource gathering boosts, or troops, based on whether you want to rush or boom. India gets free villagers with each shipment, but you can ship a card that makes them send rifleman instead.

-Units: gunpowder units are immensely satisfying. It's arguably a lot easier to micro them than mobs of AoE II. It's fun to watch all your cannons and mortars blow ships, infantry and building to smithereens. You can get a hot air balloon or an invisible spy. You can have surgeons set up field hospitals. You can have a flamethrower or an arsonist. You can set up a gatling gun to mow down villagers. You can get a dog or an orangutan, You can old school if you want and have two handed swordsman as the german (doppels, one of the best units in the game). There's a lot more variety in the battle.

-All the small things: trading posts, native villages, treasures, merceneraies, revolutions, explorer/monk/warchiefs, special wonder, treaty, dance pits, consulates, pets, etc. 

Some of the downsides are as others mentioned: weak AI (strong early game, but become downright stupid in the late game), lag issues, small community (but it's been growing recently. There are tournaments with prizes of 2000$-3000$) and lack of support/patches, though the civs are fairly balanced (with the exception of ottomans).

It feels complete and polished, but lacks depth and becomes extremely repetitive, however i seemed to overlook the repetition very easily.

The is a large veriety of units and enough customizability to have an unspeakable number of permutations of a player's deck build, and the player can easily emboss their own personality into their army and city arrangement.

That's mainly due to the excellent using of lighting effects (shades and HDR), the textures and animation on a closer look however, are on the same level as Age of Mythology (kinda obvious they used the same engine), which is a little bit dated. But it doesn't hurt at all, for some of the best RTS games like SupCom and COH aren't beautiful up close either.

Sound: Soundtracks are awesome, definitely the best in the franchise and probably one of the best in the whole genre. I especially love the track of revolution event, it pumps me up so much that I want to punch a freaking baby in the face. Sound effects are even more impressive, more so the sound of canons. God how I love the sound of canon fire in this game, every shot is like the mixture of bass solo and Morgan Freeman monologue coming out of a subwoofer. Pure heaven.

Gameplay: Quite different from the previous games. The tempo has been speeded up a bit. Range attack becomes the mainstream and melee the sidekick. Resources are down to 3, which I think is acceptable. Civs feel very distinct from each other especially those from different continents. Balance is marginally okay, with 3 pretty OP civs and same amount of trench tier ones. Many new features like homecity and card deck building are actually great fun and add a lot to the strategic depth. Online games are quite stable and smooth, and usually end in stomping.

Mods: I love the mod Napoleonic Era to death. This along with another mod called The War of the Triple Alliance make me rate this game among top 3 RTS on my list. Holy crap the additional civs and features are mindblowing. I really wish for 2 things, that we will one day get Steam Workshop for AOE3 and one day the devs of these two mods be contracted by Microsoft to combine the mods into an official expansion, just like The Forgotten to AOE2. 

Community: Friendly, steady, small in size but alive. That's all I can say.

Conclusion: Don't let nostalgia get the best of you. AOE3 is different from AOE2, but in a good way.",1434255142,1434255142,True,99,20,0.780457079410552979,5,True,False,False,76561198070060941,635,6,4793,0,2183,1576110503

It is good a game to buy on a steam sale but not at complete price like i did. The story was good even if its not the same as the Age of empires 2 story lines. it comes with 2 extra DLC with it, thanks to steam so if your done with the standard campain, try a more Age of empires 2 form of story with the Asian Dynasties DlC or continue the story of the standard Age of empires 3 game with the war cheifs DLC. This game also shares some of he features from all the age games so its easyer to get used to if you played some of the games. But, not all things are old and it does have some new features like Trading centers and being able to build 5 soldiers at a time. Also, i have to say that the online is not the best. since its really old, it does not have many people playing it these days. Also, some things might be hate ful like remembering your password if you forgot it or making a account in the game. this game Today is meant for its Single player Campain and not for its multiplayer. back to the Single player, i never ran into a bug or anything game breaking. im able to run it at round 30Fps (estimate) and i never seen it drop below that. 

So the main Question is should you by this game. i say yes you should if you want a good singleplayer RTS game packed with 2 DLC and is on Sale and not at full price. i rate this a 9/10 for single player and a 5/10 for multiplayer and a overall 8.5/10. its a awesome game.",1434156419,1434156605,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198143082131,85,10,4160,0,3558,1577329042

This game is brilliant, although the AI may be silly at times *cough, Napolean* it still has unique gameplay and good graphics, as well a Pretty decent uprgade system. I loved the fact that different units would take up a certain amount of population, e.g. A dragoon would take up 2 population where as apose to a musketeer taking up 1. There is a huge variety of map choices and with the Asian dynasties pack and The war cheifs DLC, the selection choices are endless, they vary from the Amazon River, The Andes, Anywhere in the America's and even the Asian Maps. 

What I love most though is the story based campaigns, I have finished the Asian one's which I find very addicting, but the way the whole plot goes together makes it so intresting, the characters always serve a unique purpose on the battlefeild, + they are well designed.

My favourte part in my Japanese campaign, was when I sent a group of Ninjas into the enemy base using stealth mode, to assassinate the leading daimyo, Immedialty after his death, a rebellion started and I gained control of most of the map. :P +1 Bodygaurds

The game has innovations in your gameplay. The first thing is the system of provisions, that help a lot during the game, providing you some things like food, gold and wood. Depending of the nation that you are playing, you have another kind of provisions like soldiers, cannons etc.

The other interest thing is the hero of your campaign always present in your mission, and every hero has a special ability, that helps during the battles.

The graphics are very pretty, with different environmental and climate condition, but the cut scenes in the beginning of 
missions are bad, with a terrible graphic.
The classic things of the game still present in this sequence, with exploitation of natural resources (wood, gold, stone, livestock, fishes)  and the advance of eras, with the improvement of your buildings and military.

This sequence has expanded the experience with Asian nations (India, China and Japan). AoE II has a few missions with 
Asian nations.

The War Chiefs are awesome. Play with the Indians is an incredible experience, with the unique buildings and infantry.

This game offers a lot to people who love RTS games. However, it loses a few points for not having as many ages (time periods) to upgrade through. I really wish there were a few more ages to go through, as the most modern age you can get to still seems pretty far back in time. To make a quick comparison, in Rise of Nations the last age was an age where you could make nukes, computers, tanks, etc. It made the game more epic when you spent time literally going from B.C. times to the times of now (and possibly even slightly beyond).

Overall the game is good, it controls very well and the progression tree is still awesome, just feels a little short.

There's a lot here for the people who just like custom games against the A.I. too. You can have a ""deck"" of abilities you use for each game and gain experience to buy new abilities.

Gameplay
The change from AOE 2 is quite substantial. I would compare AOE 3 to Starcraft. AOE 2 is a game where you spam with strategy. AOE 3 makes it difficult to spam due to population requirements. I think it suits more to my playing style as it is easier to counter different units. Another thing to note is the collection of resources. The removal of carrying resources back to Town Centre/Resource structures makes the game easier and faster, as you can just send workers to unknown parts of the land to get resources. This can be both a boon and a bane. In AOE 2, you stop your opponents by destroying the collection buildings, but you cannot do that in AOE 3; you need to kill the villagers themselves.

62,15320530,english,"This game is almost great. It's a solid historical RTS game at its core. It is immensely satisfying to let loose a volley of musket fire or watch the simulated projectiles from field cannon ragdoll your opponent's troops. It borrows a lot from Age of Empires 2 in terms of mechanics, feeling, and ambience, which I certainly consider a plus. It makes gathering resources simpler and puts an end to annoyances like farm queuing. The game's few glaring flaws, though, affect it considerably.

I run into my first problem with the game when I run it. Having bought the ""Complete Collection,"" I thought I would have one game to run with the campaigns and other content from the two expansions included, but when I start the game up, a prompt asks me whether I want to start the Complete Collection, the War Chiefs expansion, or the Asian Dynasties expansion. Bafflingly, running the Complete Collection only gives me the vanilla content; running the War Chiefs expansion gives me the vanilla content plus that expansion, and running Asian Dynasties gives me vanilla plus both expansions. This is confusing and it gives the impression that the Steam release was poorly done, like a rush job made by an intern in some outsourced office.

Next, I start up the game and I'm upset to see that my units have no formation orders. In AoE2, I could set the formation of my units, choosing to group them together, stagger them, or group them to defend weaker units, for example. I could also set units to be aggressive, defensive, to stand their ground, or to be completely inert. I couldn't do any of that in this game. Only after mentioning this problem to friends who have experience with the game did I learn that you CAN give formation and behavior orders--you just have to enable them from settings. Needless to say, that's poor game design. As far as I know, no in-game hints or tutorial lets you know you can turn formation settings on.

Finally, my biggest problem with the game is the home city and card systems. They are closely intertwined, and they suck. Here's the deal with home cities: In Age of Empires 2 (or really, any RTS that isn't garbage) you begin any game by choosing a civilization or faction. In those games, each civilization has its own strengths and weaknesses which make it unique, and the uniqueness of different civilizations is what keeps those games fun and interesting. In Age of Empires 3, however, you don't just pick a civilization--you pick a home city to go along with it. For example, if you want to play as the Germans, you have to pick your home city of Berlin, or Munich, or whatever (you can have multiple home cities per civilization, and level them up individually.) Playing as any home city lets you gain experience to level it up; experienced is gained when you do pretty much anything (build units, destroy units, find treasure on the game map, trade with civilizations native to the game map, and so on.) Leveling up your home city lets you pick new cards for it. Here's the deal with cards: earning XP in a game will cause a bar to fill up. When the bar is full, you can pick a ""card"" of your choice from your home city's deck to be shipped to a town center or other building. Cards are bonuses that can be one of a multitude of things, from extra villagers to crates of resources to town center wagons. So, basically, while playing any game, you can choose bonus units, buildings, or resources to materialize for you once every several minutes or so. Every civilization begins with a default deck but leveling up your home city lets you pick better cards. This sucks because it allows you to smooth out the flaws in any civilization and substantially changes what makes each one special. It lessens the consequences for screwing up; if you forget to mine gold, you can just wait until you can pick another card and get crates of hundreds of gold shipped express to your doorstep. No RTS, AoE3 included, could conceivably be improved by adding RPG elements and the ability to beef up a civilization. All civilizations should be on an equal playing field by default, and the ability to grind up the raw strength and adaptability of a civilization flies in the face of that basic fact of RTS design. The game would be vastly improved by having these awful systems removed so that I can just pick a civilization and have it work the same way every time, instead of being obliged to fine-tune it by grinding.

83,15036937,english,This is a classic ok ok before you get your nerd panties in a bunch and spout flemmy gibberish about doom and warcraft sit down. This is AOE but with some better shit added that's all it's in every way a classic in style and form. The stupid campaigns add nothing for me as with all games that add some arbitrary story. I remember people borrowing my warcraft game books to read the story of how it all came to be. What a snorefest! I've always wanted to game as me not some character it feels like watching a movie but it pauses and forces you to click on things before it plays more. The home city concept is very fresh and adds a nice touch to close matches. It compares to the summons in LOTR games as a game changer when used at the right times. I also enjoy the graphics with houses being burned or demolished rather than men stabbing a building like in older games. The cannon effects are amazing with the balls bouncing all over the map. Strategy is much more involved with this game it's not just a race to upgrade units and let them hack away at one another once you build an army. The trade posts make games a back and forth attempt to gain ground and the limited defensive buildings make it more intersting to try and hold a point on the map. The trade posts also offer real advantages while not being so essential that you feel they must be held at all cost. Plus the fun little treasures littering each map make every match interesting without being so complicated it becomes obnoxious. So it's just like any of those old RTS games with a few fun twists. -SEF,1427220867,1427220867,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198035537908,40,10,8408,0,3510,1591376645

Cons :
- Bad graphics,eventhough the texture is quite nice,but the details are dreadful and unacceptable.Just look at the characters faces.Seriously ?

- Not a popular game,affects the amount of available multiplayer games

This game is brilliant, although the AI may be silly at times *cough, Napolean* it still has unique gameplay and good graphics, as well a Pretty decent uprgade system. I loved the fact that different units would take up a certain amount of population, e.g. A dragoon would take up 2 population where as the a musketeer would take up 1. There is a huge variety of map choices and with the Asian dynasties pack and The war cheifs DLC, the selection choices are endless, they vary from the Amazon River, The Andes, Anywhere in the US and even the Great silk road in Asia. 

Best feature for me? The Expansion Packs were actually expansions that changed the game in multiple ways and added on to the complete/full base form of the game. normally DLC nowadays is required to get the full package of what the final product should've been. AoE3's Expansion Packs ARE NOT DLC. The Expansion Packs in AoE3 add on to the game content enough to make it feel like a different game within a game. The Expansion Packs aren't neccessary to fully enjoy Age of Empires III; however, having them improves upon the player experience greater.

If you enjoy real time strategy games, enjoy managing an economy, epic large battles, and don't like excessive micromanaging then this is the game for you.

38,14601700,english,"This game is quite a classic RTS from the glory days of AOE, Warcraft, Starcraft, Dawn of War, Red Alert etc. The game features 40+ hours of singleplayer campaign missions for all the expansions, covering several story arcs that are both fictional and historical aswell as multiplayer. The game has aged very well and is still enjoyable and pleasing to the eye after all these years.

Age of Empires allows you to play as many kingdoms from history, ranging from China, The Netherlands, Great Britain and many more. Each country has several unique buildings and units that give all countries a different playstyle. On top of that you are able to unlock 'cards' for your deck by gathering experience. As you build things, destroy enemies etc in the game you will earn experience that can be used for shipments. The shipments you have available are based on which cards you choose in your deck, each one providing a different bonus or group of units. By earning experience while in a battle you'll unlock points, where every point can be used to use one of your shipment cards. 

Another feature Age of Empires has is the Age system, starting at Age 1 you are able to build limited amounts of buildings and units and use limited amounts of shipments. As you upgrade your town hall you'll be able to use better shipments that you can only use at more modern ages aswell as new units, unit upgrades and buildings. 

One of the fun things to do in the game is using the walls and gates to construct a protective barrier around your buildings and placing strategic cannon towers or artillery to defend your base from enemy armies. It's a great game to fool around in against the AI or with and against friends. You can also play with random people if you don't know anyone that has the game, but given the quality of the game it should be possible to convince a friend to get the game aswell ;)

40,14590926,english,"Good points of Age of Empires III:

Good unit diversity: Each civ has a core of units semi-unique to them, making each one feel different enough that playing the Germans doesn't feel like a playing a reskin of the British, or vice versa. For the ""European Civs"" (I put that in quotes because while the Ottoman Turks are not from Europe at all, they play like one of the other European civs), that diversity is actually rather subtle, with each civ having one or two units totally unique to them, as well as a couple semi-universal units that are their ""Best Units"", which get special high-tier upgrades. For example, while the Spanish get Hussars, like the British, the British can upgrade them to ""Kingsguard"" Hussars, while the Spanish just get regular ""Guard"" Hussars. The distinction is rather intuitive; basically, if a unit gets a special name once it hits its second upgrade, it'll be better in some way than a unit that doesn't. In this way, the European civs harken back, somewhat, to Age of Empires II, which had each civ only have one or two unique units. On the other hand, each of the Native American and Asian civs are completely different, with entirely different units and even different mechanics, and which units each civ is best with is fairly obvious a few minutes into playing them. The diversity is further enhanced with mercenary units available from the home city and native american units from trading posts.

Good story campaigns: I can't quite make this point without clarification. The first three campaigns were not that great. Those were the pre-expansion ones, and frankly, the series had really stopped working out those storytelling muscles it had in Age of Empires II. The action often felt disjointed and rushed, with the endings of each of the three campaigns being the only bits that seemed to matter or have any impact. However, all of that said, the latter five campaigns were actually quite good, especially if you could disengage them from the taint of their predecessors in terms of tropes and pacing. In addition, the characters personal struggles in the latter five campaigns were more apparent, their inner struggles seemed to mean so much more. Really, if you want a great story, the latter five campaigns are pretty damn good.

Good* Mechanics: This game has some rather... mixed mechanics. I'll get to the bad later, but for now, the good news! The home city is the big thing that was touted on release, and frankly, I like the concept a lot. It allows a player to gain advantages specific to their strategy, whether it be resource gathering, naval dominance, or raw military power. Essentially, the way the Home City works is that the player assigns cards to a deck, each card representing a batch of units or an upgrade or some resources. When a home city shipment is available in game, the player selects one of the cards they've assigned, and after a brief waiting period (Hey, it takes time to get a Declaration to Claim the New World overseas. Cut them some slack.), the units, tech, etc. arrives. In addition to this as one of the primary mechanics, you've got your normal suite of resource gathering (done with villager-type units) and military unit production. An interesting nuance of the unit production here is that when you've got a military building selected, let's say, the Barracks, and let's say you want to train a sqaud of Musketeers. You can shift-click the unit portrait to train five at once. While this may not seem novel by itself; a few games already allow this sort of thing, the novel thing is that doing it this way makes the waiting period for your units slightly longer, but you get all five units at once. The Russians and Chinese have this as their primary mechanic, with the Russians training ""blocks"" of infantry, and the Chinese creating ""Banner Armies"" which are groups of various unit combinations. Overall, the mechanics are decent in most respects. In addition, the game very cleverly and subtley hampers rushing, which was a brutal, and often severely effective tactic in Age of Empires II, by making it so that the player cannot send units from the home city, or even train them, until the second technological era. I hardly ever notice that my efforts at building an army are being hampered by this restriction, but when I do notice it, I am appreciative of the clever design choice.

Bad points of Age of Empires III:

Bad* Mechanics: As I said, this game has some mixed mechanics. Now we come to the bad. The primary problem we have here is that while the home city, is in concept, a nice idea with some potential for strategic use, it seems best used as a rush enabler. Earlier, I mentioned that the game restricts rushing by limiting military units to the second age and following. But the home city can easily be stocked with military unit shipments so that come second era, you can get an entire army, virtually free of charge. Here's a hot tip for those cheese players out there: Get the best second-era military unit shipments you can. Then, in game, save up your shipments. Once you get to age II, build a Church. Then research Mercantilism, which gets you around 3 shipments for 1,000 Coin. Then, in essence, spawn a horde of troops. Admittedly, this really only works for the European civs, but the overwhelming potential for early-midgame rush is still somewhat staggering, and it means that some of the more interesting home city shipments may not ever see play. In addition, many games, it seems, are decided well before the final technological era. The reasons for this are two-fold: A) Reaching that final era and researching all the upgrades is simply prohibitively expensive, and B) It just makes more sense to strike your enemy before then, fatally, if possible. This makes the late-game content feel a little unnecessary, as you're probably already winning if you can research that final era, and if you're not winning, spending 4,000 food and coin isn't going to make things that much better. The game does mitigate this somewhat, by having a ""Revolution"" feature, an alternative to the final age-up, which turns all your villager-type units into militia-type units, and also gives you a plethora of new military options for your civ. However, if you're far ahead enough that you can forgo economy entirely, than you probably don't need the feature anyway. Also, it's only available to European civs, so the final age cost problem is still relevant to Asian and Native American civs. Also, unit counters and stats can be difficult to wrap one's head around, as the developers saw fit to give the player the literal math used to determine unit stats. For example, I believe the movement speed for the average footsoldier was 7.25. Not 7, not 8, but a fraction, 7.25. While this may not seem like a major issue, throwing numbers like that at a player makes the game feel less than polished, and also degrades the meaning of the numbers themselves. 7.25 what? And what does it mean when my Musketeer deals 8 damage, but the Hussar it's attacking has 0.20 armor? Does it deflect 0.20 damage? Or 20% damage? The game doesn't tell you, meaning you'll have to examine the numbers closely to determine exact impact of your units against your opponents.

Anachronism: While I will be the first to admit that anachronism in a strategy game isn't that huge an issue, and is in fact, almost to be expected in these kinds of games, the situation here is rather glaring. Granted, the problem is bigger in the first three story campaigns, and I wouldn't mind it quite so much if it were restricted to the game itself only. But c'mon. Having Revolutionary War era musketeers accompany Amelia Black, a railroad owner? And having them in full garb in cutscene? That's the sort of thing that stretches disbelief to the breaking point, and was one of the reasons that those campaigns did not match the quality of the latter five.

Back in 2005, when AoE III was released, I'd already been playing the 2nd for several years. Being an amateur and enthusiast of medieval warfare, the period of time didn't seem too appealing to me. Moreover, I was so used to the iconic 2D graphics of the first 2 AoE titles, that I couldn't join yet the revolution Age of Mythology had started some time earlier.

Then, I found a torrent for the vanilla plus TWC somewhere in 2009 or '10 and it didn't took a while before I developed a passion for the game. But enough of my personal history and feelings with the game's series.

[h1]Actual review and rating[/h1]

I rate the whole expanded game [b]8/10[/b]*. If I were you I would wonder [i]what's wrong with the game so that you didn't rate it 10/10?[/i] The main reason I didn't entirely like AoE III was:

-Lack of deep european theatre
Which subsequently implies the game lacks the following content (more or less):

-European maps and respective natives [i](local inhabitants that commonly formed regional cultures)[/i]
-European conflicts within Europe [i](like the Napoleonic Wars)[/i]
-European major factions/civilisations like the Austrians, the Swede, the Poles, the HRE, and so on
-European ""minor"" factions between which most of the mentioned-above conflicts occured [i](e.g. the thirty years' war?)[/i]
-I could go on for ages

*I rate the vanilla [b]7/10[/b], and Asian Dynasties [b]9/10[/b]. I liked the accuracy and dedication towards the Asian cultures and peoples, perhaps the crappiest part was that they didn't bother changing the town noise and sounds at all. I cannot say anything about the Warchiefs because I played the native factions very little and am myself not-so experienced with [i](post-colonisation)[/i] north and mesoamerican civilisations.

Many by now are probably already thinking that the review is pointless because ""muh europe"", but hey, we successfully founded the first advanced civilisations, kingdoms and later empires - ultimately colonising the world. So, whether you like that or not it's history, and we're a large part of it.

Anyway, if you want to know how good the game is, just read older and more rated reviews. I can simply tell you that if you're looking after a traditional RTS set right after the middle ages until the beginning of the 19th century, you won't be disappointed at all. 

In case you agree with me on the lack of the European content, I highly recommend you install the [b][url=www.ne.elpea.net/forum/portal.php]Napoleonic Era mod[/url][/b].

Instead, you will gain a deep knowledge of zoology and learn how to beat up people and steal their stuff.

General:
>Zoology Lessons – Some things you will learn: Capybaras and tapirs live in Central and South America, Ibex, Saigas, and Marco Polo sheeps live in central Asia, Serows live in Japan and the rest of Asia.
>Japanese Daimyos can materialize samurai out of thin air.
>Shogun Tokugawa is a wizard that can open portals to other worlds and summon the likes of monks with clubs, shinobi that shoot grenades using their bows, and entire artillery companies.
>The original American Continental Marines were an army of Japanese Ronin Samurai mercenaries.
>If you throw a lot of torches into a building, it will not burn. However, it will break apart and then finally explode.
>Native American fire pit dances generate magic that they put to use in battle, putting Warcraft spellcasters to shame.
>Medicine men, surgeons, and priests all perform the same healing magic.
>Even standing near an idle monster truck could be lethal.
>Even before the creation of the United States, George Washington always knew he’d end up on both the quarter and the dollar bill.
>As an Asian power, you can ally with your enemy through the consulate… and still wage war with their forces with soldiers from their own home country.
>Chinese flamethrowers never burn anything, they just kill it and blow it up.
>The British employed the use of longbowmen well into the 1800s.
>Cuauhtemoc of the Aztecs is a cool guy; he has a blood fetish and refers to himself in third person.
>Queen Isabella so desperate, she’ll sleep with Cuauhtemoc
>Akbar of the Indians is worse than a fervent Jehovah’s Mormon as he constantly attempts to convert you to his religion (Hinduism) while beating him up. On the bright side, he can’t nuke you like Gandhi.
>Russian strelets are a gift from the Aztec blood gods.
>Russian strelets are equipped with large foam axes and airsoft muskets.
>Created an Iroquois home city called Toronto, named the warchief Rob Ford. He smoked crack, befriended blowgunners and blew up his own city.
>As another reviewer simply noted, you can beat up monkeys and steal their money.
>The Haitians hoped that their new ironclad warships would be their knights in shining armor. They turned out to be their morons in aluminum foil.
>The story of the original Thanksgiving is full of lies, propagated by the capitalist pigs in Washington. The true story goes as follows. In 1603, Shogun Tokugawa wanted to construct a new shogunate palace. He sent a group of Japanese pilgrims across the ocean. A few years later, they landed on Plymouth in New England, an excellent place for a new shogunate palace. There, they befriended a native scout and his pet intrepid scout turkey. Shortly thereafter, a group of allied Chinese pilgrims came ashore and set up shop alongside them. The Japanese and Chinese came together for a great turkey dinner. HOWEVER… The French and the Ottomans landed around the same time and did not take kindly to what they saw as encroachment upon their lands. A great war ensued in which the Chinese and Japanese ultimately prevailed. In the end, a great Thanksgiving feast was held in the new shogunate palace with Tokugawa as the host.

Pros:
-Great game play, keeping you entertained for hours. 
-Has funny and entertaining cheats, like ""tuck tuck tuck"" which allows you to spawn in a huge monster truck. That will drive over anyone or anything, creating global havoc. 
-Has a large supply of maps, each map making you have to adjust your strategic plans to win. 
-You get all the DLC's, adds more to the game, civilizations, maps and more!

Cons:
-Dying online community and online support, servers can get high amounts of lag. Servers will go offline sometimes even for an entire day. 
-Franchise has been disbanded, meaning no more support. No updates, no fixing current glitches. 
-Population cap reaches only 200, meaning that your stuck fighting smaller battles.

The only 2 things that annoy me and they REALLY annoy me is that, It takes a very long time to find opponents using ""quick"" search which i guess can be explained by the small playerbase, and in game browser you will always end up with at least 1 pro on your team or the enmy which will single handedly win the game for that team, even if you change the title of the lobby to something like ""noobs only"" some dickhead will still join. The other annoyance is that if one person is lagging either due to low FPS or bad internet all players will lag to the same extent or even more, which is very frustrating to experience with a high end system and good internet.

Admittedly, it is a lot different from the first 2 Age of Empires that were developed by ensemble, which did have their own special charm. Age of Empires 3 feels different, but once you get into it you can completely tell that they're one of the same. I love this game for many reasons. You can play a little of each civilization and choose which is your favorite. They all have a different playstyle and personally my favorite is the Ottomans because of their free villagers. I also like them because their units look incredibly Bad A- in a formation. 50 Janissaries. 25 abus guns, some gardeners and great bombards marching toward the enemy base is a sight to behold. 

Anyways, if you've played any of the past Age of Empires games and enjoyed them, or just plain love strategy or war games, then please for the sake of all that is good - get this game. I would advise you to go into this experience with a friend. Yes, single player skirmish does get a little stale. With a friend however, it becomes a LOT more fun. 

Some things that I LIKE about this game:
Home city cards (Come on, who doesnt love these?)
Civilization bonuses (Much more variety compared to Age of Empires 2)
Unique units (Units that arent a copy+paste like the common musketeer)
Trading posts (Hell yes.. upgrade to train and you're in business baby... just remember to defend them)
The music (Seriously, go check it out yourself. I hum along to the menu theme a lot)
Tons of mods ( Ill talk about that later)


Some things that I DONT like about this game:
They've removed the ""patrol"" option that everyone loved in Age of Empires 2
You cant rotate buildings
AI gets a little stupid now and then. (Mortar ships trying to fire at shore and cant find a ""comfortable"" position to fire from)
Getting the game to run for some systems has been troublesome. 
Mercenaries (In my opinion, they could have spent more time developing more unique units for every civilization rather than these. I rarely ever use them.)
Wood is a pain in the arse (If i ever have economy problems, its always because theres a shortage of wood)
The Japanese are a tad overpowered. (Not only in military but in my opinion they have incredible advantages in economy as well) 

Most of the things I dont like in the game are actually solved with some mods, in particular, the Improvement mod by Mandos. I can't begin to address how much that mod makes a great game into a spectacular game. Things such as improved AI. Theres also little things like adding your civilizatons icon to your ship's sails (Love that) and even damage being dealt to units who get run over by the trade route caravan. (You didnt think you could get away with a train running you over, did you?). Theres an entire page of improvements in this mod and none of them are detrimental to the gameplay at all, in my opinion. If you dont like it, you can just uninstall it. 

This mod isnt at all necessary for this game to be great on its own, however.
It's old, but its fantastic. The campaign story is great, and you get the war chiefs and asian dynasties to go with the original. If you're considering buying this game, look no further. 

If you're new and need someone to play with, shoot me a message!

67,13454514,english,"They should call this Age of Empires Not. I've always liked Microsoft Games Division because they made quality games. I've been an AoE player as long as I can remember, but this is not AoE. Here's why.

Someone in a meeting during the development of this game, who has obviously never played the game,  must have raised their hand and said these 10 Things;

1. Hey, you know that scenario creator thing? No one really uses that, and the ones that do really don't like it being so easy to use. So let's make one that's much harder to use. 

2. Let's don't let them save game when testing a scenario so it can be played as a game later. No one does that. 

3. And those random maps? Ah, you know they don't use that so let's take that out too. 

4. When selecting an AI, instead of just selecting one for the computer, let's make them also place objects in the game to make it actually work.

5. And here's something really fun to them. When they create a scenario and choose human for player 1, computer for all the other empires, and select AI's for the computer players, here comes the fun part; When they go to play the scenario, we'll switch them from player 1 to another player instead. They'll find that really funny!

6. And you know those formations that you could use in older versions of AoE? I don't think anyone uses that. Let's remove that.

7. Patrols? Why would they want their troops to patrol? Nah. Take that out too.

8. And you know those towers? People build way too many of them. No one needs more than 7, so let's put a limit on them. Even if one player gathers more resources, they shouldn't be allowed to build unlimited towers. No one should ever build more than 7 in my opinion and people should play it the way I would play it, not just any way they want to.

9. Same with Ships. They shouldn't build so many, so let's limit that too.

10. Oh and this one is real important. Players used to have the ability to place waypoints from their barracks, stables, etc. at an enemy location and fill the queue with 15 troops from each one and if it was more than the population limit, they wouldn't be made until the pop fell below the limit. Instead, in the new AoE, let's not let them schedule those troops in advance. If they want reinforcements, make them go back and do that during the attack so the other player gets a break.

Those aren't all of the problems with the new AoE compared to the excellent older AoE versions, so other people who never played the game must have also raised their hands too.",1419014069,1419014069,False,16,0,0.418323695659637451,0,True,False,False,76561198168066141,2,1,1054,0,10,1576228097

99,13259411,english,"Age of Empires III: Complete Collection is a real-time strategy game from Ensemble Studios and published by to what now Microsoft Studios. It is a sequel to the Age of Empires franchise. Age of Empires III: Complete Collection also contains both expansion packs from Age of Empire III.

Age of Empires III saw many improvements and feature upgrades in term of gameplay while retaining the unique play of Age of Empires series. Many new features included are the new home city and card deck. Card deck allows you to call many abilities such as reinforcements of units, resources delivery, unique upgrades delivery and many more from home city to your new colony. Age of Empires III takes place in the new world of America. You will be seeing units such as the Musketeer, Dragoon, Minuteman and many cannons. Another new features added here is a trade post. Trade post can be built on trade routes or local tribes such as the Aztec to gain their allegiance and lets you train their unique units.

Graphics in Age of Empires III is definitely far better improved and upgraded than the previous Age of Empires, far better effects, models and textures, shaders, everything is beautiful and fully detailed in this game. Performance is also great, no issues that can ruin your play.

Seeing that many Microsoft games such as the Age of Empires II or Age of Mythology has been upgraded with Steamworks feature, Age of Empire III should see that support too, since this is the latest Age of Empire series.

Age of Empire III: Complete Collection is a great game to play, I recommend this.

2,13253927,english,"It should be known by now that I've been a fan of the Age games from way back. There's just something about the historical nature of the games that appeals to me. To be fair, I think elves and space marines are neat too, but I think it's more exciting to explore the what ifs of real, historical situations. Though not quite as faithful to ""reality"" as some strategy games, the first two Age games offered us exciting sojourns into the worlds of ""capital A"" Ancient and Medieval strategy. The third title, Age of Mythology, proved that the mechanics were just as solid even if the historical inspiration was a little loose.

Now Ensemble is back on the history train with the third official Age of Empires game. Age of Empires III moves the action to the New World, letting players lead a variety of European nations from the Age of Discovery through the Industrial Age. Eight playable nations battle across a wide variety of geographies -- from the swamps of Florida to the snowy passes of the Rocky Mountains. Players can recruit different Native American tribes and seize control of various trade routes. Material and technological support will be offered by the player's home city back in Europe.

The 24-mission campaign is very well designed. Divided into three large acts, it tells the story of three generations of the Black family. First Morgan Black, a Knight of St. John races to the New World to stop the Spanish from seizing a powerful natural wonder. Next, Morgan's grandson John and his Native American allies find themselves in the Seven Year's War. The final act shows John's granddaughter Amelia as the head of a railroad company making their way west.

I won't spoil the particulars of the story here but a common quest and a common enemy unite all three acts. The connections aren't always clear at first, but the associations start to build as the game goes on. Putting the pieces together isn't terribly hard but it gives a nice sense of purpose to the whole game and keeps you invested in the action.

While we're talking about the game's story, it's refreshing to see a game that covers this era of warfare without referencing either Napoleon or the American Revolution. While both are fertile ground for strategy game developers, it's nice to get something a little different this time around. Meeting Washington and Bolivar and taking part in the Seven Year's War adds a little authenticity as well as variety. On the other hand, some of the choices -- like finding Russians in Colorado -- may leave gamers scratching their heads in wonder.

The range of missions is pretty broad. There are plenty of defense missions where you have to protect a given structure or a whole town from enemy assault. In other cases you'll have to destroy or capture key structures. Along the way there are plenty of other objectives: rescuing captured settlers, seizing trading posts, liberating Native American settlements and a whole host of other tasks. Better still, many missions combine a variety of these objectives at once. While most of the missions let you build a base and start collecting resources, there are some missions where you have to make do with a set number of troops.

Outside of the single player campaign, Age of Empires III benefits from a very soild multiplayer interface. A few simple clicks take you to ESO2, Ensemble's online matchmaking service. Finding and joining games is remarkably easy and there are a wide variety of options to choose from. Different starting eras and resource levels will let players jump into as advanced a game as they want. The AI offers up a few taunts from time to time to (sort of) replicate the personality of a human player. It's a nice trick honestly.

In general the AI is very strong. You can find some exploits here and there but, for the most part, the AI knows how to make a good army and how to lead it. While the computer opponents in some RTS games send out trickles of units from time to time in order to keep things interesting, the AI in Age of Empires III tends to rely more on groups of units and will hardly ever use them in pointless, suicide attacks. In my games the AI has had a good handle on when to press an attack and when to retreat. The only real weak point in the AI is its tendency to leave some of its settlers too isolated. (Since there are no resource dropsites anymore, it's also hard for human players to keep tabs on where all their settlers are.)

The range of technologies and units is relatively broad here. In the early ages, players will have to make do with troops that are very similar to the medieval set from Age of Empires II. Crossbows eventually give way to muskets as the ages pass by. Soon players will be fielding long lines of musketeers and using mortars to bombard enemy towers. While it may seem that some of the unit types are redundant, you'll find that each type has a specific role to play on the battlefield. Like the other Age games you'll have a variety of ranged and melee-focused cavalry and infantry as well as a nice range of artillery units. Identifying the counter units and building a balanced force is just as important as knowing where and when to strike the enemy.

Like the rest of the games in the Age series, the naval element is merely there to support the land battles. The handful of ships and maritime technologies don't offer many options. You will find that the naval side of the game is fairly compelling early on while you're dealing with pirates and chasing your enemies across the Atlantic. Once you start fighting in the interior of the American continent, you won't really miss the naval aspect of the game as much.

Pathfinding seems to be a bit of a problem here and there. Huge formations can easily find their way through the most densely packed settlements but my one hero unit can't seem to find his way out of the middle of a line of infantry. There are cases where the pathfinding is a little too good. Units are able to predict the best routes through a maze even when large parts of that maze haven't been uncovered yet. This is most telling during missions where you're leading a small force through a series of winding canyons. As long as you click on their eventual destination, they'll make their way through the labyrinth with nary a wrong turn.

While we're on the subject, it seems odd that you can't select a single unit out of a group by clicking on their portrait at the bottom of the screen. Trying to grab a specific hero unit out of a large formation should be easier than this. Luckily, there's an option in the game to disregard any non-combat units when you click and drag to select a group. This helps to keep your settlers from marching out with your soldiers.

Age of Empires III also introduces some new elements -- home cities, native tribes, trade routes and such. Taken individually none of these are profound innovations but their cumulative effect makes the game feel fresh and strengthens the appeal of the core design. So in total of this review, I recommend this game to anyone who loves RTS Games.",1417879744,1417879744,True,6,0,0.510625362396240234,2,True,False,False,76561198039025392,191,10,2066,0,1305.0,1587076439

35,13113039,english,"Why I bought the game: Wishlist game / -66% off coupon. Researching more RTS games I took a chance on this one, and do not regret it. 

What I liked about the game: I was 5 years late playing this game, but I am an avid RTS fan. It has all the elements of a great RTS, unique buildings to each ruler, gathering and maintaining resources, upgrading units, and strategizing your victory. It reminded me of the old school Command and Conquer games, having a Special unit, and unique to each ruler, or province. The graphics for a dated game are pleasing to the eye, I recommend if you're using an up to date monitor to set the game to use minimal UI, and also adjust your zoom out for further away.

You start with Settlers, you build a town, you set up trade routes with local natives, you build defensive structures, and walls. You gather supply, and experience to unlock more upgrades, you conquer your opponite via land, or sea. What sets it apart is the sense of exploration you get on the maps, finding treasure, and fighting for trade areas can be a whole other strategy. 

What i've completed of the campaign I am enjoying, I am playing on medium and have had to restart a few times, the game is not forgiving of mistakes, but learning and adapting is why i love RTS. 

What I didn't like about the game: There is quite a bit of noise notification as default in the game, during battle it can sound like a trumpet battle.

Would I buy at current asking price of 39.99? No, and I waited forever for this to go on sale, it was awesome to unlock a badge and get the -66% off coupon, today I see it is on sale -75% off for spring sale, very worth it, and I will be keeping this one installed!

45,12907247,english,"If you haven't heard of Age of Empires, then say hello to one of the most iconic RTS franchises. With the release of Age of Empires 2 HD Edition, there's quite a bit to go around for fans of the franchise. But enough about that, how is Age of Empire 3?

Well it really depends on what you're after. Visually, it's still pretty freaking gorgeous, and it holds up quite well, though it does show its age a bit (what do you expect for an 9 year old game). the lighting effects are great, and the smoke and particle effects, especially the destructible debris that falls of buildings is a nice visual treat, and I remember how amazing it looked back in 2005, and to me it still looks great.

In terms of gameplay, it feels more in line with Age of Mythology, Ensemble's previous entry, rather than Age of Empires. From the way you choose a leader each age (mirrors choosing minor deities in Age of Mythology) to general UI layout and control schemes, AoE3 feels much like a spiritual successor to Age of Mythology, with a focus on historics rather than mythos. 

Though with this iteration of the series,  there are new, much needed improvements. Gone is the need for a drop off point for your workers; like the Atlantean race in AoM:TT (Age of Mythology: The Titans), your workers only need to mine from the resource to generate that resource. This makes macromangement considerably less fiddly. 

Another change is how Caravans work in AoE3; instead of building a market, creating some caravans, and sending them to a Town Centre, there are now neutral Trading Posts that need to capture, which provide a steady steam of either Wood, Gold, Food or Experience. There are other neutral buildings the map, such as native settlements, or saloons which give you access to new units. 

But by far the biggest addition to the series is the Home City. The Home City has a deck of shipment cards which can be sent to you during the game, depending on how many levels you gain through experience (gained by fighting, find treasure, building or from aforementioned trade caravans). The shipments can range from dozens of cavalry soldiers, supplies of wood/gold/food,  to permanent improvements to military, defense, economy and so on. It can change how you play, and it's an interesting additon to the game.

The singleplayer in the Complete Collection offers up plenty of content, with about 8 campaigns, ranging from 15th/16th Century colonials to Battle at Little Bighorn, to the Indian Revolution, and even a little bit in Japan during the Sengoku period. It has plenty of nicely realised characters, interesting stories for each campaign, and enough content for each campaign so they don't feel short. This along with the 14 civilizations you can play in singleplayer (and multiplayer, though there isnt much of a population) skirmishes means plenty of content for your money's worth. 

If you're new to the Age of Empires franchise or if you enjoyed Age of Mythology, then Age of Empires 3 will be a fun ride through some events through history. If you preferred Age of Empires 2, then you might not like Age of Empires 3 quite as much. For me though, its a hearty recommendation.",1415765363,1416469268,True,308,18,0.950703322887420654,1,True,False,False,76561198013350552,1431,17,2777,0,2777.0,1408809082

I have not tried online yet since I picked this up on Steam but I use to play that a lot as well, if it still works multiplayer against others online can be fun, especially when you set up rules of engagement at the start so no one rushes before the 15 or 25 min marker.

What you get with this over the normal version is 5 new campaigns with 2 being set around the native teams and 3 being set around the Asian teams (Japanese, Chinese and Indian).

50,12975263,english,"Well, a third part for Age of Empires. What to expect of it?

If you have never played the first two parts of AoE, here you'll get a little summary: Age of Empires I and II were defining new standards for the RTS-genre when they came out. Not as fast-paced as Starcraft or WarCraft, but with more strategical Depth and more focus on the organization of your camp and with a build-in history-part wich made the game even a little educational without decreasing the fun of the gameplay. You always could choose from many different cultures which had some units and technology in common, but some unique units and cultural advantages and disadvantages.

Now, what is different in AoE III?
First of all, after AoE I playing in antique times and AoE II playing in Medieval times up to the discovery of the new world, AoE III consequently plays in times of the colonization of America and the civil war. Like AoE I & II, AoE III contains many true historical events, locations and persons, but unlike both prequels, the main storyline of the campaigns is highly fictional so that it might be difficult to tell which events in the game truely happend and which are made up. The main storyline of the campaign is about a sect which tries to find and conquer the fountain of youth in the new world and a family which is bound by fate to stop them. On their journeys they encounter many historical persons like Georg Washington or Bolivar, but most of the game is about hunting down the sect. So the game is far less educational then the previous ones.

The second big difference is that the cultures do not longer have most techs and units in common but every nation has their own tech tree. Some things of course still are open to every culture but the differences between the cultures are far bigger then before. This isn't much of a problem because you can still tell the strengths and weaknesses of an unfimilar unit very fast, but it is more difficult then before to play a new nation.

And the there are the RPG-elements. Not only do you have imortal hero-units (like in Age of Mythology) which can only be knocked unconscious and stand up again if no more enemy units are around, you will also play random maps with a ""hometown"" which can level up between games and send you support if you collect enough experience by surviving a certain time, killing enemy units or building your camp. Although this may increase the motivation to play more random maps they removed the option to play a random culture, which I really loved in AoE I & II.

The AIs are weaker then in AoE II which is good for beginners but a little disappointing for more expert players. The balancing is also worse. There are some strategies to break the game. A pack of at least 20 osman heavy bombards, for example, is almost invincible. No AI-player ever was able to beat me if I got that far.

With the complete Collection, you will also get the two Add-Ons: The War Chiefs and Asian Dynasties.

The War Chiefs adds playable Native American Tribes (Without this Add-On they are only available as some sort of mercenaries if you build trading posts near their villages witch appear randomly on random maps). Although playing a native american culture is a very wellcome change and a challenge, it is clearly unbalanced. Those cultures are given many new and unique techniques like sending settlers to a totem and dance to do rites which give you advantages like faster ressources or stronger soldiers, they still desperatly lack heavy siege weaponary. Native american soldiers are only strong in large nummers and will have to attack early to not get overwhelmed by superior firepower of other nations.
The Add-On also adds two campaigns which complete the storyline of the original game campaign by filling gaps and finishing the somehow open story. The focus, of course, is more on the war of the native americans against the europeans and so it is no true surprise that you will have to face general Custer at wounded Knee. Still the two new campaigns are much more shallow...

The Asian Dynasties finally adds some civilizations from Asia like the Indians and the Chinese. The storyline of the new campaigns has nothing to do with the story of the original campaign. The Indian campaign for example takes place around the fight for independence in India and the chinese campaign describes the discovery of the american continent by a chinese admiral which might have taken place (or maybe not) long before Columbus was born.

Overall AoE III: Complete Collection is a decent RTS game with some unique features, but if you were a big fan of AoE I & II you might be disappointed because it is a really different game then what you are used to. Still it is worth a try.

This time you play as the power hungry european empires from the colonial era, like The British Empire (Salutes to Union flag) The French, Spainish, Russians and more, addtionally since this the Complete collection, you get the bonus DLC which includes some tribes and Asain powers like Japan.

A lot of features have been added like trading posts, and you can upgrade them from transported by horse into trains, however they removed some features I enjoyed like Captapults and cannons attacking areas you want them to, for an example if theres a forest in the way, I could send a small army of cannons to destory the forest so I can build a wall or something, sadly this feature has been removed possibly due to a glitch where you can attack ally buildings with no penalties.

Overall if your a fan of RTS games, there is no reason to say no to this amazing game.

*Note* Everytime I hear ""The New World"" I keep thinking of these.

My friends all have very good internet (100-1000Mbps minimum) and great latency. We also use high performance gaming rigs, so it is definitely [b]not[/b] on our end. 
As you start to become a better player and seek a harder challenge, you naturally want to increase the difficulty/players. This, however, hits a plateau with AoE3, so you are forced to cut yourself short.

The AI has it's flaws but if you download some mods (there are plenty of them) you make a decent game out of it.

This is my favorite game of the saga each civilization is more unique than the previous ones where only one unit, one tech of difference kind of lame but it was the time. 

Did I already mention the physics, I literally can spend hours watching culverins take out the buildings how the break apart, another improvement from the previous where they catch fire by hit on them.

The campaing are not really historically accurate which is a flaw but is an interesting one nevertheless.

It's a shame microsoft abandoned this series makes me sad, I still have the hope they release another expansion pack for this one with more civilizations and maps, more maps to play, i would definetly buy it.
Shame on aoeo and aoe mobile. I want another expansion for this and while you are on it work on age of mithology 2... you better listen to me microsoft.

I have spend over 500 hours on this even though steam only reports 80, because i'm been using the Improvement Mod, and launching it from an external exe. I really recommend this mod adds a lot of flavor to this game.

Age of Empires III incorporates an awesome New England settings rendered in amazing graphics. The combat is more intense, more diverse, and much more realistic than that of the original two Age of Empires games, which were already great. The interface has been updated and greatly improved (only three resources allow for a smoother process of building and running your civilation). 

The game has many great new features, including:
-use of a ""home city"", a city you customize and level up through battle, that serves as your main menu and gives rewards
-ability to train troops in groups of five, instead of individually
-random capturable treasures scattered around the map that give unique bonuses
-more realistic battle (soldiers burn buildings instead of hit them, cannonballs knock down trees, ships sink, etc)
-awesome revamped naval combat. Limited fleet size allow more tactical fighting strategies
-unit special abilities. these vary greatly, providing a single powerful shot, treasure gaurdian taming, stealth, etc.
-ability to build trade posts to ally with native americans, providing unique/powerful upgrades and native units
-use of limited and highly-profitable trade posts along a railroad, which are visciously fought over
-unique use of ability cards, picked outside of battle, and used during game for special advantages
-highly diverse wild animals to fight, hunt, and tame. Tamable ones includes wolves, coyotes, bears, cougars, and more.
-interesting and useful incorporation of time-period features, including minute-men, trains, native allies, and more.
-addition of artillery units (various cannons) that add a unique element to combat
-(with Asian Dynasties expansion) ability to play as one of three native American tribes (Sioux, Aztec, and one other)


Things I do not like about this game:
-population size still limited to 200 units
-artillery is a bit overpowered (specifically anti-infantry artillery, though it is more realistic that way)

In short, if you are a fan of the original two AoE games, love historical time period-set war games, like strategy combat, or just want to have some great fun on an amazingly underrated and easy-to-learn game, buy Age of Empires III now. And while you're at it, the expansions are great and well worth the money.

24,12326382,english,"Don't buy this game for it's name. Actually, it's a shame for the outstanding AoE franchise.

AoE III is a wonderful game, with good graphics and enough in-game possibilities (i'm talking about buildings and characters), but it lacks the supremacy of AoE II and AoE.

This game looks like the developers wanted to make a game that would ressemble the very first Empire Earth. Well, it doesn't. 

- Remember that awesome feeling in AoE II and EE when changing the map size to 'gigantic' and you had no idea where to start exploring first? You won't find it here. According to me, this game stands or falls with the scale of its maps.
- Also a big fail is the building-aspect. You don't have the feeling, when building your houses and military buildings, that you're constructing a city. After putting your, let's say 20, buildings close to each other and in an structurised manner, it looks like a mismatched slum of the 14th century which you want to put on fire. I know, some of you will say: 'Oy, AoE isn't about building, it's the fighting that counts!' And i'll even say they're correct. But be honest with yourselves, it's the whole that counts, isn't it?
- Another, rather 'stupid', improvement is the fact that in-game you have the possibility to make your homecountry deliver supplies (troops, food and villagers). Seriously, who gives a damn for this? This makes you feel incompetent for playing this game, since you'll have to 'beg' for help. Not a nice feeling, not?

The lot of you will buy Age of Empires III for the name and because you expect it to be even better than AoE II and EE. But don't be fooled by the name, nor the metacritic score; 
this game isn't worth buying for the full price.

-Nice physic based cannon effects

Following the successful Age of Empires franchise is AOE III, now wonderfully remastered into one complete pack on Steam. This is a must-get for not just AOE fans, but fans of strategy games in general. Age of Empires III is a strong example of what makes the AOE series a classic in RTS games. From micro to macro-management, housekeeping to empire building, the game is easy to learn yet difficult to master.

The game is set in the 17th thru 19th centuries when European nations expanded their dominions and colonies across the world. On the other side of the globe, Native American civilizations fight to survive or adapt to European incursion, and Asian civilizations cautiously open their borders to a foreign and strange culture. From large musketeer battles to cavalry charges, and artillery blasting away at mortar and brick, the game is a visual delight to relish.",1409505105,1409505105,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198056555839,30,9,11380,80,4324,1601742001

What i didn't like.  Lacked in content compaired to other Age of Empires games, The homecity concept was poorly done and pretty much pointless, even the largest maps was small , it just didn't do the title of AoE justice at all.

im not one for writing long as hell reviews so ill keep it simple and informative.

Pros:
- Stays faithful to AoE mechincs
- Interesting way to customise your chosen nation in mp/skirmish with cards
- Interesting stories in the numerous campaigns
- looks pretty
- cheesy but funny in game voice overs of leaders

Cons :
- I felt the maps were small
- Combat can be rather onesided for or against you depending on tech
- Cant build a wall over trade router but you can in tutorial (dafuq?)
- AI can be turtle like or rush like theres no real balance or intelligence to it
- Multiplayer is dead

Overall:
Id say buy it if you a fan of the other AoE titles. If youve never played AoE before then again buy it it will give you something new to try. 

Being an age old AoE fan my oppinion is biased but i do like and i would reccomend it for those who like RTS and looking for something different to play

60,11584026,english,"This game does have some good things although I have found that Age of Empires 2 has more to offer than Age of Empires 3.

Reason I would choose AoE2 over AoE3..
- More people to choose
- More structures to build
- Larger maps
- More customizability
- Easier to create things and understand things.
- Better customizable economy (can choose to start with 500 of each resource and work your way up from scratch vs 20k to start)
- Stone resource. (Some may argue this makes it harder and more of a BS resource but at the same time, its not a max out and win game.)
- Stronger structures with more unit specializes.
- More of a story
- A lot more.


Things AoE3 has against AoE2
- Better graphics
- Better UI
- One off screen to choose things to summon in from, ""Levels""
- Level up (One hero that you normally need to ransom to get anywhere.)
- If you group someone into group 1 and hold down the 1 button, it doesn't stop the unit dead in its tracks (Until the button is released.)


If your going to buy this game, wait for it to go on sale otherwise your wasting your money..
If your going to buy AoE2 and like stratedgy games that you can waste hours on end, then buy it any time.

lets start with what is good. 
for a game made in 2005 it has very good graphics. And the way buildings fall apart when damaged is very satisfying. There are ALOT of choices for what units to build.
That being said there are far more negatives in my opinion
the controls are clunky at best and hot keys are far from intuitive or fast. The 'cards' add a level of complexity that is completely unnecessary. The units and their counters are so hard that there is almost no point to getting more then the other guy and if you don't have the perfect mix to take him down there is almost no chance to heavily damage his army let alone kill it. Field artillery is far over powered. Workers are absurdly expensive but I suppose that was a balance decision to make up for the fact the resource gathering and macro, if you can call it that, is so simple that it makes where to send your workers to gather minerals in starcraft seam arduous. Factions are far from balanced and not in the good way that promotes a healthy meta game. The computer AI if you can call it that is a joke and needs some serious attention. Battles even when they are at peak seam sluggish or everything is dead before any exchange has happened and micro is almost a joke.

- New buildings

- Mouse acceleration when scrolling with the edge of the screen. (To be fair, I didn't check if there was a way to turn it off or not)
- Addition of decks (un-necessary new complexity)
- Addition of home cities (what do they do for me?)
- Unit limitation comared to AoE II HD

- Removal of a resource (stone). Makes the game a bit faster pace, but I miss having to manage resources a little better.

You can still see some of the nations here are still using bow and arrow, looks old school but it's very effective against the slow musketeers. 

Playing skirmish means that you are divided into 2 teams. In AOE 2, you can play alone and fight the rest of the enemies while they also fighting each others. But in AOE 3, if you try to fight alone you'll definitely gonna get crush by the enemies (exception when you play in easy mode and Free for All). A little advice, whenever you try to play skirmish make sure either France or British to be your ally, they build their armies faster and always in large.

I develop a Fan Patch for this game, N3O FP1.3z3N, which is available at aoe3.heavengames.com
Includes new maps, balance, spice, new unique features, without changing the way the game is played!
Has been tested by some of the best players in the community, and aims to achieve the highest regard. 
Developed over 2 1/2 years, it should give every player a new feel, just like when Warchiefs expansion came out. 
It is large enough to be considered an Expansion Pack by itself, except that it comes free of charge!
On top of this, it includes a deadly new AI, highly skilled in 2v2 matches. 

If you are a fan of the Age Series, Buying Age of Empires III this is a must. If you are further very adament about this game, 
I would highly suggest trying out the Fan Patch. If not the Patch, then for its AI player!

Let me just say that the game feels...small...in comparison to other games like it and to its own games. There are only a few unit types, the research and upgrades feel dull, the maps are a little weird, and the UI looks really bad for 2009. (Sure the UI shouldn't give the game a lower score but it is the one continous thing on your screen the whole time playing which can help you find buttons and/or match the game so it doesn't look out of place) Also there really is no strategy, as you just need a more researched army and big a economy. On top of this the Campaign is uninteresting and the weird home city hub never truly fascinated me. Nothing feels dynamic it all feels linear.And lastly the AI feels like it has an upper hand when I was playing on Normal, as their cities weren't as built up as mine for most of the game. Now here are the good parts about the game. Graphics are solid, Building Destruction is nice, Units speak in their native language, building management, and resource gathering is perfect.
My FINAL SCORE is, (5/10) I love rts games but this feels weak compared to past installments and other rts games. If this game was 20$ I would be happier but this costs 40$!!

The introduction of the Home City was a pretty radical departure for the series, introducing persistent leveling to your favorite civilizations, with immediate and powerful gameplay modifications tailored by you to enhance and compliment your playstyle. On the one hand, this feature works great and is very enjoyable, as you pick and choose 'cards' before going into each match, which might upgrade your units, or your production, or they might give you free units, or unlock abilities. On the other hand, you'll quickly realize that each civilization has its own Home City and you have to play each and every one of them for dozens of matches if you want to competitively play all of them. If you have one or two favorite civs that you'll be playing all the time then that's no problem; you can focus on your favorites and be happy as a clam. If you enjoy playing them all though, and are a fan of the Random Civ option from previous games, then the removal of that feature and the introduction of persistence may irritate you.

Other than that, all I'd have to say is that this is a great RTS, with good campaigns, good civilization variety, artwork, music, sound design, gameplay, and scenario editor.

-The explorer unit for each civilization gives players something to do while waiting for training/building completion

Cons:
-The AI for the units was programmed by a four-year old and makes zero tactical sense
-Very few ""game-ending"" units. Besides the massive warships, there's nothing that really stomps all over your opponent
-Small pool of active online players, so the quickplay option doesn't really work

Age of Empires III not only lives up, but pushes forward the great series that is Age of Empires. Most people compare it as being weaker than its predecessor Age of Empires II, but I find that these people tend to not see the greatness in this game. It seems in this Age of Empires the game became more realistic, in that the Colonial Era was a point in time when no longer were kingdoms limited in wealth by the amount of gold they could mine. Instead it brings in new Cash Crops, which allow each nation to produce Gold outside of traditional methods. 

[b]Campaign:[/b]
This is a great game with an in-depth campaign that goes through the stories of a Scottish Explorer and his sons/daughters. The campaign is interesting and introduces different styles of gameplay from macro-managing to micro-managing with scavenging and hording. Definitely worth the play through, for Age of Empires III and Age of Empires III: War Chiefs. Age of Empires III: The Asian Dynasties is fun, but the campaign has nothing to do with either of the other two expansions. 

[b]Gameplay:[/b]
Age of Empires III offers a brilliant combat system that no longer requires precise delegation of finite resources, but allows for macro-scale battle. Allowing some players to turtle and others to expand, depending on your gameplay you can grow or stay at home. Mining gold and gathering food will always garnish better results than farming gold and food. Not only can you focus different resource harvesting strategies, but you can also use different strategies in your combat choices. You can buy mercenaries which cost only gold, or even capture native towns and create tribal units. This can allow you to vary your tactics based on your environment as well as your team. 

[b]Teams:[/b]
This game introduces new challenges with Teams that are complex and highly differentiated, unlike in the predecessors where each team essentially was the same as the last minus a few shifts in upgrade options and one special unit (plus two special upgrades). Age of Empires III and its two expansions offer a variety of teams which include peoples of Europe, Americas, and Asia. Age of Empires III includes the Spanish, British, French, Portuguese, Dutch, Germans, Russians, and Ottomans. Age of Empires III: War Chiefs then offer three more teams including The Aztecs, Sioux, and Iroquois. Finally Age of Empires III: Asian Dynasties adds an additional three teams the Indians, Chinese, and Japanese. 

[b]Hints:[/b]
If you actually want to enjoy this game make sure you edit your cities in order to get all the cards, as earning all the cards takes more than one lifetime. I have owned all three of these games before they were on steam and I put over +300 hours into it still to not have one civilization at maximum level. 

[b]Results:[/b]
If you enjoy real time strategy games, enjoy managing an economy, epic large battles, and don't like excessive micromanaging then this is the game for you. It offers brilliant combat with amazing scenery. The unit mapping is rather brilliant and the variety of maps keeps you constantly wanting to play more. 

Pros:
+Fun campaign with a rather interesting story (for a strategy game).
+High level of variability in teams
+Allowing for turtle or rushing player types
+Good difficulty curve in AI (allowing boosting resource harvest rates to find the best balance of difficulty)
+Each civilization is like a whole new game
+On map bonuses to give reasons for exploring and moving quick across the map.
+Brilliant strategy diversification with special tribal towns on each map type, and special mercenary units for each map. 
+Many different types of gameplay which keep the skirmishes from seeming repetitive. 
+Loads of cards to choose from allowing you to choose if you want to Turtle, Rush, or Support. 

Cons:
-Leveling civilizations is rather dull (just edit the text file)
-You cannot select your AI team members’ cards, which means they will just use resource cards, villagers, and soldiers (not team cards).
-Some civilizations seem unbalanced. (figure it out for yourself as we all have our views on this).
-Rather than producing names for the map choices they are named after states (which can be really hard to guess what type of map you will get if you're not familiar with US Geography).
-You can only have two teams in skirmish mode, which is really annoying if you used to like playing 2v2v2v2. 
-You cannot have repeat civilizations; this means there is only one England per map.",1393446317,1396279564,True,495,1,0.940426170825958252,20,True,False,False,76561198010180088,789,65,12094,414,2945,1602035968

A great game in the series. Age of Empires III brings enough new to the table to keep the Real Time Strategy fresh and interesting while keeping it familiar enough and easy enough for anyone to jump in. I fully recommend it, especially when it goes on sale. $40.00 on steam for the game and two expansions. If you have friends who are willing to try games outside the norm, this is a great game to play.

If you like the classic RTS style – that is building a base, collecting resources, amassing a giant army, and eventually crushing your opponent with massive amounts of soldiers – this is a great choice. It includes two expansion packs which extend the play time considerably. Graphics are a bit dated but look fine. You get a lot of game for your money and if you find it on sale don’t hesitate to buy. Single player missions are fun and somewhat varied in their objectives; it will take you a long time to finish.

9,9498755,english,"Okay let's get things straight, YES this game isn't as good as Age of Empires II but it is still a very good game and it does one thing that every other age of empires games did aswell and is a must for these games and that it's simply addictive, you will keep playing and having fun with it even due you might notice some faults with the game. First of I think we should care about the story, ECH I liked the previous AoE games (<--- I'm calling it that for now) how it was based about historical events. Here it's some made up crap about the black family I couldn't give less of. The war chief campaign is slighty better cause it focus on historical events more due it still also focuses on the black family thingy. But the best one is the Asian Dynasties campaign that is completey historical, YES. This is how the AoE games was meant to be sad that One out of three campaigns is what I was looking for :(. And oh you focus on one country in the main campaign another thing that the AoE games didn't do they focused on multiply countries and history oh well. Atleast the historical book is back so I'm ok. Anyway presentation, FANTASTIC! Yeah the cutscenes were meh for me but I love the enviroment and I love the small details. I love that you army cheers after killing a enemy or destroying a enemy building, I love that you alley replies of hoping that you be better then last time and also comment of playing the same map twice. And I love how great they went from 2d sprites to 3d models. Gameplay, this isn't easy, ok. First of all formations are gone instead they auto formating which isn't too bad but tell me, WHY DID YOU HAVE TO REMOVE THE STANCES!? In AoE II you could put your soldiers on stances for example aggresive following a enemy or defensive stance that attacks it but doesn't chase it forever and stand ground were they're not allowed to move so ranged guards would work. Why isn't it here!? I have to force my soldiers to constantley move to the right so I don't attack. And there's more things removed from previous AoE games I won't even touch. However there is some features I like first of all home city, I like that. Doesn't make you abuse the market when you're low on something but rather ask for things from your country and then spam the market :). And the abilities due underplayed I really liked the idea. And if there is both ninjas and cowboys in the same game IT'S BLOODY GOOD OK!? I also really like how diffrent the expansion packs are from one another. The war chief has the converting ability.... exclusively to him :( and focus more on the wilderness and the asian dynaties FORCES you to build wonders to age up <--- THAT'S AWESOME. However the main problem is that they did nothing new..... NOTHING. The online uses the old login thing to microsoft that it did in the back in the day which I'm not even sure if it works, you can't SHIFT+TAB ever while you play at all and you can't acces the ''Complete collection'' if you use the desk shortcut you have to go to your libary and click play and chose Asian dynaties and then you get the complete collection and if you pick the War chief one only get that. I still like this game, yeah it's nothing compared to 2, it had no changes and it's a little bit easier but I still say that it's worth it but I would recommend buying this whenever it's on sale if you're unsure.

= Graphics =
+ Water looks beautiful !
+ Ships are properly to scale -- they are BIG !
+ Physics for destroying buildings and units look great -- especially heavy artillery !
- Icons for buildings and units are extremely bland; ALMOST as bad as ""Ultima Online.""
- Every 3D model in game is ""fully lit"" making it hard to recognize things you CAN click on and things you CAN'T click on.  The artists didn't understand Contrast ratio nor S/N ratio -- it is TOO HARD to find when crates or bags of gold get delivered to your colony due to foreground objects blending into background objects.  See this excellent talk to understand how to do background + foreground + UI properly:
http://gdcvault.com/play/1015306/The-Art-of-Diablo

= Gameplay =
+ New card system is interesting
- You have to *grind* to unlock cards for EACH city and civilization  You can no longer select your civilization in multiplayer; you must first build a home city.   LAME.
- Teams are limited to 2 instead of 4 as in AoE2 so you can no longer have multiple, separate, computer teams.
- You can only reset your deck ONCE !?!? More grind-for-gear crap.
- Stone resource removed from the game. :-(
- Computer AI cheats like crazy in Hard and Expert. (See next post for details)

= UI =
* The default camera zoom is too close to the ground.  Change ""Camera Zoom"" to ""Very Far"" in ""Game Options"" to fix.
- Selecting a group no longer shows the individual health bars -- it is extremely hard to tell WHICH unit needs healing
- The UI chews up 1/3 of your screen (WHY??) unless you go into Options and turn on ""Enable Minimized UI.""  
- When you are unable to unlock a card the error message is too generic and doesn't tell you WHY.
- No ""TEAM"" icon next to cards to EASILY tell which cards benefit the team.
- Stupid default UI settings.  Why is ""Show Gathers per Resource"" OFF by default??
- The status bar at the top in AoE2 that was easy to read of resources summary has been moved to the clunky bottom UI where it blends in making it WAY too hard to read.
- Tooltips for buildings and units don't work if the item is in the queue.  *facepalm*
- There is no option to remember your password; 2013 and still no auto-login??
- Creating a multiplayer game with a password requires you press a retard ""Password Protected"" button IN ADDITION to typing in the password. Gee, how about using a -blank- password to determine if the game is password protected or not like every other online game??
- Can only have 9 groups instead of 20 in AoE2
- Can only have 50 units in a group instead of 75 as in AoE2
- Can only have 200 max population with no way to increase it.  This _IS_ 2013 and we have quad-core computers these days ... why can AoE2HD be patched to up the limit but this game can't?
- Hotkey for Flares was removed *sigh*
- You MUST _first_ create an ES Online account with the ORIGINAL game, THEN you can ""upgrade"" it with the Expansion.  LAME.
- The password box doesn't work in the original host game UNLESS you press the TAB key. LAME.

MS Support are a bunch of R.E.T.A.R.D.S.  I misspelt my ES Online name and there is no way to either rename or delete your account !?!?  WTF is this ... 1977 ?

Perhaps the historical era covered by the game and its heavy focus on gunpowder in later stages isn't as compelling, and the scenario editor (which played a big part in [i]Age of Empires II[/i]'s prolonged success) is a little more complicated to use.

34,8556140,english,"Do you like video games? Do you like RTSs? Do you like not having to have 300 apm to keep a constant stream of resources coming in? Then you will like AoE 3. If you don't go hardcore or of Asian descent and play strategy games like a casual (like me) then you will also like this game. What I mean is that the macro from Age of Empires II was VERY watered down in AoE 3. Sure you still need some form of it like all RTSs, but the amount has dropped very much so. And I LOVE gunpowder units. Nothing is more satisfying then seeing 100+ musketiers poppin caps in each other like this is Chicago. 

The addition of Home City shipments is another feature that I like. Basically you choose around 20 shipments (they are cards that you put into a deck and you pick new cards everytime you level your home city) gain experience from various actions and once you accumulate enough you gain the ability to call in a shipment to your town center. Cards are also Age related and most can only be used once. The cards can range from calling in military units, villagers, economic shipments and buildings, and upgrades for many different things. And some cards affect all your allies. There is a lot of different strats you can go with a deck.

As I mentioned earlier you have Home Cities for each civ. Basically when you first start the game you choose which Civilization you want to be, then you choose your home city name and your explorer name ( you can put any name you want for both, great feature ) then you go into a game. You gain exp as you finish games, gaining levels for your city. Then you can unlock new cards. Some cards are locked until later levels ( it goes something like 10>25>40 I think) but from what I have since they aren't that much better, still useful though. If you want to play a different civ you have to make another home city for them and can also name that anything you want, along with the explorer, starting back at level one ( Unless you play the DLC, for some odd reason you start at level 10 with 10 unlocks. So just play the Asian DLC since it has everything for the other one and the base game.) Each Civ has different cards available at the start and to unlock although about half are universal.

Onto the gameplay it is mostly the same as AoE 2. With the addition of Trade Routes and Native camps (which supply extra resources and unlocks special respectively) it adds some degree of map control. There probably was already map control on AoE 2 but I know little of how the meta is for it. If there was I'm sure trade routes and native camps add even more since the extra resources are a huge bonus ( They start off giving only Exp and can be upgrade 3 times with the last being a train, another feature I like. And the free exp is HUGE to getting early home shipment points) and natives can harass early on. Natives also don't add to pop limit but you can only train a certain amount. Having more than half of all the trade posts and native camps gives you the option to start a Trade monopoly victory, which gives you victory in 5 minutes if they don't destroy any trade posts/native camps, helps if the enemy is turtling hard. You also can only build one castle and thats from a shipment you get (Russians can build more I believe). And if the wagon it starts off as gets destory you don't get another. Stone was also removed as a resource. Also, cannons and muskets. Pretty much the two man things you will build, or at least for me. Still plenty of archers, cavalry, swordmen, pikemen, etc. A lot of civs have more than one special unit, and they aren't built from the castle only. The population cap is set at 200 and that has mixed feelings but I'm fine with it. The graphics are great even though I run it on low. Haven't played the campaign nor the multiplayer, just skirmishs.

Overall, a great game and a must buy for any RTS fan. Even if it is slightly watered down from AoE 2 the new additions to it and time setting are amazing, great gameplay, and good graphics.

40 dollars though? Damn, definitely worth at at any sales price, but who even buys triple A games over 30? Still worth it at 40.",1388853152,1389480377,True,57,0,0.792015492916107178,0,True,False,False,76561198061164063,144,25,2314,0,1838.0,1416047328

45,372902,english,"I was heartbroken to hear Microsoft disbanded Ensemble Studios.  I loved Age of Empires 1, 2, AND 3 but I loved 3 the most.  I still love AoE 3 and here's why:

First of all, the game has a good mix of ranged units vs melee vs cavalry vs Artillery.  Where other games usually boil down to ""create as many units as possible and overwhelm the enemy"", that kind of strategy doesn't really cut it in AoE 3.  You might win, but it'll take you far more resources to do so.  Judicious use of your forces will make them last longer and perform better.  

Secondly, the emphasis on the home cities gives you something to work for even between skirmish matches.  Normally, every skirmish would be completely isolated from the overall game, but by levelling up your home city, you can provide better ""shipments"" to your settlers in future games.

Third, and this is probably where most people diverge in their opinions: The explorer as a sort of ""hero"" unit, and various minor enemies to fight for bonuses along the way, gives the game more of Warcraft III feel to it.  Without these little distractions you would just grind your way to the 4th age, create mass amounts of units and slaughter the enemy every time.   Now you have a choice: do you want to chance fighting the bears to get that special unit?  Maybe if you attack those pirates the treasure will give you a nice boost?

Lastly: all the enemies have a nice personality to them that makes me enjoy crushing them and sometimes (with them as allies) makes me laugh at the way they choose to attack.  Others make me sad to have been put on the same team (Henry the Navigator, you wuss!)

Mostly though, the game has actually aged pretty well in my opinion.  I know the game is almost 9 years old now, but it still holds up as worth buying and worth playing.  That is just talking about the base game... there's 2 whole expansions in this package I haven't really gotten into!

84,7817406,english,"Pros :
This is absolutely a fun strategy time-sink. Many hours haven't even been logged on Steam for my current account due to owning two accounts with AoE3 on it. Since good RTS seem limited to Starcraft and Warcraft, I like more realism and history than a fantasy universe. The art and graphics (if that is your main focus) are beautiful. Units work create formations which I have always enjoyed in a RTS. Gathering materials is pretty basic, wood, gold, food, and balancing everything is not too stressful which is great for any strategy game. I also enjoy the way the different difficulties are set. Easy being easy enough to learn and still win and Normal seeming challenging. There is a sandbox mode which is great for people learning the game as well and dont wish to focus on combat.

For single player, Age of Empires 3 has a genius combination of history, customization, and RTS. I make myself sick of this game and even if I stop for a few months I WILL be back.

Cons (without bias) :
Let me start with the warning alert. Over and over you will hear this as long as you are being attacked and not watching that area. It causes me to mute my game when there are multiple battles. Not fun.
It seem frusturating laggy during combat and this is because of units being in formation. Getting used to a combination of different unit speeds makes you break up your selection. Being that realistic is not fun to a lot of people. Single player doesn't hold your hand during the ""tutorial"" portion. They expect you to know a bit about RTS already.
The ships are terrible in huge groups which they make up for in speed. This is for both you and the enemy so it may seem that they pop up on you very quickly.",1385694099,1388612050,True,15,0,0.628424465656280518,0,True,False,False,76561198018470470,581,14,4351,0,3016.0,1440716270

PRO: Immersive Map Editor (Very good thing), Nice Menu, Nice wood pier docks (w/dingys), and good Environmental decal such as the burning pile of wood (with that smoke effect wow amazing...)

CON: Units are not authentic nor is the whole gameplay; even though the campaign sought to deviate from actual history; at least make the factions in this and some units like George Washington and Simon Bolivar realistic in terms of quality 3D models. THERE ARE NO MODS TO FIX THESE EITHERl I scoured AOE heaven, etc. modding sites and they got some shitty mods (no offense; I look for historical qualities).

Bottom line: if you're just looking to play a game for fun and not care about if you're getting those good looking redcoats/prussian mercs/etc. just like in the actual Revolutionary War or any kind of quality then I recommend.

THIS WHOLE RANT IS ABOUT QUALITY AND LOOKS OF THE UNITS/DECALS

27,8349307,english,"Personally I never owned AoE3 growing up and coming to it later on I can say it has not aged particularly well.
Unlike the new AoE2:HD release, increasing the resolution unfortunately does not allow you to see more. Usually this is typical of competitive RTS games in order to keep the playing field even. Unfortunately how much is shown to you on screen is limited at best, especially when groups of units grow beyond the screen size, a particular issue when moving across a map with multiple unit types of varying speeds. 

AoE3 sports a more to-ground camera perspective causing vision to be obscured by walls or buildings to a far greater degree than the other AoE games. Not helping this is how the buildings are absolutely massive (houses are huge!) while this might make it seem like your town is more impressive than it is, navigating your town in a pinch can be very fiddly.

Combat is unbalanced and to be fair, pretty broken. units can be queued but are all produced on the same timer. For example you can make 1 musketeer, or 5 at once in the same time. This all but removes the need to spend any resources until you need them. Most games I find end very quickly both online and against a computer.

Unlike AoE3, the only realistic way to win is through combat, immeditae and unrelenting combat, removing a large portion of what an AoE game means to me. Naval combat has however improved significantly over previous installments, sporting a wide range of galleons and some very pleasing combat animations and damage manifesting visually through holes, masts falling and other immersive effects in constrast to AoE2's all-purpose flames.

Overall I cannot recommend this game however I can see how it could appeal to those looking for a more basic RTS than is typically offered by the AoE franchise.",1388186924,1388186924,False,13,0,0.522585868835449219,0,True,False,False,76561198022846896,1249,3,525,0,525,1377293049

40,8277258,english,"Age of Empires 3 is the third and (seemingly) final game in the Age of Empires series. If you  don't know already, it's a traditional real-time-strategy game set in the colonial and imperial ages of European history, with a little of flair of Asia for kicks. Although Age of Empires games traditionally feature a very strong campaign, the replay factor in AOE is always the multiplayer and skirmish options, and this time players are given a multitude of options to suit their gameplay preferences. As a ""turtle"" (high defense, weak offense) player, I especially like the ""treaty"" mode, which turns off combat for a set number of minutes at the beginning of each round and also forces players to build their base within a confined space during that time period. As with previous games in the series, AoE3 features 4 different ""age"" milestones that allow your civilization to access new technologies and units.

[u][b]The Good:[/b][/u]

* Trading cards enabled.

* Different civilizations, especially those from different continents, have entirely separate styles of play, giving the game different ""flavors"" of play and replayability.

* Rather than just giving each civilization unique units and technologies, AOE3 takes ""Uniqueness"" a step further by giving every play 21 ""bonus cards,"" which can be used to dramatically alter your play choices. Two players can conceivably play as the same civilization and require completely different strategies and playstyles due to the bonuses given to them by their cards.

* Vastly more multiplayer options than the predecessors in the series.

* Some Civs, such as the Sioux, are fairly simplistic. This is a positive attribute as it allows differently-skilled players to enjoy the game in their own way.

* There is a ""home city building"" side-game that is a little enjoyable.

[u][b]The Bad:[/b][/u]

* I feel like a game that supports 1000+ units on the screen and 1920x1080 resolution should let me zoom the map out a bit further. My town center annoyingly takes up way too much of my view!

* No Steam achievements.

* Antiquated map controls - the only way to scroll the map is by moving your cursor to the edge of the screen. RTS games should support WASD map scrolling and/or click 'n' drag.

* The final ""age"" is rarely ever needed in a match, and costs more than it benefits your team, in my opinion.

* Map-editing is nowhere near as easy and intuitive as it was in previous AOE games.

* Weak AI. It seems like a 1 vs. 1 AI opponent always focuses strictly on cavalry, which in turn focuses me to only focus on building one type of unit.


[u][b]The Ugly:[/b][/u]

* Horribly WRONG launcher screen. When starting the game, you are given the choice of loading (a) Age of Empires III: Complete Collection, (b) Age of Empires III: The War Chiefs, and (c) Age of Empires III: Asian Dynasties. However, option ""A"" is not complete at all: choosing it gives you access to [i]neither[/i] of the two expansions. Option B gives you access to the War Chiefs Expansion (but not Asian Dynasties), and Option C gives you access to ALL game content: the base game and both expansions.

* Not as fun as AOE2. A sequal should be a step forward, not a step back. The differences are noticeable in all sorts of small areas, which individually would not be a problem, but lend to an overall diminished quality. Some examples are unit formations being nowhere near as ""tight,"" and units having a tendency to WALK into battle if they are grouped with a slower unit.

[u][b]The Verdict:[/b][/u]

* At the time of this writing, the base price for AO3 is $39.99. That is overpriced, especially since AO2-HD is a more solid and overall better game and comes for the same base price. [i]However[/i], I do think AOE3 is worth checking out if you can get it on sale. I have had a lot of fun with this game, perhaps 100 hours or so, before it ever became available on Steam.

The Age of Empires series has always been a personal favorite of mine. Dating back to the first AOE I i've been always astonished by the overall gameplay experience this game delivers. The AI system is very well written and, depending on the difficulty, will always provide a challenge. This game is often compared to Starcraft II yet there is a lot of differences between them. In Starcraft I always found myself rushing and trying to be the best, and if you were bad at the game, you were in for a lot of stress. But in AOE players can find servers with their own skill level which makes this game one of my favorite strategy games. 

In my opinion, you don't HAVE to play online like most competitive games. This game actually has a very good Skirmish mode where you go against bots. It may seem boring but if you give it a chance, it will not disappoint you. As for aesthetics, the graphics are great considering it was a game made in 2009 but this is just a small factor since the game's mechanics draw you away from noticing. There is rarely glitches, units walk with great animation, and the battle scenes have you urging to see what team will win. 

The only downfall the game has is that there is no cross-platform multiplayer support and it lacks an intriguing storyline. It is common for an AOE game to have a blan or boring storyline. And you can see that when looking at its predecessors. But don't let this change your opinion. The game wasn't really made with a basis on heartwarming or intense storyline experiences but more of a play-with-friends or AI and just have a great time.

Overall, I wish they made a AOE 4. Their progression from each Age of Empires have only been big leaps in the gaming industry. But I will happily settle for AOE 3 and look forward to playing it many, many years from today. If you are in to strategy games like StarCraft, Warcraft, and Command & Conquer, this is no doubt a game worth adding to your arsenal!",1387408338,1387408421,True,1,0,0.458333343267440796,2,True,False,False,76561197983542721,263,2,1001,203,535,1601069027

The Pros:
-Extreme variation, so many units, all custom tailored to each of the many civs
-The home city system adds a persistent set of bonuses, many of which are interesting and unique
-Detailed buildings, cannonballs will actually knock beams and such off of an attacked building
-Infinite replayability, several campaigns, gamemodes and so on
The Cons:
-Multiplayer is sort of a pain to work out
-Balance is non-existent

So basically, if you want a fun strategy game with tons to do and see, this game is for you. If you are looking for competitive online matches, try Starcraft, because you will not see anyone playing this as an esport anytime soon.

72,7756205,english,"Age of Empires III was one of the few strategy games that I played through every campaign.  There are definatly some awful story lines and arcs (The entire 1st game), but you almost have to play it to make sure you get a good foundation for the first and second expansions.  

The main campaign has you following the story of one family from the turkish invasion of Malta too finding settling the west.  A ton of liberties are taken with history in this campaign(Defeating a russian army in the wilderness...).  Ultimately you find yourself in a base building spree attempting to defeat your enemies.  Some variance in mission structure is provided throughout the game to make it a little more interesting.

If you only had 10 hours though I would start on the second campaign, which follows the son of one of the first members of the family.  As you play as the native american you actually engage in the history of the era's that the game represents.  There are some memorable battles such as Trenton, and Little big horn(!) to relieve during the expansion, and it definatly makes it worth it to stick it out.

But, then there is, 'The Asian Dynasties,' which I looked at and said, ""How could they link these two games together in one cohesive story?""  The answer is they don't!  And really for the better as each campaign follows seperate leaders as they conquer, explore, or rebel against their enemies.  Ultimately I feel like the AOE series saved one of my favorite campaigns for last in the Indian one.  In the indian campaign you play as a soldier who must choose between military loyality and nationalism for his home land.  The resulting campaign is fun and gives you some level of purpose on building up bases and fighting your enemy.

77,7751611,english,"I had forgotten just how good this game was. Like many people i'd bought it years ago, only to find my playing days cut short thanks to it being incompatible with Windows Vista onwards. Not any more! I can confirm the Steam version works perfectly on my Windows 8.1 Pro 64-bit system.

Fans of the first two games will immediately be able to dive straight in, although there have been some major changes in the third installment compared to the first two. Firstly there's not so much emphasis on micro management now. Instead you get to concentrate on the exploration and battle elements, which makes this game the most enjoyable of the three. Secondly there is the new home city section which allows you to ship units and supplies to the new world during the game. Between games you can customise your home city to change which units and supplies can be sent out to you, along with the appearance of the city itself.

Visually this game absolutely trounces the two previous games, and indeed almost any other game in the genre, it is graphically amazing. Sound-wise it's not much different to the first two, with the sound being good but not excellent, and not too intrusive. The campaign isn't too difficult, so the greater challenge will come from skirmish games (rather like Age of Mythology... indeed all previous comparisons to the first two Age of Empires games also apply to Age of Mythology).

If you did not have this game before, you really owe it to yourself to buy it now that the compatibility problems have been sorted out and it works fine on Windows 8, 7 and presumably Vista as well. If, like me, you already had this game but could not play it because of those compatibility problems, well i can now confirm that those problems have been solved!

Takes place in the times of exploration, which is a nice departure from ancient times.

The simplification of some game features were hit or miss, some were niceties, others just are too simple. An example of one that was a miss was the removal of individual farm squares, and collection buildings, although it can be assumed that it is automated, it still seems too simple.

Has a nice variety of units, although, the crossbowmen seem kind of weaksauce when I got Janissaries with guns and cannons so big they can be used for artillery. Its let hack and slash, blow for blow of some other strategy games, and more so the style of ""you mess up, you just might die"".

As civilizações são realmente muito distintas umas das outras, cada qual com sua árvore evolutiva própria, o que permite aproveitar o game a partir de várias possibilidades de combates diferentes.  Interessante é que ainda hoje ele possui gráficos muito bons. Ademais, é possível achar na net sites com mapas, campanhas, civilizações e outros mods que acrescentam bastante conteúdo free.

55,4862137,english,"Ensemble Studios has always developed very great games. This one is no exception. This game out of the whole series has the best story-line that you will find out of every Age of Empires game released to date. That may be taken lightly when you take into consideration the past games that they have released. It is much more in depth than prior games released but it still hold a fairly strong story-line based primarily in the colonial days of course.I personally believe that this game was designed mostly towards the multi-player or skirmish modes. 

The multi-player mode takes you online to a RTS (real time strategy) game where its do or die! With a small but dedicated cut-throat community you dont know who you'll end up running into face to face. With hundreds of customizations towards several very unique civilizations you'll basically never run out of things to upgrade. For a dedicated RTS PC player this is a must buy. With options to upgrade your calvery, infantry, and even ballistic attack units there is too much room for any possibility to happen. When all hope seems lost you or your teammate makes a sudden dash for the enemies TC (town center) and then all is well and victory nis yours. For me, there is nothing better  than inflicting a crushing blow to your enemy and watching his economy collapse from the heavy beating you just put on them. The ranking stucture is strict but very precise. If you're a level 6 private than sticking to people level 0-11 is probably your best bet. Theres more to the game than just ground units. You have the option to form a navy that will rival the famous Queen Elizabeth's navy. 

The game has a beautiful but dated graphics engine that will please most gamers of this generation. Personally, I'm not here for that reason. I'm here for gameplay. With that said I must say that this Age of Empires game satisfies my RTS desires. If this game is on sale buy it! If it's regular price then I advise you to BUY IT.

Pros: 
-Smooth crisp gameplay
-nice detail/smooth graphics
-Great gameplay mechanics/in depth customization

Cons:
-Limited in game population cap
-Smaller online community

Connecting a multiplayer game across the web is an absolute nightmare; I host my own Minecraft and Terraria servers all the time, but this game refuses to cooperate for more than two people.

I enjoy this game so much only if I am playing LAN games with my classmates. It is always a good idea to make a match VS bots ( expert ) or you go 3 VS 3 with your friends and listen to their rage if their base are getting pwned .

My favorite team is France ( Obviously :P ) but I think other teams are also nice, you know, each has their own weakness and such. So, you can basically counter each other if you pick  well. Graphics are okay , knowing the game is out for quite a while now.

I have tried story modes, they are just okay, not as fun as playing Lan with friends. And, why do I write this review ? Oh yes, because I am bored :p

I had multiple nights playing 4-5hrs in one single game is insane. If your thinking of getting this game..trust me is worth it. It takes some time to get used to but the community will help you along the way. Can you imagine playing 8 players in a map and all of them are real players?
