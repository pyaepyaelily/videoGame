13,Mafia II Definitive Edition,77094851,english,"This game is one of the best in the genre. A great story that you for sure will remember and make you believe you're in some Godfather movie. No other developer ever got close to Hangar 13's depiction of ""The Family Life""

However this remaster unfortunately is probably the sloppiest work I've ever seen. When even the classic version runs better, sounds better and looks better. Hear me out, here. This ""remaster"" mainly added higher resolution textures. But nothing else to it. Increasing the size of the game from 7GB to 40. For no good reason at all. The textures while they do look great, looks completely out of place to the rest of the world of Empire Bay and everyone in it. During a conversation you still see NPC's to your left that is completely untouched or re-textured.

Especially noticable on the landlady in Joe's building. You will find her character everywhere, as well as the ""Red Fox"" call-girl that shows up pretty much everywhere. Reused assets constantly. Even though this happened in the classic, it's a bit disappointing that no thought were gone into fixing things like this.

What makes the game even worse is all the bugs. It's been out for a while now and very little has been done to eliminate things that never even existed in the Classic version at release. Misaligned cameras, assets clipping (Such as wearing your hat around your throat instead of on your head) Glitching AI that seems more interested in the wall than actually apprehending you. Especially noticable during the robbery where the Irish interrupts you. When escaping from the police, they don't even exit the stairwell to the roof before you shimmy across the billboard. I had to kill them and reload twice, before I got the prompt to shimmy across. And I had to enter the stairwell and blow away the cops that seemed more interested in inspecting their shoes and the wall instead of attempting to chase us.

Another mission where the AI's aim is so good you won't even make it to the first intersection that is about 20 yards in front of you when you start the mission. I did make to the second a few times before I gave up. Restarted the whole mission just to try to get a faster car before exiting the compound after the first meeting with the Chinese.

Everything, even the game play is completely broken in comparison to the classic version of this game while looking old, still at least look homogenous. No textures stand out too much to make it look like it doesn't belong there. Which unfortunately they do a lot here.

There is nothing definite with this version of the game. It's the most disappointing remaster I have ever come across. Not even the PhysX effects work as they should, leading you to delete the folder for clothes for them to at least use the basic ones that Hangar 13 implemented to even work. Unfortunately meaning only YOUR clothes will have some kind of physics while everyone else will look like they came from the original game released 2002. How this ever passed to release is something I will never understand. They should have made a proper remake of it just like they did with the first one. And released it afterwards. I'm happy I got the game for free, courtesy of owning the original game on Steam. At least I didn't lose any money on this. Because it sure feels like a loss. Just buy the original and play through that instead.

Another glitch I forgot to mention is the sound. The volume of the conversations aren't on par with each other. One line will play super loud while another will force you to increase the volume to even hear them speak. A lot of other conversations doesn't play at all.

I won't even bother playing 3 because it was bad enough on the initial release, I don't care what definitive has to offer there haha. Moving on.. Mafia II was the bang for the buck I was looking for. Everything was perfect. Story, physics, your advancement in the game and feelings of reward. Enough free-roaming to keep you entertained. Only qualm is after you beat it, there's no *continue in free roam* option so it's just ""chapter select"" from then on, which works fine.

Graphics, also great. I did find that the game performs outrageously (low fps) on High physx, with zero difference while using Medium physx -- specific to some areas, i.e. points within the distillery mission.. Using an overclocked 2070 super on my i9-9900kf @ all core 5.0ghz.. I do consider this likely is just another case of crysis-tessellation but either way, visual appearance doesn't change at Medium and I can maintain my steady 144fps now. All other settings @ high seem to be OK

To note as well, Mafia: Definitive Edition (the first installment) was very glitchy, wasn't super impressed. But between the two, I consider my purchase worthwhile. As also already said, I won't be bothering with 3, and I might say YMMV on that one, but I don't think it will xD

30,Mafia II Definitive Edition,76998099,english,"Mafia 2: DE. A game developed by Hanger 13 and D3T Studios and Published by 2K Games.

If you're familiar with my Mafia: DE review, you know basically what i'm gonna say here. The Mafia trilogy are up there amongst my favourite of this genre, The grit and violence means they are a cut above the rest, And debatable whether Mafia 2 or 3 reigns as the best of the series in my opinion. I would like to mention here, that i don't quite recall quite what  was available in the original rendition of Mafia 2, So i will be trying to review this as its own title entirely.

Story: 8/10
Having already played Mafia 2, and knowing the ins and outs of the story, the twists and turns in it still captivated me this time around. You play as Vito Scaletta an up and coming criminal in 1940's ""Empire Bay"" which is essentially just a soft rework of New York of the period. You are busted for some low end crimes and begin the game in service of the army. Upon leaving service you meet up with long time friend Joe Barbaro and your first steps toward becoming a ""Made Man"" begins. I rated this story so highly not because it isn't a cliche mafia story full of betrayal and intrigue.but because of how fleshed out Vito is as a character. His background, his interests and his personality are all almost readily apparent and begin to develop as the game progresses. I would also like to mention that this game pulls no punches. It's filled to the brim with racism, violence and sex. This adds to the realism of the era's grit and immerses you but its by no means for the faint of heart.

Gameplay: 8/10
+ Movement: A slight increase in mobility from the first game, Vito moves fairly smoothly around the world, his ability to vault short obstacles and that's position on the controller (I play 3PS games with a controller because it allows you to move slower in stealth) makes alot more sense and is far less clunky than it was in the first game. This doesn't mean its without flaws though, Vito still has a hard time navigating tight areas and often will ""take cover"" against completely irrelevant surfaces and get shot in the face because of it.

+ Gunplay: The gunplay here is hard to argue with, the guns feel effective and powerful and sound completely immersive, When you heart people belting out full mags of a tommy gun into the cover you're hiding behind and you hug it hard because you know peaking will clean your clock.

+ NPC/World Interactions: While the world isn't exactly ALIVE. Because the game takes place in Episodes across a 10 or so year gap, the world changes quite rapidly. But even so, each individual experience is full so to speak with people to talk to, and people living their lives, and you can really feel that as you run and drive Empire Bay's streets. My only qualm is that police seem completely disinterested with the NPC's breaking laws and only focus on you. It would add to the experience if police pulled people over occasionally.

+ Driving: While NOT as immersive as the completely remastered Mafia DE, Mafia 2 DE is still quite a solid driving experience, the cars react like you would imagine they would to the certain environmental effects, rain and snow. But also smashing the rear of you car, leaves quite a significant dent in that spot which was a nice touch.

+/- Fist Fighting: I couldn't decide if this was a positive or negative. Perhaps its both, perhaps its neither, But seeming it takes up a large portion of the game time, I have to mention it. It's great to see the mechanic where you get locked into fist fights with groups, shakes things up from the whole run and gun gameplay, But its not done particularly well here. Its pretty hard to monitor what your opponent is going to do and because Vito isn't particularly agile, he seems to get smacked in the face quite frequently.


- Difficulty: This game is easy. Far too easy even on the hardest difficulty, I don't recall it being so easy the first time i played it through but this time it was a breeze, i wish there was a realistic difficulty where gun shots actually took their effect on you, slowed you down, made your aim weaker etc. But unfortunately the overall difficulty was mild.

- Mission Diversity: One of the things that makes these kinds of games captivating is taking part in a lot of different experiences, The first game pulled this off amazingly. The 2nd..Not so much. There isn't a lot happening here, beyond driving from here to there and fight off waves of enemies until you reach your objective. A strong dynamic for sure, but it gets boring by the 10+ hour mark.

Visuals: 5/10
I was hoping for more, from the definitive edition, the touch ups weren't enough to warrant replaying the game. The game still suffers from what it always has, graphical glitches to make your character and the characters your talking to look completely broken or animations completely broken, breaking the total immersion as a whole. The remaster was almost completely irrelevant. The game is extremely graphically glitchy, in fact the first mission i played i jumped out of the cinematic car, and a woman was half way through the concrete of the footpath. Not a great experience. Surely without a doubt though on a mid to high end PC this game ran flawlessly high frames, Which i would expect no less because much of the world is still geometrical.

Audio: 7/10
Its hard to rate the audio bad here, apart from a few audio glitches that occurred frequently at the start of the game, completely loss of sound in 1 ear on my headphones or crackling as people talk, or completely cutting out entirely. But the soundtrack and audio here was expertly done back in the day, and were made to seem aged even then, It doesn't suffer in the slightest, if nothing else i feel as though it might have helped the immersion.

Overall: 8/10
Mafia 2 was a trophy winner of its time, perhaps the best Mafia game ever made (Up for debate with 3) but the Definitive Edition didn't bring much to the table, the game suffers from what it always suffered from, graphically and gameplay wise, But now suffers from its aged graphics and a new slew of audio concerns. I received this game as a freebie as many who owned the original did, But its really not any different from its original experience. Other than a very limited assortment of face touch ups to make it not seem as old as it is. A worth while experience for the sake of the trilogy but if you are after the same dedication here as the first games Remaster was, you're going to be sorely mistaken. For the price of $70 AUD for the DE trilogy though, i would warrant that price seemingly it included a full remaster, a rework and all the DLC's.",1601773015,1601773191,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,1219,55,806,806,806,1601728703

56,Mafia II Definitive Edition,76866242,english,"My favorite Mafia game so far (have not finished the og M1 due to it being real clunky these days and because of M1 DE). Has it all imo that it needs to have to be an amazing mafia game. A good story, wtiting (though these two kind of fall appart in the final 3 chapters due to it feeling really rushed with a bit of an abrupt end which is kinda meh) and acting. Great soundtrack. Still some great graphics (for a 2010 game) and physx is always a plus in my book (and the default destructible environments are real nice too and better than any other mafia game by far). The open world is also the best in any mafia game with different types of stores all around the city and side jobs which makes this city feel way more alive than any other mafia game (especially 3...). I also prefer the gunplay and overall feel of the gameplay in this game to the others, even M1 DE in some aspects. My only gripe may be that there is a bit too much just driving around throughout the game for me. Even though it is a part of the series, it gets a bit old sometimes. But why do I not recommend it? Oh i tell you why.

Definitive edition my ass! All of the above is pretty much true for both versions, but there are things that I encounter in this one that I have never encountered in my numerous playthroughs of the classic version. Sure, some minor bugs still carry over (which may be acceptable to some, not me but they do not really get in the way), but there are a couple of GAME BREAKING bugs in this version. I have had to restart 3 chapters because the final mission ""locks"" up and wont let me progress and crashing a couple of times. I have also encountered numerous dialogue scenes in cars that are broken where every person in the car speaks at the same time making it impossible to understand what anyone is saying. Also the physx effects are downgraded and you need to go into the config files to even unlock some of the missing features. 

Beyond the audio and game glitches, there are a couple of visual bugs too. Some effects even seem like bugs but they are meant to be like that (Lights in the tunnels being blinding and not in a realistic or good way). Performance is also really odd. Sure, the physx looks amazing to this day and the graphics are nice, but 18 fps on a pretty powerful machine is not acceptable. The graphical upgrades are not close to being good enough to warrant the performance impact that it has.

So all in all. Mafia 2 is a great game imo, but Mafia 2 Definitive Edition is an overpriced and inferior product to Classic. If you want to play an amazing game, buy Mafia 2 Classic for cheaper. Definetly not a perfect game, but I still even to this day have alot of fun with the game. But stay away from this edition of it. A true disappointment to all fans of the series.

90,Mafia II Definitive Edition,76726368,english,"holy shit, I bought the trilogy for like 60 euro decided to play through all of them since I never played one but did have them on my want to play list.

The first one of the remasters was amazing to me. it looked like it was made today and even playing it on medium setting the city still looked amazing, from models ,lip sync expressions and the story was great. I played through that game in 3 days and might attempt to do another run at it on classic since I gave up on it at the racetrack and the armour vehicale chase.

now to come from 1 to the remaster of 2 it felt like a gut punch. as soon as I saw the menu I was confused thinking it didn't change to 1920 x1080 since the text was still somewhat pixelated to then find out it was on that setting. the menu background looked just bad as well like it were all low LOD and the textures were compressed. starting the game and I was even more befusseld, it looked dated like it came out around 3th console generation but like early of that the animation was stiff, textures looked just low, now I was playing it on medium settings thinking i'd be somewhat heavy for my pc since I played the first remake like this but it looked just aweful. I really didn't want to believe some of the reviews here saying it looked just like the original but it does, even when I changed it to highest settings I could. I had textures constantly disapear as I just stood next to it, items just appear out of no where 5 meter before me, and then I met the AI I didn't get too far but I had to escort some lady to my car but she refused to turn the corner and kept walking back to the doorframe of her house to get stuck there. at that point I just quit the game. 

I tried to give myself the mindset that this is an old game from 2010 to fight the feeling that it came out THIS YEAR but It's not right. I don't recommend it",1601319311,1601319311,FALSE,1,0,0.4710145,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,408,21,109,109,109,1601318622

92,Mafia II Definitive Edition,69458972,english,"Mafia II: Definitive Edition is an updated release, a HD remaster, of an already HD game that features enhanced models, textures, changes to lighting and the sound engine of the game. The game does look nicer at in motion. Some changes, like the greasy hair and the somewhat shinier eyes do look a bit strange, and I have noticed a few interesting artifacts with the Ambient Occlusion implementation, but generally, the game does look nicer. The nicer graphics don't necessarily explain the fact the download size of the game is nearly 5 times larger than the original, or the performance hit, but generally, the game does look nicer. As an owner of the original PC version of Mafia II on Steam, I received this version for free, while still keeping the old version in my library, which is a big plus (unlike Rockstar and the 'Complete' Edition of GTA IV that replaced the originals completely).

BUT, there are some issues with this re-release, starting with the first thing you see when you launch the game; the launcher is pointless. When I adjusted my settings so it would run in 1080p Borderless, when the game loaded up, it was rendering out at 480p full screen, but in a 1080p frame, so the game was in a tiny corner of my screen, and I had to navigate and change the options through the in-game options menu to get it running in the correct resolution. After getting the game to run 1080p, Borderless, Maximum settings (minus MSAA, which I ran at 4X and Vignette and Chromatic Aberration off because those effects are bad on a good day), I immediately saw they had re-done the pre-rendered cutscenes. Not just an upscaling, but they had re-done from scratch. The pre-rendered scenes look quite a bit better and might run at a higher framerate as well (which might explain the file size increase somewhat). Then the game crashed. After re-launching, Borderless Windowed Mode no longer worked, and when I tried running it through the options menu, the game threw up a load of messages about Nvidia Apex/PhysX, which is still in this version, but significantly gimped, and with no clear option to enable or disable the effects. Also, despite setting it to skip the launcher, every time I restarted, the launcher would load up first.

Once I got back onto the game, now in Fullscreen instead of Borderless, it loaded the in-game cutscene, and the audio was only going through my left ear on my headset. In-game cutscenes are mono on my setup, not pre-rendered, not actual gameplay, but the in-game scenes are. The shooty shooty bang bang part ran just fine, and audio was normal. The next in-game cutscene also ran in mono. Then the train station cutscene ran normally, then the in-game drive down the hill ran normally, and then the bar cutscene ran in mono. I was able to fix this by changing the in-game audio option to stereo and restarting the game.

Once I got to run around, I saw that the cloth physics were removed. This is disappointing, I have a Nvidia GPU so I was hoping these physics extensions would still work, considering that some PhysX particles are clearly still present, but they are not. Consequently, because some PhysX effects seem to be forced on, there may be a performance hit on AMD GPU's but I do not know for certain so take this statement with a grain of salt. Lacking the full PhysX effect experience has no impact on the actual gameplay, but it is a visual feature that is missing from the Definitive Edition that belies the idea this is the Definitive Edition for some players. Also, note that I did not run the game at an unlocked frame rate, so I can't comment on whether or not they fixed the bugs caused by running at over 100 FPS, such as the slow-motion glitch. Reading around suggests they have fixed them, but I cannot confirm that right now.

Graphically, as mentioned, the remaster is a mixed bag. Faces have benefited the most, but the eyes and hair look a little strange sometimes, appearing far shinier than they did originally. Artwork is generally of a higher resolution, pre-rendered cutscenes are completely rebuilt from scratch to use higher quality assets and run at a higher resolution and framerate. Lighting changes, such as sun effects and shadows have changed, with a stronger Ambient Occlusion process (with mixed results), higher quality shadows, including better actor self-shadowing, and a draw distance that seems to be further pushed back than it was before. The game generally looks better, although some of the artistic changes might throw you off.

Audio-wise, the soundtrack is apparently equal to what was in the base game in 2016, down 16 music tracks from the original release, some of which are on the better known side of soundtrack as well. It's far from what could be a definitive release, not quite on the same level as GTA IV, or the current state of the original Mafia if you buy it on Steam now, but that's little comfort. You are not getting the full original soundtrack experience. Apparently, some further tracks are also missing from the Joe's Adventures DLC pack, but I can't verify that myself, as I don't really want to play this version of Mafia II any further due to those technical issues. There is a mod to re-add the missing music, but you shouldn't have to mod a game to get the original intended experience. Audio mixing, by my ear, sounds a bit off in some places. Some sound effects have been replaced with higher quality assets that again I think work quite well but sound mixing seems off, even after I fixed the mono sound in some of the cutscenes, something still seemed off compared to what I was expecting to hear, as though the sound mixing in-game was wrong, with loud effects playing too quietly, something that does not occur in cutscenes, where instead it seems to lean a lot on my left speaker channel.

Overall, I can't recommend playing this version over the original. It does look nicer, but there are too many issues that make the Definitive Edition an inferior edition to the original version, which is still in your library and included in this versions purchase (or on GoG). Play the classic version instead. It doesn't look far worse (Mafia II still looks quite good) and suffers from far fewer bugs. Because this is a remastered compilation, it doesn't add anything, so you aren't missing out on any additional content unless you want to play the DLC mission packs (which aren't very good to be honest), and the original might not crash as often either.

Mafia II is a great game; the remaster is not the best way to play if you just want to play the game. The new version does not make a good game bad by any means (granted, I stopped playing before the end of hour two because I had enough of having to stop, drop out, tweak and come back to get the damn thing to work), but it is a sub-par re-release. Fortunately, unlike Rockstar, 2K aren't forcing you to use this version if you don't want to and unlike Rockstar's 'Complete Edition' mess, there are actual improvements that can be mentioned. The original release still works perfectly as long as you keep under 100 FPS on modern operating systems, it's also a HD game with a far smaller install size. There are too many drawbacks to truly call this game a definitive release. The classic release is included in this package, unlike GTA IV now, so I would recommend playing that version instead if you've never played Mafia II before.",1589952577,1601295617,FALSE,45,4,0.772146642,3,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,704,44,86,0,86,1589956920

97,Mafia II Definitive Edition,69956176,english,"For someone who owned the original mafia 2 and finished it 5 or so years ago finding the definitive edition sure was a pleasant surprise. This was and still is my favourite game of all time just because of the story and simple yet remarkable mechanics the game has to offer. 

When I saw the screenshots of the definitive edition I was disappointed at first and wished for a bigger overhaul, but now after spending 10 hours completing the main story and driving around selling cars I am happier with this outcome than I would be with the kind of the graphical improvement Mafia 1 is getting. This style of a ""remaster"" was one of the greatest things that could happen to a 10 year old game that still looked incredible 5 years ago. Except of the few graphical improvements everything has stayed the same and thank God for that. 

The story has to be the biggest selling point of Mafia 2. It was such a blast replaying some of the most remarkable moments I have experienced in gaming story wise. The incredible and most loved characters like Joe and Vito have a huge impact on why the game is so brilliant story wise. Mostly all of the missions were unique and interesting but have to say the follow missions were a pain in the ass especially because of the speed limit we are forced to obey. I'm not going to spoil the ending but the cliff hanger it leaves on is so well done and thought out it had me shook and made me want to find out more about the story and find an answer to the question the game leaves us with. The overall amount of time it took me to finish the story was about 8 hours which makes more sense as the missions are unique. This is better than Mafia 3 where they extended the story by 10 hours just making the player do the same thing over and over again. I haven't completed all of the DLC content but I am planning to in the near future which will extend the playtime without making the game boring as shit. 

The difficulty level is somewhat challenging even on medium as you don't have much health and the enemies use automatic weapons which could kill you just in a few shots. The game wasn't frustrating because of it but made it more fun and a bit of a challenge which I really enjoyed. 

I experienced some minor bugs and glitches but most were rare and mostly were related to character's faces and clothes. I experienced an optimisation issue which was sudden frame drops which should not happen when using the hardware I use. Some were caused by automatic v-sync which was turned on for some reason but for some stutters I couldn't see why they were happening as they even happened when I tried playing the game on low settings. 

In conclusion, this is a must-play for anyone who has any interest in this genre not only in video games but also movies. If it wasn't for the DLC i wouldn't recommend buying the game for the full price but for all the DLC content and the main story paying £25 is a bargain. Personally, I can't wait what Mafia 1 is going to offer after finishing this game.

Mafia series is without a doubt my personal favorite series of all time and I was very happy when the Definitive Edition Trilogy remaster was announced. The game follows its first part with the authentic and entertaining story, great gameplay and nice graphics/soundtracks. The music in this game is truly amazing. Especially if you are into mobster content as I am. In comparison to other open world games, Mafia is different. The game is built around the missions you're doing and the focus is on the story, which is definitely a plus to me.

My friends can attest to this.The Remaster of mafia 2 is, odd, to say the least, some textures got updated, most notably the roads and the character textures, as well as some more minor elements and Clemente's slaughterhouse seems to have gotten a bit of a repaint too. Main Character models are way more detailed than the classic mafia 2 ones, and some voices of some minor characters have changed, like the soldier's in the intro mission.Markers, markers for enemies on hard mode have been removed, thats for gang members, cops are still visible on the minimap. Lighting has been changed as well, but nothing impressive by any stretch. There are also new gun sounds, which are very pleasant to hear. I honestly have no idea why this needed a remaster, you get some minor graphical upgrades and some postfx options and sounds, but besides that there is nothing to this remaster. Its mafia 2, but with a price hike.

54,Mafia II Definitive Edition,75874677,english,"Mafia II is a remastered edition of the classic game, including better framerates and better visual fidelity. The game tells the story of Vito Scaleta and his best friend Joe, with their rise through the mafia ranks; without spoiling too much, Mafia 1 & 2 have some of the best story-telling in previous generations, with the first game being fully remade later this year. 

The game takes place in Empire Bay, with a semi-structured open world modeled after New York, Chicago and Los Angeles. The game takes place over the time period of the 1940’s & 50’s, with great attention to detail within the world ranging from the architecture, cars and music. The game is told in Chapters with structured missions, controlling Vito in a third person perspective.

If you have not played Mafia II before it is well worth playing, some have been complaining about this edition only being a remaster, but it is still a fantastic game. This game's price point IS £24.99/$30-35. Depending on your taste for these types of games, it may be worth waiting for a sale; also, the game is free to you on steam if you own the classic version already.

Mafia II was one of the finest games of the last generation, I highly recommend picking it up at some point.

It starts out feeling like it has real promise, but I feel they must have run out of time or budget because by the end I was rolling my eyes and checking the clock.

Frequent game breaking bugs forcing restarts, baffling exclusions like no shooting from cars (when every other character in the game can), characters ranging from forgettable to irritating, predictable story, dull writing, loads of loose ends, no real sandbox, tedious speeding fine mechanic (yes, this was in the first game and no I didn't like it there either), risible AI (especially in cops who forget you exist when you walk around a corner, or your AI companions who I don't think got a kill all game), meaningless money and customisation options which are reset frequently throughout.

A lot of people seem to praise the story and writing of this one to the hilt, but frankly I'd prefer they just go back to ripping off Goodfellas if this is the best they can do on their own. I'd really be interested to see if anyone can list five personality traits of five characters from this game. I felt like I'd barely interacted with people my character was treating as a mortal enemy. I was utterly indifferent to people he treated like a best friend.

I don't really bother to write negative reviews, if I don't like a game I don't usually finish it, but after grinding along to the end of this grudgingly out of sunk cost fallacy, liking it less and less as I went on, I was just so annoyed I had to moan a bit.",1599687051,1599688682,FALSE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,464,2,902,0,889,1599689166

Cons

- 5 times the size of the original
- FPS Drops
- The price seems like some kind of joke, this is a 2010 cashgrab remastered, why would you even bother?
- It has a lot of bugs that the original had
- I had some softlocks
- Broken NPC movement, they are more robotic and bugged than the original version

Neutral

- Custom FPS support (Something I could do with RivaTuner in 30 seconds, but it's fine I guess?)
- Some added graphical options which it wasn't necessary as well; but maybe it's fine for someone who has a gt 1030 with a 3rd gen i3?
 

Pros

- It has a newer ambient oclusion which is nice (HBAO)
- Temporal SMAA and MSAA x8
- Some better textures
- Improved facials
- High refresh rate improved
- More consistent FPS
- At least they gave it for free if you had the original

48,Mafia II Definitive Edition,74701041,english,"Even though I received this game for free, and I enjoyed my time playing it, it’s still not worth recommending. I had read some reviews and seen that people were having trouble with the game running, crashing, and other graphical issues. I had only had one graphical problem and I thought it was funny so it didn’t bug me. That was until I got to the last quarter of the game and everything just decided to stop working. The game would crash, drop to about 20 frames, the world wouldn’t load, characters saying their dialog lines at both the same time and repeating them over and over again. 

It’s a real shame because I had a great time playing the game until the last parts. The story is something that I haven’t experienced in a game. It’s like playing a gangster movie and all the jobs they get are missions and first jobs are easy. As you play more the jobs start getting harder and things don’t always go as planned as usual. I loved how it was like playing through a movie and the soundtrack helps get you into the right atmosphere. It’s a big plus that it doesn’t share songs in Fallout. At least all the times I was listening to the radio I didn’t hear a single song I heard from another game that tries to use old vintage songs.

The gameplay is fun but there is a lot of driving. At first, the driving is great because it gives you time to get to know characters and there are a couple of funny conversations. By the 10th mission, you will be getting tired of driving every place you go. The missions and the tasks you have to do for people make you feel like a gangster. The game does a good job of telling you what it’s like to get into the Mafia and the lifestyle of those in it. The gun sections can be a little difficult which is good. I played on medium difficulty and there were plenty of times I died because I trying to spray and run through. Its that difficulty that’s just hard enough to make you stop and think of an approach but it won’t take you more than a couple tries if you die.

If the game was more functional I would give this game a thumbs up but sadly we live in a time where games we buy aren’t even completed on release. I never got around to playing the original/classic version but I’ve heard that if you can get your hands on it, its the better version. That is all.

Release Date: 19 May 2020

*Note that I did not play for 2 hours as I was offline for most of the time, it was near 8 hours instead*

Pros:
The Mafia franchise has had its highs and lows and this, is at its peak, if we only consider Mafia II and not the definitive edition that is. The story is rich and although it is increasingly unrealistic to go guns blazing, that serves as a fun entry point for those who are new to the Mafia series. Maintaining its grittiness and your frustration at cops chasing you for speeding and so on. Yes, cops do matter in this game surprisingly. That aspect allows you to play in a more realistic manner aside from the shooting and explosions and that cops do give you a sense for needing to stay in the shadows and to blend in with 1940s and 1950s American society as an Italian immigrant. The story itself makes sense, the characters make sense, the dialogue makes sense and so rather than immersing you in a game such as Mafia II, it more so immerses you into a movie. Every cutscene and action from the original deals like an award winning film featured from the 70s or 80s and could be comparable to greats such as The Godfather and more modern takes such as The Irishman.

Cons:
The definite edition offers an extension pack to you for free. A ****load of bugs, glitches and optimization issues. Luckily, most optimization issues have been fixed except for the random crashes whilst bugs and glitches could range from Vito ""getting up"" by punching his feet through the bed and eyes pointed in a very unnatural direction during cutscenes. Textures and and coat clippings were also found annoying amongst the populace but I guess it was expected for since it was Hangar 13's job to remaster a timeless game. As they have done a poor job with Mafia III alone, they brought that inexperience into Mafia II purging of anything that is good in the game.

Verdict:
If this was a review about the classic Mafia II, this game would have gotten a higher score, but since it isn't, there isn't much to say before giving it a awfully weak,

67,Mafia II Definitive Edition,74198593,english,"A classic, fantastic game at the time of release (original Classic version) with a good story, rich characters, comedic elements, a bunch of cars with their own characteristics, a beautiful city, and for the most part very enjoyable.
Reviewing this in 2020 as the DE version, it's surprisingly limited in terms of the AI of 'background' characters (just jumping out in front of your car, for instance), it doesn't feel all too 'open' really - the story is pretty much linear, the game is also relatively short (do not expect anything ANYWHERE NEAR GTAV) which I didn't recall it being so but back then it was probably fine, though there is still a good 12-20 hours worth in there.
It does also have a bit too much 'filler' in there when it comes to tedious tasks and should you fail at any point it is likely to throw you back further than seems right at times.
On hard difficulty, it's challenging but not overly so, though losing the police seems a bit too easy still.
Graphically, it looks good, but it does have some glitches - one terrible case of this is with Leo [spoiler]at the end of the game while you are riding in the car with him, his eyes are like a dog looking upwards[/spoiler] which is embarrassingly bad that it made it through ANY kinda of QA process.
The music, voice acting, and all that jazz is superb - it really gives it the right feels in all regards.
[spoiler]It also has one of THE great call-backs in gaming history, imo, when you get to see old Tommy Angelo once again, truly loved seeing that again[/spoiler]

I'd recommend this game still, for sure, but it has to be said - it has it's flaws, mostly just graphical glitches - but it's still as good a Mafia game as anything else out there, though in terms of content it's maybe around 5% of what you get with GTA V, as a comparison.

All I had that related to the game was the same old graphics comparison video with it and GTA IV, however, now and after I played through the marvelous Mafia I, I finally get to taste from this forbidden apple, the game everyone praises to death, to the point where I probably never heard anything negative about it.

Well, the first frame hit, and sweet mother that was a huge step-up, seriously, I played the Definitive Edition that was released a month or two ago, and I did hear that the remaster wasn't that big aside from some texture enhancements and color calibration and oh boy dis it a looker. I don't play the latest Tripple A games so I'm not quite familiar with the state of the art graphics that hit the headlines, but I gotta say, it even holds up to GTA V in some areas and even surpasses it in a few details and gimmicks.

The story. I progress like your typical mafioso saga, even picking up on the first entry's notes, split into chapters with varying time skips that follows this trouble-maker and his childhood friend make it from street crooks to made-men. And the plot really makes you work for it. The levels are challenging especially on the hardest difficulty and even the medium one keeps you on your toes. The shootouts are unforgiving and the cops can get really brutal. I love the wanted system and how you have to be smart and cautions in order to stay low on record.

The driving system was definitely a step up from the first game, although, the simulation option did not add much, almost as if it was never there.

The characters are engaging, take the protagonist, Vito, I would always have Mafia I in higher regard in terms of the story and setting, but Vito takes the cake over Tommy as the main character. He's cool, classy and his development shows. He's like the anti average GTA protagonist where the character can do 180° between cutscenes and gameplay. Joe was the perfect side-kick, always there for his friends and true to his mafioso identity, brutal but also loyal. So good in fact that the last quote in the game moves you to tears having him as a center. And last but not least, Henry. He always had a faint but persistent presence in the story, not always there but somehow always involved, very likable, and interesting fella.

I wish the game had a Free Ride Mode like the first game because as soon as you finish the story, you're stuck loading previously finished chapters in case you want to do some free-roaming. Thankfully, there were 3 DLCs that unlocked the ability to free-roam as much as you want, moving their story from a per-chapter model to more of a GTA open-ended mission checkpoints scattered all over the map.

I won't be writing a review of the original Mafia 2 since I would basically be writing most of the same things. However, i'm choosing to review this because in terms of purely cosmetic things it's for sure worse. First off I will give some credit where it's due, the devs of this game didn't ignore the crappy launch and fixed the gamebreaking and annoying bugs. As a downside to that though, that basically renders this game original Mafia 2 with free dlc and some bonus content if you own Mafia 3. So it really adds pretty nothing new. Now yesterday (the day before i'm typing this review.) I marathoned this game starting at the earlier mission I had started on and beat it from the 3rd act to the 15th over about 6 hours. By the time I had gotten to the end my only complaints were how annoying the cops were, the fact that there are several parts where you lose your hard earned weapons afterwards, and that you can't kill any of the bosses yourself during gameplay. However, my biggest complaint and the reason I decided to mark this review negative and also not recommend the original Mafia 2, is the ending. This a GTA clone don't get me wrong on that. I did enjoy the references to Goodfellas, Scarface, and the Shawshank Redemption. However, anyone that as played GTA knows that at the ending of the game when credits roll, you can hit continue and cause carnage and destruction like you never had before on the open world map, because you unlocked all the weapons and cool stuff. Now in this game after the credits roll and you are taken back to the main menu and hit continue story, I was expecting to be taken to the main map for some sandboxing, but instead I got started over at the ending mission. That was one of the biggest gaming disappointments in my entire life. 

pros 
maybe some free dlc and mafia 3 easter eggs 
old gangster and prison movie references 

cons 
nothing new 
horrible horrible ending

To be very honest, this is a very well made reshade. Lighting, textures, reflections represent the technological advancement we saw since the release of the original. I don't have any negative remarks, except the game could be a bit more optimized in PhysX section and a few very weird bugs.  
Ultra preset PhysX can cause framedrops in very intense gunfight situations in open roads on entry level PCs (Ryzen 1200, 1050Ti, 8GB ram, 10Gb pagefile set on SSD in my case) and I've had a few hiccups while driving under the streetlights inside the tunnels.  
Bugs include texture glitches, character animations etc. The launcher in particular is awful, should NOT have included that, and I had to relocate my Documents folder just to be able to autosave, because the game glitched.

All in all, I'm satisfied with this. Nothing more can be said about story. Linear but deep story about friendship and loss. Voice acting is great, accents really shine on Italian characters. Driving mechanism, cars, music nicely represent 50's era. It's a 7/10 in my book. Good job nonetheless, Hangar 13!

4,Mafia II Definitive Edition,73707895,english,"Let's be clear about what Mafia II Definitive Edition is: it's a very lazy graphical remaster with no other meaningful enhancements made to the original game from a decade ago. You can watch side-by-side comparison videos and see how little noticeable difference there is. Vito has blue eyes now and looks a little more tan? Maybe the textures on cars are a little sharper? Basically this looks like the original game with a reshade mod enabled. Apparently they've fixed some bugs which affected the original game on high refresh rate monitors (I was still a 60hz pleb back when I played the original so I can't say), but in exchange they've removed the PhysX elements for some reason? If you were hoping for, say, some of the additional content notoriously cut during the Mafia II's development to be restored here, fuhgeddaboutit.

Since I got Mafia II Definitive Edition for free for owning the ""classic"" version of the game, I guess I can't complain too much, but if I paid for this, I'd be upset.

Underwhelming graphical upgrades and cut content ""might have beens"" aside, Mafia II is still a game worth playing, and didn't get as much respect as it deserved because people expected it to be GTA with fedoras, which it just isn't. However, while it's an enjoyable experience, it's also quite a short one. If you're wanting to play the game for the first time you're looking at paying thirty bucks for 10-15 hours of gameplay, which is a bit dear. If the ""classic"" edition of the game was still readily available for PC at a lower price (like it was on Steam until the remaster was released...) I'd say just buy that. Buuut it isn't.

That being the case: If you haven't played the game before, get this, but get it on sale.

It went from looking like a game that was published in 2010 to one that was published in 2012. It's very clear they only re-released this game as a gimmick to advertise for the original Mafia remaster. This game does not come close to meeting the standards of a game released in 2020. The animations are very minimalistic, choppy, not fluid, and unpolished. There are several visual and audio glitches and bugs, none of them game breaking, but annoyance nevertheless. They did fix one game breaking bug from the original release in the second to last mission where you could not progress, which is good. 

All this being said, the game is still worth playing. The story is one of the best narratives from this genre, even if it may not hold up in places. I'm glad 2k made the decision to give everyone that owned the original versions of Mafia 2 and 3 the definitive editions for free. There would have been even more backlash otherwise. It was also a nice gesture to include the DLC expansions with the definitive edition, as I never would have played them otherwise. They shouldnt have released the definitive edition for this game however. They should have waited until Mafia 1 remastered was finished, and then gave Mafia 2 the same treatment. Yeah, it would have been resource heavy and they might have other projects they want to focus on, but it's a missed opportunity with a game that deserves a remaster.",1596068649,1596068649,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,48,19,2499,0,1331,1599196500

- Vito glitching through his bed like a T-pose when waking up
- Audio during driving scenes repeating itself (almost like the same track is being played twice, with a slight delay)
- The eye lines of several characters (Leo, Henry) do not line up right when speaking during cutscenes, as if they were not animated
- When playing DLCs I have had scripted events get stuck which causes me to fail over and over again.

The definitive edition includes the classic Mafia II. I highly recommend you just play the classic, and you can even get a 'remastered' texture mod pack to spice up the graphics.

53,Mafia II Definitive Edition,72753966,english,"Mafia II is one of my favorite games of all time. And it didn't deserve the rough treatment this ""Definitive"" Edition gave it. For quite a good chunk of the game, everything seemed in order. Characters enhanced, some more visual effects, maybe improved sounds? It's all very... unnecessary. But not a problem, it doesn't ruin the integrity of the main game.

... Until I got in deeper and deeper into the story chapters. Then I noticed characters' faces messed up as if it was a Garry's Mod video, cutscenes with broken segments, Vito having his hat shoved down halfway into his head as the back of his head got messed up, Vito getting up from bed quite literally, with him standing up as his legs sticked through the mattress as he ""woke up"". AI companions never moving from one spot to help you out, but still talking during shootouts. Scripted events like tailing missions failing because the car I went after got stuck on his own, and I was keeping my distance. Characters speaking over themselves, and repeating themselves, on the SAME conversation (even in the final encounter)... the list just goes on and on.

Issues, that I've never seen in over 10 years of playing Mafia II across different machines and consoles, happen all the time, specially crashing for no reason. Mafia II doesn't need Vito's hair going fullbright white during a cutscene with emotional impact - it just pulls you out from the experience completely. D3T, the studio responsible for this, did a very subpar job on this remaster, and it is a shame.

Don't let the title fool you, the Definitive Edition lies in the Classic Mafia II version.

[h1]Pros:[/h1]

[list]
[*]Game looks better (subjective). It isn't perfect though; It's a remaster, not a remake.
[*]Some bugs have been fixed - Infinite loading etc I no longer experienced.
[*]You get a few clothing items both new and old depending on the edition/pack you bought.
[*]Apart from that. I honestly can't think of anything else for now.
[/list]

[h1]Cons:[/h1]

[list]
[*]A considerable amount of this remaster is unpolished. Down below isn't even a full list.
[*]Unrefined/polished performance: Game lags on a 2080 TI especially involving physics.
[*]Heads warping with the joints etc contorting.
[*]Player hats clipping through the characters head to mouth level leaving the top of the head jagged and crushed down.
[*]Audio Problems such as the audio playing in multiple layers with a 1 second or so delay.
[*]AI is heavily unrefined. If you play on hard, get ready for them to shoot you before even looking your way or even 
[*]when they are staggered by gunfire. 
[*]Some of the textures are clearly inferior to the original (again subjective).

+ Character skins now have subsurface scattering
+ A few upscaled textures here and there

- Does not run well
- Crashes consistently when the player has entered/left a garage multiple times (usually when 'building up' cars and doing things between missions, so you will lose a lot of progress very fast)
- Buggy. Some character heads did not show up sometimes, so I would be seeing eyeballs floating in the air in front of me. Animated sprites and VFX would flicker violently and jump around their origins
- High res Textures suffer from ""HD Texture syndrome"", with loss of original style choices and appearance. This is most definitely a minor nuance and not a major gripe, but it does fight against Mafia IIs original soft, stylised textures that complimented its appearance from when it originally released.

Also legit, why does Joe Barbaro have completely different coloured eyes now? He looks like a different man.

26,Mafia II Definitive Edition,71678096,english,"Shorter than I remember but still a great game.

I've just completed Mafia 2 Definitive Edition in around 11 hours, which makes it a relatively short game, although I didn't do anything other than plough through the story missions; not that there's a great deal else to do, besides selling cars, robbing the odd shop or looking for collectables. Mafia 2 was criticised at the time for having an open world without much to do in it but I see it as simply the setting for a good story. While part of me wishes that the experience was longer, and that I could have played out a couple of the cut-scenes, rather than simply watching a montage of my criminal activities, I think this would have impacted on the flow of the game and the story.

At first glance the graphics seem the same as I remember but take off those rose-tinted glasses and you realise that they have actually been nicely updated. Cars look the part and handle well and everything fits the period, providing a great atmosphere; the soundtrack too is also really good. Shooting and brawling obviously play a large part in the game, with gunplay being of the ""press button to hide behind cover, hold aim to pop out"" variety; again, it works well and I have no complaints here.

There has been a lot of talk of this being a poor remaster, so let me just say this:
if you have the original already on Steam, then you have this in your library right now, for free, which is how I got it, and it is definitely worth another play through.
if you have the original on another platform, is it worth buying this? Probably not, not for the current price. It's the same game (albeit with all of the DLC included) with some nicer textures and the occasional sound glitch or ""eyes stuck looking to one side in cut-scenes"" glitch thrown in for good measure.
if you don't have the original is it worth getting this? I would say so. Maybe it's showing it's age in some areas but hey, forget about it. Now get outta here!",1593460062,1593460254,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,711,26,752,0,662,1593700162

45,Mafia II Definitive Edition,69722550,english,"I honestly don´t get, why this remaster exists. Mafia II (Classic), how it´s called now, was still fine. At least, in my opinion.
Okay, they´ve redone many textures, for streets, sidewalks, clothes and the faces look better, too.

What they didn´t do is fix some of the mayor bugs. 

-You can still fail in Chapter 9 when you tailgate Luca and he crashes into another car, while trying to get on the highway.
-There is an annoying flickering goin on with the new smoke effects, that wasn´t present in the original. Also some of the trash, lying on the ground, has this flickering too and some of it has a unnatural yellow colouring. You can see this especially in the first few chapters, because of the snow, but it´s present troughout the whole game.
-The clothes physics semms to be much worse than in the original. On several occasions Vitos forehead just clipped through his hat, or his leather jacket trying to escape his body.
-There are way to many pop-ups. If you drive fast enough you can try to outrun the grass and flowers popping up.
-For some reason all charakters seem to have puppy eyes. Most noticably when they´re in dark envoirements and their eyes seem to glow.
-Also they claim that you get all the DLC´s with it. Thats a lie. At the time of this review, several DLC´s are missing. For example the War Hero Pack, the Vegas Pack and the Made Man Pack. Because of this some cars are also missing, like the Jefferson Futura, the Roller GL300 or the Cossack. You can however play Joe´s adventures and Jimmys vendetta.
-The Fight against Derek is still way too hard. You sit there in his Warehouse, while you get shot at from all sides an he is on the catwalk throwing molotov´s that will hit you TROUGH cover. And there is still no checkpoint after entering the warehouse. So you start on the opposite site of the harbour again and have to kill ~15 poeple until you run into the warehous and get killed again by molotov´s.

I have to mention, they´ve at least fixed the endless slowmo bug from the original, when you steal your first car. Too bad the couldn´t do that in the original.

Sadly, I can not reccommend this. True, I got it for free, since I own Mafia II Classic, but future players HAVE to buy this version, since the OG is pulled from the store.
It just feels rushed and unfinished. They were probably mid-reworking the game, when some manager, or something, walked in the office and told everyone they have to release the game soon, because of the Mafia 1 anniversary.

Edit: Okay, when I wrote this Review I had just finished Chapter 12. Now I´m at the end of Chapter 14 and can´t progress. My Mission is to pay bruno back. 55.000$. I have 55.298$ in my Inventory, but when I got to pay him back, I can´t interact with the door. Even restarting fom a Checkpoint doesn´t fix this.

57,Mafia II Definitive Edition,69913508,english,"I'm really getting tired of this unfinished re-released mess of a game that claims to be ""Definitive Edition"" 

Update changes can be found the the end of review.

Disclaimer: Just because i have received it for free since i own the classic copy, it dosn't mean that i should tolerate the progressively lower quality end product, ESPECIALLY since it was better before. So i will try to inform the new buyers to what they are signing in for.

The graphical uplift is barely noticeable to classical version. Sure there are some changes like; super shinny surfaces, better makeup for our ageing characters, altered weapon sounds and God like car lights that can blind the blind person. Oh yeah and there is two new cars;
One ported over from Mafia 3 (with terrible damage model) and Mafia's 1 taxi Falconer only available during winter time? And that is it. Can't think of anything else atm.

The game is still missing 2 vehicles from ""Made Man Pack"" weird considering This Is ""Definitive Edition"" Now on to RNG Bugs: Every time you start the game you have a random chance to get rare, common or Legendary bug. ps. Epic bug just crushes your game to your desktop, at anytime of ur playtime...
Sometimes unloaded textures, sometimes unloaded Text. Sometimes no sound or smt. no minimap. Ohh and don't get me started on tailing missions, because you have a really good chance to repeat the whole BORING and SLOW section, just because the opponent is a total derp at driving and gets stucke on other cars, thus game decides to call it a day (failing mission) since you can't go up to him and help him out.. obviously.

Get use to it, this trend is becoming the new norm.  ""oh but i got it for free, ehh its oke""
Good attitude..  xD Mafia 1 Remake goes live in about 2 months xD ""its oke"" and yes i know 
its not Hangar 15 who worked on this rrrresalle of mafia 2, they worked on Mafia 3 xD

I will keep review updated if something changes in upcoming weeks or a month. 
But im not willing to download 44GB again just because they woke up and decide to release patch months later.

Warning! Spoilers Ahead!.. sort of, its to help you save time.
Ps.[spoiler] Before you start the mission on chapter 12 ""Sea Gift"" round up 25.000 shmackles,
( preferably Deric's ;) place ;) You will thank me later.[/spoiler]

This re-release should be called ""Definite Joke Edition"" of once glorious game The Mafia 2.

Review note changes 01/06/20
Remove unnecessary spaces. I'd like to say that there is still a problem with earning some basic achievements which otherwise you would normally unlock easily.

Review note changes 18/06/20
+ Enforcer achievement can be now unlocked, and main campaign stats are now correct. 
Fun fact. Direct @k support website isn't helpful at all. good luck reporting bugs.
- Jimmy's Vendetta stats are still broken, preventing (me?) from obtaining other achievements like; Massacre, Sharpshooter, Firebug and Armament King. (Yes i did verify steam files).
- Still no ""Made Man"" pack cars available. (yes Iam linked to 2K)
- Weird fps drop that have not been present before. (Jimmy's vendetta) As of now.

Final Review note 26/06/20
This game will be uninstalled after I have finally reached 100% complition. 
Summery:
+ Nostalgia 
- I fell like this rerelase didn't deliver much of an experience like classic version did and some of us had a problems running it at 60FPS (it was all over the place). Some didnt have the problems but had same bugs scattered throughout the game despite their glamourus PC machines.
- Corrupted save games. (but i've managed to fix that, i will explain below)
So for same reason, good or bad. This game had my old (classical) auto-saves already present when I first installed the game. Most of which where negative sums that are closer to 
UK national Debt (of about -2.3 trillion)[-4.8Tril to be exact if counted all liabilities because of some F*#ki@! lockdown decision!! of a thing that might be just a flu! And Kill Bill is talking about 2nd wave!] alright ok ok...
So i fixed that.. you know how? xD 
I have copied and pasted my old save games from Classical superior version to DAssE save folder. AND... [i]it worked[/i] I was able to finish the rest of the missing achievements and my game run lot smoother without bad FPS drops [i]Magic[/i]

79,Mafia II Definitive Edition,71200278,english,"First of all, i got the game for free because i already had Mafia II.

I can understand all the other comments saying its a bad remake because of the amount of bugs occuring now ingame wich aren't present in the old game, but i'm positive the Dev's will fix them

Positive Things / What i like about the remake:
- Better lightning, reflections, volumetrics
- Street lamps have a really great lightning it looks very nice too see the city at night
- Shadows are more saturated and softer
- Way more detailed charakter skins
- Faces are more detailed, you can even see every freckle, scratch
- Beards better visible
- Hair looks now more like the gelled hair young folks had in the 40's
- The environment feels more reflected on the vehicles
- Objects that were actually round, but were rather angular due to the technology at that time, are now round
- More options to adjust the graphics and behavior of the game
- A ""Launcher"" gives you the chance to adjust the settings before you start the game and can also be turned off in the settings
- Cutscene movies are remade to fit the 1080p optic
- Film grain was removed in many occasions (never understand why it's a thing in games, same as motion blur)
- New arrangment of the Main menu
- Story is still the same (yeah i think this is a valid good point because many remakes do changes on it's stories)
- Xbox Controller work better now
- Even the remake can run easily with 60+FPS on most machines on highest settings

Negative things /What i don't like:
- Main menu now show an Ad for the ""Definitiv Edition Collection""
- Why should i create an 2k account? And why the game needs to remind me about this everytime?
*Answer* You will get 2 new Cloth pieces ingame wich are both ugly in my opinion.
- Ingame cutscenes sometimes have problems with buggy characters, sometimes the eyes don't move, don't blink or just look somewhere else
- Smoke, Steam flickers sometimes and are a little ""too much"" and are not constant
- Some lights especially in the tunnels are way too bright and dazzling
- PhysX. Do i need to say more? Well, it ""work"" but only after you delete the ""Cloth"" folder in the game folder
- PhysX again - after fixing it, it will work, but your clothes start to wobble some time after your character stops moving 
and some other world objects will also begin to wobble too as soon as they move
- PhysX once again? Well not exactly but its still PhysX fault: DLC Clothes (Greasers, etc.) will not show up in your wardrobe if you don't delete the ""Cloth"" folder
- If you kill a NPC near objects like chairs, it will most likely happen that the object will spin away
- If you stealth-kill a NPC like a cop sitting on a chair, the NPC will stand up regulary because he see you, but then act like getting strangled and get unconcious without alerting anyone else
- Combat System is untouched and ducking is still a little clunky
- Movement with Controller is sometimes a bit loose
- They really could have reworked the tuning system, you can only make your car better, but you can't downgrade your car if you don't like the highest tuning because the engine goes through the hood which looks ugly on some cars
- Some objects still have their original graphics wich look out of place
- sometimes the characters glitch a little in cutscenes

There are sure many more things to mention but i think those are the most notable. 

Summary
- Do i enjoy the game? Yes of course
- Do i bitch about some bugs? No, because they are minor, yes i think they shouldn't exists in the game but well, here we are
- Do i recommend the game? Yes and No
-- If you loved the original and want to see the game polished in 1080p then yes, buy it or if you're lucky, you already have it for free anyway. 
--No, because some of the bugs can breake the immersion and fun for many people especially since the gaming community became very bitchy about anything what isn't 100% perfect (nothing can be)

All in all, in my mind, the bugs and everything negative i mentioned is somewhat minor and can be easily ignored, because Mafia II Definitive Edition is still a good game and a worthy successor of the original game and i really have fun playing it",1592872036,1592872036,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,177,2,2283,0,409,1593385074

84,Mafia II Definitive Edition,71171712,english,"This one is really hard to dislike just because I enjoyed the original so much. After ten years you'd think before they put this out they would have taken the time to fix some of the issues that it had even when it launched. Unfortunately not only are a lot of those old issues still there, but there are a pile of new bugs that make the game borderline unplayable. That being said I still played it all the way through and got over 50% of the achievements so I can really talk about this game. I played the original several times over the years, originally on console then eventually moved up to playing it on PC. Sometimes I'd play for just an hour driving around enjoying the atmosphere, others would be full playthroughs just to do it again. I'll state I played this version before and after the 1GB update they put out. So let me start with the pros and then I'll move to the cons. I also have a perfectly acceptable PC that shouldn't be a cause of any of these issues.

Pros-
Beautiful atmosphere now in higher definition.

Great radio soundtrack, though a few more songs would have been nice.

Fantastic car catalog with so many lovely renditions of cars of the era, slightly modified to not be direct copies they'd have to pay to use of course.

Ambient sounds were normally well done, always nice standing out by the road hearing the grinding of a non-synchronized manual transmission on a passing truck.

Story has always been good, not perfect but good.

Police AI when it wanted to actually work was always a nice touch, might be annoying to some but I love the thought of speeding tickets and bribes.

Little details like fuel consumption, losing hub caps, car wash, the price of fuel going up through the story. so few games really do it and it's just another one of those things that you can mostly ignore, but is just a nice touch.

Now on to the cons-
Buggy Glitchy mess. Constant never ending graphical issues, freezes constantly I wouldn't even call them micro-stutters because they could last for up to 5 seconds and could be as often as every 15 seconds or could be several minutes between but through the entire 16 hours I played they were always there. Get in a car? Stutter. look too fast? Stutter. Change the radio station? Stutter. Turn the PC around too fast? Stutter. You get the gist. 

Audio bugs galore. The radio stations were constantly having issues where the last few words of a radio report, or the last part of a song would hiccup and loop several times before it'd finish and go to the next. Talking? Sometimes it'd be an absolute pain because everyone would be stuck talking over each other 2-3 times so you can't make sense out of anything they are saying.

Vehicle AI was a huge issue, sometimes they were fine, and other times they were so unpredictable it's as bad as actually driving in Manhattan. Usually I'd not mention it because real drivers are absolutely nuts, but being on the highway and all the sudden a car up ahead is just parked on the expressway is ridiculous.

Pop in was awful, having cars just suddenly appear on their side or roof in front of you while driving was just ridiculous. I assume it could also be related to why the game is constantly stuttering as it tries to put everything together, but I honestly couldn't say.

Camera one of the biggest issues in this game is the awful camera, it was awful in 2010 and it's even worse now. It's a 3rd person view that's like being on a little ball turret a foot behind the PC, never looking exactly where he looks, but just in his general direction. Getting shot when you're peeking around cover because he would technically be able to see them, but your stupid camera can't is just bad camera design. RE4 had third person camera down in 2005, the GTA games got the hang of it more or less by San Andreas in 2004. There was no reason this 'Definitive Edition' couldn't have taken some time to fix the camera.

T-posing, clipping through the ground and other posing issues were also a constant issue and while not as much of an issue were still something that's probably not supposed to happen.

Shooting similar to the camera is something that really could have been improved in this edition, it's not the worst but the few times I died in the game were because the PC did something weird when I tried to aim to fire.

DLC not all there. Where's my Jeep and uniform? 

Those are all things to consider when you want to buy this game. They might fix it, it'd be nice if they did and if I see things are fixed I'll edit this review, it'd be nice if at some point I could recommend it but right now I just can't. I would have rather paid to get a Definitive Edition that fixed everything than just got my version upgraded when it came out. I really hope they don't screw up the Mafia original remaster because I played that game a ton too when it first came out.

Sure, its got some strange bugs, glitchy facial expressions and some of the achievements don't work (note how I've completed the game but somehow didn't get the achievements for completing certain chapters) but overall the presentation is very good. A lot of hate for the new lighting system, but I personally think Empire Bay at night looks much, much better.

Gunplay is the same, simple, straightforward and satisfying. Driving is fun and varied, and incredibly unforgiving.

Mafia II is short, but the attention to detail throughout the game is insane - from hubcaps rolling off your car when driving erratically, your car getting dirtier the more you drive in the snow, to the way the citizens of the city start the game not knowing who you are, to them knowing exactly who you are. Memorable levels, memorable chapters.

Still one of all time favourite game endings.",1592168839,1592168839,TRUE,1,0,0.523809552,0,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,406,52,902,0,834,1592592609

51,Mafia II Definitive Edition,70631553,english,"Mafia II Definitive Edition Review

A Second Chance to experience this truly immersive 1950's Mafia open world action-adventure game!

Story:
9/10
You play as Vito Scaletta, a wannabe gangster and aid and get aid from and to your best friend Joe Barbaro who has been 
there for you for your whole life. You will experience so much together. So much indeed. The city is Empire Bay. Real life New York. So many opportunities, the American dream as they say. Will you accomplish that dream and so many other dreams that Vito has? How will Vito's story end?

Graphics:
7/10
Not that much improvement overall. Some of the textures were upgraded. Better lighting and facial structures of the main and sub-characters. Mostly, it's the same look from the Classic version. But of course there are bugs, glitches and lower fps and game performance with this game. 30 fps near many areas, even on strong rigs. The developers might fix these issues sometime in the future.

Gameplay:
8/10
The driving mechanics are so realistic! You won't find the GTA driving style here. The driving style here is a more brutal and realistic one, I would say. You get penalties from driving fast or not driving carefully from the cops. The shooting gameplay is rather simple. The weapons are rather impressive. I Like their design and sounds. As I stated above, the gameplay is open word so you can kinda explore and collect collectibles, only this can you do though. The game has achievements also, always a plus in my book, just like the classic version. Sadly, no more stuff beyond the main story missions and collectibles were added.

Soundtrack:
6/10
I wouldn't say that I am intrigued or surprised by the soundtrack, only the main theme puts me on chills. Some scenes have a powerful track out on them while others don't. Kinda a miss or hit or done by purpose.

DLC(3 in total)
5/10
Filler in my opinion. With the DE you get all of the DLC with the main game of course, so no losing here, you can play them or not, if you are an achievements hunter like myself you need to complete these and miscellaneous achievements that you can only obtain by playing the DLC's. All the DLC's have a timer on every mini-mission and you have a limited time given in order to complete the missions and do some extra work for the achievements (e.g Drifting daddy 'o', millionaire etc). The best one is Joe's s Adventures which covers the time gap on what joe did after a crucial point in Vito's life.
In Jimmy's Vendetta, well you guessed it: Jimmy's Vendetta!
And The Betrayal of Jimmy: Betrayal. In addition to these, you get various car and outfit themed DLC's and exclusive outfits from past mafia games to the most recent ones. (E.g. The Mafia III protagonist can wear Mafia II's protagonist's clothes and drive his car and so on)

In Conlusion:
Overall game score: 9/10
This is a nice addition to your Steam Library in general especially if you are a Mafia fan, have already completed the Classic Mafia 2 game, the story, the achievements etc or even a newcomer who wants to try a Mafia game and also get all the dlc included in the price and not independently. Then this game is for you. 100 %

Thank you hangar 13 for giving us another chance at completing the game again from the start, obtaining all the achievements, enjoying the game with a fresh look and of course giving it for free to the Mafia 2 Classic owners like myself!

P.S:
*The achievement ""Enforcer"" is bugged. Doesn't unlock even if you surpass the 50 enemy kills. The developers are currently working on a fix.
*I got the DE for free because I had already had the Classic Mafia II game. You will get the Classic Mafia 2 game for free if you buy the Mafia 2 DE. And vice verca.

72,Mafia II Definitive Edition,70522844,english,"Let me start off by saying that I recommend this game to those that have never played Mafia 2 before, or if you had played it on another platform and don't own the original on pc. The story is simply amazing and is a must play for people who have yet to experience it. 

It is easy to see why this ""Definitive Edition"" is getting the amount of hate that it is. If you don't own the classic version, then you are paying $30 to get both versions, with this version barely being an upgrade. There are some graphical improvements, but that is about it. The game still has a ton of bugs, and even more than the original. For instance, the newspaper salesman no longer has any audio and silently waves the papers about. The eyes still move in the cut scenes, to a degree. There are times where people look cross eyed during scenes. Even with the ""improvements"" graphically, the game still looks dated. The character models throughout the game are so re-used that it is slightly jarring at times, which I'm sure it has always been this way, but nostalgia forbids me from remembering it. Some of the cut scenes in the game don't seem to have been updated at all and look entirely the same as they did when the game was first released.

The graphics in the game is good not the best but decent enough. the gameplay however just doesn't cut it at all and the whole open world feels so empty it feel like GTA 3 world where there really nothing to do excepet for do the main missions getting point A to point B, protect the escort and etc there are some stealth mission but it felt kinda boring and simple.
driving in this game is horrible like there no way you can do hard right turn unless you smash into car or a wall because it doesn't turn at all. 
there is no progression in this game except collecting playboy magazines ( which i don't have a problem with that lol ) and wanted posters.
i just can't see myself telling people get mafia 2 because it doesn't seem worth the time to play it at all

On a real note I am thoroughly disappointed in this remaster.

From my understanding and through playing it is clear that all that have done is try and make the game pretty and slap a great big Definitive edition on it that doesn't necessarily mean anything. The graphics are updated and do look ok, but they are still lacking in terms of today's standards. The game also takes a heavy toll on your hardware for some unfounded reason.

The first Mafia was my #1 favorite game for a long time, so I was really excited to play Mafia 2. But this games seems to fall short about everywhere. The environment is done decently, but it's not really as expansive as the first game, and that one is OLD. There's a story, but it failed to make me feel any real connection. The missions themselves are rarely interesting, and the way the story is set up, you do a whole lot of ""drive to that place"", that might actually be the bulk of my playtime. The only real interaction I had with the city was driving across it. The stuff they put in the city had no real significance to the campaign.

So, if you're like me and on a mission to go through all games in the series, Mafia 2 is kinda sorta OK, I guess it's worth a play-through. But for a game on it's own, eh.

• Pros
‣ GRAPHICS UPGRADE TO CURRENT GEN
‣ COMPLETE DLCs PACK
‣ IMPROVEMENT IN FRAME RATE (60FPS)
Sadly this is all the pros I could find here.
• Cons
‣ A lot of bugs some game breaking that force you to restart it and mistakes in this game that begs the question for ""definitive edition"" quality.
‣ No Cloud support or extra contents added for better for this game.
‣ Clearly not a ground up remastered in quality of this game.
‣DLCs content are worthless only useful DLCs are outfits and vehicle that's it. 

‣ Joe's Adventure as much fun it was in story it was clearly not given the interest and time it needed as much as I love its free roam the timer is a fun killer it should work only for extra bonus not complete within time and missions like ""Bomb Under the Seat"" and ""Highway Racing"" makes you wanna lose your nerves its bullshit missions that actually prevent you to progress in game but the end was fun.

‣ The Betrayal of Jimmy is a waste of your time just avoid it all over and watch cut scenes on Youtube not worth your time.

‣Jimmy Vendetta its much better than Betrayal of Jimmy and continue after that event the mission phasing is good and vehicle are goods its fun to score as you finish it you will automatically forgot anything about it or when you quit your game its a petty cash grab DLC.

- they fixed cop chase bug (constant slow-mo)
- they added custom fps limiter

Cons:
- Nothing else was added
- New graphical settings are a joke, they don't really make any difference
- Visuals are terrible. Blur and sepia all the way.

This game is true gem in the Criminal underworld of games. It really immerses you into the experience of working for a mafia family. 

Remaster: 
I played this game 10 years ago on console when it first came out and loved it then just as much as i enjoyed this time around. The remaster improves the games graphics and could hold up to modern games of today with a few tweaks and patches. The cars, Charcter faces, and enviromental assets is what i noticed the biggest changes in as everything has had a fresh polish look to it colours are more immersive and brighter and more ambient. The way rain falls onto your car all the little details look way more realstic now than what they did. This game suffers the most from performance thoe as its not very well optimised for pc as there is constant frame drops and Ai issues but with a few tweaks this game will be a masterpiece. 

Police AI: 
One point I really want to talk about is how smart the Police AI were for the time. If you commit a crime you need to change your clothes otherwise police around the city will recongise you. Same if youre driving a the same car they can track your liscense plate if you hang around to long. All these little things even having to refuel your car for the time was different to everything else out there on the market. 

Story: 

10/10 amazing gripping story 

Gameplay: 

9/10 just needs a few more tweaks for performance 

Replayabilty: 

6/10 needs side missions

To the writing, the characters, mature content, and the story. I love it. I bought this remaster because I wanted to jump back in and playthrough again with all the updates. I'm in chapter 9 and I feel like I have played enough to make an opinion on this remaster. Having played through the original release already. It's still the same great story (so far) with better textures and graphics. All the little glitches and bugs that you hear in other reviews are true, examples (blinking fog, graphic glitches, and eye tracking). You can fix some of the blinking on objects and fog by capping your frame rate to 60fps in the games settings. Which is a bummer for someone with a powerful PC. And performance is quite dog turds to be honest compared to the original. Even with a 2080ti and everything on Optimal settings. Physx is bugged and doesn't work for cloth. You shouldn't have to modify a file to fix that. I want to recommend this game, and it does some things right. But in the current state I can't. I really hope whoever is responsible for the patches see the reviews and fix these issues because it's a classic and deserves it. It'd be hard not to feel a little worried about the Mafia Remake.

19,Mafia II Definitive Edition,70313838,english,"Remaster, what remaster?  Well, where is it??  I don't see no remaster, more like, virtual paperweight.  

Are these guys really trying to destroy the entire Mafia franchise??  If so, they are really doing a good job at it; considering the fiasco known as Mafia III... just when I thought it couldn't get any worse, nope, they found a way to really ruin a cult classic and one of my favorite games of all time; jackasses.  Hey, 2K, if you're going to be making a remaster, actually hire MASTER DEVELOPERS to do it; just makes everyone look at you, with baring cringes.

Get the classic version, this is an insult to the long time players.... this is supposed to be an upgrade?  *lol* The classic version plays better, any computer can play it and graphics are just as good with 5x less disk space required.  I rather play an old game at the highest settings than a new game at the lowest.  It's a tad wonky but works well.  I don't get where some players say the graphics are better in DE, not for me anyways.  It looks like it was polished, like the polish on a car; glare-galore.  The classic version was just better made for its time; 10 FN YEARS AGO!!!  This looks like a high school project; which, if it were the case, bravo, this deserves a medal... but since made by so-called professionals, no... this is just shameful.  This was the opposite of putting lipstick on a pig... it's putting feces on a babe's face.

They will likely do like Deus Ex after selling a fiasco... ""oh, we won't make any anymore because players don't seem to enjoy those types of games anymore"" but ignoring the fact they're building trash and players refuse being sold incomplete trash, where the player is left to do the beta testing, for free.  FK that noise.

Look, $30 for this?? WTF... they'd have to pay me to play it but since I got it for free; you get what you pay for in life I guess.  Those who said they played this and not the classic version... are liars.  I will still complain because I am fed up of shitty games being released by developers, let alone butchered remasters of classic games.  Only reason this game exists, is to lick D3T's butt crack.... no other reason, since there are not many venues to profit here.  This was not tested a whole lot.... if at all... or testers were incompetent; pick your poison.

This goes to any development team, release nothing instead of releasing trash for the sake of giving a bunch of losers work, you're just pissing off those who paid your bills for over a decade and will end up with a deficit.  #SteamRefunds

There is a reason I only paid $10 for Mafia III, I don't see it as being worth more than that.  This is why this game was free for the old school players of Mafia II, there is no way that they have gotten less than 90% refunds... like the previous installment. They stopped listening to players and started douching instead of building a fun game and as a result, no one will buy, nor keep, their trash and wonder why they can no longer afford real talent.  I feel this game studio won't last the next decade.  Make a continuance of this game, without douching... and there might be some hope here.... but not hanging much hope onto it, I know the way the world spins now... and it spins toxicity.

I doubt we'll ever see another game like CLASSIC Mafia II from 2K; like triple-triple snowmobiles.  Awesome is being phased out for douching purposes, ""lame and barely acceptable"" is being phased in... sounds familiar (Made in China) eh?  Awesome nowadays costs 3x and takes 10x longer... has a mandatory waiting period and an endless slew of paperwork.

AS A DEMASTER:
I don't like this new trend of demastering classic games. The AI is sometimes a big what and graphical bugs of character models tend to not be right i.e. the face model stretching across the entire room.

THE STORY OF MAFIA II:
This is one of the best narrative storytelling I have played; the characters of Vito, Joe and some of the others you meet are fantastic. 

GAMEPLAY:
It's dull: the shooting and driving get a bit boring after a few hours. Some sections were great, but the autosaving was an absolute pain to deal with when you loss or get locked into a tough situation.

- Story
- Cinematics and main characters

However, its visuals did not age so well, so here we have Definitive Edition aiming to polish and improve all visual aspects. Does it do it well? I would say its a great improvement and the best way to play this gorgeous game in 2020. It does, however, has its flaws - poorly optimized areas, visual bugs and glitches plus lots of the DLC characters textures have not been touched at all. Even through all of these mistakes I would not call it a sloppy remaster as all of the above mentioned can be fixed with patches and I hope that that is exactly what they will do. Overall recommended as if you are buying it for the first time, you will get classic Mafia 2 with all of its DLCs free of charge and same goes for if you already own the classic 2.

Pros:
+ Gorgeously polished already great looking game
+ Most of the areas dont really hit performance too much
+ Story still holds up today as one of the greatest Goodfellas-like style of storytelling
+ Gameplay is a bit on the arcady side with shooting, but drive still feels really good
+ Well crafted characters

Cons:

- Graphical glitches that are very apparent especially with newly added clothing such as Tommy Angelo´s suit and Clay´s jacket - character model is protruding through the clothes and the hat of the suit was sometimes stuck in the middle of Vito´s face during cutscenes
- Some places are poorly optimized for no apparent reason - there is nothing going on, no shooting or particle efects, it was even in the middle of the night but the game decided 15fps sounds like a treat
- DLCs still s*ck and that is cemented by the fact that creators of this remaster did not so much as a touch textures of side characters of the DLCs

Decided to load up the original game, and while the Text seemed odd (probably by design?), I turned up all settings, 4k, physics, etc, it ran stable 60fps, worked with fraps, and the audio was improved.

Bad things:
-lack of free saving, and sparse saving checkpoints it shows that it was designed with consoles in mind
-lack of free roam after you complete the main mission
-sometimes when undercover and trying to shoot the sights are not were you were looking  just a second before -
accompanying AI, in the cases that they are leashed to follow you they are next to useless because they stop and move as soon as you move
-at this date there are unsolved bugs from the original version ( like Joe stuck in chapter 14th)
-this is about mission design, you didn't get to drive the cars you worked to get and upgrade
- a lot of areas are closed off after the missions are done

Good things:
- good voice acting (even though I am not a native English speaker I consumed a ton of English content over the course of my life so I can tell they did a fine job)
- professional cutscenes
- a lot of details in the world
1. NPC's are going about their daily business with all the mannerisms that you would expect from them gas station is one example
2.period  appropriate soundtrack , commercials, news reporting style, building billboards
3. well crafted interior locations

81,Mafia II Definitive Edition,70093606,english,"Must've been around 10 years since I've played and finished the original Mafia II. I did really enjoy the game back then so when this remastered version came out I thought it would be a good time to endulge myself into the Mafia again. 

I did not play the original Mafia II first to see if this remastered version is a big improvement or not but from what I've seen the game holds up very nice even after 10 years. Empire Bay (a mix of Chicago, New York and San Francisco) still has an amazing atmosphere of that era and great to drive around in. 

That said, this is not a GTA clone. Yes, Mafia II is an open world game but there is not that much filler content like in GTA. Mafia II pretty much focuses on the main story line. There are no sidequests except maybe some ways to make money like bringing cars to the scrap heap and robbing shops/gasstations. 

The variations of cars is quite limited, as would be realistic around 1950. You can buy a few new clothes and guns but there was not one moment in the game where I actually needed to buy guns. The clothes come in handy whenever you are wanted with the police and have to change clothes. 
You can also bring a car to the garage to repaint it and change the license plate so the car is not wanted anymore. Customisation of cars is also quite limited and unnecessary. 

The story however is quite good. The game really feels like a Mafia movie, albeit with a lot of scenes directly stolen from the movies but that's fine by me. 

Currently I did not finish the remastered version of the game yet because of a game breaking bug at the end of chapter 14 where Joe as to go see a doctor. Somehow the game thought Vito was in the car , which he was not.... 

I could not kill myself so the only thing I could do is try to restart the game. This did not work because my savegame is broken which forces me to restart Chapter 14. This would be okay with me under normal circumstances but Chapter 14 is quite a long chapter with some annoying filler content. Also, I probably will not get the achievement for finishing Mafia II on hard mode.

I will update this once I completely finished Mafia II and played some of the DLC.

Sure, the graphics and textures look better, as does some of the facial details and whatnot, but weapon sounds were changed when they didn't need to be, the cloth physics for clothes are gone unless you do some serious file digging to find them, and some songs were removed, as I noticed when Dean Martin's ""Ain't That a Kick in the Head"" didn't play during the credits for the main story.

During the cutscene for Chapter 9's mission ""Balls and Beans"" whenever it shows Luca interrogating Tony Balls and Harvey Beans, Beans's face is horribly glitched.

Mafia II Definitive Edition is a tragic story of missed opportunities, the only real differences between this and the original game is some questionably improved graphical effects and texture work and sadly the introduction of new bugs the original didn't have (though I must say the snow on the pavements during winter is a great improvement.)  As well as forcing you to buy this one on steam if you want the original. (just go to GOG and buy it there.)

This could have been so much more, anyone who is interested heavily in the Mafia franchise is no doubt aware by now of how much content was cut from this game due to publisher pressure and time constraints, and this could have been a real opportunity to remedy that and let us see what could have been. This is made doubly sad by the fact that simply modding the original Mafia II will get you closer to this dream and look a bit nicer as well. 

They also missed the opportunity to integrate Joe's adventures into the main campaign like I always felt it should have been. 

With very little effort they could have vastly improved this game even if they didn't touch the graphics at all (and sometimes I wish they hadn't)   I can only hope that they will update this with some more content to justify it's horrible price tag but given how poorly Mafia III was delivered and how poorly this and the other definitive edition have been delivered I have gone from being hyped to suspicious of the upcoming Mafia I remake.",1590175389,1590689613,FALSE,3,0,0.527559042,0,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,264,11,577,0,57,1590684365

The graphics has gotten a facelift, but most of the models are so poorly made that the old one would've suted the game better anyway.
I got stuck in chapter 14 in the warehouse, where you save Joe. Either Joe didn't follow me from the roof, or 1 enemy was visible on the map, but not in-game. Either way, i found it pointless to continue playing a game, with such a broken AI.
Such a shame, this had potential...

The game starts in 1945 and theirs a 6 year time jump im not going to spoil and everything changes. the cars, the music, the clothes. The level of detail in this game is unbelievable. People go about their day on the street selling newspaper, go to their jobs with briefcases, shopping, moving boxes at the docks or just drinking in the gutter they will even sometimes slip on ice. Cops will pull you over and give you a ticket for not following the speed limit, you're car can run out of gas, gas tanks explode like real life if shot, tons of little immersion touches but it dosent go as far as the orginal Mafia in these aspect. Cops will put your face in the newspaper if you getaway and get your licesnce plate number so you also have to keep that in mind and change your clothing and buy a new licensce plate. If Martin Scorsese directed a video game it would be MAFIA 2. The characters are all likeable and believable and the story is full of twist and turns.

96,Mafia II Definitive Edition,69865449,english,"This one has been on my radar since it was released but I never got around to checking it out.  I picked the non ""Definitive"" version last year for six bucks and change and recently got this sent to me for free so I figured I'd give it a spin.

While I've played worse games, this one is aggressively mediocre in every way that the whole experience ends up being forgettable before it's even done.  I can only really suggest this if 1.) you're really into this setting and 2.) you can get it for cheap, thirty bucks is too high a price by far.

Normally open world games like this start off boring with a battery of pointless tutorial missions that recap mechanics that everyone is already familiar with from dozens of other titles, but here the beginning of where the game peaks.  The snowy 1940s NYC of the opening chapters looks great and the licensed period music only adds to the charm.  These missions are a mix of simple hand to hand combat, stealth, shooting and driving, all stuff you'd expect.  You'll be beating up uncooperative dockworkers, selling bootleg cigarettes, and shooting cookie cutter mooks for 4-5 hours.  Again none of this is revelatory but starting off with these small jobs both introduces you to the mechanics and helps solidify your place at the bottom of the criminal underworld of Empire Bay.

The thing is, once you've gotten through these opening chapters and the game progresses you realize it has NOTHING to offer besides what you've already seen.  Rather than introduce anything new, all of the above mechanics just became more of a hassle to deal with.  Driving around, which is charming at first given the old timey setting and cars, quickly becomes your primary activity, as you chauffeur NPCs from end of the completely empty map to the other, then drive all the way BACK across that empty map to your house so that you can end the chapter by walking up two or three flights of stairs, entering your empty apartment that has nothing you can interact with, and press X next  to your bed.  Shooting is even worse - this game's cover-based combat would have been bland by 2010 standards.  As the chapters progress the only difference is that the game puts you up against large numbers of bullet sponge enemies who can shred your health to nothing in short order if you dare leave cover, often from areas you can't even see.   Memorizing the scripted enemy spawns through trial and error is basically your only option to get through late game combat encounters, especially because you can't adjust difficulty mid-game to just get through the more maddening bits.

But it gets worse - a lot of the games features seem at odds with other design choices.  There are weapon stores throughout the game that you can spend your money at to get gear... but the game regularly will take your weapons away from you at random intervals.  Stocking up before a combat heavy mission is often pointless because the designer didn't design the encounter with you having them in mind.  You can spend your money on vehicle upgrades... but the maddening decision to include a speed limit negates the benefit of having a faster car.  Not that owning a car is of much benefit - you'll almost always be driving an NPC's vehicle which is almost always a piece of crap instead of your highly upgraded cars which largely gather dust in your garage.  You can spend money on outfits, but there's a point mid-game where all of your possessions, those included, are also removed.  Any attempt to spend your time doing ANYTHING besides the story missions, in order, immediately, is rendered pointless.  You can crush cars at the junkyard and rob stores to get money, sure, but why?  It's basically worthless (except, of course, at one point late in the game where you have to raise funds by repeating those two activities, over and over again.  I liked this part because it let me catch up on podcasts while I mindlessly picked the locks of cars, drove them into the crusher, walked up the stairs to the crusher controls, hit X to crush the car, etc etc).

But my biggest gripe is the checkpointing system.  This is the WORST example of this I have ever seen in a modern game, bar none.  The game has no manual saves to speak of and doesn't save when you quit.  The only way for it to save is at predetermined intervals during story missions.  So, if you do get the crazy idea in your head to go check out the world, raise some cash perhaps, and then, say, die in a car accident, you're back to the last checkpoint which could have been an hour ago.  The game punishes you at every turn for trying to do anything other than the story.  I know that it's lazy in a way to compare this to other open world games and complain that it doesn't do what they do, but the game invites these comparisons by trying to copy the open world urban game format and force a linear shooter in to it.

Let's end with the story, which is often touted as the games best feature.  This is the only thing the game pulls off, for me, and even then it's nothing special.  It's your basic rags to riches and then back to rags story of a dude who always wanted to be a gangster.  Every cliche you've seen in mob fiction is represented here and played straight without a hint of irony or subversion.  Vito is well voice acted and the new model for him looks great but it doesn't fix the fact that he's a cardboard cutout protagonist with no agency who has nothing driving him besides a desire for money and the fact that there's no game if he doesn't do the things the story needs him to do.  Every single thing that's asked of him he does without question or introspection and it's impossible to relate to him or his struggles.  Every other character is like that but worse.  I have a special hatred for Joe, who may be the most detestable sidekick character I've seen yet in any game. [spoiler]When he's carted away to be murdered at the end,  I had the only actual moment of emotional resonance in the entire experience, and it was one of happiness that this annoying character was going to be offed.  The idea that this is some tear-jerking moment is laughable to me.[/spoiler].

Overall, I'm glad I didn't spend thirty dollars on this.  If you're really hard up for an old timey gangster game and don't mind it being a boring slog that has no respect for your time, go for it.

If you want to play the game i would recommend the original, it runs on old hardware with no problems, its 7-10GB and it can be modded (not sure about modding the remastered version because i haven't tried it) and its not that different to the remaster you really can't notice the difference till you look up a side by side comparison of the graphics (which to me 30GB+ just for a better looking road doesn't seem worth it to me)

 I suppose there are bugs in the new Mafia definitive games which can make them unplayable.  I had trouble with Mafia 3 Definitive and decided to leave it alone until they release a patch for it.  But that's not what i'm here to speak of.

Mafia 2 is a game that many would see as a Godfather like story where you go through some hoops, become family and work for the don and  some stuff happens. These games bring out that familiar noir type field, and in the era this takes place, it's a wonderful vintage point.

33,Mafia II Definitive Edition,69822033,english,"Mafia 2 a game I hold near and dear to my heart, I personally hail it as one of the best narrative driven stories, while linear it is still a game that holds up to this day and is much better than the mess that is Mafia 3, now that I am done tooting the horn of Mafia 2 I will talk about the changes to the game from it's classic edition to now. Mafia 2 Definitive Edition definitely has some problems, more so on console to my knowledge but this isn't about the console port this is about the PC version.

The remaster problem: The graphics on some characters look gorgeous, Joe, Henry, Vito and the other big players within Empire Bay look nothing short of amazing as with some of the set pieces as well looking beautiful however there is a drawback with this in which not everyone in Empire Bay got the special treatment and thus they still look about the same as they do in Mafia 2, for a remaster this isn't a very good thing however as someone who has played through Mafia 2 many times it was a slight annoyance to see a bunch of NPC's look like they do and have Vito look great. A lot of Empire Bay also is very beautiful to look at you can tell there was definitely some passion put behind remastering the game however sadly some of the passion was put into one area and ignored in another.

The story: Mafia 2 follows the story of Vittorio Antonio ""Vito"" Scaletta born in Sicily in 1925, his parents moved him and his sister to America to start a new life, in 1943 he was arrested during a heist with his buddy Joe and given a choice, go to prison or fight in World War 2, after returning from the war in 1945 he meets back up with Joe who gets him out of the service and working with him, Vito after finding out the debt his family has sets out for a life of crime with Joe in order to pay back his family and himself so as to never make the same mistakes his father did. This is just a basic synopsis I wrote up for the start of the game's plot, the story of Mafia 2 while a bit cliche holds up extraordinarily well telling an emotional story of a man who originally set out to help his own family ended up becoming deeply involved in the Mafia life.

The gameplay: Mafia 2 Definitive Edtion's gameplay is the same as it is in Mafia 2, some people call it outdated which is true as it's still the same as it was in 2010, a little clunky but I think it holds up quite well. Each gun brings something a little different, the 1911 is the perfect all rounder handgun to use, the .38 is the weakest of the bunch but fires quite fast, the c96 boasts the most bullets out of all of them and the magnum is the strongest, the shotgun is one of the best weapons for close to medium levels of combat and the Thompson M1A1 is a great all rounder machine gun only rivalled by it's big brother the Thompson 1928, there are other guns that can fill in different roles for each scenario so it is fun to experiment and see which one will suit you best, however keep in mind that some of these guns you won't be able to come by very early on in the game with the exception of Chapter 1 when you are fighting in World War 2. The driving hasn't seen much change either, don't speed around the city otherwise you will be chased by cops unless you know the car you are using will outrun the any day.

Glitches that I know of: currently with Mafia 2 Definitive Edition I know of a few glitches in the game, one of them being a texture glitch with some litter on the ground having broken textures and I believe I am the only one who has encountered  this glitch so far but in the cutscenes for the end of Chapter 10 and part of the cutscenes in Chapter 11 would abruptly end before they were supposed to, these don't affect me too much as I have already finished the game many times however these can be a massive problem for players who are just starting out in the game, if this was just something that happened to me then it is okay but hopefully if it does happen to others it will be patched out soon, the last glitch is just a goofy one in which during cutscenes Vito's head would clip through his hat or his hat would clip through his head, it was funny to see that happen from time to time but it should be patched out somewhat soon so as not to take anyone out of the cutscenes. 

The only other problem I noticed with the game is that during the main story pretty much every coat that should have physics with it would just stick to Vito, there appears to be a mod that patches this out already so use that if you want while we wait for it to be patched out, this problem does not occur in the DLC though for some reason.

In conclusion Mafia 2 Definitive Edition is what many would consider a true remaster, it updates the games visuals and makes it playable on next gen consoles, this is a pretty good PC remaster but a horrendous one on console according to the problems it has, my advice would be to pick this game up if you are interested in an old school Mafia story or get the bundle to get them all, however you need to make your voice be heard if you are encountering glitches to 2k or through reviews to get them patched out.",1590475002,1590475002,TRUE,2,0,0.523809552,0,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,258,9,1545,0,1295,1592989254

38,Mafia II Definitive Edition,69819353,english,"Let me start by saying that Mafia 2 is my favourite game of all time. I finished it multiple times on Xbox 360, same with the PS3, and probably another 2 or 3 times on PC. Add to that that I've just finished this version of the game and i think i can safely say I've played my fair share of this game. The most disappointing part of this edition is that the bug on the objective ""pay Bruno back"" which results in an infinite loading screen or the door not being usable at all, is still present in this version of the game. It's been in the ""classic"" version since launch and is still present in this version, not very ""definitive"" at all.

The graphics updates to this game are nice, although subtle and in no way an upgrade that makes the game ""next gen""
This version comes will all the DLC packs so thats a bonus, plus it was free to owners of the ""classic"" version. 
The story of Mafia 2 itself is great and is something that blows away Mafia 3 in every single way.
If you're tempted to play Mafia 3 and haven't played this, don't bother with Mafia 3. This game is superior in every way.

I recommend playing this version of the game if you've had it for free, as the game itself is brilliant, but the fact that bugs that have been in the game since its 2010 launch is honestly disappointing

59,Mafia II Definitive Edition,69785491,english,"Okay, let me start by getting this out of the way:
Mafia II is a phenomenal game, in so many ways.. If you haven't played it already, then play it!

But, if you already have played it... Do n't expect to be blown away, as the remaster is crap.

1)  some of the licensed music was removed... which RUINS the 1950's atmosphere; half the songs we sang along to as we cruised around Empire Bay are no more.
2) Okay, MOSTLY the texture quality was increased, as was the lighting-- but I've noticed so many instances of lights flickering, decals Z-Fighting constantly (flickering between the decal and the texture beneath as the camera doesn't know which to render on top),  texture pop-in, and remember I used the word ""mostly""? Well, there are still loads of textures that haven't been touched-- these look even more apparent as everything around them has been improved.
3) PhysX (Or lack thereof). The phenomenal physics of the original 2010 game aren't entirely present-- some debris effects seem to be intact, but a lot has been removed-- cloth physics seem to have been removed entirely, making Vito's coat stiff as a board. Unrealistic, and super annoying as his coat physics were one of the first things I'd praise about the original after the story xD
4) THE EYES, like wtf... Characters' eyes are completely fixed in position. This completely ruins the mannerisms of characters like Henry in particular.  They are more detailed eyes though, texture wise, and they reflect the environment quite well, if only they actually f*cking moved!
5) None of the cut content. This was a real annoyance. Many people would have hoped to see the cut content, but none of it is here. It's a shame as I'm sure that alone would've made all my points so far easy to ignore.

Again, it's a phenomenal game, but this remaster is not so good... Play the original-- I'm sure there are ""graphics mods"" out there if you wish for a more modern look.",1590420072,1590420072,FALSE,149,2,0.868227363,0,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,117,11,37,0,37,1589987807

While there are some visual enhancements, theres quite a lot of flickering on some objects and even lights in the distance and up close. Vito's clothes get deformed half the time, and also I've seen instances where some character faces are deformed. 

The game-breaking bug I mentioned are characters walking into things and not interacting. The game breaker for me that stopped me from moving forward in the mission in Chapter 14 was Joe getting stuck on the scaffold. A few missions ago I noticed characters walking into doors and not opening them, causing them to get stuck.

These bugs made the experience worse and left a bad taste in my mouth. A remaster is meant to enhance the experience not devolve it.

[h1]▶️Introduction[/h1]
Mafia 2 is a third person open world game with a strong emphasis on storytelling. This is the successor of Mafia 1 which was one of the best games of the early 2000s. As we all know by now Mafia 2 was a worthy successor in 2010 but how does the HD Remaster stack up? Lets take a look. Mafia 2 Definitive Edition was developed by Hangar 13 and d3t and published by [url=https://store.steampowered.com/publisher/2K]2K.[/url]

Release Date : 19th May 2020 (Mafia 2, 23rd August 2010).
Last known update: 19th May 2020.


[h1]🎮Gameplay:[/h1]

[b]Are there any changes as far as gameplay goes?[/b]

[list] [*] [b]Mission design and shooting :[/b]
If you think Mafia 2 is just another ‘’copy’’ game of Grand Theft Auto you’re totally wrong, the Mafia series really takes the time to make you familiar with controls, movement and shooting, it is a slow paced third person game that sometimes might need a little bit of tactical movement. Mafia makes great use of the run and cover system and enemies usually die within a couple of shots, now level design was great in Mafia 2 as every mission had a different meaning and different way of completing. The level design of Mafia was actually ahead of its time, sadly mechanics weren’t and the game still feels a little rusty and slow compared to Mafia 3 that does actually have the mechanics as it is a much newer game. So in short, no they did not change anything and I like that decision as it keeps the purity of the game quite high.

[*] [b]Open world potential:[/b]
Granted Mafia 2 didn’t possess a huge man in 2010 and in today’s time it is worse, still the city of Empire Bay is extremely detailed with a lot of potential, the NPC and randomly generated humans in the streets of Empire Bay feel alive, for example in the snow timeline of the game you could see random people falling due to the icy roads and this honestly adds a crazy level of detail that is even by today's standards unmatched.Now as far as special events go you basically get nothing, you cannot race your cars not can you play quicktime missions which is kind of lackluster as far as stores and what you can do with your money you get a plethora of options  like boutique stores, vehicle garages and even gun shops.

[*] [b]Weather and other little details:[/b]
Weather and nighttime are actually working real time in the game, out of nowhere it might start raining and the rain is actually noticeable while driving, that's pretty rare for an open world story game that doesn’t really focus on driving that much. After your cars break down due to multiple fatal hits you can actually go out and repair it yourself just like in the 1950s. Lastly you heal yourself by consuming food and you even get custom cutscenes for this which is a great attention to detail.
[/list]


[h1]📚Story:[/h1]
You have been warned, spoilers ahead.

Vito Scarletta is the main character and his story starts back in Sicily when his parents decided to avoid the WW2 italian drama and travel to Empire Bay, USA. Vito was both fascinated and disgusted by the city and had to learn the language in order to keep on surviving there.After some years Vito crossed paths with Joe Barbarro and both of them started robbing small shops together as money was low. One day Vito gets caught and gets to the chance to fight for the American army in 1943 in order to defeat Italy. Vito then comes back after an injury in 1945 and after that his mob career took on. First Vito was working for the Clemente family in which he proved useful but after someone snitched on him during the gas stamp mission vito had to serve jail time. While in jail Vito got to know strong people like Leo Galante and obviously joined the Galante prison gang. After proving that Vito is a viable option Galante got Vito out of prison right after Galante took Exit. After being a Free man Vito had only his sister as his mother died while he was a prisoner. Joe offered Vito a spot to work for the Falcone family and Vito happily accepted without seeing the bigger picture, after some breathtaking mission killing former boss Clemente, witnessing Henry's death by the Empire Bay Triads under the command of Mr.Wong and more Vito realises that Falcone wanted to kill all the other Bosses in order to sell Dope freely. In order to combat that Vito had to kill Falcone as Leo Galante ordered Vito to do in order to save himself from all the other families and the Feds.


[h1]🌇Graphics / Audio:[/h1]
As mentioned above Mafia 2 got major texture and lighting improvements. Most of the noticeable improvements come within cutscenes where you can clearly see a lot more detail on the skin and hair of character and even their eyes look normal now compared to the OG version. Lighting and textures and even minor geometry fixes are noticeable within EMpire bay.

[*] [b]Audio / Soundtrack:[/b]
Audio is a mixed bag in my opinion. cars do sound just a tad bit better but gunshots are pretty flat in the remaster while the OG version had quite the kick still, Voice actors are still the same and I think that the soundtrack hasn’t lost any songs which is always a plus as the music in the game is just amazing.

[h1]🌀Performance:[/h1]
[b]The Remaster works better on High end devices but worse on Low end ones. [/b]
Here are the Benchmark stats of both the Remaster and the OG version.

[*] [b]In Game:[/b]
AMD Ryzen 5 3600 X, 16GB RAM, RTX 2070 S: Mostly 144fps on ultra settings while normally playing.

Intel Core i5 5200U, 8GB RAM, Intel HD 5500:Mostly about 28fps on Low-Med while normally playing.

[*] [b]🖥️Bugs / Glitches / Crashes:[/b]
In 12 hours of being an Italian mafia boy I had no crashes but minor bugs, for example PhysX wasn’t working on my Coat and I had to do some fixes, lighting bugs and even magazines vanishing. Other than that I had a great and stable experience.


[/list]

[h1]💲Price:[/h1]
If you had Mafia 2 you get the Remaster for free.
Great Value.
29,99Eur. is a little too much, I would wait for a sale.

[h1]⚖️Conclusion:[/h1]
Mafia 2 Definitive Edition is a more than solid remaster as it does give you all the DLCs and improves a lot as far as graphics go yet it still has some minor technical problems which is not really optimal, if you can ignore that you get a hell of a game though.

[h1]📉Overall rating: 90/ 100 [/h1]

1,Mafia II Definitive Edition,69736346,english,"I cant give this a thumbs down as it's free if you own Mafia 2, and you cant really complain about something you got for free unless its a sexually transmitted disease. 

The new textures and lighting are very nice, and the indoor environments are lovely for such an old game. Some of the character models are pretty woeful looking tho, especially the ""sexy"" ladies Joe kicks out of his apartment in the first act, they look like something out of Unreal 2, and all the characters eyes look really weird at times too, like theyve all got really puffy, wrinkled eyelids.
The actual gameplay is the exact same and thats the biggest disappointment to be honest. 3rd person shooting is fairly weak feeling, the guns don't feel punchy or powerful, the aiming is loose and overall its just about serviceable. The driving is okay too, and really those are the only two things you do in the entire game. Oh that, and an insta fail stealth section or two. So yeah. Fun shit like that.

The story is...eh. The writing and voice acting is all very ""eyyy youse guys, lets go boost a cah and slap around some fooken broads"", that is to say its about as cliched and stereotypical as you can get for a story based on the Mob in the 1940's. 

I dont think Mafia 2 as a game, or as a story, has aged particularly well, and some new textures and lighting doesnt really help all that much.

The retextures do look absolutely awesome, but funnily enough, their doing this has made it super obvious where they decided not to retexture things, which is a decision they made, and it makes the whole thing feel really half-arsed, at least to me.

It's not all bad though, like I said, the retextured things do look really nice, and the improvements they made to sounds and sound quality are also really appreciated. I do intend to play this game through to completion because I do love Mafia II, but I wouldn't feel good spending $30 for what ultimately seems to be a half-arsed remaster, when I could get the same fantastic game, but less pretty, for less money.

3,Mafia II Definitive Edition,69727592,english,"Mafia II: Definitive Edition: Soft Around The Edges

Right, this was something that really came out of nowhere, a ""Definitive Edition"" lineup for the three main Mafia games. I mean I expected 2K to do something special for the release of the Mafia I Remaster but this was out of nowhere and not in a good way. I feel bad for Hangar 13 in a sense, they always seem to get ambushed with all of the heavy lifting for stuff like this. Mafia II: DE is a weird remaster that doesn't do much to the game and does enough things wrong that the only reason I'm not more pissed off is that 2K gave this for free to anyone who owned Mafia II before hand.

I'm going to break from my traditional formula to just get into the nitty gritty, you know the story already, it's Mafia II. In-general, the remaster looks exactly the same as it originally did with a slightly cleaner texture pack but there's a feeling that a couple of extra fingers got stapled to this Frankenstein's monster without checking if the monster could use it. Besides the 2K Account thing, everything about the game is just slightly off.

Guns don't sound like they do, voices tend to sound different, stuff like PhysX seem to be broken and the game's ability to even run right runs a line between functional and absolutely broken that I have ""luckily"" found myself on the functioning side. Relatively. As for the other sales points for this, yeah it includes all of the DLC for 20 dollars. That's not TOO bad if the game actually ran correctly but from my playthrough, which even then seems to be an outlier from most people having a full on broken game, this definitely needed more time to proof before 2K went to bake it.

TL:DR: If you want Mafia II, play the ""Classic"" version that you can find elsewhere for the time being. I have a feeling 2K will at the very least attempt to clean this version up but we're still a decent bit away from that bit of magic happening. It's Mafia II, all the crime and chaos that entails with a few weird additions and a HUGE jump in GB takeup to make you consider waiting on this. It's usually a bad sign when you get a game like this for free and you still feel sour about it. Come on 2K, try a little harder and stop forcing your companies to shove these games out of the door and maybe then you'll beat Rockstar to the punch rather than playing second fiddle.",1590329302,1590329302,FALSE,2,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,402,48,572,0,194,1600482890

It looks like this was quickly ported over from DX9 to DX11 API with a few general enhancements (textures, lighting, etc.) by D3T.  Unfortunately, there are many technical bugs present right now in this port.  It seems that QA testing was either slim or non-existent.

Here's a quick list of bugs I have personally seen happen and/or confirmed from multiple reports from others:
-Physx API is broken.  It's really bad.  Physx is always on, with no option to turn it off, and it's extremely buggy.  Vito (your character) has 0 physx applied to coats, leaving them looking like old PS2 style graphics with the bottom sticking to Vito's legs.  This can be worked around though, by deleting the physx files which enables the back-up physics engine (much simpler cloth physics, comparable to 360 version of classic edition)
-Audio is bugged and cutscenes only go through the left speaker.  You can work around this by setting audio to high and to stereo, although that is a poor workaround for people with surround sound setups.
-Hitching is pretty bad, but I remember the Classic version had similar hitching.  This is likely due to the old engine being overly conservative back in the day.  The engine loads chunks of the world frequently when traveling through the world, causing the hitching(even installing on an SSD didn't help).  This adds to my suspicion of quick port of the Classic version.  I ran Special K and used it's more advanced framerate limiter, in order to normalize frametimes and minimize some loading hitching.
-Smoke and other alpha effects flicker now.  I have seen reports that limiting to 60 FPS corrects this, however this is a bad workaround in the days of Gsync/Freesync monitors.  I personally limit to 60 in single player controller games anyways, but this seems like yet another oversight from the port job.
-There a plenty more, but these are the most frequent I have seen or have experienced myself.  Just look at the other reviews, and you'll probably see many more bugs like special characters causing save issues (Silent, creator the the GTA SilentPatch's, is creating a patch for this as I speak, he knows far more about the issue than me).


I would really avoid buying this RIGHT NOW.  Keep your eyes out for a patch though, if D3T can continue supporting it then it will be even better than the original Mafia 2, which holds a special place in my heart.

D3T, if you see this, you're up to bat!!!  This is your chance to redeem yourself, until then I simply cannot recommend buying this version as it is fundamentally broken.

it tries to use the IGPU all the time... had to force it to use my RTX 2060 with the Nvidia control panel 

once you get past the launcher page... it loads the game at the lowest possible settings for resolution and must be manually adjusted to every time start the game.

Not sure whats up with that but so far physX seems to be working as far as I can tell with no Modifications on my end . 
game runs around 85 FPS Avg on my rig which is nothing super powered

9750H Under volt of -145 mv

16 GB of ram @ 2666

Would hold off buying the Collection as well with their (Remastered mafia Edition)

Mafia I and part II are games with one of the best single player stories that i know.
The story's are in par with stories like in ""The Last of Us"" 

This Definitive Edition of Mafia II is not to be compared with the totally overhault and remastered version of part 1 that will come out later this year..
It does have some better graphics and artwork and it includes all DLC's + The clothes and black Samson car of Lincoln Clay from Mafia III. 

One thing that i want to mention at this point is this;
Mafia 2 was ahead of it's time when it first came out in 2010.
It was packed with awesome PhysX particles that seems to be not showing\working in this devinitive version.
This part can only be fixed by Nvidia i think.
Because in this definitive version the files that are needed for the physX are still based on DirectX 9 and will not work for DirectX 12 because it is not remastered like in Mafia 1
And because of that i believe that the origional part 2 still give the best experience to the player.
But dispite of that it is still a nice game to play on modern setups.

I’ll start off on a positive note, that being that the few things which have changed for the better are great. Wonderful remastered character models/faces, nice looking lighting, and the updates to *certain* textures look great too. But all in all, this ‘remaster’ is just disappointing. So much of the game is glossed over, so many areas that could benefit from new assets or ported assets from Mafia 3, so many areas that could’ve used brand new textures rather than old upscaled ones, and so many situations that could areas that could have more modern effects added, like snowdrifts or summer leaves blowing in the wind. The other big disappointment is just how much this remaster breaks. PhysX has been gutted from the game making 80% of the clothing and physics/cloth enabled objects from the original simply not work, or not function to the degree it used to. Certain effects like sewer steam is broken and jittery. I’ve even see vertex’s in some cases become completely stiff, causing objects to weirdly stretch and solidify while the rest is moving (another great example of broken clothes). This really is the absolute bare minimum they could have done for a remaster, and they would have been better off just releasing and HD texture pack or something of the sort for free. I personally did not buy this remaster and received it for free as an owner of the original Mafia 2, but if you’re considering buying this, I really don’t think the changes justify it. Too little for too high a price, and too many key components broken.

I downloaded the 38gb install and played for an hour, the first time since something like 2010 I had played Mafia 2.  

I play on an ultra wide monitor, resolution of 3840x1600, and I was happy to see that the game supports this resolution and that it was automatically selected.  So far so good.

Graphics wise the textures aren't too bad while playing the game, but something feels ""off"" about the character movement.  I don't know if it was always like that, or I'm just too used to playing GTA5 and RDR2 and how the movement mechanics work in those games.  Or maybe it's the animations/character models themselves that do not move right.  Aside from that, I enjoyed the first hour, and I believe I will indeed do that second play-through of the game.

One note about cut-scenes, they do not appear to have been upgraded, and look much worse than the game does while playing.

I have had no bugs or oddities within the first hour of the game, for what it's worth.

79,Mafia II Definitive Edition,69640680,english,"There's a lot this remaster does well, but as of launch, there is a whole lot that needs fixing.
At least original owners got this free! If they expected us to rebuy the game in this state, this launch would have been REALLY bad.

The new lighting and texture work is overall great, no complaints about that. As for some more important things though...

Now for the issues that I've noticed that need to be fixed:
1. Cloth physics are bugged in the main game. All the physics but cloth work fine, the cloth is stuck at the lowest quality setting from the original no matter what setting you use here. It works fine in the DLCs. Probably just a bug, but please don't ignore this one and leave it unpatched, the main game looks like absolute crap without cloth physics. And don't just stop at the old medium physics setting, give us the full PhysX cloth physics from the original back. Some other issues with cloth include the physics spazzing out and making odd jutting shapes, which happened in the original but is more common now. I assume it's something to do with the cloth physics being bugged in general, so if the botched physics in this remaster are repaired to their original game state, all of this might go away.

2. Some effects like smoke can now flicker and stutter. This is a very noticeable issue that wasn't in the original game, it's distracting and needs fixing ASAP.

3.Light flicker, on streetlamps and distant buildings, was present in the original but is now more noticable, possibly because of the revamped lighting. It would be nice to get a fix, but since this was an original issue, it could be a fundamental engine problem, so I won't be mad if it's not fixed.

4. Some textures that really need high-res versions still use old textures. The biggest offender is the rock texture. Now that the mountains have been made more rocky and rocks are way closer to you up on the roads, they really need to be sharper because they're so visible. Not essential to fix, but would be appreciated.

5. The eyes. Characters look overall great, but for some odd reason they removed the moving eyes from the original cutscenes, now they blink whenever their eyes change direction, and the eyes are in a new direction when they open, we no longer see them move. Some characters don't even move their eyes, no blinking or anything, they just stare blankly ahead the whole cutscene. It really makes the characters less expressive and more robotic. The fact that they covered some of this up with blinking shows that they were aware that they somehow messed it up, and instead of fixing it they tried to hide it, and didn't even do a good job at that since half the characters simply don't look anywhere but forward now. Really disappointing intentional corner-cutting, stuff like this is why I don't respect Hangar 13 that much. Take the time to do it right, you messed up something that already worked, now fix it. As with the cloth physics, just make it like the original again, copy and paste the old animations into the remaster if you have to, I can't imagine why this would be an issue short of a dumb typo or something.

If Hangar 13 fails to fix the three most important issues that they messed up from the original: the physics, flickering smoke, and eye animations, I will not buy the Mafia 1 Remastered or the future Mafia IV if they develop it. I can let III's issues slide because that was their first game of that size. But breaking things that already worked in the original Mafia II, putting shoddy bandaids on them or ignoring them entirely instead of fixing them, and releasing the remaster knowing these things are broken, is a pretty bad look that shows just how little they care. If they don't fix all three of those issues, I'm done with them.

And I know they shipped it out to another company to remaster; but since they obviously chose someone that wasn't up to the job, received a remaster that was visibly not up to par, and released it without fixing any of the new issues anyway, they might as well have broken it themselves. 

After many of Mafia III's still-present issues and now this, Hangar 13 needs to prove to the community that they care about quality by fixing this remaster. How they treat this game with patches after launch is going to be the deciding factor in whether I buy any future game with their name attached to it. The community's good will matters more than they might think; Mafia III's sales were underwhelming because of all its issues and that can happen again. If they keep messing up, the series is either going to permanently end, or get passed off to another developer that's up to the task.

When I saw the announcements for a remaster of one of my favorite games of all time, I was thrilled to say the least.

Perhaps I'm being harsh, when you set out to make a remaster of a masterpiece and charge 30 euros for the thing, you'd expect it to be built from the ground up, something that could compete with 2020 graphics while staying true to the original. This remaster completely fails at that. It's literally just Mafia 2 with some mild adjustments.

In 2010 there were two versions of Mafia II. One for PC, the other for consoles. Now there is one with less features than before. Yay, parity!

87,Mafia II Definitive Edition,69631559,english,"TL;DR It's still  Mafia 2. One of my favorite games of ALL TIME. 

So, yeah, the game itself is amazing. It's worth picking up if you've never played the original. Those looking for an actual ""remaster"" will be disappointed. All the weird jankiness of the original (due to it being a game from 2010) is still there. Gunplay feels sloppy, the AI isn't very intelligent, and the car handling can be spotty. Really, the only thing that stands out is the updated lights and post-processing. 

The textures are still pretty low-res and pop-in is absolutely TERRIBLE. Pop-in actually seems worse since the fancy new lights will pop in when the cars do so it really draws your eyes to it.

Honestly, I wish they'd had just reworked the view-distance and tightened up the shooting since Mafia 2 ""Classic"" actually still holds up really well.

I guess I'm sad since it's a wasted opportunity.

BUT STILL. Don't let that deter you. A great game will always be a great game, so you might as well play a great game that looks a bit better than it did at release. Playing it now really puts into perspective how ahead of the time the game was.

Has the same bugs as before & same issues as before. Hell before i could not even play the classic version cause the game would be pitch black & no texture would load. So this is a big upgrade from the previous version to me. 

Is it perfect? No. The textures are obviously from the older version & some thing has not been fixed that should have been fixed. Did i expect a full on re-master of the game? LOL no. It does not need one. 

To review the [b] ACTUAL [/b] game. 

The story is great & the gun play is okay. Driving is fine & dialogue is decent. If you are expecting some sort of GTA style then look the other way cause you wont find it here. 

You can buy guns & you can buy new outfits. 
You can go to a bar & go to a diner to eat/drink other than that the game has not much to offer other than a really REALLY good story. Cannot stress this enough. I have always played trough the Mafia games once a year cause the story always brings me back & makes me want to play it again even if sometimes the story gets a bit [i] boring [/i] but it picks up again quickly. 

At the moment i have not tried any of the DLC's to  really put my opinion on them but the fact that they are included in the [b] base [/b] game is a fantastic deal especially when the DLC's combined were like $30. 

Is it worth buying if you dont own the classic version? [b] YES [/b] is it worth buying if i'm expecting a GTA Open world style game? [b] NO [/b] the game has an open world but its rather limited to what you do. Since the [i] open world [/i] is tied to the story it will keep reminding you to get to an location. There was a mod for the classic version that basically puts you in an open world but i dont think it works with this version.

When I heard about the game getting an update, I was excited to revisit a game I grew up playing. I honestly jumped in to try an see what all the complaints were about so I could give my 2 cents and try to defend a game I love. 

After playing through the story, I can say that there is some issues that ruin the game immersion-wise. Sections of the game had AI huddled in corners doing nothing. Some scenes had dwarfed faces during important dialogue which was sad to see. Some lighting also broke in certain points of the game. I liked how they updated the textures and made the game look great, but it looks like (to me) they use the same meshes for characters and buildings. Which is not a big deal to me personally, I just want to make that known to those who think the game is completely remade from the ground up. 

At the end of the day, I would still recommend the game for it's amazing story and fun game-play. My only reason I would recommend this version of the game is if you can deal with the bugs and want the nice updated visuals. Otherwise I suggest playing the classic version.

Generally speaking, there are some encouraging things: for example, improving the quality and optimization of the paintings, updating the Chinese language, and the Mafia 2 can get the latest and final version free of charge. However, there are also many bad places: for example, the Chinese language subtitles and interface of the game are too vague, which gives people a sense of vision of an old antenna TV set, which is also a headache for most Chinese players. I hope that the language definition can be updated later. Finally, I hope that the production team will be able to extract its essence and its dregs, and dedicate the Mafia's 1 plate making to the screen before us. thank you!

Overall I'd recommend anyone who previously owned it to play it, its free and the higher-resolution textures breathe new life into what was already a very lively feeling game.

21,Mafia II Definitive Edition,69515275,english,"tldr: Just buy Mafia 2 (Classic)

How it stands as a graphical remaster;
Pros:
Updated for the Mafia 3 engine (64 bit, better general performance on modern machines)
More graphical options
Updated reflections
Updated textures (on most things)
All DLC included

Cons:
Broken APEX PhysX integration (cloth physics and smoke physics not functional)
Flickering on particles and lights
Mafia 3 shaders and lighting clash with the feeling and setting of the original title
Some cutscene NPC's use old textures, creating jarring visuals

Ultimately, Mafia 2 is an incredible game, from the narrative to the gameplay it doesn't miss a beat. It's great that the game has been modernized to be introduced to a new generation of gamers, but this remaster isn't satisfactory. Either through rushing or negligence, some of the original graphical aspects have been completely removed or worsened (APEX and shading.)
I sincerely hope they patch out some of the issues, but this release could be considered nothing more than a beta release in my opinion. Not worth the money until these glaring issues are fixed, in my opinion this is currently inferior to the original release, even by modern standards.

25,Mafia II Definitive Edition,69454134,english,"Doesn't work with windows 7 without editing files and XMLs.

So they took a 10 year old game made for windows 7 and made it NOT work with windows 7.

Even with xinput1_4 mod the game will start and run but controller will not work. KBAM still works fine.

NVIDIA PHYSX NO LONGER UTILIZED! So everything that made the original version so amazing from tire deformation to clothing physics to snow to certain debris is now gone and replaced with static and hard models that creates clipping and strange rigid clothing. Even doing the XML edit you can get ""some"" PhysX features enabled but at about half of what the ""classic"" version has.

So they took a 10 year old game, added slightly better textures, then took away a bunch of features that made the original game so good, then made it not work on the operating system it was made for.

Talk about a bungled ""re""launch.

Unless you really care more about 4k textures, then I'd say the ""classic"" version still looks better if you are still running 1080p or 1440p, as there really isn't that big of a difference to justify the loss of PhysX goodies and the increase of more than 35gb vs the classic only needing about 8 gb.

If you really want to see what this game could have looked like if they didn't bungle the ""definitive edition"" check out 2 mods on nexusmods for ""classic"" Mafia 2 called: 

-""Mafia II Remastered"" and ""Old Time Reality Mod"" These do a much better job at tightening up graphics with lighting, shaders, and 4k textures as well as a few more addons like 20 more cars, 70 more songs, better damage models and more.

Secondly: The audio is messed up. It is super loud in some parts & the audio only plays out the left headphone. Dialogue also has audio issues where some lines play in lower volume than others.

Thirdly: I dislike how the game pauses if you alt-tab or need to use steam friends. I want the game to be continually running unless I specifically pause it (Edit: You can change this)

Some questions I've seen from other reviews:

1. Is it worth £24.99? No. (Hopefully you got the free upgrade like myself)

2. Is physx in the game? Yes. (People have reviewed this game thinking it's not because it's not in the settings menu, however it's a hidden setting which is only turned on if you select medium or high preset for all graphic options, a tip for those having frame drops issues is to set the games graphics settings to the low preset, restart the game and it will turn off physx, then turn your game back to what ever graphic settings you wish but do it manually do not use the slider preset at the top as that will turn physx back on, you only have to do this once, if you want physx back on use medium or high preset restart game and do your graphic settings manually again and your done, you can also enable or disable this in the game files instead)

3. Slow motion bug from the original game fixed? Yes.

4. Texture bugs? Haven't come across any yet.

5. Audio bugs? Haven't come across any yet.

6. Custom controller settings? No. (Only 2 presets to pick from like the original game)

Mafia II: Definitive Edition is literally just that, it's Mafia 2 but better.

Pros
- Improved Textures
- Improved Lighting
- Improved Models
- Better Frame rate and Optimisation
- Same amazing story and characters

Cons
- Fov can be awful at times with no way in game to change, external methods are seemingly possible but don't seem to work for me (This is not exclusive to this version, Mafia 2 Classic also requires external methods) not unplayable by any means but would be nice to have the option in game.

Possible Issues
- My PhysX was apparently already enabled but you will need to double check the top of the review and just make sure it's set to high if you want it in game.
- People are reporting sound issues with headphones and only coming out the left ear however this doesn't happen on my end so just something to watch out for.

However currently, my anti-virus disables the launcher stating it to be a virus, and so this has forced me to turn off my anti-virus just to be able to play the game. I thought there'd be a silver lining when I saw you could disable the launcher, but it doesn't truly disable it, it just starts, then immediately skips. This is a pain, because it means that if I wan't to play the game, I need to keep my anti-virus turned off (which I really don't like to do).

Another thing I noticed which really annoyed me, was the fact that when I exited the game, the game continues to run the executable in the background, and when I go to turn off the exe in the task manager, it tells me I can't.

My opinion? No. If you haven't played it yet, buy the original. It's cheaper, it's the same game and it honestly feels a little better. If 4k matters to you and space doesn't, and you really have money to burn.. I guess go for it? You really aren't gaining much. As it stands, I can't recommend paying money for this remaster.

Pros:
- The good looks great in some areas; Textures and models have been improved, but you're really only gonna notice this with some walls on buildings and the character head models.
- Weapon sound effects have been completely changed (Some of them sound ok while others sound unfitting)
- The infamous game-breaking black polygon bug has been fixed
- Performance is enhanced
- Many songs that got removed from past updates have been restored

Cons:
- This ""remaster"" does way too little. Besides the DLCs, no additional content is added
- None of the features that were cut from the original 2010 game has been added. This was a huge missed opportunity
- APEX cloth physics are disabled despite the files being present
- The file size is WAY too damn big. (How did it go from 8 GB's to 37 GB's?)
- The emotion and intensity of some of the character ingame voices has been heavily toned down. (The soldier who tells Vito to ""Take the Shot"" says it with far less urgency and is much more quiet)

Despite the good changes made, I cannot even call this a remaster. This is more or less a port that has been enhanced at a bare minimum.

looking forward for mafia 1 remake in august. hype hype hype!",1589922892,1589922892,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,3933,142,3697,0,141,1593374129
53,Mafia II Definitive Edition,69440954,english,"Considering it's a free upgrade for those who had Mafia II it's a solid 11/10. Thanks 2K.

Source material is excellent, original models, textures and assets stand the upgrade to 4K quite nicely and lighting and textures improvements make it a really good update. Art direction is as good as it ever was.

As a minus, PhysX removal, while not crucial to the experience is a big loss, and some fonts and UI elements should have been improved and upscaled.",1589920763,1589922152,TRUE,2,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,131,9,478,0,113,1599583820

55,Mafia II Definitive Edition,69441401,english,"Mafia II: Definitive Edition is FREE to all existing owners of the original game and includes all the DLC content, It is not a 'remaster' and it's certainly not a remake either so expectations must be kept in check. This was more of a release for the current gen consoles than anything. 

Improvements are minimal but still noticeable - the visuals have more detail in places and are much sharper too along with increased draw distances. The performance is incredibly smooth and the game-breaking bug that plagued high framerate monitors has also been addressed. 

At full price for newcomers, it may seem quite expensive but this still remains one of the most remarkable games ever created with an unforgettable cast of characters and incredible story set in a truly wonderful world. You also get the Classic version thrown in for good measure!
