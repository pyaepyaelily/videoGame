Ruins the experience completely and has been a problem for years so I guess SI simply can't make it work properly despite demanding endless examples in the bugs forum.

Examples (just a few but happens all the time, player is only involved in one of these so player is mostly observing).

Season 2
Bidding war for Jadon Sancho from Dortmund begins. Chelsea, Man Utd and Man City all table bids.
Signs for Chelsea for pretty cheap £52mil, despite a clear fricking bidding war.
Chelsea Squad status - Star Player - Wages a paltry 135kpw. No major clauses in the contract to make up difference.

Seriously, his agent must be on the Chelsea board.  
Kante Important player - 300kpw
Zouma Squad player - 205kpw

Ziyech Important player - 150kpw
Loftus-Cheek Squad player - £150kpw

Sancho -Star player - £135kpw (ridiculous)

Season 3
Bidding war for L.Martinez from Inter begins. Chelsea, Bayern, Real, Barca, Man Utd, Man City all table bids.
Signs for Barca for £81mil. Squad status - Star Player - Wages a paltry 160kpw. No major clauses in the contract to make up the difference.

-------
Season 3
Bidding war for Leon Goretzka from Bayern begins. Chelsea, Real, Barca, Man Utd, Man City all table bids.

Signs for Real for paltry £61mil, less than his value despite squad status at Bayern being Star player and a clear fricking bidding war.

Real Squad status - Star Player - Wages a paltry 155kpw. No major clauses in the contract to make up difference.

Seriously, his agent must be on the Real board.  
Hazard star player - 550kpw

Season 3
Example transfer where player is involved and again it's with Chelsea.
Ruben Dias to Chelsea.
Player managing liverpool - Current European and Premier league champions.
Player Manager rep 4.5/5 stars
club rep 5/5 stars
last position - 1st - Champions league winners, EFL cup winners

AI Chelsea
Manager F.Lampard rep 2.5/5 stars
Club rep 4.5/5 stars
last postion - 6th - Qualified for Europa league. No trophies.

Liverpool transfer bid of 58mil accepted but his agent with no relationship to player or Chelsea refuses to even negotiate - reason - 'interest from Chelsea'

I'm like.... huh? Chelsea came 6th last year, won nothing, are playing Europa league and haven't even made a bid.
Forced to move on as will not even negotiate.
2 weeks later signs for Chelsea for 51mil and paltry 125kpw.

21,Football Manager 2020,77008955,english,"As a person who used to mainly play FIFA for the career mode unaware of Football Managers existence until 2017. 

I am astounded at how incredible this game is and I am disappointed in myself I didn't switch to this years ago. The detail put in to this game is incredible. If you're a true football fan to put it quite lightly, you will adore this game. At first I had a look at the menu I was handed and I'll be honest, I was confused. Never been more confused in my life. Gradually as I went on I learned more and more things and even now I'm still learning. I've only played so many hours (due to my low attention span I really can't just play the same game for hours and hours on end).

I can understand why when the matches actually take place the graphics aren't too great but it seems we've become lost where graphics are actually better than the rest of the game. I'd take Football Manager having the fantastic opportunities and detail given to me opposed to nice graphics for a 10 minute interval where I don't even have control directly over my players. It simply doesn't bother me and it shouldn't bother you. A million percent there could be improvement in graphics but it really shouldn't matter.

Personally, I bought this on sale for around £20 and if I'm being honest I feel like that was the right price for me to pay for this game. I'd advise to buy it on sale especially now considering FM21 is coming out soon which I will be honest I probably won't buy until it goes on sale. That's just me though, trying to save some money and feeling when the time is right.

44,Football Manager 2020,61779322,english,"I've been playing FM20 for now a much longer time since COVID-19 and to be honest this game gets annoying fast. The AI is basically idiots and plays like a new comer. The game isn't that exciting when you have to go against a PL or Real or Barca rosters. One of my saves City has all there key players and also add Dybala, Joao Felix, Federico Chiesa, Neves, Declan Rice, Bentancur, Esposito for those who don't know this guy is OP in saves. and Mohamed Ihattaern. And many more top tier players the problem with this? Is its unrealistic the AI commonly does this and stack up with all there top players. And If your a smaller club they can raid your club for key players by tossing there weight around. and their whole roster is filled with overpaid players that no way they can get away with if the AI operates with FFP. But teams that splurge like this City are common United raided be for Dembele spent 109 million on him doesn't start him and he plays no games for them. Transfer list him a year later for 70 million? why did they spend that 100+ million with no attention of using him it makes no sense. this has happen multiple times and in every save I have done with small clubs. Keep this in mind City built that roster 3 years in its insane how stacked teams get. Another problem are AI clubs not selling players which can get dumb. I offered 20 mill for Kepa ""That's his price in the game""  and Chelsea was refusing why you ask? IDK because they had Oblak starting so why would Chelsea hold on to a 10 mill a year back up GK. Is something you must ask the Devs themselves. Another issue I have ran into is injuries it seems only my team gets hit with them as hard. And when I say hard its like a punch from Wilder hard. Most of the players on your roster comes down with it. Which makes it so much harder to win crap cause not only are you factoring in your key players who play awful in game but also injuries. Every season I have played in this game at least 2 of my players go down with a 2 month + injury. Now to gameplay its not really all that much from what I feel. Many goals gain seem like stupidity and wouldn't happen in a real game. In a huge cup game my experienced players fold like a omelette. classic game sheets you will have in this game is 20 shots 11 on target AI stats 4 shots 1 on target. And this would resolute in a loss for you. I understand this happens in real life but clear dominance in game? And you are more likely tying or losing gets annoying. The game scripting ruins it hugely anyone who telling you they enjoyed this and its perfect is lying or a Bot. This game is riddle with glitches if you want actual real review go to the dicussion and the Discord the game sheets are memes now because its that bad. You can have a from 3 of Mbappe Ronaldo and Messi and they will all be pocketed by a MLS back line if the game in the mood for it. This game was made by a PL fan because they always win everything in my saves. All the saves are the same things same players are sold in all of them and same moves. and if you want to try and ""build young"" after 2 years they're all 100 million for 1 17 year old that hasnt played. But if you have a good young talent your getting offered 10 million.

But FM20 really has addressed many of the biggest issues from previous versions. Proabably my favourite improvement is the game engine, where balls curve now and goals (esp FKs) are so much more realistic, as are crosses. No more ridiculous early yellow cards, players can actually play two games in 7 days without being completely tired out. In my first season didn't come across any crazy scheduling issues, although I was knocked out both cups early and was not in Europe...so let's see. It's great the way you can easily delegate tasks to staff and management, depending on how busy you are with other things. So far it is the best of the modern FM games and I highly recommend it.

One of the striking disappointments is the SAME media questions being recycled for the 5th year running, which makes the whole thing feel monotonous. Symbolic, really, of how the franchise has lost its beating heart. The game is no longer fun anymore with so much crammed onto the screen (for stats sake) the eyes are overwhelmed by text and numbers on skins that are cheap and garish. The 3d match engine gets worse with each iteration, and 2020's effort resembles a 6th formers animation project, with players gliding surreally gliding around the pitch loosely coinciding with ball movement. Goal replays are dampened as the ball crashes into the net and the spectators remain seated, and then... oh, they're up and celebrating a little while after. The training screen is so busy now, it just makes you want to ignore this aspect of the game because its simply to onerous to manage or understand how on earth any of it will impact upon your team. The Player Search list is now cumbersome with each player listing now 2-3 rows in width which prolongs the process of browsing for players. Since 2017, the joy has simply been sucked out of these games by a developer who seems intent on ripping out everything that was good about the game and replacing it with ridiculously packed screens of mostly inconsequential data. Sega/SI would be better off building a baseline game based on some of the better versions, and simply keep it updated. They'll still be quids in. The constant unnecessary tweaks to the game are killing it.",1600983258,1600983258,FALSE,3,0,0.543396235,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,75,4,2213,1643,625,1602019554,,

14,Football Manager 2020,76075660,english,"I don't often play sports games. When I do though, they mainly consist of racing titles such as F1, or Assetto Corsa. And, in this case, Football Manager. I'm still relatively green, so to speak, to this series, starting with 2019 last year. As someone who does enjoy football, I felt as though I'd be doing myself a disservice [i]not[/i] trying out FM2019. I enjoyed it, of course. That's why I'm here writing a review for FM2020.[hr][/hr]I will be honest. I suck at this game. But. Honestly? That's part of the fun. A lot of FM's charm comes from the audacious (and scarily realistic) it can be at times. For instance, in 2025, Manchester United re-sign Cristiano Ronaldo for £200 million, or something ridiculous. And FM has gotten these kinds of things correct in previous titles. [hr][/hr]The amount of control you get is second to none. I mean. It has to be. [i]You're[/i] the manager. Other football titles such as FIFA and PES offer a more casual experience, but lack any sense of control with what you do. You control one player at a time and have to pray and hope the AI doesn't decide to alt+F4 itself. (In FIFA's case, it does that all the bloody time) Football Manager, on the other hand, is more complex than that. While you don't control any single player, you do control how the team behaves. Do they go for the attack, wanting to demolish their opposition? Do they sit back and defend for their lives to win a relegation 6-pointer or prevent their title rivals getting the upper hand on them?[hr][/hr]If you are inclined to, you can always start from the ground up as a new and upcoming football club. From the grass-roots of Sunday League, where players eat pie and chips with a pint of bitter to boot for breakfast; to the glory of lifting the Premier League (or Premier Division due to licensing rights; this can be changed with the free FM20 Editor add on) trophy. [hr][/hr]TL;DR - if you're a football fan and you've not played Football Manager, where have you been? If you want complete control over your team, this is the game for you.

Your choice of tactics have absolutely no bearing on the outcome. Ask them to play a short passing game and they will boot it long, ask them to ease off tackling and you'll get 4 or 5 Yellow cards. ....and so many disallowed goals...and never ever a handball!!
To check it out properly I used the FM Editor, boosted 7 or 8 of my York players to Premiership level  ratings...absolutely zero effect. i still got the sack.
i'm digging FM 19 out and starting with that again.

It also helps that this really feeds into my OCD and the management aspect of football is lacking in the other 2 major football games (FIFA and PES). I was playing the Demo for most part of the year (too expensive) before buying the full version recently (on sale). Short summary:

Pros:
Very deep and informative system
All inclusive in terms of various aspects of the sport
Refined Match Engine (compared to previous titles)
Scores of options to start your journey (I always start out unemployed)
Widest collection of clubs and countries and national teams
A huge community online to keep engagement

Cons
Lack of licenses (easily fixable with mods)
Sometimes different features of the games can be too difficult to understand
Almost too in-depth sometimes to have fun playing (I haven't experienced this but many people I know have)
The game can be brutally unforgiving at times

And that's my short review! I might edit in the future if I feel something should be added/removed. Have fun managing!",1599323787,1599323787,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,70,2,2676,438,1803,1601993840,,

I agree with this, to an extent, as there is nothing more fruitful than being able to connect spiritually and emotionally with the team you support on the football pitch. However, while playing this game, the only thing I can connect with is my fist to the screen because this game is utter nonsense, it is the epitome of crap, it is the personification of a headache. Aight, so listen, hear me out. Why the heck do my players always become prime Mo Salah when they are in the box, they literally need 10 good chances to score 1 goal. Not only that, my players seem to become Raheem Sterling in the sense that not only do they only score tap ins, they also crapping miss tap ins. What the heck. Nah, we can't let us this fly. Not to mention that your team could have 30 shots but lose to a team that have 5 shots. Yeah, that does happen in football sometimes, I ain't disputing that, but this happens literally every 3 games in FM. They should change the abbreviation to ""FML"" at this point, cuz that's how it feels like when I'm playing this game.

15,Football Manager 2020,74624017,english,"I've been playing different entries of football manager/championship manager since the late 90s and I've liked some and disliked others. Unfortunately, football manager 2020 will definitely go in the disliked category for me, which is really a shame because there are several things about the game that I did like. The interface is pretty,  lot of the club management features work well and new additions such as the club's vision and the development center are pretty cool and add to the overall experience. 

The major problem with football manager 2020 however, at least in my experience after having played this years' game for 50+ hours (plus about 20 hours with the demo), is that this year's version is incredibly frustrating and just not that much fun at all. I really wish I could go back in time and not pick up the demo or pay for the full game because overall I feel that I just wasted a great deal of my time, and a little bit of money, and have gotten very little enjoyment in return. In fact, most of my time playing this year's game has been mostly terribly stressful and frustrating. 

My only save in this year's game, which I started with the demo, was managing Juventus (called Zebre in this year's version since they didn't have the full naming rights for the team). After struggling to win the league in my first year (ended two points ahead of second placed team, AC Milan) I finally had a pretty decent second season winning the league comfortably after bringing in a bunch of new signings such as James Rodriguez, Cavani, David Neres and David Silva. My performance in Europe meanwhile was truly embarrassing, having been eliminated in the group stage in the first season and in the round of last 16 by Lyon in the second season (got killed in the away game 0-3), despite having a pretty great team. However, it was truly in my third season that things got ugly. After signing a number of great players, some young and promising (Fabio Silva, Antony) and others highly skilled and experienced (Aubameyang, Oblak) I started the season by beating Roma 3-1. This was the kind of result that I would have expected and I was happy to start the season with a victory. After that it was all downhill though, getting destroyed by Napoli (1-5 away) in the second game and accumulating a number of bad results after that no matter what I tried to do. This is when I decided enough was enough and uninstalled the game.

I understand that winning all the time would not be fun or realistic but it just felt that I was really not having all that much fun at all with this year's game and that overall the game just wasn't fair. The basic team and tactics that had allowed me to comfortably win the league in my second season all of sudden simply didn't work at all and after I started losing there was no stopping the bleeding essentially. Really, no matter what I did I could not get good results or have the team play well, especially away from home, and while I want the game to be realistic I just didn't feel that it was.

In FM 2018, the last FM I played before FM 2020, I had enjoyed a tremendously successful run with West Ham, having eventually built up the club to win the Premier League several times and even win the Champions League, and even though away matches had always proved difficult I never had the same degree of underperformance as in this year's game. I really feel that the game is either not fair or it is not telling the players what they should do to correct their mistakes and have their teams perform better. 

Overall, I would certainly say that I wish I hadn't played this year's game and I really, really hope I don't make the same mistake next year and buy this game, even at a discount. The game requires too much of a time investment in my opinion to ultimately deliver such a frustrating and unfair experience. My advice is stay away from this game or play at your own peril...",1597943198,1597943666,FALSE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,133,8,3073,0,3073,1597860800,,

21,Football Manager 2020,74608551,english,"I am reluctantly going to give this a thumbs down. Now, i'm reluctant because i do enjoy the game, as i'm pretty sure anyone who likes football and/or management games would do to some extent. The problem with it is the lack of realism in the matches and results, which has been an issue in previous versions but nowhere near to the same level as in this 2020 version.

I will give some examples of what i mean. There have been games where my team has completely outplayed the opposition, i have had over 30 shots on target, over 50 shots in total. The opposition has 2 shots, guess which team wins that game 2-0? That's right, not mine. Throughout these games their 2 star goalkeeper makes absolutely world class and, in many instances, physics breaking saves that would quite literally be impossible in real life. Meanwhile my 4.5 star at this point best in the game goalkeeper can't even catch a ball. The goals the opposing team scores are almost always shots that should be saved with ease. I have seen the opposition keeper save a shot that is hit from 2 yards, as hard as it can be and right in the corner yet somehow their keeper saves it. As i said, physics breaking and completely unrealistic.

Now this has been a problem that has come up in previous version of the game, but before it would happen in maybe 2 or 3 games a season, which i guess was supposed to represent that on very rare occasions you may get a game like that. In this 2020 version this seems to happen almost every other game. It completely spoils the realism and immersion of the game when you beat a title rival 5-1 then the next week lose 1-0 to the team which is bottom of the league even though you have 25 shots on target compared to their 1 shot. 

So, this is why i am reluctantly giving this years version a thumbs down. I enjoy it, you will probably enjoy it, but the complete lack of realism is very jarring and very frustrating. Especially so when they like to advertise themselves as being the most realistic manager sim out there. If i were you i would do yourself a favour and buy the 2018 version, update the player lists with mods.

The only thing im disliking since 17 (i think) is this role thing where you cant not give some combinated instructions just because the game dont want you to do. In real life, some players create roles, not just follow specific ones, if it wasnt the case, the programmers were not adding new roles each edition, they could keep it, and add an option where you can create a role for a position.

Board expectations are extremely unrealistic. You always need to do better than last year in order to please the board. Also the board always forces you to play certain playing style, which you can't negotiate even with godlike determination skill. Also the interface is disabled to change the level of importance to certain requirements.

Player training is fake, players have baked in attributes that you ""unlock"" via training, but you can NEVER train something that you think the player would actually benefit from.
Absolutely retarded training system.

Match instruction options are far few and uncreative and repetitive.

UI has so many glitches all over the place, for example setting up set piece takers is ultimately bogus.

You can opt to have your assistant manager to handle the ultimately boring and repetitive and goddamn stupid interview questions, but it will obliterate your media handling reputation, reducing your chances to get another job.

If your team fail to produce results, it is career ending, don't expect any job offers, regardless of your legendary manager skills, your reputation is irreversibly annihilated.

Old players skyrocket into being useless at a much faster rate than in reality. It is laughable how all football manager game predicted Christiano Ronaldo to deteriorate hungarian division 3 level. And guess what, yet he is still playing for Juventus, how come dudes? To make it even worse, in this game they will NEVER accept lower salary. Even if they play at the level of a 2nd world war veteran at the age of 110, they will ask more than in their prime years. Rendering all old players not just a big gamble, but an expensive money waste.

Game loading is disabled during a match. Making save scumming the most annoying experience in this game.

At least it's realistic that all the English leagues are full of useless overpriced crap! At least you don't need much brains to do well on the transfer market. Avoid English players like the plague and you will do just fine.

Btw transfer market expectations of the board is also ridiculous. When you want to meet league criteria, you need to buy players from your own nation. But they are limited. All the clubs are fighting for them, driving up their price. Especially the good ones. When you sign players that play international level, you will always hear the board whine about their price. Even though you kind of assembled the best team within your nation, they will crybaby about it. Ridiculous.

Then the transfer revenue percentage. Every now and then they will reduce your transfer revenue percentage, just because why not. Although it takes just about asking them to raise it back - to make it completely retarded.

Oh, god no, the coaches. There are so few that are actually good. Coach training is completely useless. You can't realistically max out your coaches.

Also improving your training facilities. Takes tens of years. You can bump it once every year. And you can only afford that if you won every match that is physically possible with your dudes - and it takes all your revenue. Tell Ronaldinho that it takes billions of dollars and tens of years to get a proper training facility together. They can't just kick the rubber in a courtyard, cos that way they will never have the ""potential"". So freakin dumb mechanic.

Sponsors are nearly non-existent. Even if you massively over-perform and somehow cheat yourself to win the Champions league with a lower division team. You will still only have the 100$ yearly backing of the local grocery store. Maybe you will get an extra 30$ offer from the local fake KFC clone.

If you manage to improve your team, you will end up having all the old shitty players whine about playing time - even if they regularly play in your B team against opponents that they used to fight against. No they complain, that they want to play against Liverpool with their one and a half star rating.

Youth. Omygod! You can have godlike coaches, if you have your youth facilities too low, you will always end up getting complete garbage players.

Additional training focus is just a joke. A player with a skill of 5 on penalties can't improve it. Just forget it. Even though if Ronaldo and Messi are mentoring him together. I guess a cripple in a wheelchair has better prospect to be a professional fotballer in reality than your youth players in this game.

Custom team actually doesn't fully give you the freedom. And you can't delete your custom players, so if you made a mistake and create the same player slightly modified, it will have a clone.
Also the original modified team's members will be available on a free transfer. For example if you sack the Barca, you will have all the top players available for free and suddenly Manchester United will buy all of them, good luck winning champions league with your custom team after that!

There is no easy to understand guide how you should set your team to succeed. Trial and error is completely useless cos of extreme RNG.

From all the above, the predetermined player skills are the most annoying as this mechanic completely takes out the long term strategy of football. Why would you adopt a certain training if the players have LOCKED-IN skills that never react to any kind of training, even with godlike coaches and godlike training equipment and quadruple training intensity, they will simply say: No effect.

So all it remains is a transfer market game. Buy the players with the skills already in place. Because you can't train them as you like.

Fulfilling:
- Managing a football/soccer team, signing players, scouting, tweaking tactics
- Silly fun
- Playing in MLS
- Building from the bottom of a pyramid in England to the top
- Load/save (best feature of the game)

Lame:
- The game is harsh and illogical, yoyo-ing results even as you build a consistent deep team that wins, wins, wins. One minute your GK saves amazing goals - the next minute, he doesn't know what the ball is doing.
- Broken stat/attribute systems that don't really make any sense.
- Your tactics are probably fine - the game is dumb.
- The computer switches tactics far faster than a human player or manager ever could. This should be fixed.
- Win 20 games in a row? Doesn't matter - the next game your guys will forget how to pass out of the back, always head balls to opponents, and struggle.
- Win championships? Your players will still act shocked when you tell them they are capable of beating Manchester United in the Carabao Cup final, and then you go and do it, and then next time, they still act shocked when you suggest they are capable of winning it all. So dumb.
- Go unbeaten in a season and then play like they hardly know each other in a game against a tougher opponent. Seriously, fix this!

For my humble opinion, this game was still ok until 2017 release, where i was not suffocated with too many, but really too many details, which kill the enjoyment of the game. if i really wanted to become a football manager in real life, i would do what is necessary for it. but wait: this is just a 'GAME'. This ,(at least) 'WAS' a game when there were 'acceptable amount' of details. This was a game when there were 'acceptable amount' of challenges,which were still pushing me to use my brain. 

It now turned out an algebraic calculus where i should take all the tiny hells into consideration. I am sure some people would now say: This is the realism. Really? Are you guys sure Football is something like this? Are you guys  seriously sure that any of the managers in real life calculate the effect of 'intuition' or 'determination of a backup left wing on the pitch? where is your passion guys? who cares about the match engine?

The negative review is because there is little effort put into the series, FM has been little more than a roster update with minor tweaks. Just compare it to out of the park baseball which completely blows it out of the water. In comparison this looks like a budget title but it isn't. About the only things FM does better is scouting and the 3D looks better. It's getting a little boring that there's never any real additions.

Ootp has you start at any time with the rosters and rules of that time with the players emerging and rules been added as time goes on. Customise the rules. Create new leagues with new teams easily with an easy way to give them logos and jerseys. Adding custom jerseys and logos is much easier in general you could easily change them out every year if you wanted. Put players of every era in so for example want pele and zidane in 2020 go ahead. Feel you can have a much bigger impact on the match with tactics and choices though this is partly because baseball is easier to do that for than football. A match engine that makes sense and works. It runs considerably faster and better they also call their skip a skip instead of a holiday. Even something as minor as the facegen is better. What have we gotten in FM? Tweets and press interviews :).

Match engine is made horribly making me question (yet again) the development capability as much as their knowledge of football altogether.

The next game probably won't release until November/December, meaning that there will be 10 months of absolutely no updates between releases. A shocking practice that isn't worth supporting.

Which they won't, by the way.  For the quintessential FM2020 experience, just ask your team to 'work the ball into the box' and watch them pass it sideways back and forth until the entire opposition team is behind the ball, and then either stand still shuddering on the spot like a pensioner having a stroke until they get dispossessed, or give up and smack the ball against the nearest defender.  If you try to play attacking football, you get beaten by long balls over and over.  Try to defend and watch 25 yard worldies repeatedly scream into the corner of your net.

The biggest issue I have is there is bunch of LGBT flags almost on every stadium including Turkish and Russian clubs but also when you do other matches in non-registered teams like Middle East, makes 0 sense to have LGBT on Saudi Arabia, and it feels like Devs are promoting so much to spread political values on a football game. I have no issue seeing LGBT flag on Western clubs, but seeing these on Turkish or Russian teams or in Africa, Asia or Middle East makes 0 sense and a perfect example of 1st World Liberalism forcing values on 3rd World countries, and acting like they are inferior or barbarians.

66,Football Manager 2020,72009657,english,"A review from a player who had 500 hours in FM19 ( the real number is more than 1000hrs i believe) and someone who had played the series for 10 years since i was a kid.

If you are new players: It's a must play which improvements from FM19. But its not change much compare to the last, if you jump from FM15 or FM16, it will be a whole new experience. But from FM18 and 19, not so much.
Good:
- Youth Academy is a good add on. I think they should make it long time ago not until 2020.
- Staff is now very active and lively. Head of youth development is actively seek and buy youth prospect at a bargain price. The old version just splash lots of cash, pay overprice for a youth player.
- Match Engine: a little more realistic, speed, strength and balance actually show clearly in the match. You will see the clearly different between a fast and slow player, an outpace or a successful dribble is satisfying to watch, also there is fake turn where the attacker trick the defender by dribbling in the opposite direction. A strong and good player will still standing and not lose the ball even taken 2-3 successful tackle from opponent.
- I haven't seen any weird angle shot yet like many players report.
Cons:
- Match Engine: yep, still ME, I gonna break down each situation below.
In 2019 ME, when ST receive ball in the middle, he will dribble and usually lose the ball or try to pass to the wing and slowly run to the enemy third. Its usually not end up in a goal.
2020 ME, ST receive the ball with a beautiful touch and turn on Saiyan mod. Dribble through both the defenders and 1v1 with the goalkeeper.
And talk about the 1v1, what seperate it from real life is i never seen an attacker that lob the ball, dribble around the keeper  or nutmeg. Just a boring hopeful shot.
- Player's value: I have a feeling that the value of player is higher than previous years, some player with very normal stats, sure he have potential but no way that guy price is 30~40 mil. In FM19 my player would be very good and it take a top performance season to reach 20 30 mil.",1593856863,1595643963,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,117,14,11501,503,882,1601917154,,

79,Football Manager 2020,73171895,english,"This game (and the games before it) converted me into a football fan, and I had barely any appreciation of sports before that point.

Football Manager is, in gaming terms, like a grand strategy RPG. You have the grand strategy element of heaps and heaps of numbers going up and down and the initial confusion of understanding what any of them mean, as well as being able to play for 400 hours (like I have) and realise you understand absolutely nothing about the game, and still having that creeping feeling that you really don't know what you're doing.

The RPG element comes from your players. Each of your players has their own wants and needs, and you have to balance your match day squad as best as possible. It's not just a case of ""who's best at what"" (although sometimes it can be) - you might need to settle a disgruntled player, or give one of your younger players a chance to shine and get some experience in the first team.

It's hard to show what the appeal of the FM series is unless you really sink your teeth into it. I can honestly say I get ridiculously immersed in this game. You experience the highs and lows of your labour, cringing when your team has an awful defeat and cheering when they do well. Were you responsible? Was it just RNG? Who knows, but it's fun, isn't it? Trying to work out what's actually you and what is just smoke and mirrors is part of the fun.

What I'm trying to say is, even if you're not a fan of football and sport, if you have an interest in grand strategy or complex RPGs you may just appreciate the incredibly diverse and immersive game that has the potential to grab you here. For me, players like Alessandro Rossi, Hendrick Weydandt and Luismi are burned into my brain, and I've gotten a brand new appreciation for the complexity and nuance that the sport of football has.

Squad, staff and club management.

GAME-PLAY>>>>>>>>8
Good. For gamer's who love to analyse lists,stats and look at lots of info. Should be higher but has some annoying and frustrating elements in the match engine. Like forwards struggling with one-on-ones (!?!?!) and players taking impossible angled shots instead of making an obvious pass. You'll cheer and you'll curse so i guess the end result is good enough.

GRAPHICS>>>>>>>>3
Bad. So bad that a lot of ppl don't even use the 3-D match engine and still use the older 2-D mode or even the text only mode. Fifa 2000 has better graphics. The vanilla user interface and menu layout is not great and has only changed its colours the last 8 years. Most ppl play with user made UI's.

MUSIC&SOUND>>>>5
Average. No music. Sound effects are ok, they do the job. But little to no attempt to incorporate more stadium atmosphere or teams chants. 

POLISH>>>>4
Average. This series has a reputation of not making any major changes to the core experience. With every years game basically being a database update. Every edition needs a patch to sort numerous issues out from the launch version. You could for example play FB manager 2012 and not notice to much difference in overall experience. With the most notable changes since then being more depth surrounding injuries(sigh) and some minor interface changes and menus that show things that used to be hidden like team hierarchy, squad dynamics. Which since i can remember has been part of the game, players just lacked visual representation of those aspects.

REPLAY VALUE>>>>8.5
Good, almost great. Mainly a single player game but multiplayer is possible, as well as steam leader boards. If you are big football fan and really get into this game it could really suck you in and you could find yourself putting hundreds of hours into this. You could play with one team to the year 2100 if you manage not to get fired or you could jump around to different leagues or even manage international teams if you are bored of club football. For me the game gets really interesting when the original ""real player"" database is fazed out eventually and gets replaced by newly generated players and where scouting becomes one of the most fun parts of the game. 

OVERALL>>>>>>>>57%
Objectively not a good game. The core game is decent enough but the devs havn't given players anything new and substantial for years. The mechanics are questionable, the graphics are plain bad and the sound is average. This game prides itself on its database and simulation but that has been largely unchanged for nearly a decade. The only reason why you would buy the newest FB manager is to get a updated database which doesn't justify the price.

Arsenal teammates and two time World Cup winners Seon Rochford and Edward Bennett have dominated the Golden Globe for the past 5 years, finally losing out to their (now) teammate Dario Torres, the Argentinian striker. This team can be the best in the world, and are one game away from another Invincible season for the Arsenal.

For example, you are going to play a very important game in the Champions League, and suddenly all your team gets injuries. All season without bad injuries and suddenly you can't play with ur prefer players.

Arsenal has zero injuries. I don't know how this can be called ""realistic"". 
For FM2020, playing with a Portuguese team against Mahrez, Ozil, Aubameyang, and Lacazete it's not enough, they need injurie half of your team...! What a j-o-k-e.
If you are comfortable in your national league (1st) and you want to make a good CL, this can be a lost season. Saying in another way, losing my precious time. 

You can say all these injuries it's ""bad luck"", but we all know it's not. This happens frequently in the biggest season games. It's basically the IA being biased in a very silly way and calling you retarded...  I play this kind of games since CM and can easily identify some patterns.

EDIT: As of February update the game is much better. All of the issues above have been resolved for the most part. Here are some additional issues I've noticed: 

The game tends to favor gegen pressing heavily, good luck sitting deep and trying to defend (although may be my tactics) 

Wingers and Fullbacks tend to blast the ball in a for a cross off defenders frequently, even though instructed to cross less often and playing narrow system. 

Annoying amount of offsides being shown on comprehensive highlights, since there is no instruction to tell the players to be more careful why show them over and over to me? 

Defenders frequently head/kick the ball out for a corner when they could clear it elsewhere

There is a glitch that allows you to sell your player for any sum you want (right click after offer accepted and type in whatever price you wish) 

Some of the descriptions are not written very clearly in what they do and how they impact the team, may be tough for new players to get into the game. Example, mentality should be rebranded as risk. 

Match sideline shouts are broken and/or not explained clearly in what they are supposed to do. Basically only demand more, praise (when up a goal), and get creative work, the rest just make my team lose focus for no reason.

It's a game you love to hate, hate to love, love to love and hate to hate at the very same time. I am pretty familliar with football as a sports, but I wouldn't call myself exactly a fanatic. But this game (and serial in general) is something I can't let go out of my hands. It does have that certain level of simulation value, where you can see what could happen, how would something look in certain conditions and it does always make sense.

Not only that, but it's the only game in this world which brings me to the very top and the very next game slams me down right into the ground. To a non-FM player it's pretty hard to explain how it feels when your regional club manages to snatch a draw against a club like Real Madrid in Champions League only to suffer a humbling defeat against a last placed club in your domestic league the very next game. And it's like a d*ug, you just can't let it go. 
When it goes good, you can't drop the game because you are on a roll, when it's bad you can't drop the game because you're not just some sissy that's giving up when times get rough.

Unfortunately it's let down by being structurally broken for one simple reason. The tactics and match engine are appalling. It takes away from everything else, as you feel you can't link what you have instructed the team to do vs what they are doing, and more importantly, what the opposition do. 

If you press, they half-arse it, the opposition dance round you and score. If you sit back, the opposition pass round you and score. Your players can't or seemingly choose not to tackle, meaning the opposition will literally run by your defenders like they're not there whilst your player stands still and lets them by. Your team cannot mark an opposition player in any situation and do not win any defensive second balls

This would actually all be forgivable if the opposition suffered the same flaws as you. However, this is FM so they don't. If you decide to get everyone behind the ball because you're fed up of watching your team not even try to defend, then whoever you're playing will score multiple 25 yard strikes to the top corner - with no correlation to their long shots and technique stats. If you try and engage in any way, well whoever has the ball becomes Messi incarnate and will happily run past multiple defenders to score  - again, with no correlation to their dribbling and finishing. I won't mention your team's inability to finish clear and half chances vs the opposition for my own sanity

For example, youth intake is different, something you can't take advantage of (unrealistic stuff taken away that can be taken advantage of).
Another example, your players moaning about not having enough players in the squad and giving me only 7 days to make transfers. You can't do that in 7 days, so what happens is you have an unhappy player.
Another example, players in english non-league, who are free signing wanting over 20k per week. WTF is with that? 
I have the media chats, they've been the same for years now. It's boring.
Also a lack of flexibility when talking to players about problems, they won't accept 9/10 of the stuff that you say and then get an unhappy player.
Previous years I have enjoyed, however this I haven't. I didn't mind the unrealistic stuff, but the game is unbalanced in the way, where the unrealistic stuff that make the game difficult, don't change, but the exploits do.

In all seriousness though, the match engine is a disaster-class. 

Bang average at best players employ their 10-11 dribbling skill to run past 3 world class defenders on the regular.

You get 1-2 goals disallowed and 3-4 shots hitting the post literally every game. 

Mediocre goalkeepers manage to parry 15-20 shots per game while their equally mediocre forward teammates convert 2 out of 3.

15+ marking defenders make it a point to leave opposing players completely alone, instead marking their own teammates.

Defenders pull off sliding tackles on their own teammates in their own box, but absolutely refuse to attempt tackles on opponents advancing towards their goal.

And speaking of sliding tackles, on the off-chance someone actually performs one on an opponent, the ball only moves about 5 cm so the tackled player shrugs, picks it up again and continues his run. That's not how physics work, SI!

FM20 does the best job of any instalment so far of improving and expanding on the good and dealing with the negatives.

The match engine is fantastic. Players move in a convincing way; stepovers, Cruyff turns, stop-and-go, all represented here in the best match engine to date. Yes the crowd animations are repetitive but you know what, if you want to play FIFA, go and play FIFA.

The IMMENSE scale of the game means you might feel overwhelmed by your responsibilities and the sheer amount of clicking you need to do to establish your latest season but please, friend, worry not! Along with all these new options comes a wealth of new staff responsibilities, and you can delegate or take charge at your leisure, Like to finalise signings but don't really care about the scouting side of things? Delegate it. Prefer to find those hidden gems yourself but couldn't care less about negotiating their contracts? Sure, delegate it. Want to keep an eye on your blossoming U23 side but the U18s are just too far off your radar right now? Guess what? Delegate it.

I haven't been this impressed with the advances in a Football Manager title since FM13, everything you can think of that would improve the series from FM19 is here. Data presentation is fantastic, player development and progression is as close to perfection as it could be. FM20 makes the complicated things seem simple and makes the simple things seem effortless. To me, this is now THE Football Manager title.

Simply put, FM20 is a defining moment in the history of Football Manager titles. Make no mistake, this one is a classic. Though you may not find the next Tonton Zola Mokouko sitting in Derby County's reserves, every story you do write for yourself on this genre-defining game will carry its own memories and legacy and surely that is the highest praise of all.

- Watching my team execute my custom tactics in wonderful 3D Extended Highlights
- Having the ability to hire the right supporting staff to reduce all the micromanagement required in running your clubs (first squads, youths, and academy) and makes the game faster
- Fully customizable game database
- Solid In-game Editor with the option to deactivate it for the purists

Dislikes:
- Technical Issue: One (1) Fatal Crash To Desktop experienced so far during the halftime of my Unemployed Career game (forum discussion suggests possible fatal issue with NVIDIA graphics cards). I hope the crash did not corrupt my save file...
- TONS and TONS of menus in game. It can be overwhelming to someone who's not used to FM games
- I notice that my days are going by so fast
- TONS and TONS of menus in game. Several features (like managing Youth leagues and your Academy) are only accessible via it's own tiny clickable button inside another menu that may be easily missed.
- I have suffered many sleepless nights so far since I installed the game
- Have I already mentioned that there are TONS and TONS of menus in game? I wish the next FM game would have a simpler UI.

Nonetheless, it's still worth the purchase (especially when it goes on Sale) !!! :D

31,Football Manager 2020,72017021,english,"FM 20 is the alarming case, when SI releases two versions of the the game consecutively worse than the previous one. FM 19 was an attempt to overhaul tactical side of the game and quite expectedly many changes didn't go too well, resulting in inconsistent Match Engine, where player simply can't see results of his choices, because intructions fail to apply. It was understandable and I hoped these issues would be fixed next year. They were not, in fact they got even worse.

Completely unrealistic chance coversions, GKs never following instructions, wingers mindlessly hitting balls when there are two open teammates in the box, nerfed strikers, passive counter mentality, you name it. Adding this to already existing problems like neverchanging interviews, interactions with useless options, unbalanced transfer market, stale world simulation and overestimated reputation effect, and you get the clear sign that SI have stopped paying attention to players feedback. We don't really need loan manager or any other fancy roles, when DoF is still useless, here's your example

Now don't get me wrong, I'm still a fan and FM is my favourite addiction, but I see 19 as a failed step forward and 20 is worse than 19. I'll keep playing, but I'm concerned that series are going backwards, and devs are applying cosmetic changes to a stale team management, in the meantime messing up match engine more and more. Eventually this might hurt them

Cutting to the chase, if you pick top club and apply plug and play tactics, you'l have a blast and win things. If your FM experience is playing for underdogs, developing club and tinkering with tactics and scouting, you might be up for a frustrating experience",1593865501,1593952044,FALSE,5,0,0.55477953,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,2,1,26876,2070,15500,1602021443,,

The new addition of random goals being scored out of absolutely nowhere with no build up has on occasion made me want to smash my computer, this isn't necessary and adds nothing positive to the game.
Can honestly say that in the past ten games played, opposition GK have had unrealistically good performances. Expected on the odd game but not every game.
The better your team gets, the harder the game makes it which is great as it continues making the game challenging however, is also unrealistic in ways of world class strikers going from scoring 40 goals a season to not being able to put the ball past a bottom of the league keeper.

The game is highly addictive but unfortunately, there are more negatives to the gameplay than positives.

The thing that really immerses me in the game is the 3D Match Engine, for me, its the part where you get to see all your hard work pay off (or fail) and unfortunately, there isn't much of an improvement in that regard.

Don't get me wrong here, I love FM20 but you would think that 3-4 years down the line, it might actually look a bit more improved than it is.
The other thing that irks me, and I'm sure, many others is that on release, FM always has many problems, bugs, errors etc..  They have a whole year to get it right, why do they release a game at +£40 and then take 6 months to make it playable?  It makes people mad every year, with the money they suck out of us each year, you'd think that SEGA/FM would offer a more polished product on release.  I'd happily pay full price every year if there were improvements that worked out of the box.

First off, this might arguably be the best FM in terms of all the control and freedom it provides to you, with a slightly better UI and performance. However the thing that really goes against the game is the match engine, which is, well, horrendous to put it mildly. It has been getting worse over the past few years but, this might just be the worse one. I really don't know what I can add that hasn't already been covered in countless other reviews.

I love FM, I've played like 10 different editions of this game, but if you have FM 19, or even 18, I wont recommend buying this game. Rather download editor data and update transfers than buying this game.

The best thing about this game is that the graphics are a little better when playing a match. Player animations are clearer and the ball really curves now when shots are taken. Nothing major but it does make for a better playing experience. I also like the addition of the Video Assistant Referee. 

Obviously, the game has updated players and this is another big advantage when you want to use players that are at your club now (especially if your team in real-life has improved!). 

The interface is quite loud and a bit confusing for me. I preferred FM 2017 because it was simpler and cleaner. However, you do get used to it and over time it becomes easier to find out where things are and how to adjust settings. I recommend increasing the text size.

The gameplay has also been updated to include 'gegenpressing' and other tactics. It just makes an already good game better and it is worth getting it in the sale! 8/10.

But honestly almost nothing has changed. The match engine is laughably bad at this point. And that's not just because the graphics look like absolute shit but because it is super scripted. Sometimes the game seems to tell the match engine ""I need team A to score now"" and then out of nowhere the wildest combination of passes and mistakes happen which lead to a bullshit goal. You don't feel like you are in charge. So often your defenders just let the enemy run through, so often your goalkeeper makes an obvious mistake and so often your striker just kicks it out of the stadium.

Every year they promise an improved match engine but every year it is a letdown. Also almost every year the match engine is broken for the first few months.

22,Football Manager 2020,60132554,english,"It's OK adding pointless extras like social media, which in my opinion is one reason why football is heading down the toilet, but until they address the pathetic match engine it will never improve. Same story as every other incarnation - having 30-40 shots per game and failing to score more than a couple of goals, whereas opposition score from almost every chance, inexplicable decision making, clunky wooden player movements.... same old, same old.

Still, when idiots like me continue to buy it, they don't need to invest to improve it, do they?!

I get that it is a simulation game, and its about the strategy not the graphics. But nothing that happens when you watch the game is reflective of the instructions given to players, so it would be better to remove the match simulation if they aren't willing to improve it. 'Run at defence', 'hit early crosses', 'cross from deep' may as well be removed, because the players never do any of them. A personal favourite is seeing your player shoot (usually from a ridiculous angle) and it gets blocked by a defender, then ricochets back into your own six yard box!! Are these players made out of concrete?!

The decisions players make are laughable; apparently world class players shooting from impossible angles, hitting shots straight at the goalkeeper instead of squaring it to an unmarked team-mate, and playing suicide passes across the front of their back four are evident numerous times in every game.

Aside from the match engine, there is also very little scope for digging out a bargain. In FM19, it was possibly too easy to pick up young, cheap players who would go on to become stars, but this version has gone to the other extreme. You find a half-decent youngster playing for a village team in Nigeria, and his club want £25m for him. Again, they just can't get the balance right. 

What is desperately required is a rival game, ideally made by people who understand football. The makers of FM have become lazy and complacent as despite how bad the game continues to be, there is very little competition in this space.",1576784701,1592684690,FALSE,7,0,0.483870953,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,8,3,43585,0,1118,1593283013,,

36,Football Manager 2020,70444864,english,"In summary - a brilliant game let down by a less than adequate match engine.

Having logged nearly 500 hours and played through 9 seasons, unfortunately I cannot look beyond the glaring issues on match day any longer. Ultimately, the higher up the divisions you go, the more frustrating the match engine gets.

Cons - 

1. One on ones are completely broken. You will find that in the lower leagues the problem may not be as prevalent due to awful goalkeeping being a regular occurrence, but once you reach the top divisions, keepers are impossible to beat or your player misses the target 99 times out of 100. The AI misses chances too, but let's not ignore a fundamental flaw. I think the missed chances are relating to match engine balancing - it is too easy to generate one-on-one situations so the conversion rate is kept artificially low by dreadful finishing.  

2. Set pieces are far too powerful, leading to a myriad of goals. Penalties and goals scored from direct free kicks are realistic, but corners and indirect free kicks are too bigger source of goals.

3. Inexcusably, the set piece creator does not mirror what is seen on match day, so you have a game which doesn't replicate the instructions you have assigned in this area. This can lead to conceding goals that otherwise would not have been conceded. Specifically, throw ins are a complete farce and need a rethink from the developers. You cannot have one throw in instruction for defending and one for attacking, it needs to be split into four sections - the defensive quarter near your own goal, two quarters either side of the halfway line and the attacking quarter near the opponents goal. 

4. Goal variety - set piece, cross followed by a back post header from a winger, long shot, winger dribbling 50 yards into the area and an occasional error. I can count on one hand how many times I've witnessed a central midfielder assist via a through ball. There needs to be a complete overhaul of movement in the opposition's half to generate a more fulfilling goal variety.

Pros -      

1. Everything outside of the match engine, seriously. Massive kudos to the development team here as the games feels very polished and rewarding. 
 
This edition is the equivalent of playing GTA's story all the way to the end, then for a big screen to pop up saying they didn't get a chance to finish the final mission. Damn.

60,Football Manager 2020,57809103,english,"Game has stagnated for the past few years. ME is plagued with bugs from release, and the game MAY be playable by the last patch in March. That is if the devs get their act together and pull their finger out and focus their attention to all aspects of the game. ME animations are still sub par and looks like something you would find in Actua Soccer 99. Its not all about the graphics, but the animations make it look much worse. Furthermore, the ME is buggy. Far too many one on ones via long through balls, players hardly cross anymore, the ME just feels linear and is a joke to put simply

Posted numerous bug reports but I am officially done. Nothing gets done and im fed up. The developers are far too apathetic and egotistic and are in another world. The game is no where near good enough; compare the ME too FM12 and FM14. Those were much better IMO. Im not sure what planet the devs are on or what they smoke, but their behaviour and attitude needs plenty of work. The game feels like it was made by a bunch of amateurs, and clearly it has been. Tiny studio with no many resources and it clearly depicts this with the final product. Mr Brock states he wants the ME to become as close as real life as possible. I would love to know what he puts in his tea. Firstly. the match sounds have been the same for over 15 years, and CM01/02 had better sounds. Animations still pathetic, grass still looks crappy and to prove they're a joke, they release SNOW as a new feature, but cant even get it right. Have you seen how sloppy and pathetic it looks. And one of the devs quoted that it is a feature they are working on and it will get better in future versions. Are they having a laugh?? Dont release something that looks like a grade one student just drew. It literally looks like a couple white blobs my niece jotted on a piece of paper. Disgusting and just shows the state of the game and the ME at present. Pitch marks look like black dots and are pixelated and reminds me of Doom from the mid 90s.

Overall very very disappointed with the lack of progress, especially with the ME, which is their bread and butter. AI squad building still very very bad, and its relatively easy to build a champion team with pretty much any side, because the AI pulls of spastic moves and is nowhere near good enough to build a good squad. AI needs to loan much better players (lower leagues) and just improve drastically. 

I am not a member of their forums as I have been told that whatever you post, the moderators over there are quick to pounce on negativity which is surprising as I thought they were super helpful and bug reporting would assist in improving the game, but apparently SI have swept so many issues and bugs from previous versions and have yet to rectify them, and just provide a band aid fix. Example? Players hardly ever cross, where as in the previous 2-3 versions, you may as well have called it Crossing and Microsoft Excel simulator. That is how it felt. 

I highly suggest you hold off buying the game, or at least try out the demo and find out for yourself.
Too late for me to get a refund, but will definitely not buy the game for the next 3-4 years as they simply dish out the same garbage every year,. and the game is not playable up until March at the very least, and that is IF they fix the issues

FM19 was a joke as strikers were pretty much useless in the game, and guess what? SI never fixed the issues at all, so the game was pretty much broken for its entire life span. How useless is that. If you are a casual FM player and dont pay attention to these issues and dont care, sure, buy the game. But if you have purchased the last 12 games, and are a hardcore player who wants realism and immersion, do not buy the game right now. It will give you PTSD and anxiety from all the bugs and hair pulling. Potentially great game designed by a small obscure studio with poor facilities without undersoil heating and poor research facilities. 

EDIT: Here in May, and ME is broken. Small bug like the net bulging when the ball hits it was listed as a bug in January, and was never fixed. Devs are apathetic towards the game.

If you play as a big club, I think you will have a whale of a time.
But as a smaller club, there are insurmountable barriers to success.
I have spent a few seasons in Premiership mediocrity after promotion with Nottingham Forest, and the conundrum is this:
Every time I try to buy very talented players to help take me to the next level, they very quickly, and without fail, throw their toys out of the pram, demand this or that impossible sum of money, the squad morale goes down the toilet, and I lose game after game, until the only way I can steady the ship is to sell the player. This is not just the case with established world class players: even youngsters I sign at 18, after their first breakthrough season on a meagre wage, become world class divas the next season and steady the ship.

So my options: to carry on with mediocre squad players and stay in mid-table until I eventually get sacked––or buy the wonderkids and precipitate my downfall that way.

For the people who are sceptical: i got to a point in my game where a wonderkid (on 20k per week) rejected my contract offer of 150k per week + bonuses, all of the squad decided *he* had been unfairly treated and had low morale, and i had a game coming up against the 17th place team in bad form. i played this one game 8 different times, using different tactics and team-talks, and lost every time. The odds are impossibly stacked against you if you have just one big-time charlie in your team!

The game runs and the core elements work, though several things do not. Those several things are what makes a person upgrade from the previous iteration. People pay for the new instalment under the impression that it will be better than the previous...an improvement. Unfortunately, as of the release date which happens to be today, the game have several things yet to be fixed which sadly ruin the immersion of the gaming experience. Every time I face one of these bugs, I understandably become frustrated and lose interest. I understand that the bugs will be ironed out over the coming weeks, though until then I cannot recommend 2020 over 2019.

53,Football Manager 2020,69161594,english,"The gameplay and match engine is frustrating, annoying, and a lot of times unrealistic and doesn't make any sense. 
I've tried everything I possibly could but for some reason I cannot control possession to save my life. By the way, I am the Bayern Munich manager playing against the likes of Union Berlin or Hamburg or Zwickau and they dominate the game which is the closest thing to impossible that I can think of. I am dropping points to so many draws because for 60 percent of the match I am chasing the ball. The opposition always loves to knock the ball around with no purpose to their passing, just playing keep away, back to their goalie and whatnot and when I finally do get the ball I lose it just as quick as I gained it. Because of this I have a really good defensive record and a low scoring rate. 
Also scoring sometimes is garbage. I used to only be able to score long range goals from outside the box but now I can't do that anymore. I would even miss obvious clear cut chances that non-pros would make an absolute living off of because the ball doesn't want to or isn't allowed to hit the back of the net.
The gameplay is the most important component of the game and if it's this poor in my opinion, what do you really have? Is it really worth buying this game? 
Besides that I really love the game. Everything is top notch from top to bottom. It is so detailed and fun to manage your club that I find myself playing it all the time. Honestly, I can get over the licensing issues or just find mods online to download. It's just matchdays that I absolutely dread. I almost wish I was not the head coach but rather only another staff member just so I wouldn't have to stress about tactics that are completely useless and just enjoy the other really good components of this game. 

Update: After playing this garbage some more, I wish i never bought it. Every good thing I said before i take it back because this game is terrible. So frustrating how unrealistic and stupid this all is. I can't deal with this extremely poor match engine where none of your tactics even matter or affect the outcome of the game because its already set even way before the match starts. This match engine alone ruins the whole game and like I said before, if the match engine is this bad, you literally have a worst of the worst game because nothing else good matters. I hate this game so much.

Think football (or soccer in America) doesn't make sense or you don't know the game.  It doesn't really matter.  This game has the deepest database, most realistic simulation (in-game and over multiple seasons) and gives you the depth of running a whole organization.

The 2020 version is the best and most realistic yet.  The youth development and planning portion of the game is the best yet.  The ability to sign and develop youth has long been most gamer's favorite parts of the series.  The added depth in this version takes it to a new level.  

I greatly enjoy building a team from scratch, developing youth into world class footballers and making waves in the transfer market.  People have complained about the match engine.  I am yet to see an issue.  I think those complaining have never watched a real game and seen the same things happen.

I would try to get the game on sale but would pay full price for it (especially if you don't already have one of the series).  You will not be disappointed.

Defenders will kick the ball to coner whenever they meet the ball near the back line. Strikers and wingers will try to score from impossible angles instead of passing the ball across. AI will score in added time every fourth/fifth game while you will score a goal in last minutes once a season. Defenders  stay cool while opposite striker paves his way for the shot. Keeper throwing the ball directly to the opposite striker leg - how often you see this in real life? Maybe once a season, here, in FM it happens frequent (remember we're talking about Championship level players)... and a lot of other ridiculous things that I just have no time to describe here...Don't get me wrong, there are a lot of cool stuff around the match, but when it comes to the match itself the gameplay is ruined...This is my last buy of this series

The  match animations, although can be clumsy, is respectable and from what I've gathered only the heart pounding moments are played out in slow which makes them truly fun. So far the majority of my experience has been of a national team under 19s. Only thing I can add that may be an improvement is a reason as to why a player would retire early, like a 16 year old whose been called up to the national squad, or the inability to call up a player who wasn't manually removed.

32,Football Manager 2020,69150348,english,"Great game, although I can't believe that in FM 2020 we still don't have the following all-time fan favorites:

- a Photo-op before the start of the season. Do you remember the posters we all had in our rooms? The ones with all the players, staff and trophies that were won the previous season. I mean how hard it is to render a picture like that? SI, you have all the tools and brains for it, do not deny us such delights. Don't forget to list the player and staff names as well.

- You need to do a better work with the trophy room. Man, put some imagination or send people to see the trophy rooms of big European clubs. 

- make rivalries and derby games more dynamic and feed it to us as news. If I play 3 final or semi-final games for CL against the same team within 5 seasons, a rivalry could get established. Also, rivalries could get established from high profile transfers. Like Suarez and Coutinho going to Barcelona. Or when a larger team is feeding from a smaller team and buying off their players in bulk. Also there should be some push back against rich and big teams and i am not talking about financial fair play.  

- I am still waiting to play as a president/general manager of a club. I know it may sound boring, but it may not be. A lot of us play the game as presidents anyway. Who doesn't click on auto-pick, right? As a president you still have a lot to say about transfers, style of play, vision, etc. plus you will have to negotiate and find sponsors, contractors, staff but the biggest of all joys to get into the dressing room give pep talks or snap a selfie, lol. 
  *Plus, if you could start as a maintenance and grow through the ranks ;)

- And last but not least: Why not have friendly tournaments of indoor football with 6 players on the field? It could be even  for charity. Having those will keep players that are not on international duty sharp. 

I am telling you, if you add even only one of those to the game for next year, you will make a lot of people happy and make FM 2021 stand out a head above its predecessors and competitions.",1589507607,1589507607,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,97,5,13430,0,5493,1590864417,,

68,Football Manager 2020,69040298,english,"This game can be incredibly frustrating and I do not believe that it warrants the full $50 price tag.  Don't get me wrong, as I have had enjoyable moments in the game, but those come less and less the longer I play.

First and most importantly, the ME is in need of work.  
-Strikers are often on the losing ends of 1v1s way too many times.  I don't know if this done to create some difficulty in the game, but it seems almost impossible to score off these chances.  
-Long shots are still a bit too prevalent in this game.
-Wingers and fullbacks do not cut back properly when striker is unmarked in box.
-Defenders seem to lack any sense of positioning when dealing with set-pieces.  
-Players do some weird animation when trying to prevent the ball from going out of bounds.  They manage to save it but then take a number of steps beyond the ball, allowing the opposition to gain possession.
-VAR is way too consistent in its decisions.  (ie if called in the box, it will always be a penalty.  If the referee goes to check for offsides, it will always be offside)
-Also, VAR sometime call an onside goal, offside (https://community.sigames.com/topic/520454-var-offside-issues/)  
- Also note that SI will not be updating the ME for FM2020 (https://community.sigames.com/topic/518591-thanks-for-all-the-feedback/) As a result, some of these known bugs/issues will not be resolved (which makes it somewhat a slap in the face that SI still is considering charging full price)

Second, AI transfers make no sense
-This is more of a gripe than a bug.  Players seem to make moves to other clubs that are either A) questionable or B) the teams would never sell normally.  You are telling me that Liverpool would willingly sell VVD to Paris for £60 million?  After a Champions League winning season in which he was a key player for the team?",1589332909,1589332979,FALSE,35,9,0.666601181,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,26,1,38482,0,18876,1600389771,,

73,Football Manager 2020,69031606,english,"I moved Celtic and Rangers into the Vanarama so I can build something.  I've done this in multiple incarnations of this game, so I know to change nation to England, but somehow we are still in the Scottish League Cup (and group stage at that) which has added extra games.  Not a problem as it gave me a chance to field mainly promising U23s against lower league sides.
Including friendlies (four I think), I've played 22 games.  I've won 19, with the only defeat being away in the CL playoff, which I won anyway. One draw was in the League Cup group and another was away in a CL qualifier.  We've played one CL group match away to Galatasaray, and came from 2-0 down to win 3-2 and top a group with PSG.
Because of the extra matches from the league cup and Europe, we've only played five league matches, which have all been won with a goal difference of 21-1.  We are sitting 8th (only seven points behind) having played five games less than everyone else, and suddenly half my squad have lost faith in me because we are apparently struggling.  It's mainly key players as well who have all had a lot of game time.
Perhaps the game is great if you don't edit anything, but you'd think after 20 years of providing an editor, they'd have made the game engine smart enough to deal with odd situations that arise from using it.
I attempt to warn the main instigator about his conduct and he says he always conducts himself well on the pitch.  He has no idea the angry meeting has even taken place.
Add to that there seems to still be an awful lot of random injuries out of nowhere.  This lot don't seem to be getting any better at anything other than the 3D pitch.  Mind you, my wide players don't seem to be able to take anyone on.  They sprint to the last third, then slowly walk, then get tackled by a guy already lying on the ground.  That guy will then get up and get the ball whilst my guy stands around wondering where he is.
Corners don't go anywhere other than into the six yard box to be immediately cleared by a centre half.  Also, the camera angle for corners is horrific.  You can't tell whats happening.

So now I have Aberdeen at home in the league cup.  I've attended the prematch interview and one of the questions is ""Aberdeen won't be used to visiting smaller stadiums like CELTIC PARK"".  Seriously, Celtic Park, a smaller stadium than they are used to?  Get a f*****g grip SI.  Why give access to an editor if it is going to do stupid s**t like this.  Yes, I'm now in a lower league, but how can it not realise this?  Why does it look at the stature of the league instead of the actual club?",1589317956,1589319188,FALSE,2,0,0.536585391,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,53,1,16592,1700,1379,1601332262,,

2,Football Manager 2020,68958653,english,"This game definitely has the fundamentals of being a very successful game. It has a very select level of detail and does very well to simulate what a normal professional manager would go through day to day. However, there are some bugs that I would consider to be underground that can completely ruin the game. I'm not talking about problems with the match engine or club vision, I'm talking about a specific scenario that almost made it unable for me to continue the game. First and foremost, the club world cup in 2021 is hosted during late June, the period when all of your players are either on vacation or on international duty. When I got to this point when managing RB Leipzig, I was only allowed to train my players the week of my matches, and the game acted like all the players were unavailable to play when they were available. I was able to manage overall training, but I couldn't alter the players training intensity because they weren't training at all. After I played my first match, the match sharpness or conditions of my players weren't getting better (as they are usually terrible after a vacation) even though I had recovery sessions that they weren't attending. Even worse, the other team's players were recovering after each match which made the games totally unfair. I know the game is programmed in a way that makes everyone go on vacation during a certain period, but they don't make any compromises when there are tournaments like the Club World Cup that you have to play during that time. Please fix this and hopefully I'm not the only person that encountered this problem. This is a problem specific to Europeans teams that make it all the way to 2021.

As someone completely new to FM, this game is absolutely fantastic. Sure there is some weird situations where a 1 on 1 opportunity seems to get blown, but overall the game plays correctly, and tiny changes in your tactics can make or break a big match. 

Been doing my run thru with Manchester City and after a very successful first season, we struggled behind Liverpool our second year, resulting in a few big transfers and a stronger focus on youth development. Now going into my third year we are boasting a strong winning streak, with Liverpool left in the dust, and our bitter rivals - Manchester United hot on our tails. 

The game creates a story in itself, the interviews get repetitive but still hold meaning even after the 20th time being asked the same question. Your team reacts to every word, and a slight drop in morale can cost your entire squad their form. 

Great game, and definitely worth the pick up. I wanted to get the game on sale but go figure I got it a week before it finally went on sale.. but I feel I already gained my moneys worth!",1589137275,1589137275,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,237,37,31795,1,5763,1601711437,,

Allowing you staff to hire under and reserve team staff is the best time saver feature that's been added.

New mental attribute, 'Negotiation' allowing you to leave a DoF in charge with contractual responsibilities is a personal fav.

New code of conduct feature is another great addition. Automatic fines for various behaviours.

80,Football Manager 2020,68755008,english,"Overall I am a fan of the FM games, as I still seem to pay for them year on year. There are many comments here regarding the price for the game, I think the price is OK, given the depth of the game in terms of content and replayability. A few minor points to pick out for those that have played it over the years. 
Pro's:
- You do feel more in control of your team than in previous years. Through the interactions, youth development, tactics and new staff roles added. Loan Manager = much needed when I get a bit excited with my first big budget. 
- Great lower league experience. I think the game is best played bottom up. Starting with a low level team (I started with Dulwich Hamlet). It can get very same-y if you start with a decent team. 

Cons:
- Promises promises. Some of the mechanisms and potential responses to player promises are lacking. For example, I signed a player and promised to strengthen my team. I did (well I thought I did), I was unbeaten for the season and champions league (up to this point) and the player still complained and wanted to leave. Therefore the player rationale was based on reputation of players, rather than performance of players signed. This happened a few times therefore I stopped promising players anything before I signed them (which meant losing a few). 
- I am not sure if it was just my game, however after being 7-8 seasons in, there was an abundance of world class 17-20 year old strikers coming through. When checking the top scorers of the leagues, they were all created in game and all had ridiculous stats. I would compare it to 8 or 9 Messis coming through at once? WILL SOMEBODY THINK OF THE CHILDREN 
- Press conferences. Eventually the questions become very, very repetitive and you will always have the same answer for the same question. If you leave it to the Assistant Manager, they tend to go rogue every now and then, therefore perhaps some way to automate, but in line with some preferences would be good.",1588885913,1588885913,TRUE,1,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,30,1,39643,0,21548,1600250225,,

Apart from this bug however there are gaping wholes throughout all the game engine, there is essentially no such thing as defending. You can easily conceded a hundred goals a month. The game only recognises attack as a strategy and if you attack correctly you automatically defend, examples including Watford wingbacks on defend against you dribbling past 5 players 90 yards up the pitch cutting inside when they are right footed only and scoring a 30 yard screamer with a long shot rating of 4 and finishing of 6. Expect Raheem Sterling to man mark your players like a good and track back despite pep laying down a high pressing tactic rather than marking. Expect totally phantom tactics regardless of scouting reports such as the opposition defending narrow and man marking when slated for a high line press, you can either press or you can man mark, it also doesn't seem to make any difference what the attributes of the players are the computer can simply play the best tactics against you and their players will fill their roles perfeclty and have perfect squad harmony and passing teamwork no matter having never played that formation against you all season. Whatever you do the entire league will set up specifically to counter just your team including buying players that you need such as inside forwards.

People are commenting on here of how easy they think it is, well, these fall into 3 categories for me.

A)	Liars, just want to promote this game
B)	Addicts with no other games or life, these guys play this game all of their spae time and take it too seriously.
C)	Cheats, these people simply use cheats to win.

If you are like me, a football fan and a casual player of this game, then do NOT waste your money, it is garbage and unless you play a huge team, then you will lose most of your games. It is unrealistic and I have tested this game playing a loss 2-3 times in a row by restarting the game without saving and managed to win most of my games because of their useless programming algorithm, this game promotes the other team more, it wants you to lose. 
Looking at this company in detail, they have made NO progress as a company in over 15+ years which tells me that they have only a loyal fan base and not a large player base like most games. Their lazy attitude of making a quick buck over actually making a very good game and taking pleasure in programming an excellent game just goes to show how naïve their fan base is.",1588095479,1588095479,FALSE,1,0,0.452674866,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,6,4,25,0,9,1588234646,,

52,Football Manager 2020,67764018,english,"Football Manager is one of those sporting based franchises which receive a yearly rendition, with what looks like from the outside, nothing more than just a roster refresh. To an extent, that is true with Football Manager, with the database updated for the 2019/2020 football season, a seemingly insignificant change to justify £30 more of your money. However, what Sports Interactive are consistently capable of, is bringing a range of quality of life improvements as well as the occasional larger update that don't necessarily reinvent the wheel, but refine it to it's truest form.
Football Manager 2020 is the best version of Football Manager, hand down, in the same way that Football Manager 2021 will most likely surpass the present iteration of the game. If you are a new player to the franchise, the in game tutorials and menus allow any user to customise and change the many different roles and responsibilities to their liking. Meaning you can slowly ease yourself into the fantastic depth that Football Manger provides for club management. Whilst if you are a returning player, the improvements to aspects like the match engine and the development centre should allow a greater sense of success in the short term while allowing the ability to feel like you have left a legacy with a club in the long term.
Many people may be put off with Football Managers limited licenses in comparison to games like FIFA, with the lack of Premier League licenses, with the exception of Watford, potentially disinteresting a core English audience. Although that being said, the use of the EFL and National League licenses within the game should encourage more lower league management, which in my opinion, provides a much more enjoyable experience than starting your saves at already financially secure and successful teams. Moreover, the complications surrounding the German national team and the Brazilian Leagues can also detract from your experience. However, the ability to install a wide range of graphical and database improvements provided by the fantastic Football Manager community can resolve such issues, these improvements may not be directly supported by Sports Interactive due to legality issues, again surrounding licenses, yet they are perfectly easy to install on the PC version of Football Manager (Simply Google how to install Facepacks, Club Badges, Name Fixes, Entire new divisions, etc).
Football Manager cannot be learnt to play in a day, as much as that may differ certain players, its simply the reality of this game. Football Manager provides a incredible depth to club managements and players will be learning certain mechanics and nuances to the games up to years after playing it. I, myself still learn small things about the game after playing games in the franchise for 4 years now. Yet, If you are willing to brave the seemingly steep learning curve at first glance and learn the core mechanics to this game, I strongly believe you will find yourself hooked into crafting your own narrative and stories through this digital football world.",1587484613,1587484613,TRUE,9,1,0.569402635,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,94,2,74368,321,39908,1601557673,,
53,Football Manager 2020,67757585,english,"As someone who has bought pretty much every year's instalment of Football Manager for the last 10 years running, I have to say this one is a massive disappointment.
The match engine is absolutely abysmal, and simply provides absolutely no reward for creating a good tactic and carving the opposition open as your players will miss one-on-ones and clear cut chances over and over again, irrespective of how good they are supposed to be as a finisher. You will repeatedly find that the game punishes you for playing football, and instead rewards tactics that only focus on Pulis-style hammering of crosses and long balls into the box and set pieces. It is just so horribly demoralising to see your team achieve great stats, dominate possession, shots and clear cut chances, only to watch highlight after highlight of your top strikers repeatedly missing ridiculously simple chances.
I would strongly advice you to avoid this game at all costs and simply play an older version of Football Manager where the engine actually works to reward effective tactics and doesn't leave you pulling your hair out when your key striker, a player who on my save was ridiculously overpowered in terms of his attributes for his level, misses 95% of one-on-ones, spurning 6 clear cut chances only for the opposition to score two headers from corners and win.

Wide players will attempt to score from the byline several times each game instead of passing to an unmarked striker. 

There are almost no forward passes centrally and no through balls at all, so most goals are the result of a winger, inside forward or overlapping back crossing to the other side of the box where an onrushing winger will score. Or a set piece which seems overpowered to compensate for the relative lack of goals from open play.

Occasionally a midfielder will score a screamer from 30 yards from a cut back but strikers score mostly rebounds and headers from set pieces and get very little service in normal play.

It's very possible to win most your matches by having world-class inside forwards but I finally got fed up with every attack looking the same.",1587159726,1587160420,FALSE,9,0,0.584195137,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,24,1,10797,0,10441,1587224825,,

When it comes to tactics, and managing the team it is realistic and even when you are in a match you can edit and adjust accordingly to whoever you are playing against.

Considering it is £40 now it is dog shi*e.
I wont be playing it again unless fixes to the game are introduced

Edit: despite a few fixes the gameplay is still very dissapointing and the worst i have seen on a fm game. Each game consists of balls over the top of the oppositions or my defence and the striker scoring every 1 in 7 games or the wing players dribbling past the wing backs and instead of cutting back or crossing the ball in the box they shoot straight at the keeper. Whilst there has been slight improvents the game is still very boring after 5 games. On the other hand leaving out gameplay i am impressed with the other aspects of the game.

56,Football Manager 2020,57544751,english,"Nice new features like the development center, club philosophy etc, together with improvements in general to the game. All these things should improve the already impressive replayability of FM.

HOWEVER, the match engine has disappointed me again. It has similar flaws the FM19 match engine had: strikers are nearly useless, no overlapping runs from central midfield, no through balls attempted, to name a few. Even worse, wingplay has become a joke with wingers and full backs blasting shots at goal from impossible angels. All this after a lot of feedback SI got from the community during FM19 and the FM20 beta.

I hope they can improve the match engine. Until then, this game gets a low score from me and I'll stick to the older FM18.

Update 25 February 2020:
SI has released a big patch earlier this month, also including the transfer updates up until that date. The match engine was changed as well, but this update didn't improve the experience significantly enough to change my initial review of this game.

For future games, I suggest to wait to buy the game until after the winter update as you can then ask for a refund if the game doesn't fulfil your expectations. Now it's impossible to do that because you only get to see the final version of the game 4 months after the initial release.

Update 8 April 2020:
SI have confirmed on the SI community forum they won't release a new update for this game. As such, my negative recommendation will not change.",1574275053,1586334495,FALSE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,117,1,11854,0,7733,1600619473,,

16,Football Manager 2020,66629177,english,"Usually a huge FM fan and consumer but this years game isn't my favourite, if you've got an older version - stick to that.

Problems with this game: 
Overall - Mainly the matches themselves seem to be utterly unpredictable, completely unmanageable and none of the information stats seems to match up to  to pre-game instructions and player stats.
More specifically.
- Too many 1 vs 1s (missed and created) 
- Too many volleys, header, long shots scored by all players or players with low stats
- Too many goals scored by simply tackling defenders - regardless of press instructions
- The team doesn't really feel like you're managing it. At all levels and situations - making a change in seems to yield rather random results, FM19 seemed to have a better balance of cause and  effect.
- Zebre FC (although i understand why)
-  I think too many chances per game, although i haven't studied the statistics compared to reality
-  seems impossible to 'tighten up' or try and maintain possession. 
-  I'm not overly bothered about match day graphics, as i like 2D Traditional (top down) view. 
- Alot of aimless punts up the pitch/bad computer AI. 
- Teams seem incapable of moving up the pitch as a unit. 
- Lots of stuff appears to happen in the last 10 mins
- Not totally sure all the pre-set style of tactics are necessary.

Anyway - usually a huge fan of this game and left frustrated with this version of it. I see others are having similar issues and  i think these have been acknowledged.",1586041761,1586041761,FALSE,12,0,0.603340328,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,20,1,134696,7540,20522,1602017553,,

62,Football Manager 2020,66448919,english,"Having played all editions since like 2005, I can say that I finally reached a point where I had enough with this game. It's decent as all the games from the series are, it's undeniable that for all of us football fans there's always a smile to be attained every year when we take our team to the glory and that alone keeps making us play it with a smile everyday. But I think it's time for me to just say, I had enough with buying it for full price and it being exactly the same thing, over, and over, and over again, and guess what, the problems that it always had are still there and I don't think SE will ever fix them.

The game's randomness is it's main problem, it's inconsistent as hell as it's always been and it can become frustrating to a point where you just don't feel like wasting time on it anymore. A good example of this randomness is with injuries, god awful, it doesn't happen in a football team for in less than a month 10 players or more of your team getting injured even when you made sure you have the best physios and conditions in the club. It also doesn't happen your striker with amazing attributes failing 10-20 goals per match, it also seldomly happens that your same striker fails to pass the ball to a colleague that is alone 10 cms on the side and can easily score. Also, players are human beings, and as any conscious human being, you cannot expect a poor team to reinforce your squad with millions when they are not available, but in this game, every single player will create drama for every little thing, and it becomes TERRIBLY annoying at some point. We know now that we live in an era where football players cost a lot of money, but man, after 5-6 seasons, even the lowest of players cost over 5-10 millions and it just becomes impossible for you to deal in any sorts with other teams. Also I doubt that any big team would be able to spend over 600 million every year like I see in this game happening... Another propper example of failure in this game is what happened to me this season, I won a game 4-0 on my first go and I was playing with a team that was inferior to it's adversaries, but not by much, and my PC crashed after. Reloaded the game, and for my surprise I couldn't win that game afterwards anymore for some reason, even though I changed absolutely nothing, now, I normally don't replay games (if I lose I lose, just like in real life, there's always a chance of that happening since everyone has a bad day) but I replayed this game about 10 times and I never won it again. So if that isn't randomness, than what is it? Football doesn't work like that my dudes, of course there's always a chance for any team as long as it's 22 men on the pitch fighting it out, but it puzzles me on how stupid it can be sometimes. I think this algorythm that the game uses, is in no way perfect, but damn, it should've been perfected in 20 years no? It's the least you could do for people that keep cashing in every year.

These same mistakes, of course, arguably, are what set this in being a game and not real life, but when you play a game like this for being a simulation, it should be as accurate to the real thing as it can get, and it puzzles me that in 20 years these dudes have not improved one single bit. 
Now you can come and argue with the ""UI has changed, better scouting etc."" sure thing, but is it really any way superior year after year? Not really, it is just a different shade of paint on the same painting every year. 

Cannot in any way recommend this game to anyone, even though I have fun with it as I do every year, and as probably I will keep playing it every year, guilty pleasure I guess or the love of football, or maybe both. But it's getting harder and harder to recommend this to anyone, when it's not a football simulator anymore, it's a randomness simulator with football elements.",1585858272,1585858272,FALSE,7,0,0.549763083,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,436,41,9586,0,9586,1585856555,,

I've been playing since FM12 and even then people were complaining about the match engine. Disappointing that every edition still has a glaring bug when it comes to gameplay (players not squaring the ball, one-on-ones). 

And each new FM seems more focused on feature-creep crap like player interactions and adding unnecessary jobs like data analyst and sports scientist. Why are my players always talking to me when the conversation options feel like they're written by someone who has never spoken to people? Why add data analysts when your scouts keep recommending you Mbappe, Aguero and Varane even though you're managing Norwich? FM is getting more bloated with each year and these features have been gradually eroding away at the actual fun of the series. 

I want to develop unknown youngsters into star players and I want to devise tactics that allow my team to play beautiful football. I don't want to get into an argument with my 18-year-old striker about why I played him as an Advanced Forward instead of a Poacher like I promised.

Update: 08.03.2020

I waited till the last update. Match Engine kills this game. That's it. You can spend hours with building your roster then coming up with a balanced tactic or whatever. But the match engine is so boring and lightyears from real football that it is too much for me. My centre backs score 10-15 goals from corners and indirect free kicks in one season. My CMs score 7-10 goals / player from outside of the box. In exchange my strikers and inside forwards are retarded in clear cut chances. This is not football.

Update: 20.12.2019

I changed the recommendation to NOT RECOMMENDED. Match engine is still not fixed which is a big problem because it is so unrealistic that I quit playing this game. I am very sad because everything is at least good in the game but the match engine (the main dish) simulates a sport which is clearly not football. 1 on 1 situations (striker against goalkeeper) almost always missed. It's like in a basketball game Lebron James would miss every second dunk... :(

Update: 22.11.2019

Since the last update the match engine favors the AI heavily and it is more broken than before. What I did not experience before:
- 4 out 4 penalties were missed by my pen. taker (fin, pen tak. 16 rating)
- My team shoots 20-30 times on goal (appr. 5-8 long shots) and create 2-5 clear cut chances, meanwhile the AI shoots max 10 per game but scores with 30% (deflected long shots, free kicks, cannon shots from anywhere by Average Joe) . And I have a defensive tactic. I couldn't win 10 games in a row... before the last update I was on a ""run"" (I am with Real Valladolid in 3rd season and in Europe League, so the ""run"" is relative definition in this case).
- and in 2 weeks 6 major injuries in the squad...

- I am literally sad that something messed up/made the match engine worse.

What I really don't get is that how can you publish a football simulation which is appr. 20 years old in development and when you start a match and the strikers never score on 1on1s, I can't believe that the developers/testers cannot saw it. I assume SI employees are aware about that strikers tend to score when they are on 1 on 1 against the keeper and not bothered at all by any defender... please someone explain this to me.

See ya after the ""real version"" is published! I am done with beta testing for my money.

Update: 20.11.2019

compared to fm19 and in just in general:
- less major injuries (more than 3 weeks long), more minor injuries (less than a week), more realistic I think
- match engine is better than fm19 but needs some refining, e.g.:
- 1 on 1 finishing is a joke right now
- long shots overpowered (players with a long shot attr. of 14 are Roberto Carlos Academy graduates)
- wingers/fbs smashing into the sidenet from zero angle instead of crossing
- majestic solos (playing for me Castrovili is Kaka at his best, the AI tends to have a Messi every second match)

The problem is that you can create a team and tactic based on the long shot ""feature"" and you can kill every team. (possesion game 
+ long shot from anywhere) And it's unreal and boring.

Don't forget to create custom defensive set pieces instructions, AI tends to expose the default settings.

So every part of the game is excellent (can be some bugs of course) except the match engine. Now I would put an ""untested/not tested enough"" label on the match engine. What I fear is that the 1on1 and the smash into the sidenet things won't be fixed because then every match could be 7-4. The defenders still act time to time like low IQ cows.

Football Manager 2020 is selling like hotcakes, there have been plenty of records broken with the game this year as Miles Jacobsen has been celebrating on Twitter at every opportunity. It's great for the money men, it's great for Sega, but something has changed with Sports Interactive (SI) with this game. The match engine is an abomination this time around and SI have done little to fix it and Neil Brock has basically dismissed the torrent of negative feedback on the official forum saying that SI are happy with with the match engine. He basically said they don't care about the fans that have helped shaped the game series over the past 25-30 years. This is worrying, it is so broken and unbalanced this time around for a senior figure at SI to think this and communicate this with their most diehard fans clearly shows that the drive of improving fundemental features is gone and that the objective it to fluff the game out with nice sounding but useless features to boost the annual marketing push.

I'm so disappointed in this iteration of the series and in my opinion it is the worst Football Manager in many years. The game is jut not fun to play, even with success. There is no way as a Football Manager player of 25 years that I can recommend this game. Football Manager 2021 will be the first game in over 20 years that I do not buy at launch.

New comers to the series you will probably enjoy the game as it will be your first and you will likely be drawn in by the depth and all the things that has made the game great for so many years. But extended play will lay bare the awful match engine which will never be fixed.

The ability of the AI sides to use pull backs, pass and move. All things my players never do no matter how much I tinker with them. 
I would really like the option of not having to play the match and just let the AI decide the outcome. My suspicion is i would get more wins.

Should you buy FM20, yes! I give it a solid 9 out of 10! My only gripe with the game itself is the countless problems its had with launch bugs since release. That, and I have it installed on 2 computers.....same specs just different graphics cards. Each install has the same mods on it, yet only my gtx1660ti runs the game.

79,Football Manager 2020,64040215,english,"Football Manager 2020 (FM20) is a football management game developed by Sports Interactive and published by SEGA. It was released on 19 November 2019. In this review, I will briefly cover Football Manager game play, run through the features introduced in FM20 and provide a perspective on the state of the game.

In FM20, you, the player, manage a football team through 118 playable leagues. Of this 118, 26 leagues in 14 countries are fully licensed and another 24 teams (national and domestic teams) are licensed. Within the 26 leagues: French Ligue 1 and Ligue 2, German leagues one to three, and English leagues two to four are fully licensed. The English Premier League, Spanish La Liga, and Italian leagues are not; though the Serie A has 18 of 20 licensed teams.

[h1] [b] Game Mechanics / FM20 Features [/b] [/h1]
Football Manager incorporates a variety of features and mechanics; including, but not limited to, 2D and 3D football matches, squad training, scouting and transfers, tactics, and financial management. The series also includes a vibrant modding community. In FM20, SI various smaller features such as Club Vision - long-term club progression, the introduction of the Development Centre, transfer negotiation improvements, better integration of backroom staff into your operations, and match engine and graphic upgrades.

I reflect on these main marketed features as small, but solid quality of life features that has a ton of room for improvement in future iterations. Club Vision enables you to consider the long-term aspect of the game, however I found that negotiating a different vision is not user-friendly to do and the Board of Directors offers you little flexibility to amend their vision. Further, Club Vision allows for player negotiations to be interesting by offering players different playing times, but a mechanic that SI should balance because the penalty for not adhering to the playing time is little.

More on FM20's features: The Development Centre is a cool feature that consolidates your developmental squads into a single UI. This is a neat addition because you can treat your reserve squads similarly, and staff provide useful contextual advice to you on the progression of players. The changes to backroom staff are visible, i.e. you can select Technical Directors and Loan Managers, but I have yet to see any observations in their role. Lastly, the match engine and graphic upgrades are nice, but the match engine has a lot of room for improvement. If I summarise FM20 by the above features is relevant, yet underwhelming, but nice inclusions to expand on the core game mechanics.

[h1] [b] Perspective on Annual Releases [/b] [/h1]
I have played Football Manager since Football Manager 2017. Across these four iterations, I recall that only two of the four (2017 and 2019) made substantial changes to the game. It appears that SI Games has a formula which Year X incorporates large changes and Year Y focusses on quality of life improvements that expand or address concerns on features from Year X.
 
I acknowledge the concerns of the community and question the situation: Is SI Games complacent? I think the football management market has a lack of competition and variety. While SI Games makes enjoyable annual games, I think they could address more community concerns, particularly with the match engine and to fix the various glitches and bugs throughout the game. I do appreciate that SI Games is expanding the licensing of official teams and leagues because it makes playing the game a more enjoyable experience. But in saying that, I vastly enjoy the Football Manager series and it is addictive; though sometimes a frustrating experience.

[h1] [b] Conclusion [/b] [/h1]
FM20 is an ultimately enjoyable game. It benefits from having a strong foundation of team management and football simulation, at the consequence of visible stagnation to new features and post-launch support. FM20 specifically, has some nice features, but I applaud more the many quality of life changes implemented by SI Games. If you are new to Football Manager, I recommend FM20 at full price. If you own FM19, I recommend the game on sale.

[h1] [b] Rating [/b] [/h1]
7.5/10

[h1] [b] Pros [/b] [/h1]
* Core mechanics are immensely fun, including team and financial management, and social feeds
* Development Centre is interesting and useful
* Modest match engine and graphical improvements, including upgrades to manager appearances
* Slightly improved press conferences and tunnel interviews; your manual comments can slightly benefit or hinder player morale.

[h1] [b] Cons [/b] [/h1]
* Series has a need for material improvement including: more animations and enhancing the fluidity of matches, more applicable feedback from players and staff, press conferences, and financial management such as customising and managing club facilities and managing tickets/negotiating sponsorship deals
* Underwhelming Club Vision and player negotiation features
* Inability to identify applicability of new backroom staff and the supposed improvements to staff.

I'm leaving you......it's not you it's me, no actually it is you!!!! You've let yourself go, taken me for granted and so we need a break....I may see other people, just saying.

That's actually hard for me to say because I love the franchise. Like my wife, kids, dogs, summer holidays, American Truck, FM is embedded in to my daily life, it's amongst the things I value, adds balance to my life, or at least it did.

Honestly, the gameplay is simply the best it's ever been, albeit a little buggy in places. There is a but though and its a huge one.

The Match Engine is currently a disaster, easily the worst its ever been. I've played this game since inception, half of my life, I've never been as down on the ME as I currently am. Sure I can win games, win the league etc etc but I want and need it to resemble real football.

The players stats do not matter and every goal keeper is the best goal keeper in the world. Also no matter how highly rated your strikers are, they will fail to convert 95% of chances. 

I'd say, either wait for SI to fix this sad excuse of an engine which is surprisingly worse than FM19 or wait for the game to be on a very deep sale, probably 95% off.

Update: Tried the latest beta patch, still the engine is broken. The players attributes are still not taken into consideration. Though 1v1 have reduced by around 90%, the strikers of your own team have completely forgotten how to play the game. The wingers have learned how to cross the ball and are more effective now. The defense how ever is still dumb struck over long balls over the head and overall haven't learned how to do their job, which is defending, instead they just turn around in circles and watch the opponents go past them. The cards have certainly reduced, but the foul count is still the same which is a lame way to fix an issue. The tactics and instructions are still a foreign language to the engine because it still calculates the winning chances based purely on the reputation of the club, which again is plain stupid.

Each year SI Games tweaks the game a bit to the better, sometimes with bugs and other new issues that comes along with that. A lot of players almost always ask for a new match-engine that will make the game more realistic. 
Ive bought this game(series) since before it was called Football Manager but the last year each time felt Im being robbed a bit, as some stuff that comes each year with a ""Brand NEW IMPROVED game"" should be updates or patches or even DLCs. 
The game is still in BETA you say, dont complain!!, but I wonder if the game ever does come out as it feels like an updated version each year. 
Im not voting down the game but more Miles Jacobsson and SI Games and how they take advantage of being the best of the football manager game series out there.

The board is blocking my transfers cause they want me to sign more players from a specific country outside the EU. I already signed one last year who is now one of their top national team performers, I signed 3 promising youths who will be joining next year, they still block all my attempts to really strengthen the squad. I do not know how this is supposed to work... I do not know if the devs have understood how this works in reality but what they have implemented is totally crappy and a game stopper. Fun fact is that the specific team I am playing used to have two players from that country and now has none... Another issue I dealt with was the fact that the board was aiming at building a new stadium but when they agreed to upgrade the youth facilities this particular goal just disappeared and suddenly, even expanding the stadium was not deemed financially viable... Both these problems seriously affect my game and enjoyment and are by no means realistic.

Apart from that, I do not really understand how they can do that, but every year the game feels slower than last year. The match engine is not bad, but still far from being visually up to date, days drag by.. slowly... scouting feels much clunkier, training could use some automations and so on.

83,Football Manager 2020,63085160,english,"So, I have played Football Manager for about twenty years, since the days it was still Championship Manager, back in 2000.
The game always had this random component to some aspects but it was fun once you got the hold of it and had your team playing in a consistent way. That is until this year.
It seems like the game is set to screw you most of the time. Really.
While this is not really something new to the avid Football Manager player, as most of us have experienced a sense of unfairness, at some point, in the game; on this version, you get it most if not all of the time.
Mind you that I am an experienced player and I have won, over the years that I have played the game, everything that there is to win and on different clubs.
On this year's version, despite winning the league on the first season and having a world class team, after three seasons, I couldn't even be a contender for the Champion's League qualification places. I had some of the best players in the game, like Tonali, Havertz, Ansu Fati, Sancho, Bernardo Silva. I had a dream team, really and I would struggle to beat weak teams. Constantly.
I tried multiple tactics, nothing really worked in a long therm. The tactic that won me the league, on the first year, suddenly stopped working even tho my team was actually stronger. I mean, you don't change something that is working and is consistent. Such is the philosophy that allowed me and, likely, most of the players in the game to achieve success, eventually. Even if there were some struggles at the beginning.
I tried to have more than one tactic and get my team familiar with those, so I could change if something was not working, I tried multiple approaches with training and team mentality, player instructions and, as stated, even with some of the best signings in the game, it wouldn't matter. AI would score goals, constantly, after being outplayed for the entire match. And yes, I know this happens in real life but it doesn't happens as often as in this game. It's stupid and unrealistic.
Maybe, for people who are really dedicated to the game, spend hours planning and reading every detail on the tactics and have a vast knowledge, these issues can be worked on but it's not really a game for the player who just wants to chill, keep things relatively simply and have some fun with their favourite team because, even the experienced player, might get screwed. 
The game can, indeed, be very gratifying when you win something, specially in the last games of the season, when everything is really close but, believe me, most of the time, it is incredibly frustrating. The possible reward by winning something, even with a top team, is not worth the annoyance and the sensation of wasted time and confusion as to why the AI still manages to beat you against all odds, more often than not.
I don't know what SI is doing but it seems like their attempt to make the game realistic has set them on a path where things are out of control, most of the time and you are always on the edge of your seat, on every game, regardless if you're playing against the strongest contender of the competition or a club that is just playing to avoid relegation. You never know if you're going to win, no matter how strong your team is.

It is pretty much what some people have been saying here, lately. You will also find many posts on Reddit about this.
No matter what you do, it won't make a difference and it is, probably, a bug from some recent update.

I liked the previous versions, on past years but I definitely do NOT recommend this game. Save your money, your time and, especially, your sanity.",1581046832,1581046832,FALSE,18,0,0.64155364,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,42,1,11705,0,6809,1584248430,,

So what you gonna do? Go back to square one and adjust your tactics, substitute, modify roles for your player? Good luck with that, it won't work, often it made you lose even bigger.

Only one of the many tactical styles of play will ever get you results. You can spend hours setting team and individual tactics just to watch the game show your team following none of them. Constant direct long balls when playing possession build up is a joke, full backs scoring blinders every game while strikers can never convert the way too many 1v1 chances magically created. Defenders that do not play a covering role even when set to with a low defensive line are constantly going high just to then get beaten by a long ball to the striker in behind. It is clear the match engine is not an actual real-life game in motion, but pre-defined scripted plays that you have no control over, nor do your tactics.
This game is sold as being as close to real life as a football management game can be, funny how in real life I don't see every team playing route 1 long balls or the gegenpress across the world.

24,Football Manager 2020,57711953,english,"UPDATE: New BETA match engine, same old guff.
Now your full backs have lost the gift of sight, as they literally watch crosses, passes and players go past them without actually moving or even sticking a leg out.
Anticipation is 0. Literally 0. The ball will bounce off a post and NOBODY will move for it. Everybody, opposition included, now seem to ball watch.
Tactics still have no effect. Disciplined, positive, short passing football- so where does my advanced forward pass it? BACK TO THE CENTRE BACK! Who is marked. Who then falls over his own feet for no reason (maybe how the ME represents balance?)
Direct wing play? Game goes full back to winger, to full back, to winger- then out for a throw. F***ING CROSS IT YOU PLEBS!
I dream of a match that even remotely represents life. Where my defenders move with urgency, where COMMON SENSE exists and passes aren't completely idiotic. Oh well, maybe next year (I won't be buying it).

The game engine was broken on release:
*Strikers that can't score from inside the 6 yard box
*Wing backs who don't/won't CROSS or CUT BACK
*Idiot goalkeepers who use their knees instead of their hands
*Defenders who turn like a pint of milk and run the ball out of play/into their own net instead of turning sharply with urgency
*Players turning onto their weak foot and misplacing passes instead of their good foot- not even under pressure.
*EVERY. SINGLE. LONGSHOT. FROM 25 YARDS. FROM A PLAYER WITH 5 FINISHING. AND 5 TECHNIQUE. IN THE LOWEST LEAGUE. WILL SLAM INTO THE TOP CORNER. EVERY TIME. But a half volley from 6 yards central to the goal? Wide mate.
It's just not fun, not realistic, not a fair representation of professional players. YET if you ask an SI developer on Twitter, they defend it to the death. I've had a player miss NINE clear cut chances in one game, with 13 finishing, in the National League.
I've had a defender pick up the ball on his own 6 yard line, run behind the goalie and try to clear the ball, kicking it off the goalie and INTO HIS OWN NET. What's the tactical instruction for that one then? COMMON SENSE AND EYES?

Those days are long gone. From Championship, we have switched to just... Football. Do not get me wrong, I'm not another one of those nostalgicphiles, quite the opposite. However, it just incomprehensible that the game is going from bad to worse. DLC level additions year after year, and an ever declining match engine that has just led to today's broken game. We never asked our addiction to follow RTX tech level advancements. All we asked -and to this day, still do- is that what you try to 'design' on a tactics board, is followed to a logical extent on the pitch. Instead of aiming to fix the ice skating phenomena of the motion -wtf is- captured, focus on getting the basics right. The game should all be AI, seamlessly working algorithms, multi million calculations per second that would resurrect ENIAC out of its grave. I fail to comprehend how the match engine is declining instead of improving over the past few months/years. With all due respect to those hard working individuals (I'm sure there's plenty of those) but is the level of staff working in SI declining? From a CX perspective, you consistently present a malfunctioning product, with DLC level additions, at a premium Epsilon Alpha (wink wink) price. Hand in heart, you should take a sabbatical year from production, fix the basics of a functional match engine, and release the next version on September 1st 2021. Yep, the year is not a typo. Riding that early season hype wave may even help you recover the lost year of revenue.

 I just came across a post from 2010 where a player was complaining about a 3% cross completion ratio. Guess what, a decade later, players with crossing 15+ finish the game with 10-15%. Your team's players crosses will always be stopped by those heroic opposition fullbacks, despite having galloped past them like Usain Bolt against schoolboys. On the opposite end of the pitch, those schoolboys always get their revenge with a staggering 80%+ cross completion ratio! 

Goal conversion is just like VAR in England. An absolute joke. One-on-ones are still not fixed since...October XX (where XX add the year of your liking). Lukaku level strikers (love or hate), finish two seasons with 8% conversion. Lautaro loves bruising the shins of centre halves by fiercely kicking the s*** out of them (with the ball, no red card material here you naughty minds).

Goalkeeper distribution is still as good as CM 00/01. Imaginary. ""Ederson with the quick release"" remains fiction.

Anyway, I could go on and on and on... But truth is, I'm tired. Tired like you start a Champions League final in June with 58% condition... The match engine is just like a hamstring.

85,Football Manager 2020,60594561,english,"Pure random junk simulator, it's just a rather bad game. You can call it the 'cheating engine'. I'm a long time player, this time they made a random result game. You can be the best manager, have the best team with the best morale, still losing with the weakest team at home. You can be first after midseason and with morale top get a streak of bad results ruining your whole season. So, if you don't like to cheat, you will collect bad results at home against weak teams; then you will eventually win again away against good teams. It's just frustrating, instead of improving it Sports Interactive worsened it. Beautiful presentation, broken game (it's clearly designed badly); before or later it will cheat, that's it. An insult to Sigames customers. Just try to exploit the engine and be happy about it, otherwise it will frustrate you. How you do it? It's simple, just remove forwards and add wingers, because the somewhat laughable match engine expect it; it's strong against forwards and weak against wingers, so don't dream about your tactic, the one that it works is the one that it's going to exploit the match engine. It's not about having the best team with a coherent tactic, but having a good team playing an exploiting tactic. Unhappy to have spent so much money for this year iteration. It must be said that it is become an elephant. It's slow in day by day progression (it can take 20 to 30 minutes for a virtual week, so you are going to waste more time than in the past) and the GUI graphics is fat, too much rich and boring like the match engine; luckily, I've been able to find an excellent skin that at least add spices to that depressive 'dull english art with added punk', it's called Heffem and it's made by Krysler, a bold artist; unfortunately it doesn't support very large fonts, well... I'll adapt to it; it's sacrifices a bit of readability (stretched fonts) but it adds coolness, a colorful and complete environment with a great match day graphics. So, all in all, shame on the (cheap) designers/coders responsible of all of this. The game system needs to be overhauled, or better... remade, certainly shrinked.
On the pros must cite the inclusion of new roles in the match engine that add a bit of variety (not much, some roles aren't that much diversified) and the inclusion of analysts for scouting. Also, the transfer market to me looks better than before. Scouting, as a whole, looks less intuitive and streamlined. Sigames put a patch on micromanagement, that aspect can be (almost) serenely offloaded to staff members. 3D match engine graphics are better than before (that's what sold me, unfortunately I didn't knew about the newly featured 'random junk engine').",1577367490,1579275337,FALSE,6,0,0.519313335,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,139,42,103198,0,6106,1592079997,,

The match engine is fundamentally broken - too easy to split a defence open with a long ball resulting in a one-on-one, so SI nerfed the conversion rates of one-on-one chances to keep scorelines acceptable. The result however, is that your world class  striker misses 2-5 easy chances every game. 

Wingers do not square the ball for strikers, instead preferring to shoot from obscenely acute angles rather than play the ball across the box. 

Half the crowd is a repeated man in an orange jumper. This may sound minor but it's really immersion breaking once you notice it. You can be a team that plays in blue, and yet over 50% of the crowd are dressed in orange. It diminishes the match experience and detracts from the game as a whole.

It's crap like this, broken for 2 months now, I've bought every game in this series since the year 2000, I pre-order every year (literally the only game I will do so with) and said I'll continue to do so until I get burned. Well, SI Games, you've broken me at last. The 'Bugs' section of your forum is littered with these issues that are ""under review"", well you can consider my purchase of FM 2021 in the same category.

Edit: I played a bunch more because apparently I'm a masochist. The match engine is total cack and has regressed massively since FM 2017.

57,Football Manager 2020,61789909,english,"First review I've ever left, but feel I need to add a warning here. As of 13 January 2020, the match engine is fundamentally broken - one on ones and headers are almost impossible to score regardless of the level. You'll spend hours trying to figure out a way to convert chances, thinking it's your tactic that's the problem, but the match engine so far this year is just bugged. Look on reddit etc and you'll see hundreds of posts with the same issue.

My advice is to not buy this game until they've fixed it - it's a joke that it still hasn't been addressed by now and SI is another company who are happy to release an unfinished, untested product and screw over their loyal customers. They hardly make any changes every year - so why they can't devote more time to QA before release is just negligent. FM has become a cash cow to SEGA in much the same way FIFA is for EA.

Notice how you can no longer buy any of the previous years editions of FM which are balanced and just require an updated database to bring up to date. SI and Sega are pulling a fast one.

Recommendation: Buy the game in March or April when it's fixed and is 50% of the price.

Pros:
Dev Center.
New analysis tools.
New staff roles.

Cons: 
Broken & Unrealistic Match Engine.
Very few changes notable from last year.

97,Football Manager 2020,61350674,english,"I really want to give this game a positive review but unfortunately there are just too many problems with the match engine that take away from the ""glossy"" improvements elsewhere. Sure. There are positives:

Board Vision and the fact that clubs are now being picky over who they invite to interviews is both realistic and frustrating (lets be honest, how many Conference National managers get jobs at higher levels unless they get their team promoted - Christ.......even Grimsby just appointed Ian Holloway rather than take a risk on a proven manager such as Dodswell at Havant)

Youth Development side of things is good and a real improvement as all fans want to see their clubs develop their youth players.

Right........moan time: Firstly......I want to say that I have seen over 1500 football matches live (mainly PL and Championship but also many games in the Conference National and South) so in terms of having seen football I have about 150,000 hours of the damn game.

MATCH ENGINE. Real ife vs FM20

Real life:

I took some notes from the last 10 live games I saw:

Only  7 one on ones in ten games - 4 scored
107 corners - 4 goals from them
Only twice did defenders get caught woefully out of position and outpaced by a striker
In all ten games - NO goals from long shots

In the FM20 match engine:

About 10 one on ones a game - but with about a 10% conversion rate (if you're lucky) - too many one on ones by a long score but this is counteracted by the fact that no-one ever scores from them.

Attackers whilst on the ball still easily outpace a retreating defender. This is utterly ridiculous as I've only ever seen top class players with rapid pace able to do this. 

Defenders never ""drop"". E.g. Even though a defender is 31 and had 300 games under his belt, he'll still allow a striker to run through the middle cos he's too busy marking someone else. Also, it doesn't matter what height defensive line you play as they'll always allow strikers to ghost past them for the inevitable missed one on one.

Players just don't tackle. I mean. I play with a ""Get Stuck In"" mentality and even target some of their players further (yeah........nice I know) but the team waltz around the pitch like they're auditioning for Swan Lake.

Shouts: Some work, some never work.......although there is probably more variation in what works from FM19. Concentrate and tighten up always cause utter confusion in the ranks even though you've justifiably given the instruction on 85 minutes when you're 2-1 up away from home. But they all get frustrated like they're six year olds who all want to score in a game down the park. 

Overall. I think a lot of the improvements to the ""glossy"" side of the game are good. But it does seem like SI have gone and done a Disney Star Wars......

""Look......its so bright, flashy with all these special effects........its Football Manager - you've got to like it"". Even though the soul of the game has been completely ignored.

Hoping this gets addressed in a patch but am worried that SI are now more interested in profit than caring for this game. Hoped to be proved wrong.",1578225959,1578225959,FALSE,9,0,0.554558992,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,96,2,60065,496,11859,1601677568,,

The superhuman ability of goalkeepers... i am consistently getting 3-4 clear cut changes along with 2-3 half chances per game an coming away with 0-0 and 1-1 draws. in fact in my last game i had 6 clear-cut chances and 2 half chances and lost the game 2-0...How are lacazaette and aubayang not scoring goals...its beyond frustrating. I have a a game in which i had 10 clear cut chances (the most i have ever seen) and won 1-0 what a joke...how is only one goal being scored.

This is beyond my control as a manager i am delighted with the chances being created i can do no more and its agony watching chance after chance go by...what am i doing wrong????!

Is anyone else expericing this?

Players attack skills or defence skills may go wrong often. 3D match vision seems to be ok, but it should be improved. (come on it's 2020, you can do better)

- Man marking does absolutely nothing. Tried it many times.

- Shouts do nothing as well. It's just a pointless tab

- Don't know if anyone else gets this but you always end up drawing against the hardest team in a cup, Multiple times

- Proof of scripting with drawing harder teams in cups and the occasional 3D match engine errors

- The players themselves are just dumb and don't do what they are suppose to do accordingly for example booting the ball out when there is space. Shooting that goes miles off target. Not crossing the ball when there is a player unmarked and could potentially score

- Every team no matter what even if play the instructions "" Pass into space "" Or short passing only "" They will still long balls over the defence or fail to vise versa. And quite a few goals have come through annoying over head long balls

I've given up trying to play good football because creating 5-10 clear cut chances a game doesn't seem to matter because you'll only score like 5% of the time from them. I've had a ton more success after telling my team to shoot from long range all the time. How messed up is it that long range pot shots have a better rate of success than clear cut chances?

Another issue is that strength and pace are still the be-all-end-all of attributes. There's no place in the game for intelligent players who don't rely on athleticism. For example, Firmino scored 3 goals in 15 games for me, but Origi who is only superior in the physical attributes is averaging a goal per game.

Problems with ME that I notice:
- One over the top through ball from your opponent and he's clean through, scoring his one-on-one chance.
- Speaking of one-on-one chances, forget about it. You'll never score any. While your opponents score from just 1. 
- Don't even bother spending on forwards because they'll never score anyway. So I decided to spend on wingers, but they too just shoot into the side netting from ridiculous angles.
- Dribbling is OP, my full-backs dribble all the way from their own halves, get into a very good crossing or cut-back position with an unmarked striker waiting in the box and guess what, they choose to shoot into the side netting.

I took a 2 week break and came back and some of the few positive changes in the early patches are gone. Wow SI, wow.

WORST MATCH ENGINE EVER.

Current:
Match engine is having some major game killing issues and they seem to be having a problem getting it sorted out. I don't remember a FM release being this wacked out gameplay wise on full release, I'm not feeling confident as several of the issues they have been aware of and after several huge updates (one of them nearly a gig worth) these issues aren't fixed.

Inside Forwards and Raumdeuters will not shoot at the goal with their dominate foot, nor will they drive at goal like they should.
Everyone should be able to picture the ubiquitous Salah (of Liverpool) goal, where he drives into the box from the right and curls a shot with his left foot.

Will not happen once in FM 2020. He gets in the box 1v1 and is not blocked by the defender, but he mostly passes the ball outside the box away from goal, and not to someone with a chance to shoot. 

Or he turns and drives to the end line or corner of the post and tries to shoot with his weaker foot through the post.

This is being reported for other players and teams. They have to have seen these reports, PKMs have been uploaded, but here's the thing SI

ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS FIRE UP A GAME YOURSELF AND TRY TO GET THE MOST SINGLE MINDED SHOOTING INSIDE FORWARD IN FOOTBALL TO TRY TO SHOOT WITH HIS LEFT FOOT FROM THE RIGHT.

And you will see it is broken.

They did fix the fact that no player would ever play a long through ball through the center or over the center.

Also you have to play with your defense on narrow defending, but the space is still far too wide when out of possession. You could slide a semi trailer between CBs sideways when set to narrow. I know they spread out often when in possession, but not out of possession.

The behavior of the wing backs is not much better, they refuse to cross until they are at the endline, or they pass backwards before then. 

Cross from deep
Cross early
Cross more often

These mean nothing in FM 2020.

Spain and Germany has this B club system that I started bug reporting on in something like 2014 and with the latest FM20 has made the B clubs even worse, what was supposed to be ""a great new feature"" instead just take all the brokeness of B clubs and mangle it into the senior club, resulting in problems with hiring staff or asking for more coaches (result in the Senior team getting more coaches, so great a unlimited coach exploit) or problems with Sensior players not being able to play for the B team, because the game flags the senior players as unregistered, most of the time the interface to select players to play on the B team don't come up and when it finally does the interface menu is broken and is the menu for unselecting B players for the B team, not for selecting Senior players, so it has no effect. If you manually select a player to play for the B team, the game does this unregistered check and don't allow the player to play, you have to use the broken menu, in the part that is supposed to be the already selected players to play and double tell that they can play, this apparently get around the unregistered problem. Unfortunately something prevents the selection inbox item from showing up most of the time, so it's really hard using the B team to get someone back after injury.

England don't have B clubs, so at least I hope that is working better, but then we have a million other bugs, that has been reported year after year that SI just don't care about fixing.

Then there is things like PSG is a better club than Barca and Real Madrid, so all the good players in the world want to play for PSG and PSG win bidding wars against the big clubs, but at the same time the frenche league is flagged as being not as good, so all those world class players isn't as good as if they played in Spain/England, resulting in PSG not being able to compete in Champions Cup.

Harry Kane and Christian Eriksen both went to PSG on lower, even after my Barca team offered higher wages, I think it was 100K/week more than what they accepted from PSG.

When I paid 209m for Kylian, I get told he is improving playing on our team because he is playing football at a higher level than what he got at PSG. (Not sure if that is fair to the French league, but that is how the in game simulation see's things.)

So half my team is wanted by PSG and want to leave to play at a bigger club, but if I buy PSG players I'm apparently the stronger club.

Regardless if these new features are  worthy to dig in or not, I can feel the effort you guys put in. The training part becomes more detailed. The Tactics are well explained and easy to configure. The transfer part becomes a little bit more realistic.

But I would NOT recommend FM2020. 

Here is why:
Have played so many gens of FM. I don't understand why the Devs make the GK so godly this year, almost unbeatable. Tell me when do you see a GK save 99% of  1 vs 1 situation in a match and how do you feel after seeing that happens in every single game you play? Shitty. First time in my life, I feel shitty when I play FM. 
Why do you do that to the players?
My assumption is that the tactics in 2020 are too strong/too easy which allow players to create way too many chances in a single match. In order to make the game look not too easy, they have to stop you score that much. So their answer to this is to make the GK op instead of making the game more ""realistic"".
I've read many players have the same complains in the comment. So hope the devs can hear us and make some patch/update to fix this soon.

Edit: The praise this game gets is unreal. Blind fanbois who defend a broken game like this are the reason why unfinished games like this go through year after year.
The ME is an absolut mess and unrealistic. This has nothing to do with tactics.
To charge 50 bucks like a big boy and deliver like a basement dweller who developed his first game is scam.

Edit 2 28.12.2019: Now their Developer Neil Brock is closing threads and deletes posts that call them out on their BS ME even here on Steam. Instead of fixing glaring issues with the ME they rather try to hide how bad the game is and go through any length to do so. Stay away from this game and again don't believe the praise the game gets. The vast majority of positive reviews are fake.

26,Football Manager 2020,60588126,english,"Slightly better than last years in part. Overall based on hours played I am obviously OK with this game but I do have a number of annoyances which come up alot with the hundreds of hours I play. 
Can be a bit annoying with the change of how responsibilities work, feels like they added more granularity but also took some previous away. (I.e. telling U21 and U18 to not use same tactics as first team is not obvious?) 
Does not always give the opportunity to include board promises when doing contract extensions.
I like the new team selection suggestion mail from your assistant which highlights things like training performance and promises which helps. 
I like the mentoring groups. 
Very over priced compared to past few years considering only incremental updates to game and DB

I ideally wish they corrected / improved the following: 
- Allow you to multi select to give praise/ critiicism to players for training effort
- more player talk options as at times they only give outcomes that will only result with an unhappy player
- Board overriding buying and selling amounts to block transfers , i.e. they dont want you to sell for a rubbish player to get anything you can (and they value the player at 50% more - which no-one will ever pay) - at the same time if you leave the club to auto recruit players they will pay ridicuilious amounts to buy (and wages to go with it). 
- game needs more NFT turning - can be sluggsh during matches (and I am doing 2D overview so not huge graphic rendering required). My machine is auto spec'd for high performance. 
- Like last year the in game shouts need some work. 'Get Creative' or 'Demand more' seem to be the only ones that result in a positive outcome ('Praise' only works if your smashing the other team and its mid 2nd half onwards). All others  have a negative outcome - like 'Encourage' - wtf does encouragement have a negative impact (at any point in the game from what ive tried). 
- Email that tells you players picked up positive and negative personality traits from their mentoring groups - but not which those are (so you can look at have them in a group that focuses on removal of those negative ones).  
- I liked before where I wasnt running U21 and U18 teams, but could easily setup friendly games for them via my main schedules calendar, but thats not present (I gather I need to be fully managing those teams before I can). 
- You join a new club with an existing roster and its like you just bought the team in terms of their team chemistry for on field partnerships. Likewise if I buy two players who played together last year or more into my club - they have no strong partnership - like strangers. 
- some players with low work rate or weak strength, no matter how many months you put them on individual programs to correct those, some never get better. Any player hitting the gym or doing endurance work as a pro althelete will improve (im not talking getting someone to 20 in each, im talking going from a 5 anything higher than a 5. Specifically players like 50 mil + wingers). 
- As a manager, id still love the ability to be able to use my career earnings to go and buy a team in lower leagues and build them up as an owner manager. (or keep working say in Prem league and hire someone else to manage my club). Owning a club and be the manager would allow you to avoid all the dumb board decisions and it could happen in real life. (Just look at Salford FC). 

There is lots more, but if this was my first FM game id be pretty happy.

In all my hours playing this i have not seen a single goal where a player can pass to another for a tap in even if they are free. your attackers will miss around 90 percent of 1v1s no matter what their stats are.
 Your defence will always allow through balls and give away 1v1s for opposition no matter how deep and back you play them, there is no such thing as offside trap. the players look like headless chickens that run after a ball even when you ask not to press. 

as bad a the Ai was in previous games, it has actually  gone backwards from there to a point where the game is just un enjoyable. i sit there re-setting the game from a previous load for the first time since FM 2007 because my Bipolar team will play completely different every time. its like gambling at slots. no strategy works. you can beat the strongest teams in the game then get hammered by 20th place team 5 - 0. players sometimes forget that they are playing a game and take a stroll on the pitch when the ball is next to them. 

this game is ridiculous and every year my hopes go up that they may improve the AI on match day, yet all they do is change a colour or 2 and add a new shitty tab or 2 which honestly dont even matter if the core of the game isnt good. i mean if you kept last years, even thought it was also bad, it would have been better than this one. it is upsetting knowing what could have been a potentially fantastic game has failed because of lazy developers that have done jack shit in the past 5 years. the AI has not changed, and again, if anything it has regressed. great work you turds!

0,Football Manager 2020,60351001,english,"I've felt that these games have been decreasing in quality rapidly over recent years. The last couple of FM games that I've played, the match engine just hasn't played realistically and there was always a disconnect between the tactics being implemented and the game that plays out on the pitch. So, when a friend told me that FM 2020 was amazing and way better than previous versions, I guess I just wanted to believe it too badly and I stumped up the cash for this season's offering. Sadly, I have to say that I feel this latest game is even poorer than it's predecessors. 

I know that a lot of people are now sick of the rudimentary 3D graphics of the match simulations in Football Manager, but I'm honestly not too bothered about that. I played Championship Manager when it was just text commentary and subsequently the 2D pitch and I had a blast with those games. My sole issue is the match engine and how the matches play out. Now, I can only imagine how difficult it must be to have a game with thousands of different teams in different leagues and different countries, where any given game played should offer a fairly realistic simulation experience. I certainly wouldn't know where to start creating something that complex. Given the complexity in creating this kind of accurate simulation that evolves alongside the modern game, I do expect a certain amount of rough edges and anomalous occurrences, which have always been present throughout the series. However, watching the matches in FM 2020 does not feel like watching a real football match. The way that the games flow and the strange occurrences that play out on field makes for quite a confusing and frankly boring experience. Many others have identified some of the recurring issues in the match engine, but the ones that I'm most affected by (constantly) are:
- Too many goals from long shots
- Too many chances in the penalty box being missed/saved when the attackers' stats would suggest that a goal is a very likely outcome
- Wide players with good crossing and vision stats on the ball with multiple options in the box and either no cross being attempted or the cross gets blasted into a nearby defender's shins.
- Players not taking obvious options e.g. several open team mates in passing range, but knock the ball out for a corner instead.
- Team instructions that seem to get ignored e.g. defend wide, but all of the defence is constantly clumped together in the box.

I could go on, but it seems pointless to enumerate the issues that have already been flagged dozens of times by others. What appears to be happening is that the game is trying to create an accurate simulation in terms of outcome (scorelines) whilst not being too concerned what happens on the pitch to reach that conclusion. I can accept that being an important part of the simulation experience. However, what I am witnessing within the matches themselves makes it too difficult for me to diagnose what I actually need to do to improve my tactics etc. What plays out on the field seems so disconnected from the tactics that I have selected that it often feels like a process of trial and error to find a tactic that the game approves of and then I'm left scratching my head wondering what the underlying reason for that is. Rather than seeing my team fail and being able to tell from the gameplay that my team are playing too narrow or too high up the field and that it's obviously creating vulnerabilities, my team can actually appear to play quite well, but consistently fall victim to ""bad luck"" instances. Ultimately, I don't feel like I have as much control as I'd like and it's just not fun to be essentially trying to guess what the game is thinking in order to succeed.

The only other thing maybe worth mentioning is that the set piece routines feel like they could be improved. For attacking corners, it feels like my players just ignore my instructions. For defending corners, I feel as though every substitution or change in lineup means that I have to re-assess the corner routine and make sure that I haven't now got a player that's 5 feet tall trying to mark the opposition's main goal scoring threat. I'm honestly not sure how best to overhaul this, but it's a part of the game that I find really tedious.

I fear that nothing will change as long as football management sims are a monopoly. There's probably no reason to improve the game if nobody else can produce a superior product and the majority of customers are content to play as Liverpool/City/PSG/Barca etc. and just brute force the game with high stat players. Any criticisms can just be waved away with ""You must be tactically inept"", so I guess that there's not much to be done. I only write this as an opportunity to vent my frustration of spending a lot of time trying to give this game a fair shake, in vain, but also so that other people thinking about buying the game will maybe read this and spare themselves the unnecessary expense and heartache.",1577056045,1577056045,FALSE,15,0,0.593725085,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,8,1,27931,0,4780,1593915682,,

1. one v one missing like aLOT!!!!!, like every GK is a Gordon fucking Banks and all my strikers are emile heskey. i have played for 15 seasons on FM2020 dont tell me that it is 'normal'. FYI one of the player missing 1v1s is Kyliian Mbappe with 17 finishing and 18 composure

2. every defenders playing long ball straight to strikers and long passing like they are all steven gerrards, despite me setting the passing directions to very-short

3. wing players shooting into sidenettings from ridiculous angles and asking them to pass instead and shooting

64,Football Manager 2020,60153278,english,"Read carefully: 
I've been a player since ChampionshipManager 2003, and this is what its wrong with this game IT'S NOT FUN ANYMORE !
It's the same movie you liked but you watched 20 times and for the amount of money you'll spend, for the Tunnel Carpale you'll get and for damaging your eyes after hours and hours it's simply not worth it. 
1) This developers make 1/2 improvements per year, an 1 of the 2 improvements is UPDATING THE SQUADS. It's not enough IT'S SIMPLY GARBAGE for all the money they make
2) Do you think it's normal that you get a 15 years old player and after 6 years his weight and height it's still the same? What's wrong with you developers and costumers to realise that's not realistic?
3) It's December and we're playing a League game at night and the temperature is 1°C, it's time to substitute a player, you go to tactics and send your player in...Without sending him to WARM UP first? You know what's gonna happen if after 20 secs that guy gets hit on the leg and he is totally cold? DO YOU THINK THAT IS REALISTIC?
4) Chairman's and Owners don't have their personalities, style, or goals. Do you think all the clubs that play a League are there to win something? Some owners just want to MAKE A PROFIT and that's it. They want to make profits through Sponsors, Tickets, Transfermarkt, TV etc. Some of them don't care about anything but money. Where are the OUTSIDE PITCH GOALS OF A CLUB ? do you think its realistic ?
5) you can't decide about merchandise, ticket price, sponsorship NOTHING BUT THE DAM squad business
6) Where is the networking (MOST AGENTS AND CLUBS AND COACH develop relationship with each other and these people will then propose their players just to the ones they have relationship with) THIS DOESN'T EXIST IN THIS JOKE OF A GAME AND I THINK IT'S TIME TO ADD THIS FEATURE
7) the price...for what? seriously for what, we have to download the game, the logos, fix the colours of the competitions, the kits (one by one), the facepack, the colours of the Brazilian clubs, WTF ???!!! if this game is what it is, it's mostly thanks to the ppl that create all the features to make this garbage fun
8) the ""3D"" I mean go to Youtube and look for PC CALCIO 2001 and look at their 3d, that was made 20 years ago and looks better than FM20, I won't add any other comment about that. That should make everyone reflect (I personally never played 3d I don't care but it p***es me off when you talk about the ""improvements"" you make to that c**p every year
9) Transfer market with exchanges it's simply IMPOSSIBLE to make
10) the individual training does barely make improvements
11) It's simply RETARDED that a RIGHT WINGER can fully manage that position but if you put him as RIGHT MIDFIELDER the majority of them is gonna RED and completely DUMB !!! Imagine this: you have a player playing as Right winger and he is completely comfortable doing it, then you ask to play more defensively, about 15 meters back AT THAT POINT YOUR PLAYER LOOKS SHOCKED AT YOU AND STARTS SLAPPING HIS FACE AND SAYING DA DA DA DA like he has DOWN SYNDROME (no offense) cause in that position he is RED and he can't play.
I HOPE A NEW COMPETITOR WILL COME AROUND, SO YOU GUYS CAN CLOSE YOUR LEGAL MONEY COLLECTOR GAME AND BYE BYE, I'm asking a refund 

IT'S TIME TO CHANGE, THIS ISN'T POSSIBLE ANYMORE

87,Football Manager 2020,60121655,english,"Some of the new stuff such as the club vision and development centre are nice additions, but as has been said in countless reviews so far, the match engine is tedious at best. The number of one on ones missed or saved is what really ruins the game for me, the players trying to shoot from the byline or wingers shooting from a tight angle when there is someone in the centre free is just the cherry on the cake and I don't like cherries so it just compounds the misery for me.

The transfer system is as standard, a player you own is worth say 10mil, a club will offer 8 and said player will be upset that you reject the offer. A player another clubs owns is worth 10mil, they want 30mil and no ones bats an eyelash when you refuse to pay it.

The game feels like it is missing something, it feels pretty one dimensional now, it has a drop down box for the role when a club offers you a job, but you can only ever be a manager, it seems as though SI thought about putting things like head coaches and interim managers in, but decided not to, which is a shame as it could have been tied into the club vision quite nicely, with some clubs operating where you are the head coach and have little to no say in your TD or DOF appointments as well as the transfers, which does happen at some clubs.

I feel at some point SI will have to be bold at some point and offer the user a chance to be a reserve manager, academy manager or a director of football, as there is only so much they can do and rehash every year before it well and truly becomes stale, which if they continue down the path they have for the last few editions, could be in the near future.

40,Football Manager 2020,59971090,english,"I'd start this by ensuring you that I play the game since 1999 and I loved and also hated it ever since, despite the match engine is broken EVER SINCE! I played nearly every iteration in the last 20 years. I just can't understand why nobody could fix the match engine like ever. 

Below I tell you some examples for FM2020:

I play Dortmund right now, but the same thing happens with mostly all the teams I tried to manage...

1. Magic goal at the last second of the game:
Sometimes when the match engine realises that I'm having a better result that (according some hidden rule) I should have, then it corrects itself with a last second goal for the opposing team. It's really last second, so there's no replay, only the match ends and I realise on the scoreline that I lost. (there was also no scoring chance, or passes before, it just happens out of thin air) That bug can really break something deeply inside me...

2. My players are having a bad day:
This issue goes back a long time now, it existed more or less in every iterations of FM. If the RNG generates a bad number for you before the match then you CANNOT win. I've tried to reload the match as long as I got bored (after an hour or so) and every single time I've lost against a much weaker team. (maybe a few draws) I had like 3x the chances yet my players magically forgot how to score. I hit all the posts and crossbar 10 times, the rest goes over or their goalkeeper gets a 8.5 result after saving EVERYTHING. Then the other team goes once inside my box, and they score one from EVERY chance. This is also ridiculous.
2/b: I think that decision before the match is a real thing, as for example competition draws are decided BEFORE the draw. I checked it by saving on the draw day but BEFORE the draw itself. The I reloaded and drew again getting the same exact result over and over again. I getting to belive that matches work about the same. They are decided before, and ""simulation"" is only eyecandy, but the result (win or loose) is mostly decided before. You can only change in the match how bad it will be...

3. Teams play better with 10 man as with 11:
Also goes back a long time with FM. You are getting a good amount of chances and faring ok in the match maybe even leading by 1-2 goals. Then the opposite team looses a man with red card. After that they magically turn into 10 Messies and beat you up with no chance to counter them. Even if you switch to DEFENSIVE AGAINST A 10 MAN TEAM!! If on theother hand YOU loose a man you are as good as dead, they destroy you...

4. Opposing players magically learn to play football in the middle of the match:
You are getting massive amount of chances and really destroy the opposite team leading by 2-3 goals easily. Then something happens and the opposite team comes back into the game in 10 minutes. If you are lucky you can maybe still win, or draw by the skin of your teeth, but it's often turning into a draw or loss. I've checked, they didn't change tactic or stg. They just learned how to beat me in 10 minutes. 

5. Equalizing from kick-off after goal:
You score a goal, and the opposite team equalises from the kick off after 2 touches. I'm getting this in 2-3 out of 5 games.

Right now this 5 things annony me really after my last couple of matches, but I'm sure I could come up with 5 more if I weren't really pissed off.

All-in-all in this state of match engine you need to be a real fan of the game (like me) to play it, otherwise you will start to hate it for the rest of your life. I still hope that it will somehow be fixed, and I can really play it like it was meant to be, but in it's current state I cannot recommend you to buy and play the game. Wait until it will be fixed (if ever).

I have really tried to like this game but it only really ever serves to frustrate, most of the problems with this game I feel revolve around the match engine. I cannot even begin to estimate how many times I have dominated games in possession, shots & shots on target yet suffered defeat. On a very frequent basis I see my team generating well over twenty shots and over ten on target yet lose the game to a team generating only 2 or 3 shots. I recall this being a football manager curse over many seasons and hasn't been addressed, it simply isn't realistic and to say it happens in 2 out of every 3 games I play really wouldn't be an exaggeration. I accept it may happen from time to time but it is happening in virtually every game I play.
Method of goals being conceded is also dull, repetitive and unrealistic. I would estimate that 90% of the goals I concede are from balls lumped over the top to the striker who scores one on one with the keeper, I have tried lots of different instructions & formations to my defence but to no avail. This may be less frustrating if my strikers didn't miss 90% of their one on ones. But again, wholly unrealistic.
Their are other frustrating aspects to the game, particularly 16/17yr old prospects demanding moves to a bigger club before they are even good enough to break into the reserves never mind the first team. Undeterred they also demand promises of first team football in contract negotiations regardless of their talent, they just can't be reasoned with.
Media interaction seems to have changed little and the same boring, repetitive, pointless unrealistic questions crop up without an option to say anything even remotely like what you would like to say in response. Of course you can you send your assistant to say all the wrong things if you prefer. Surely this could be more imaginative.
I don't want the game to be easy, I want it to be fair. The vast majority of the games I play leave with me with the feeling of having been cheated, it's almost as if the game wants you to lose.

26,Football Manager 2020,57042738,english,"Heres the reality of what I had seen so far on the game and this beta release:
The match engine so far is a ABSOLUTE DISGRACE.The main thing about it is players don't adhere to certain tactical instructions at all. They simply don't adhere to instructions like : pass it shorter , shoot less often etc. Players love launching the ball for absolutely no reasons. Centerbacks launch the ball forward to a striker. Play constantly ""switches"" to other flanks about 3495895 times a game. Players loose possesion for no reason without even any pressure on them. Players miss 1v1 chances that are easier to score than miss on a CONSISTENT basis and dont get me wrong when i tested on my test juve save i won league 102 pts and all cups and cl semi  but i had seen this from TOP strikers like higuain etc miss TIME AND TIME AGAIN 1v1 chances however what DOES go in is : long shots , indirect free kicks , free kicks from rediculous ranges etc. The football being played is just rediculous. Often times players can't string a pass when they have obvious passing options they still launch a ball even with individual instructions such as shorter passing ( and i tested with good players.) 

NOW AS FAR AS GAME IN GENERAL AND NEW FEATURES:
The most notable feature in the game is that the board intervenes now when u dont follow certian philosophies such as sing players under 23 for first team etc. They might cancel future transfers u make because u didnt sign or adhere to these philosophies.

Theres also now a ""code of conduct"" that automatically disciplines players for various offenses such as missed training , red card etc.

And thats about all I saw so far new.
The game is roughly the same as last year except now the match engine in the beta at least is piss poor and needs RADICAL changes for the game to be worth playing.

HERES A UPDATE:
WHEN THE FUCKING PATCH 20.2 CAME OUT IT ABSOLUTELY PUT A NAIL IN THE COFFIN OF THIS FUCKING MATCH ENGINE. THE GAME UPON FULL RELEASE BECAME PLAYABLE FOR  A BRIEF PERIOD OF TIME BUT THEN THEY FUCKING KILLED IT WITH THE 20,2 PATCH. YOU CAN SEE ON FMARENA WHAT IT DID TO TOP TACTICS AND BELIEVE U ME IF TOP TACTITIANS LIKE KNAPP CANT CREATE A WORTHWHILE TACTIC ON THIS VOMIT NEITHER CAN YOU.

It happened to me where I had to take a holiday for a game because my game kept crashing in that specific game, then I thought ""well if it was just one game its no big deal"" but 3 games later the same issue happened again.
I've been in contact with their support through the forum and the support ticket but unfortunately no fix has come up yet.

54,Football Manager 2020,57460142,english,"So after some time and some updates, some insight and experience, i have decided to rewrite my review.
So the game as it are are still bugged, they did sort some of the more paramount things out and iam both a fan and not a fan of their match engine at the same time, i can see a lot of good things in it, but also some annoying bugs, i have more faith now than at last review, that those bugs will be sorted out.
iam currently really enjoying my game, specially after i found out how to counter to poor goal conversion rate with tactic and traits(not using exploit tactics) just took me some time to really build a decent tactic tailored for my players, the thing i hated most was poor 1vs1, its still poor but you can counter this with some traits on your attackers. also the fact that my wingers kept shooting into the side of the net instead of trying to pass it, sorted that out too with shoot less + the trait ""looking to pass rather than score""
ofc this takes time to train, unlesss your using editor, i do prefer the normal way myself, even tho i own the editor. they fixed the stats bug that rendered most of the regens useless, so now one can enjoy newly created wonderkids again. so with this in mind i decided to change my negative review, to a positive.
my old review is readable below this new one.


Old Review: 
""this game have been one of my favorite games for almost 10 years, and i can say that if this is the way they expect to continue, i am done. the match engine is a mess and there are a lot of weird stuff happening in matches, some matches seems to be predetermined, so no matter how many times you reload and change tactics and players you cant get a different result, new regens are generated without all their stats set, so all their undefined stats end up as a 1, which makes them useless, so long games arent a posiblilty at the moment, there are a lot of fixing before i would recommend anyone to use money on this game, so save your self some headache and stick with the 2019 version until they have fixed this game, who have to potential to be the best FM ever, but at the moment are unplayable unless your someone who edits everything.""",1574145943,1575988182,TRUE,0,0,0.502074659,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,138,6,32255,0,13182,1584984146,,

99,Football Manager 2020,59468483,english,"In my opinion this is the best iteration of FM I have played. However there are still negatives with it though as with every game.

Positives:
The new development centre allows for players like me who like using younger players and youth prospects to use there own intake more often.
The game is much better (in my opinion) at predicting and producing realistic results whilst also providing upsets such as in my personal Ipswich career gave me an fa cup win over Everton but a league thrashing by a newly relegated Southampton.

Negatives:
I do think that the way you find and approach free agents could do with an improvement as you should have a level of knowledge about their ability as well as be able to search for them specifically as a separate section instead of a broad transfers section.
I also think the way that interviews for prospective jobs need to be altered as on many occasions a chairman will question me about things that haven't happened to me such as media controversy.

22,Football Manager 2020,57851366,english,"Post Update Edit: Players now pass it into the box more often now when they have an option instead of shooting. Sometimes they do in fact shoot it from a narrow angle , but it's rather seldom. The 1v1s are still treacherous though. No improvement whatsoever.

I genuinely mean this when I say it, FM20 has, without a doubt, the worst match engine SI has ever implemented. The most common complaint this game has received so far is that strikers consistently miss 1v1s. Unfortunately this problem is rampant in this game. While this has been a problem in previous FMs, I can comfortably say I have yet to see a striker score from a 1 on 1 situation in my first 12 hours of gameplay.

 Not. A. Single. One.

What's this? My winger received an excellent through ball into the box? Oh that's great, if he strikes the ball he might sco-- why is he running all the way to the end of the pitch? Now the angle is far too narrow to get off a decent shot. Well at least he's in an excellent position to lay it off it in to my striker who's wide ope- oh he shot it at the keeper anyways.

You will see this happen every game, multiple times. It will consume your highlight reel. It's completely unrealistic. Drives you mad especially when you're losing because your opponent has had one shot from long range at your keeper, and your keeper is a brain dead nonce who dives over the ball. 

Overlapping full backs are an absolute nightmare. Even worse than wingers. They get themselves in great crossing positions, but consistently decide to get closer to the keeper, but engage them at a narrow angle. Always. Sometimes they even shoot with their weaker foot.

JUST PASS THE CUNTING BALL MATE.

44,Football Manager 2020,59295427,english,"Tl;Dr 3/10 at best. Get it on sale if you have too. Personally wont be buying future versions of the game until below issues are addressed. 

This game is basically just a database update on FM19. Sure they added some small, new features like the ""development center"" and detailed contract negotiations but don't let that layer of gloss fool you. The ""bread & butter"" aka the match engine and tactical aspects of the game are completely crap.  Also, graphics are still very poor compared to other smaller budget games of the same genre.

Some examples:

- Fullbacks and wide players won't make obvious passes or crosses in the final third. Half of your highlights will be this.....over and over and over again.....especially infuriating when you're behind. 
- Your tactical instructions will be completely ignored. Ex: Set an instruction for your center-mid with superb stats for ""teamwork"" to ""shoot less""? Screw that. He'll shoot from odd angles and distances anyways. Icing on the cake is that, more often than not, he'll often even score.
- Forwards are even worse. Clear-cut chances that even your grandma wouldn't miss, go begging. This will be the other half of your highlights for most games. 
- Through balls and passing is still kinda unrealistic and wonky. Most through balls don't...well..go through. While passing is just silly from time to time with players constantly switching the ball to the opposite flanks as if everyone is Paul Scholes or Pirlo. 

Side criticisms of the game:

- $50 dollars and they don't even have critical licenses, kits or logos like for Juve.
- Graphics are still very outdated compared to much lower budget games of the same genre.
- Weird lag, glitches and bugs can be found from time to time. Ex: blank screen appearing rather than the pitch during 3D matches when using custom skins. 
- Game feels too script-y. I don't know how to explain this but I just don't ""feel"" like I am playing the game anymore. Everything feels scripted like there's coded scenarios or animations for every possible input I make tactically. I hope I make sense. Maybe add more scripts so the game at least feels rich and realistic, idk?

25,Football Manager 2020,57395305,english,"UPDATE--played another 84 hours. 

I feel like this game is much more scripted than past games. I played as Arsenal and am 2nd in the EPL now. FA Cup comes around, and I have tried, I kid you not, 11 times to beat a League 2 team. Every single time, a different player gets a red card and I lose by at least one goal. I still lose even if I try to take a vacation and sim. 

This is about par for the course too. I've had Lewandowski line up next to Laca, and watch him receive a pass two meters in from the penalty spot, but hit the shot so poorly that it goes out for a THROW IN. That's nearly impossible. I convert 1 on 1 opportunities at maybe a 10-15% rate, and I had 37 shots on target against Ipswich Town but lost 2-1 because their keeper had over 30 saves. Something is really broken in the mechanics around shooting (and making the easy pass on a 2 on 1 instead of shooting it into the side netting) that makes the games within the game unplayable until fixed.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

I rarely leave reviews, but I feel like it's important to for this game. I've played these games since Championship Manager 2004 I believe, so I've spent thousands of hours (yikes) not just on Steam.

First of all, the match engine is broken. Shattered. Useless.

I've had more games than I can count with over 25 shots on target and haven't scored a goal, I've tried every tactic in the world to try to get touches to my Trequartista but can't get the ball to him, I score the majority of my goals from outside of the box even tho I almost always use ""Work Ball into the Box"" (I try to mainly play an Arsenal Tiki Taka), but most frustratingly of all are 1v1s.

1v1s are pointless. I've scored exactly one in more than a whole season of play, regardless if the finishing is 12 or 19--mind you, a lot of these goalies were **** from Sky Bet Championship in cup play too. I've yet to see them make an extra pass inside the box to score a goalie (again, think Arsenal) even when I've had a 4 to 1 break (he shot it from outside the box). It's unbelievable how hard it is to score a normal close goal. Want to win? Figure out a solid defensive structure, counter, and fire away from 30m because you're better off with that than 2 forwards and an AMC against a goalie. 

The UI is solid and the visuals are fine, nothing too exciting, but the board is ruthless. I signed Vignato who scored 18 goals and 15 assists in his first season, and was considered a decent price, but I still got a B on the signing. No explanation why. 

In all honesty, if I hadn't pre-ordered, I would ask for my money back on this game and wait until next year. I'd just get an updated roster for FM 2017, which I think has the most balanced match engine of all the recent games, because I want to try to emulate football management, and this game resembles very little the game I love.",1574034825,1575151231,FALSE,23,2,0.538862467,1,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,54,1,19527,0,5077,1599607001,,

Don't get me wrong it's a good game, but still has it's issues like every FM has (and probably will), this one to me seems a little more perfected but it doesn't stop some down right perplexing things happening during matches. 
There are a few nice additions this time around, like the development centre so you can focus on youth growth. More staff positions add a realistic feel and give you more options to delegate tasks to. Club vision now allows you to make a five year plan with your board adding to the overall feel of being the manager of a club. 

Is it better than FM 19, to me yes. 
Is it a radical change that makes you ""feel wow...this is so new..."" no it is not. 
It's a game for long term fans of the series but is a great entry point for new players, it feels very accessible and there are plenty of websites out there to give help with guides and tactics. I find the UI is easy to navigate and easy to find what you're looking for.

I'm hoping to see some issues addressed in future patches but that of course remains to be seen. 
Eg. Youth players demanding ridiculous wages, penalty conversions I have had an issue with though it's been better since the last patch.
There are more that many others I am sure have mentioned so I won't bother with a long boring list to read through.

Been playing since the beta opened and been having a great time, here's some of my key takeaways to help anyone considering buying:

Streamlining:
The game at this point can essentially play itself with you in charge, I never touched some features in previous versions and never really wanted to. Now you can take charge of exactly as many duties as you want and the game feels so much smoother and more fun and you have the peace of mind knowing every aspect of your club is being used reasonably effectively. Obviously you get best results by reading guides online and implementing it yourself but to save you time and stress this feature is really useful

Man Management:
In FM19, regardless of my Discipline stat, players were kicking down my door every 5 minutes to whine about something. I'm happy to report they've reigned this in significantly for FM20, yes you still get issues but they seem to be more grounded in what is actually happening.

Feedback:
SI have really revamped the amount and quality of feedback you receive so it's now much more clear what you are doing that's working and what you need to change on a variety of fronts

In game:
Other criticisms you're seeing are right, you don't score many one-on-ones regardless of quality and pressing seems to lead to high number of bookings, but it's the first version of FM where I'm clearly seeing the tactics I'm selecting actually playing out, YMMV. Seem to score from range a lot more consistently though, so it's swings and roundabouts.

It's worth checking out if you're looking for a experience that CAN be less intimidating and slow, but allows veterans to delve into all the minutiae of this very deep management sim.",1575009488,1575009488,TRUE,10,0,0.662946582,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,229,1,55306,3645,18799,1602005198,,

Some things i noticed

- My goalkeeper did this several times, a ball is shot low and my goalkeeper makes a high dive
- Players pass the ball and for some reason they dont pay attention anymore to the game, like he pass and someone pass back and he just walk a different direction,
- Players sometimes dont even look at the ball when defending but walking around
- in a sprint in defence, the player suddenly stop IMMIDIATLY for no reason.
- sometimes they just walk to a ball and the opponent sprint from 20 meter and gets the ball
- The players make 3-4x weird moves when tackled in one position (Gets tackled) but still manage to keep the ball.
- saw some players get tackled and no one is near the person.

one thing improved in mechanic: The old FM when a goalkeeper stops the shot and the ball goes to the line, your own player gets the ball but stand there as a idiot and the defender steals the ball behind from him, this happend many times but i did not see it in this version.

shortly gameplay is improved but the game mechanic is worse then ever.
- sometimes a player is behind a other player but makes a iceskating move and he get in front of the other player

Really i think i will go back to FM19 the game mechanic killing me now. If you like to be anoyed and break your screen then play this game.

FM20 does the best job of any instalment so far of improving and expanding on the good and dealing with the negatives.

The match engine is fantastic. Players move in a convincing way; stepovers, Cruyff turns, stop-and-go, all represented here in the best match engine to date. Yes the crowd animations are repetitive but you know what, if you want to play FIFA, go and play FIFA.

The IMMENSE scale of the game means you might feel overwhelmed by your responsibilities and the sheer amount of clicking you need to do to establish your latest season but please, friend, worry not! Along with all these new options comes a wealth of new staff responsibilities, and you can delegate or take charge at your leisure, Like to finalise signings but don't really care about the scouting side of things? Delegate it. Prefer to find those hidden gems yourself but couldn't care less about negotiating their contracts? Sure, delegate it. Want to keep an eye on your blossoming U23 side but the U18s are just too far off your radar right now? Guess what? Delegate it.

I haven't been this impressed with the advances in a Football Manager title since FM13, everything you can think of that would improve the series from FM19 is here. Data presentation is fantastic, player development and progression is as close to perfection as it could be. FM20 makes the complicated things seem simple and makes the simple things seem effortless. To me, this is now THE Football Manager title. 

Simply put, FM20 is a defining moment in the history of Football Manager titles. Make no mistake, this one is a classic. Though you may not find the next Tonton Zola Mokouko sitting in Derby County's reserves, every story you do write for yourself on this genre-defining game will carry its own memories and legacy and surely that is the highest praise of all.

1. not good looking graphics - do you actually have a art director or somebody with a good esthetic feel? The 3d Graphic are not appealing at all. It is as you are playing a game from 2005 or worse. Stadium looking all the same. Even if you do not have the licens just do a bit on an afford to build stadium which maybe looking nearly the same es the originals. The light in 3d mode is off - it is not a very good atmosphere. And the most funny part is the weird looking black dots on the grass to simulate that the usage of the pitch. I really do not get this at all.

2. animation of the players are - how do i say it - weird. Player sliding over the pitch or moving strange. They do not behave as they should in a 2019 engine. 

But overall it is the best football manager right now - it is actually the only one or i would say there is no competition. So maybe this is why it feels as you playing the 2019 version with half assed changes.

You have a big publisher on hand and i am not sure why it is like this. It feels like that the match engine got dummer. If you watch the whole game you can see that something feels of. Just read the forums. I guess many people are not happy with it.

I just do not want to buy a database every year. I want also good graphics and a good engine. Please get somebody for your team that can make it happen.",1574867867,1574867867,FALSE,17,0,0.594445169,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,207,1,69540,308,5452,1601832437,,

8,Football Manager 2020,56386447,english,"Yes it's BETA, but it's poor. Not really a lot can be wrong with the skin etc. so it mostly comes down to the ME - and it is shoddy. 

Every Ai attack is a simple punt over the top for the striker to chase - regardless of how deep you defensive line is, how little you press, how tight the marking is (or not). Makes no difference - punt finds the striker/winger/full back in acres of space.

Another issue is how many times per game you hit the post. 5? 6? Not an uncommon number.

Full backs refuse to cross - despite their instructions to do so ""...more frequently"".

Your players rarely win headers.

The old ""stand there swinging left and right until I'm tackled even though I have an easy pass on"" is still there.

SI have had several years to sort out these problems in the ME and each time, the same problems. Makes you wonder exactly what they can justify the £35 for - except for a new purple skin of course.

Edit. Can't help but also notice how the percentage of injuries have increased since release - and the release of the in-game editor. 

Furthermore, the Ai will arbitrarily give you a ""bad run of form"" once a season - without fail. Just now, I played around with a game v. Atalanta in the Serie A. Played the game three times and all three resulted in a 0-0 draw despite Atalanta registering 0 shots in the three games. My team registered between 5 and 12 shots on target. As a test, I reloaded and went on holiday giving my assistant instructions to use the same team and instructions I had used in the previous 3 attempts. With the Assistant manager in charge using my tactics and team selection the three results came in as 1-3, 2-3 and 0-3 in my favour. Why would the three results be so different despite using my instructions and team selection when the only difference is that the Ai is in charge on the team?",1572781661,1574856970,FALSE,2,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,136,22,19511,0,1372,1594329040,,

cons:
- i needed to adjust to the bright/strong colors. i preferred smoother color. since i'll play this game for hundreds if not thousand of hours, smoother colors will definitely appreciated. like ""matte"" colors.
- team selection view by default with team shape minimized and positioned at the bottom left, i find it very annoying when i dragged a player to a certain position and the formation getting blocked by attributes comparison pop-up.
- sometimes achievement not show up right away. i got ""Total Support"" and ""Superb Dressing Room Atmosphere"" a little while after i actually getting it on the game. maybe it's good that the records not lost. maybe finally i'll get Goal of the Month achievement that has been bugged a few years before.
- there are a few bugs here and there, but i expect it will be patched. for example:
-- often when i make substitution and tactical tweaks, then i clicked confirm, there was no option to give team talk so then there is no option to confirm changes. it stuck and i have to start over. there are 2 button, confirm and team talk. i always want to give team talk but maybe i clicked wrong (confirm) so this bug appear. but still, fix this, or erase confirm button so it's automatically give team talk.
-- when i confirm substitution/s, and before it happens, my player on the pitch got a red card. it gets messy.

The development center is a nice upgrade to get a quick snapshot view of promising youth players. The in-game engine seems better (I tend to play with better teams so maybe the difference is more notable there) and players' touches and passes seem to look and feel better.

With the good, there is of course the not-so-good.

1) Bugs. In the staff tab, when I click on ""youth team staff""(u-19 or reserves), sometimes the click does not work. It just sits there. This also happens vice-versa when i am in the u-19 staff menu and i click on ""first team staff"" and of course again it doesnt work. In game, there is also issues again with inside forwards/wingers just running down line and shooting it straight at the near post. It seems like you need to have 15 vision, passing, teamwork, and the ""pass before shoot trait"" in order to get your player to actually just simply cross the ball to your open forward. Speaking of forwards, for the last 3 years pure single-striker systems struggle to have a consistent scoring striker. Maybe its just the formations I play (vertical tiki-taka for the most part) but I find it hard sometimes to get my striker to consistently score. 

2) Ridiculous training injuries. Why the hell do some of my players randomly get a ""Training injury"" all the time. Also, one thing I've noticed, if you haven't saved in a while, the game will throw an injury your way. IT HAPPENS ALL THE TIME. I personally dislike injuries very much, but that is my preference.

All in all, the game is absolutely worth getting for the FM fans and newcomer. The game does a great job in helping you progress through a campaign and set you up for the future with the new development system.

For me, yes. I play each game for hundreds of hours and make databases and the like. The development centre is a big plus for me, as it focuses on one of the best aspects of the game - developing wonderkids. The quality of life updates all over the shop are brilliant to have as well - you really notice the difference.

The thing that makes me positive that it was a good decision is that I could never go back to FM19 now, I really like the new features and playing without them would just feel inferior now. Make of that what you will.

As to the match engine, in the beta there certainly were many missed one on ones, and wingers shooting from ridiculous angles. Happily I can see that I do not experience these issues any more than I did in previous iterations of the game now. I wouldn't say the match engine is an improvement but after the updates it certainly isn't a step back anymore.

44,Football Manager 2020,57544271,english,"So there are some good new features this year BUT... that doesn't matter really because the game is broken.

The match engine is dire this year. DIRE.  Frame rate loss and stuttering are terrible problems, and the actions of the players are just ridiculous. Players dribble for 50 yards down the pitch on a regular basis without any attempt from another player to challenge them.  You don't really feel like your decisions and tactical tweaks make much of a difference to the action either. 

Additionally the text bar commentary is STILL semi disconnected to what you actually see happening on the pitch.

I thoroughly enjoyed meeting the fans and boards objectives scouting the world to find the best bargain next world class stars, picking up wonderkids and developing the quality players that were already there. Loved the attacking football and watching my goal machines do their thing,

Where did it go wrong you ask?

As soon as SI started fiddling around and patching things! Now granted the game was released with a lot of cosmetic bugs things like not being able to delete notes and fine players etc however game play was fantastic I would count myself as the majority who just want to sign scout and train players and get on with things and do well with the odd challenge and let things develop season on season as better players come in,

However now that they have patched the game it has become so bloody boring, my team which is full of world class players and stars in the making now barely beat the weak teams by a goal and are losing and drawing against teams they should annihilate even lost 4-1 when I was drawing 1-1 after THEY got a player sent off. Also had several games where there have been 7 bookings in a game and sending's off between both teams and I am not even set to 'get stuck in'

Anyhow the tactical familarity of my team is great the morale is great squad is incredibly talented I have 3 different tactics to choose from some tweaked and newer than others because as we all know the AI learns your tactics after 8/10 games.

I am someone who has been playing these games probably for the best part of 25 years so i know my stuff but because of poor decisions on SI's part the game play and match engine is both boring and unresponsive.

I was hoping the full release would remedy this but it is clearly an issue they have given no thought to at all.

I just wish I had not spent £35 quid and put so much time into this already because as it stands I will now wait until Xmas before I play the game again in vain hope that they update the match engine and game play in a further patch.

4,Football Manager 2020,57488801,english,"+ The game aims for high realism! Man U, (yes I know I'm not writing it right, but I do it on purpose) is in the bottom and fighting for survival in the PL with over 1billion spent every transferwindow. Arsenal are in the middle of the table, Everton is relegated, Leeds coming out of the Championship, Barcelona vacuuming the best players from Liverpool ... I don't know what could have been more realistic with the game.
+ New features work optimally and are easy to understand.

- If you play a match and have 40 shots, 28 on goal and no one is in, you will be incredibly frustrated.
- That Liverpool do not sell any players in a transitional window, but can still buy Dybala, De Vrij, Ziyech and Van De Beek, is bullshit. so incredibly unlikely transfer windows! 

I have played fm from 2009, before that I have played CM from 2001 (?).
I have now spent almost 40 hours in the beta, most bugs have been wiped away, the new features that have been added work optimally and I like them very well.
the only thing that I'm still not happy with is;
- realism of the transitional windows
- poor graphics engine during matches
- limited options to customize the manager you create
- That you have to tamper with files on the data to name Juventus, Champions leauge and Premier Leauge
- That logos have to be downloaded in order to be decent, this also applies to the team kits.
- Portrait photo for players, should as of today be mandatory.

And take your joy to a whole new level in the press conferences as we bring you THE EXACT SAME questions from years gone by, but with the bonus of new questions that make no sense!  Experience the joy of answering the same questions each and every in game week in multiple weekly press conferences.  And don't worry, you still have to do them because your assistant manager will just upset your players if you leave it to him!  Speaking of upset players, they're still here, still moaning, still wanting new contracts in the first year of new contracts and still getting upset about anything and everything just because!  And speaking of inept staff, your chief scout wont even assign someone to watch the next opposition even if he's highly rated and experienced!

I've put a lot of time in to this year and last year.  The core is somewhere buried amongst all the utter tosh the devs throw in every year, but it's getting harder and harder to enjoy.  SI Games seems to have forgotten that people play games to escape the tedium of life and work, not to experience someone else's.  Having multiple press conferences every week with the same quesitons over and over and over and over and over and over is utterly soul destroying, having players whinge constantly is just annoying and does anyone know the point of the judging skills with scouts because the highly skilled and low skilled seem to rate guys the same.

I'll play this, I'll enjoy team building, tactics, transfers and developing young players, but all of that will be severely tarnished by all the add on crap that doesn't need to be there.

1. Home advantage is ridiculous, when you are playing as the away team, you can never score even if you have more than 15 shots and over half of them are on target. On the other hand, the home team scored as soon as they have 1 or 2 shots on target.

2. Players are still doing insane and unreasonable actions, e.g. clearing the ball to my own end line when they got the ball near mid-field. This issue persisted for at least 5 years in this franchise.

3. Players always use header to knock the ball to opponent players even if there is absolutely no threat around him.

4. You can hardly score from 1 on 1 chances, this is very unrealistic, and persisted many years as well.

Firstly, your strikers will miss 1 on 1 chances 9 out of 10 seriously, and the opposition strikers as well. So even if your team adopts an attacking football, you won't get scored a lot, and meanwhile, your strikers shoot 10 and score 1.

I am now playing Arsenal, this team has two good strikers. Lacazette and Aubameyang. 
Now I am leading PL, and they both don't even score 10 goals in the league ( 28  matches passed)
Most of goals came from Xhaka, Guendouzi, David Luiz. Yeah Nicolas Pepe is a good player and he can score. But what about two strikers? They miss 1 on 1 challenge 90%, this is why Auba scores only 8 goals and Lacazette 4. They just boot them to the opposition keeper or goes to over the bar.

But here is the point, I adopt long range shooting tactics, therefore, in away match, I won over Tottenham ( 5-1), Man city ( 2-1) Liverpool ( 4-1 )
so at this time, all you need is adopting a long range tactics and never expect 1 on 1 challenges as your strikers won't score.

Much better Game Engine

More interesting Dialogue options and some added media stuff.

Adding seasonal goals has increased the depth and functionality of transfers and signing staff. Players also seem to value these items more than in the past.

Same game fundamentally that I know and love.

The Bad -
I've seen 99.9% of all one on ones go out of bounds or miss. Mine and NPC combined. 50+ Hours played. literally have seen 100s of 1on1 breakaways.

My players also seem to ignore ""Shoot Less"" and ""Work Ball Into Box"" and shoot from 30-40 yards out with both instructions.

For some reason the dialogue options are confused. I'm in first playing second place - Dialogue option ""The standings currently have us in 4th and our opponents in 1st...""

Also not sure how I am expected to finish in the bottom half of the league. I'm undefeated as of January in the Serie C/C in 1st place with a 6 point lead. If I lost literally every game I have left I'd still finish comfortably in 12th. This affects everything from dialogue options, future player signings and betting odds.

FM 2020 is more of the same with some solid improvements. Certainly compared to 18, the quick tactic creator can be great for newer players who don't quite know what every tactic option does. Pick a template (with helpful in-game descriptions on what exactly the tactics do), tweak it a bit for how your team plays, and you're good to go. The more detail training schedules help out too to really focus your team's weaknessses, rather than forcing you into broad attacking/defense/technical categories.

I really think FM 20 is the best starter entry into the series in a long time. Doesn't mean you're guaranteed success or a championship, especially if you start on a top-league team with no experience. But it walks you through the basics of setting up your team even if you don't bother delegating tasks to your coaching staff, and even if you lose, you'll at least have some idea WHY you're losing.

53,Football Manager 2020,56845623,english,"TL:DR - Solid release with lots of small and large improvements, however some of the same issues still present.

For me this is probably the strongest release in a long time so far. Engine feels slightly improved from last year with only a couple of bugs noticed and some of the common ones from the previous releases fixed.

PROS

As well as that they have once again added a new large feature in the player development system, I am yet to get stuck into it however it looks a decent addition with some nice tools for developing your youth teams. They have definitely expanded in this area.

As well as the major additions they have refined and sharpened a lot of existing content and features. I really enjoy the expanded staff responsibilities. Allows you to make a lot more use out of your backroom team, I have hired a really strong Head of Youth development in my game and given him permission to find and sign new players for the U18s, however I have kept responsibility for the final say meaning if the players not good enough or in a position thats already saturated I can veto it.

There are very minor improvements that only experienced players will likely even notice and even I am finding hard to recall. One example I can say is that when you get promoted from lower leagues in previous game you always go into the next season 500-1 or even 1000-1 to win the league, regardless of signings or how good your team is.

This is the first time where the odds actually reflected reality when I went up. My players were really strong and I made big loan signings. We started the season at 16-1 to go up. It felt more realistic.

Another example of these minor improvements and refinements was when negotiating deals. In previous titles I found the player demands pre contract were virtually useless. You could just remove them all and the player would still be happy to negotiate, he might just ask for a little more money.

Not any more, players will reject negotiations more often if you remove all there demands.

There are lots of tweaks and changes like this and they add up to a more immersive and enjoyable game with more problems to solve and elements to manage and balance. May add more of the better ones when I encounter them in my game and am reminded.

The overall UI is an improvement for me also, feels clearer and more concise. Easier to navigate.

CONS

Some of the small main issues and in my opinion the one big problem with FM still exist.

Small issues like team shouts being too repetitive and not really dynamic, unrealistic player fallout when a shitty 4th choice defender is unhappy he isn't starting, teams worse then yours offering you a job every week when your doing well etc. A lot of these still haven't been addressed, though some of them have as I pointed to in my previous section. These didn't make the game unplayable then and don't know.

The main issue is still there for me. Once you have mastered the game its too easy and always will be. For experienced players who understand the games tactical and man management systems it becomes far too easy. I am able to take a conference team to the premiership in 5-7 seasons every single game I start without fail. The tactics I play haven't changed since FM2016 really, they were tweaked in the last tactical overhaul but the principle is still the same.

I just follow the same tried and tested formula. Its always the same and there isn't really that big a challenge anymore.

The game is still fun for me and I enjoy growing my team, discovering new talent, taking my team from the lowest league to the best team in the world and doing big money negotiations etc.

But as well as new features and expansions on what is there I long for a new challenge in the games existing mechanics. Maybe a harder mode with some new problems to deal with, or where the existing problems are tougher to deal with or identify. 

The last few releases have added a lot of identification and prevention tools, I think this was largely down to the community complaining about the game being broken in regards to the match engine, injuries and tactics etc.

SI do listen to the fan base and gave a lot of ways to make identification of these complaints easier, as virtually 99% of the time it was the player not managing properly, not an issue with the game.

I fear SI will never be able to please everyone in this regard and they have settled on a balance between the two types of players.

Even then it was more balanced than it is now.

I have to say this is the most unbalanced and unrealistic FM I have ever played.

3 Seasons in and every single season the same happens. I play with FC Porto, and it's impossible to win the league. SL Benfica always wins it even though I completely destroy them in every match we face each other.

My results with them are always 3-0, 4-0 and even 5-0. But what happens is that SL Benfica doesn't lose any points other than the points they lose against me, meaning they always win every single match and finish top of the league with an unrealistic 90+ points.

Other than this, in 3 seasons clubs such as Chelsea and Manchester City have become bankrupt?!?

Edited: Finished second place in the league one point from first place. At the end of the third season, the day after I won the Portuguese Cup and the last match of the season (second cup won that season) I got told off by the board for failing to win the Cup I had just won (I know right?!?).

While I'll recommend this game, from what I've seen so far it's a small visual update to the previous years game with a greater emphasis to changes to the in game systems and mechanics surrounding the management of your club. 

I've come across some errors with the in game 3D engine not always matching up with the calls being made (i.e. constant offside calls when in the 3D match engine its clearly onside) but that is probably a beta issue. The 3D engine doesn't appear to be greatly improved graphically, but I've noticed more nuanced movement and animations with the players on the pitch. 

Player management, particularly squad management has changed somewhat and there are even more ways to classify your players and set training now.

You may view this as being more of the same but in my experience that's not always a bad thing with Football Manager.",1573257115,1573257115,TRUE,6,1,0.614543438,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,736,40,3229,0,65,1587226289,,

88,Football Manager 2020,56785974,english,"Great improvements already in the beta version - the new features add more depth and allow for players to focus on micromanaging or delegating.
In any case, there are a lot of issues to iron out still.
- One on ones (as mentioned in a lot of other reviews) are missed at an extraordinary rate.
- The fact that there are *so many* one on ones every game also needs review, since it's unrealistic.
- Defensive line mechanics don't seem to be working properly, they always allow for strikers to dash behind defenders.
- When facing the goal, strikers (or any other player for that matter) always goes for goal and never passes to a better placed teammate, even if the other player is all alone in front of goal and the striker doesn't have a clear angle.
- Selecting low or whipped crosses doesn't really change anything.
- A few of the club vision criteria are not measured properly. For example, if the club doesn't expect you to sign players over 30, and you sign 8 players of 20 or under, they will still be ""reserving judgment"" even after two years managing the team.
- Transfer negotiation between clubs (or contracts with players / agents) need a bit of rework. Negotiations are easily broken for minor reasons.
- Conversations with players who are unhappy (want a new contract, etc) should also be reviewed. They sometimes request an improved contract ""just because"", and the conversation itself doesn't always go OK even if you promise to offer a new one.

Regardless of the issues stated above, I still strongly recommend it. I trust the issues will be sorted, the game stabilised, and all in all it's a great game.

development centre
club visions 
match engine (for some aspects, will be clear later)
and fm for being fm

One on ones seem almost pointless
long range efforts are always finding the net
the first season seems to have a few PL teams unbalanced

I'll happily admit that I haven't bought a Football Manager game since 2017, due to feeling like nothing was ever really changing. But this time seemed different, and how right I was to make the early investment this time around.

As a Football Coach in real life, it's great to see more control over the development of youth players and how the backroom staff can help make or break a player, depending on their own skills as a coach. Before I would pick a lower league side and try to work my way up...it didn't matter what the skill of my players were, we could get promoted every season. But now it feels more realistic, which I love. Destined for relegation? Then you probably will without a decent training set up and well thought through tactics.

Choices matter now. Early pre-season is actually important and can effect how your team manages the start of the season...player negotiations are much more realistic too! (Though the constant emails from the scouting meeting can get annoying, when you're not looking to expand).

22,Football Manager 2020,56524634,english,"As an FM player since 2011 I can safely say that this game is a definite improvement upon FM19.

As a lot of reviewers have also mentioned; the match engine has come leaps and bounds from last years game. FM19's match engine was annoyingly repetitive despite changing tactics, players made the same decisions, stayed in the same position and made odd mistakes that shouldn't be made. So yeah a huge plus point.

I actually really like the new youth development tab. As a player that likes to frequently bring through youth players, this makes this style of management so much easier. Whilst earlier games weren't very thorough in keeping track of players out on loan, a quick click can view this.

Don't expect any UI changes or match graphics to be improved as these are spitting images of last years games. I don't think the UI is bad, but previous versions were definitely better. Most FM veterans will agree.

Delegation of staff responsibilities has been tweaked for the better. I personally prefer my coaches to set opposition instructions and now they'll make these changes for you throughout each match, a big plus point.

Although this game is far to similar to FM19, the tweaks and changes that have been made are worth investing into.

Let's be honest... we know why we're here. Only the hardiest of souls dare wander into sports management sims, but you're here, and you're ready.

For me, having some of the old features feel like an old pair of boots is incredibly welcome. I wandered right back into core mechanics that were familiar, and that was great. Tactics, signing players, match play, etc. 

Some of the new features are really great and will be underrated/underappreciated at first. Club Vision is very relatable to real world scenarios, and I did new (to me) backroom staff roles.

Also, I do not believe it's new, but I absolutely love the Social Group and Team Hierarchy mechanics! Having both personal and team personalities is slick, and recognizable players on a team coalesce or conflict with each other can either bring teams together or rip them apart. 

Match play seems super solid, and I appreciate that shouts work! I've started with Crewe Alexandra, primarily because as an American traveling through London and Manchester, I always transfer in Crewe (and my real world experience with Arsenal is already traumatic enough).

I haven't messed with training, but that's the next goal. ;)

*BETA Flaws*

- Players are not getting linked (e.g. green line when wing back and winger getting used to play with each other.)

- Goalkeeper stats graphic are too bright their stat graphics are almost invisible.

- 3D matches are laggy (i need to change settings to lowest before match then back to higher during match to fix the lag)

- Dark skin is not actually dark on some inbox messages.

- When using searching on drop tab menu, pressing on keyboard buttons to fast access not working. (e.g. clicking E to select England easier, not working)

- When saving team selections, box that we are writing down the selection name is not activated until clicking on box or pressing tab button on keyboard. On FM19 it was automatically activated.
