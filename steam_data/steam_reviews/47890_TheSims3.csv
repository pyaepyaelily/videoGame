35,76795212,english,"I have been playing Sims since Sims 1, and Sims 3 is my favorite.  You get a lot more out of the EP and Stuff packs.  
Plus, every now and then Steam runs some specials on the game so you can get it cheaper.  The building and Create a Sim is great too.  I feel like Sims 4 is better at building, but for gameplay Sims 3 is better.  Which you can still build great, amazing items in the Sims 3, others and I have done it.   I am happy that they now offer Sims 4 on Steam, it's about time.  But I personally like Sims 3 best.  But with all things, if you want more gameplay you will have to buy some of the EP and Stuff packs.  I personally have about 11, including base game.  But I am more story based in my games and want packs based on how I tell stories.   

Also, make sure your computer can handle it.  I have always upgraded my graphic's card on any computer that I played on.
If your computer is slower, than the game will lag.  And it depends on how many EPs and Stuff packs you add.  I personally have a lot of CC too, and play in a lot of CC worlds.  
I started playing this game on my older computer in 2009.   But since about 2014, I have added some extra gameplay into my Sims by adding CC.  
However, you don't have to add CC, custom content, to play.  
The Sims worlds/ neighborhoods are nice, and even right now, I have a game going in Sunset Valley, and I am playing with pre-made game characters who live in the town.  Right now, on my newer computer, I have 8 neighborhoods I'm playing in.
Just remember the more you add to your game the more the computer uses, think Graphic's Card.  I know for Me, upgrading my Graphic's Card helped.  But it's really up to your computer and how it will play.  I'm not computer savvy and I couldn't tell you the best Graphic Card to get.  I would normally tell my guy that I want my game to run good/great with the game, and he would find the graphic's card for me to help with game play.  I do know I have it maxed on my 2018 computer. 
 
Another nice feature to Sims 3 is the color wheel, which allows you to color your sims, furniture, buildings, and anything else to any color you want.   I love the color wheel.
But again, remember the more you add the more you use.   Like any game, it has its good and bad aspects.  What game doesn't?
There is just so much to do in Sims 3.  I spend hours just building a sim or house alone.  But that's what I like.  I spend hours creating stories about my sims, but that is what I like, and Sims 3 allows me to do all of that.   
And that is why Sims 3 is still my favorite.",1601438996,1601438996,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198360329153,8,1,30335,330,30005,1601511285

88,76450744,english,"Pros: The Sims 3 is definitely an improvement from the Sims 2 and is, in my opinion, the best of all 4 games. The lore is deep and families from the Sims 2 are back. There is so much customization when it comes to building lots and adding clothes to your sims. The game also has music from real artists translated into Simlish for the simmer's pleasure. There are a ton of personality traits, aspirations, and I love the biography option. The player has so much creative choice and there are quite a few unique features that other sims games don't have. Sims react more realistically to life events than in the Sims 4 and it's an open-world, so you're not staring at a loading screen every time your sim leaves the house. The build and buy modes have a wider variety of textures with more customization, angling, and furniture. The settings menu itself has a lot of customization and preferences to offer, including changing your sims' lifespans. If you have the pets expansion, you can actually play as your pets, unlike in the Sims 4 where pets are NPCs. The game offers a tutorial for new players to help them navigate it's many features and also provides a small guidebook. You can also look up tips online. There is a social feature where you can message, friend, and like the posts of other simmers as well as post your own content. As a writer, I sometimes use this game to act out my stories and bring them to life.

Cons: The game isn't complete without buying expansion packs. This has always been a problem with the sims games as players have been urged from the very beginning to spend money on additional content. The game is also very glitchy and hasn't been updated in years due to the fact that EA is instead focusing on more recent projects (like the Sims 4.) The base game itself doesn't have a wide variety of clothes and hair styles and can get boring after a while. I've had to reinstall the game more than once due to bugs. The quality of the game is typical of it's time, but is considered outdated and low now. The interaction between the sims and objects could also use some improvement, especially since sims have a larger space bubble and therefore can't walk as freely, unlike in the Sims 4 where they can pretty much go wherever they want. The game also uses sliders instead of clicking and dragging, but this is mostly because that kind of feature hadn't really been introduced in video games yet and was a very new concept when this game was released. If you're a fan of sliders, this may be a good thing, but if you prefer clicking and dragging, you won't see any of that here. The sims' fears from the Sims 2 don't exist in this game. The game stores memories and life events, but the sims can't talk about them and are not as affected by them as they are in the Sims 2. It's also harder to play without using a mouse.

Tips and side-notes: Although this game is available on console, I recommend downloading it on PC as the controls are a lot easier and it'll be easier to type commands as well as other texts. When installing mods, test them out as sometimes files can conflict and become corrupted. You can view your downloaded content in the launcher under ""Downloads."" If you need technical support, since EA no longer provides it for this game, I recommend diving into the sims forums. Often times you'll find people experiencing a similar problem and there are experts who can help you out. I also recommend getting expansion packs while they're on sale. If you like the game, there are a number of Discord servers you can join that also provide technical support.

Overall, this is a good game and I love it. Cheers-",1600897960,1600897960,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,76561198161393554,23,6,53531,3047,51126,1601870715

Friends recommended Sims 3 over 4 and I'm very happy with the purchase. Bought the game and a few handpicked DLC when it was all on super sale. The price of this DLC is outrageous. That's the biggest con about the game (get it, con). Anyway I also kept getting game crashes until I installed a few of the essential (they really are) mods from NRaas. After that the game runs smooth enough on the smaller maps that I can play multi generations on one save with no crashes. There's enough to do that I doubt I'll ever run out. Xmas will prolly hit by then and I'll just pick up another DLC. If you like playing god or exploring crazy scenarios in a sandbox this is one of the best games to do it in (*cough after mods *cough).

The DLC I currently play with and consider essential are: Seasons, Generations, & Pets. They honestly should be part of the base game but whatevs. 

I also bought Late Night and like it a lot, but i wouldn't go calling it essential, I'd say any DLC beyond the 3 listed above just depends on your play style.

I'm pretty sure this is one of my favorite games. It's the sims, so you already know if you're going to love it or hate it. I'm going to focus on a few key points though, since I believe it is best played in a certain way.

-DLC and prices
Yes, there is a lot of DLC and it is expensive. A lot of people are disgusted at the idea of spending hundreds on a game to get the full experience. I will tell you, as someone with a lot of history with this game, owning all the expansions is not advisable. The game becomes unstable, bugs multiply, sims become borderline bipolar in their actions and there's so much happening and so much to keep track of that you'd have to play a VERY long game to see it all in one sim's lifetime.
Pick and choose what DLC is interesting to you. Otherwise, just play the base game; it's very playable without any additional content and you're able to download tools to create custom neighborhoods and clothing for sims with little effort.

-Mods
The modding support is cool and can help the game, but I prefer playing without mods. For quite a while I used mods simply to enhance game stability and longevity. After a while though, I found that game actually ran worse and was less stable when using them. They prevented a lot of prevalent bugs and issues, but I've personally experienced a lot fewer serious issues on a vanilla setup. Your millage may vary is all I'm trying to say.

-""The best"" setup
As I said, pick and chose your DLC and mods carefully, but I've found the game shines the most with the following:
No mods
Generations, Ambitions, Pets, University and Seasons
Full autonomy for sims and pets and a long lifespan with default values
Graphics to max and I prefer to run in windowed at 1280x720 so I can watch videos or peruse reddit while playing

Currently on a save of 20 hours and haven't had a crash or major issue beyond some stray horses clipping into my sim's house one time. moveobjects on fixes that in an instant and beyond that I'm bug free.
Every expansion I listed all synergize well together and really have a sim-focus to them. 
Generations expands each life state so they're detailed and interesting and have obstacles depending on the specific sim. 
Ambitions expands job and career opportunities allowing your sim's career to be as in-depth and micromanaged or as simple as you like, along with proper self-employment.
University allows sims to attend university whilst not aging, giving them a big head-start in careers as well as just a fun time for certain sims. Also, smart phones.
Pets adds in the furry creatures we all know and love. They're a burden in real life and they're a burden here too, but you love them for it.
Seasons adds in weathers and holidays and festivals and aliens, (for some reason,) adding great variety to each day and year in a sim's life.

All of this allows the game to run very smoothly with the fewest bugs and issues. So long as you save often, you could find yourself playing in a single town for potentially years. As nice as the rest of the games in the series are, this one still shines the brightest to me.",1600157165,1600157165,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198848976102,98,3,30667,0,30400,1600259687

*I would also throw [b]Supernatural[/b] in there but only if you're into the whole paranormal aspect of it. I think its super fun.

**I know some others would also add in [b]University Life, World Adventures[/b] and [b]Island Paradise[/b] to this list. I'd say you could check them out after you try these first, just in case your game runs slow or you decide against it; after all it is a big purchase. As for the other DLC's, I personally wouldn't get them, ever.

Cons - Price, this game is too bloody expensive for such an old title that never gets an update, last update was 12th November 2015. and yet the expansions and Stuff Packs are about $30 au each with 21 packs in total including the Base Game, makes this probably the most expensive decade old game in the history of games. they should have these listed at half the retail price they are now at least. I honestly cannot think a single player game out there of the same age that costs anywhere near the same price as.

BUT

Pro's  - Gameplay, honestly as a game this is still well worth playing, this steam sourced version works better on my old PC than the Origin Client setup. I have a dated 1st Gen i5 a 2nd Gen i5 and a i3 laptop and the game runs fine on all three with 8GB/16GB and 4GB ram, all of these are DD3, and running Windows 10 on Graphics below the Nvidia 7 series GPU's. 
I strongly recommend using this game on a system with a good Hard Disk that is no more than half full, I find performance issues appear once the Hard Drive it is on starts to struggle with all the data its handling and storing, I use an old spare HDD in my PC just for the Sims 3 and 4, and this works perfect for me, with all my expansions and CC Mods installed.

Open World
Extremely Customizable
Mods
The Music

Cons:
As the game is open world, I find the game freezing or heavily dropping frames the longer I play. And I'm not on a wimpy machine.
A lot of the fun stuff is locked behind Expansions/DLC. You can get these kinda cheap...but yeah.
Electronic Arts

Pros:
- Great graphics
- Open world
- Easily moddable (although not as easily moddable as sims 2)
- Enjoyable even with CC or mods (Unlike its successor)
- Fun
- Colour wheel
- Story progression (even for inactive households)
- WAY better than sims 4
- Cheaper than Sims 4 (especially when you consider the fact that Sims 3, even in its base game is a complete game, while sims 4 after €700+ is still not a complete game)
- Traits (which adds more personability to your characters)
- Booby slider

Cons:
- Can get laggy (especially in Isla Paradiso, which unfortunately also happens to be the most aesthetically pleasing out of all the worlds)
- When you sum up the cost, it's quite a hefty price (so I'd probably recommend you buying it while on sale, or perhaps skipping on buying possibly unnecessary DLCs)
- Characters can look both pretty and odd at the same time (if that makes sense)
- I personally, don't feel like I can attach myself to sims 3 sims as much as I attached myself to sims in sims 2.

16,74272979,english,"I wish there was a middle option between 'Recommended' and 'Not Recommended' because that's where I would put TS3. I've played The Sims series since the original game as a kid. I've done around 1000 hours of TS3, and it's a great game for sure. I haven't played TS4 and I don't want to, because I know it has all of the same issues that frustrate me about every instalment of The Sims.

Firstly, it is not worth the price. I bought the game and all DLCs when they were discounted at 65% off. At full price I believe it would have been over AU$450. It's currently AU$600 at full price, so the price has gone up by 33% since I bought it all those years ago, and the game is over 10 years old. There are far better games out there for that much money.

The other problem I have with The Sims in general is game performance (i.e., lagging and bugs). Lagging in long-term games has been an issue since TS2 and it's worse in TS3 (and just as bad in TS4 from what I hear). Every one of my playthroughs has become unplayable after a certain point due to lag. It doesn't matter if your machine smashes the (ten-year-old) spec requirements. There are fixes you can make, mods you can install to ""manage"" it, but like a terminal illness it will eventually get to a point that is unbearable. And why should you have to do routine maintenance on your games or install mods to keep them working properly anyway? (Sidenote of gratitude, though: If it weren't for the legends at NRaas, my playthroughs would have been much shorter.)

Overall, it's a great game and I don't know of any other life-simulation game like it (more than happy to hear about any). But it has only gotten LESS great as time has gone on when you consider all the other games out there with fewer performance issues and available for a fraction of the price.

59,43901404,english,"The Sims 3 is a pretty alright sandbox game to screw around in. If you were to ask my preteen self, I would have told you it was complete trash before playing it for another fifteen hours or so -- so, basically, it was one of my favorite games at the time. With the power of hindsight, I can accurately judge its best and worst merits.

[b]The Good:[/b]
+ A first (and, unfortunately, only at this time) for the series, each map in The Sims 3 is a small Open World, which complements the Sandbox nature of the series while adding new twists on its own. The majority of my time with The Sims 3 as a preteen was spent with the Showtime expansion which, while not very good, has a decent enough map that makes good use of the new mechanics that were added to the game. Because of that, I can't really say what my favorite maps are, but there are a few good ones in there
+ The amount of possibilities provided by the sandbox nature of The Sims cannot be ignored and it's no different in 3. Become the president of the world, have over 100 babies, or die in a Macaroni and Cheese induced house fire. The choice is yours, and it never disappoints.
+ The ability to customize each article of clothing, furniture, and otherwise purchasable items -- also a first and only for the series -- gives more options for customization in an already customizable experience.
+ Ten years later, The Sims 3 mostly holds up on a graphical level. Obviously, some things are dated by today's standards (texturework, every time a Sim is in bed), but a lot of it still looks really pleasant.
+ Mods are supported right out of the box. While mod support isn't as great as it is in 4 (oddly enough, one of the only saving graces for that game), there are still a ton of mods that add a lot to the experience. Add in a gun, allow your Sims to have casual sex with complete strangers consequence free, or do what my 13 year old self did and--

[i]Note to self: when accessible memory wipes become a thing, have more than one.[/i]

[b]The Bad:[/b]
- There isn't a whole lot of content in the base game. There's not enough to say this is a major issue, but you'd be a fool to not snag an additional expansion pack with your purchase.
- While each map being an Open World is cool, the sacrifices needed to make it a possibility are disappointingly understandable. Things like work and school are just buildings that your Sim disappears into and cannot be explored by the player. This leaves a lot up to the imagination -- great for a 13 year old, but boring to anyone older.
- Performance can be more on the iffy side at times. Especially if you have a lot of mods installed, expect some hefty lag every now and then.

[b]The 'So Bad TikTok's Algorithms Would Hide It And Get In Trouble' Ugly:[/b]
[i]Sorry if that comes off as circlejerk-y[/i]
-- Some expansion packs are nice, but seven years after the very last expansion packs were released, I can say: they are not worth $379.81. Holy shit, if you want to talk about excessive monetization in Video Games, The Sims is the perfect series to center that discussion around. The best I can say about 3 is that there are no loot boxes as those weren't the hot topic for greedy publishers at the time, but there are still microtransactions via SimBucks (at least I think that's what they were called. I can't be bothered to actually look it up because I just don't care). These are a little excusable, in that they also gave players the opportunity to buy new maps with additional content that wouldn't have been big enough for a full blown expansion pack. But, even then, those maps aren't sold on the Steam page or anywhere else outside of the in-game currency. Once EA stops allowing people to spend on these things (more than ten years after the game came out and three years off of being ten years since the last expansion packs), the only way these bits of newer content will become accessible is through piracy. Thankfully, the system is so thanklessly thrown in that if one chooses to go down that path, all they need is an official file that interfaces with the game's launcher to install the content. I don't know if calling that lazy scratches the surface of how embarrassing that is. Disregarding that, the actual expansion packs are split into three camps across a spectrum: solid, solid But Unnecessary, Stuff Packs, and Whatever The Fuck That Katy Perry Thing Was. Solid packs (Late Night, Supernatural, University Life, Into the Future) alter the gameplay in either drastic or noticeable ways. They could have been included in the base game, but knowing that not every game can be super content rich at launch, are understandable exclusions. Solid But Unnecessary packs are ones that alter the gameplay in ways that would have been great to see in the base game and not a separate expansion pack. The two biggest examples I can think of for this are Pets and Seasons. Then you have Stuff Packs. Recall that one of the most hilarious and deadpan game reviews ever written comes from a piece on a Sims 2 Stuff Pack and, really, you shouldn't need much more to go off of. All they really add is cosmetic stuff, which wouldn't be so bad if they were downloadable only packs for five to ten bucks a pop and not currently $20 and released as retail products at launch. Then you have the Katy Perry incident. I do not wish to speak about this, other than that it's not available to buy on Steam and things should stay that way.

All in all, I would recommend picking up The Sims 3 on a sale. It's less refined than 4 is in some areas, but don't mistake that as me extolling one over the other. In terms of content, there's no contest between the two games. That said, if you would like to spend [b][u]700 FUCKING DOLLARS[/u][/b] on DLC alone, go ahead and try out 4.",1533259201,1596942992,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,76561198074181588,320,100,768,0,768.0,1591081026

If you're brand new to The Sims as a series, it's basically just playing house. You make a Sim, choose the house they live in, have them look for a job, go downtown and make friends, hang out with said friends, etc. What I personally find incredibly engaging about the series is the designer aspect of it. I love being able to design my Sims clothes, what they wear when going somewhere formal, casual, etc..

With a few choice DLC's that let you piecemeal what addons you want and some fixes to keep it running well its both feature rich and fun to play for hours and hours, The lack of loading screens and seamless transitions keeps you popping to different areas of town or home to plan things to do or just to check up on your household.Your Sims themselves will constantly keep a smile on your face as you see them go about their daily lives.

The DLC's are clearly overpriced but are worth picking up on a steam sale and know you're going to need to look up some fixes and a mod or two so the game doesn't break down on you over time.

I'd recommend to pick up University Life, Seasons, Pets, Generations to go with the base game.ALSO IMPORTANT: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1131162350 This guide to help you get the game working and keep it working.

Overall it's the must have of the series and plays better than it's newer counterpart (The Sims 4) which i'd say avoid unless you absolutely love this kind of gameplay.

There is allot of content to play around with, and the ~ $10/dlc was reasonable on release for the volume of content added.
Then EA fucked their own release of sims 4, upped the price by 3X on a 10 year old game, and to this day refuse to allow it to go on sale.

Two wrongs here seem to balance the chequebook, and therefore make a right in the eyes of EA execs.
I am not an executive, and see the price of the sims 3 + DLC (~$550 at time of writing) as outrageously and prohibitively expensive.
LET ME BE CLEAR: it has been - 11 YEARS since release - the whole package is worth maybe $50.

My recommendation is to buy the base game to support the developers at a reasonable price tag, but pirate the DLC.

I wouldn't recommend any expansion in particular, as each of them adds content in a pretty specific area, but each one is very thorough with the amount of additions in that area.  Like fantasy/horror?  Try Supernatural.   Enjoy Sci-Fi?  Look for Into the Future.   You want your Sim to rise to fame?  Late Night and Showtime have you covered.  However, there is one exception to my ""I wouldn't recommend any expansion in particular"" rule.  If you can buy one, I highly recommend Generations, as it basically adds loads of content for any playstyle, whether you want to make as many Generations as possible, or live as your one and only Sim forever.  Whether magical or technological, Generations can support any playstyle.

89,55688405,english,"Even in 2019 -- ten years after release -- and despite having the backing of Electronic Arts, the second largest game studio in the world, this game is an unplayable, buggy mess. 

My computer (Intel i7-8086K plus NVIDIA 1080Ti) is more than capable of handling GTA V with all of the settings maxed out. But somehow The Sims 3 from 2009 has brought my computer to its knees?

Let's quickly list all of the issues:[list]
[*]Whenever I launch the game, it also launches an Electronic Arts / The Sims 3 game launcher that runs hidden in the background, and the launcher continues to run even if I quit The Sims 3, and somehow the launcher uses ~20% of CPU even if The Sims 3 is no longer running, and the launcher prevents me from turning off my computer, and the only way to exit the launcher is to kill the process via Task Manager
[*]Game performance degrades over the course of a session; eventually the performance slows down so much that it doesn't matter whether I have the game set to 1x speed or 3x speed, because time will pass at 1x speed either way
[*]Weird in-game bugs show up; the most memorable was when my sim cooked waffles and set them down on the counter and somehow the game registered the waffles as a book about logic, and when I clicked on the waffles I only could see a grayed-out option to read the logic book, and eventually I had rotting waffles on the kitchen counter that I couldn't do anything about
[*]On maybe 10% of work days, my sim's carpool for work doesn't show up (but I still get in trouble for missing work)
[*]Sometimes, other sims invite my sim to their house, or to their party, but when I look around the neighborhood I don't see any house with the sim who invited me over living in it
[*]It takes about 60 seconds to save the game
[*]It takes anywhere from 60 seconds to ten minutes to load the game
[*]My most recent save will not load -- the game crashes every time I try -- so I guess my save file is corrupted and all of my progress is gone
[*]All of the aforementioned issues persist whether I run the game in compatibility mode (Windows XP SP3) or run it natively on Windows 10[/list]

So anyway.

Electronic Arts is asking you to pay four hundred dollars in total to buy The Sims 3 and all of the DLCs. And yet, since 2013, Electronic Arts has not invested one dollar in fixing bugs or patching The Sims 3 to ensure consistent performance on newer versions of Windows and on newer PC hardware. 

Please don't buy this game -- please don't reward Electronic Arts for selling a broken game for $400. Honestly, Steam should consider pulling The Sims 3 from their store if nobody is on deck to make sure that this game still runs on modern hardware. A brief glance at the Steam discussions page will reveal just how many people like me are unable to get the game to run acceptably. Numerous people on the discussions page insist that you need to install unofficial fan-made patches before the game will run well. Steam should not be selling a game where you need to install unofficial fan-made patches to un-break the otherwise broken game.",1571580763,1594600541,False,21,0,0.681925535202026367,3,True,False,False,76561198035088159,198,13,2439,0,2433,1590448206

I will never ever ever buy a sims game and then pay $40 an expansion for ~$10 worth of content.

Anyways.

I've been playing this since the year it came out (I was in 7th grade), and I feel like it has aged extremely well. Sure, there are obvious signs of its age, but the main thing that keeps me playing this over The Sims 4 is its open-world feel. You don't have to load every single time you shift from one lot to another.  The entire map operates regardless of whether you are looking at it or not, and it's cool to be able to shift over and stalk people who are working out in the gym, just because you can. 

ALSO, the ability to put custom textures on everything is amazing and I can't believe they removed it. Instead of being limited to literally three colors when you buy something (clothes, furniture, ect), you have literally unlimited creative freedom because you control the texture that is being applied to the surface. Want your couches to be made out of metal? Sure. Want a plastic suit? Why not.

This is much cheaper than The Sims 4 and still a very good game. I especially recommend this if you are planning on buying expansions, because you can get these at a much more reasonable price (when they are on sale) than The Sims 4 expansions.",1594578454,1594578454,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198033415470,307,12,1971,0,1540,1597884745

22,72352115,english,"As you can see, I put a lot of time in here, and let me give my 2 cents worth.

When I bought this game, I got it in a bundle that includes Base game, Generations, Pets, and Seasons. On sale it was about 12 dollars CDN I think? Regular prices were 20 dollars base game or a DLC, but on sale, they dropped it to 5 dollars each. Pretty reasonable deals, I bought a couple DLCs, Late Night and University Life, and have been considering others. 

But sometime in the last year, not sure when, someone decided it was a good idea to raise the prices 7 dollars each, and get rid of the bundle that was a REALLY good way to get someone into the game. I would NEVER have bought this game without that bundle's existence, and frankly I don't think it's worth paying out the kind of prices that they're demanding. I also haven't seen any sales since the price hike.

My thoughts are that maybe they made the prices so horrific here in order to make the also expensive Sims 4 more attractive and maybe get more sales there. Kind of a scummy thing to do if that's the case.

Thoughts on the Game:
The combo of generations, seasons, and pets really made the game a great experience out of the gate for me, and you don't even really need much more to have a lot of fun with the game. There's some pretty decent autonomy by the sims, and that's without mods. With mods you could probably improve your experience, although I never experimented much in that regard (even with that playtime). Also, the world is one big open sandbox which is great. The one major downside is the extremely long loading times, when you start up and load your save or start a new city. It's not too bad once you're actually playing, except if have University dlc and you go to university, in which case you'll have an even longer loading screen until you get there. You'll also have some glitched sims at times, but if you use the in game command menu there's a command to reset a particular sim and that fixes the problem most of the time. Doesn't fix wild horses stuck in your walls though.

Custom sims are great, there's a lot of freedom with what you could do with it, and some of the personality traits can help flesh out your characters. The first sims (besides my personal one) I created were Wario and Waluigi, first interaction with them Waluigi chose to bore me to death. I also would often give characters the Inappropriate trait because it's one of the best traits for stirring things up and one of the few ways that could lead sims to get romantically paired without it being off screen or you having to direct them to do it. Insane trait was always a blast as well. I liked to give my sims free will and observe them. Part of why the play time got so high, I'd leave it running in the background at times.

If I were to give them a priority though, for me personally, it would be Generations, then Seasons, then Pets. For some Seasons would maybe be more of a priority, but this wouldn't even matter if they still had the actual decent bundle that made the decision a moot point. For the 2 expansions I have, I liked Late Night a bit more than University Life, mainly because going to university take too dang long. You do get some new buildings and such that you can use to spice up your towns so even if you're not at the university, elements from that expansion can still apply to your town which is good.

Considering that that particular combo of Base Game-Generations-Seasons-Pets would now cost 108 dollars CDN is disgusting. This game's 10 + years old, I just went and got Portal 1 & 2 for 2 dollars to get myself to the 35 dollar mark for the summer sale. This game isn't even on sale at all this summer while Sims 4 is. The only thing to note is the Into the future expansion was 40 dollars before so it's gone down. But on sale, it'd go for 10 so that doesn't matter much.

Final Thoughts:
With what prices have become for this and considering they got rid of the best starting bundle and things may not go in sale, I can't recommend picking up this game at those prices. I may change my mind if I see they have sales, but that jump up in price is gross, and getting rid of the good bundle just kills it for anyone new looking to try the game out. If that starting bundle still existed and went for 20 dollars or less on sale, I'd recommend this game. But with these garbage bundles and even more garbage prices, I can't, even if I really enjoy this game.",1594284703,1594284703,False,0,1,0,0,True,False,False,76561198075854363,51,2,110962,0,110587,1595351330

51,72135098,english,"The hours Steam has listed here are inaccurate.  I've played Sims for hundreds of hours on other computers.  I learned about how to create mods by editing content in the Sims 2 and experimented with making script mods for TS3.  If EA hadn't hiked the price of stuff packs up like this, I might even have left a positive review.  But I can't do that with a good conscience.

For those of you wondering: Yes, you are being ripped off.  Just one Stuff pack (DLC that simply adds items/clothes to the game) now costs as much as the game itself (these were not always priced this high).  Stuff packs add things like furniture and outfits---some of them are genuinely unique, such as the Katy Perry pack adding items that are shaped like cupcakes and candy, or the Movie Stuff pack introducing superhero-themed content.  But other than that, Stuff packs generally do not add anything exciting.  Your gameplay will not change from these, your Sims will not react any differently to the Sweet Treats furniture than they do any other furniture in the game.
Now, it's understandable that the Expansion packs (DLC that *does* add new features, worlds, interactions, new sims, etc) cost $20---but it's absolutely ridiculous that Stuff packs are that expensive.
And don't look to the Sims 4 as a good alternative to this game.  Base game TS4 starts out with even less features than the base game TS3 and 2 had...and added only *some* of that content back in as expensive DLC.

I do believe developers should be paid fairly for their work so I understand why prices may be high.  However, I also believe consumers shouldn't be exploited for corporate greed.  More specifically, customers shouldn't be exploited for *EA's* corporate greed.  When EA begins respecting it's own developers across the board, when it stops buying smaller game companies just to gut them, and when it stops rushing out incomplete games with $60+ price tags....then we can allow a little wiggle room for greed.  But for now, today....EA only cares about your wallet.  Don't let this company con you into paying them hundreds of dollars for a full game.",1594004520,1594004520,False,2,0,0.526908397674560547,0,True,False,False,76561198058004985,191,3,533,0,533,1585477817

But even with the best computer, EA is killing TS3 day by day, one day no one will ever be able to play it. It's the second best TS game after TS2 imo, but it's buggy, has fps and texture issues, getting slower with every update and so on. My advise would be to play with at most 2 or 3 dlcs because after 3rd dlc, the game turns into a nightmare and no other dlc but Seasons and Generations are necessary. Try to keep your game as clean as possible and by that means try to download not too many cc. This game with the sensational open world feature should be as flowy as possible.

Some tips to consider when getting the game + mods:

-Downloading mods and custom content into the game is great and all but I recommend getting a software that combines some of the cc and mod files together so the game can run somewhat smoother.

-But don't put everything in one file because that will actually remove some content so when combining files categorise it so you don't lose files and so it just appears more organised.

 -Delete the cache files, they are created every time you open your game and they are there to make your game smoother. But getting mods will definitely make cache files a bother, because they have your previous settings saved so deleting them when installing mods will actually allow you to use the mod in the game.

Those tips are there just so when people get the game they don't get frustrated when it starts to slow down.",1538644700,1593871301,True,0,2,0,0,True,False,False,76561198447958587,57,4,8747,0,6706,1561290699

This game, however has a lot of great features from The Sims 2 and then some new features like the colour scheme designing tool is WAY better in this game than any of the other three! Very customizable things in this one. And I know we ALL appreciate that kind of freedom. The animations aren't very much different than TS2 and not the overly ""cartooniness"" of TS4. The graphics are definitely an improvement from TS2 and a lot of the same features return which makes it a very nice balance of a more modern Sims installment without the rediculousness or lack of difficulty in TS4. But there is an issue I've run into many times with this game's performance. trying to record this game for a video is a challenge. The game begins to get a little choppy and quality seems to drop a bit. Another performance issue with the game I've run into is when going to lots (my sim is a ghost hunter for work and travels to houses) the game seems to freeze for a good solid minute (and a half) when arriving to lots sometimes. Very strange issue that seems to persist but is on and off. Overall it's a solid game with a few bugs (as any Sims game has). Would recommend!

Oh boy, time for a long, juicy review! 

The sims 3... Where do we even begin?
I know! The engine. 

One of the main reasons the Sims 3 is better than the Sims 4 is because of the engine. While Sims 4 has a more optimized engine, it's a heavier game doing more than cancelling out the effects. And, it does a loading thing that is super long (about 30 seconds) when you just wanted to go to your neighbor's house... But the Sims 4 also didn't add Toddlers or cars until a late patch. 

But, the sims 3 is easier to use, has a nicer GUI (Instead of flat stuff that looks weird and confusing, the Sims 3 has a more appealing GUI), and doesn't have that loading thing.

The sims 4 is highly dependent on expansions and gameplay of the sims 4 is bland without expansions.

But the sims 3 is just fine without them.

We're only scratching the surface as to why the Sims 3 is better than it's sequel.

Probably the best EA game ever created.

Even if you've been playing the series a long time, you can skip them, which I love. The customization of your Sims is amazing, you can get incredibly detailed if you enjoy that like I do. You basically never run out of stuff to do in this game. If you somehow do, look up different challenges to do, building challenges, game-play challenges, and more. The community is awesome with all the custom content they've created. The expansion packs could add some more elements to it, however-

So yeah, awesome game, you can spend hundreds of hours on the game and never get bored. there's many ways to play and your choices are almost unlimited when it comes to world building, item coloring and your designing or advancing your Sim's story/life. you also get many DLC to choose from and unlike some games, you can pick and chose what you want! though some DLC can make the game feel almost too easy at times.

Best part is the music IMO, so many good tunes!


The only down sides I've noticed is are as follows

1: the lagg can be really bad at times and it seems to get progressively worse when you add more DLC or try to build huge mansions/buildings with large amounts of items on lots.

2: some of the features from the sims store can't be accessed anymore which kinda stinks since there's 2-3 additional worlds/towns you can build/play with.

3: EA no longer provides support for this game which is bad because some DLC have bugs that will either break your game or disable certain features. so check the reviews first for details before buying a DLC!

4: The price for an 11 year old game originally released in 2009 is a bit high. (current year of this review is 2020)  The main game price is worth $20, but I think the DLC should be $10 for expansions and $5 for stuff packs. luckily the game and DLC goes on sale quite often so if you don't want to pay full price, just add it to your wish list and wait til it goes on sale!

5: space. if you want to own everything, you will need some space on your hard drive for this game.

If you include all the DLC (which you should!) it is far too expensive to buy at full price. Thankfully Steam does sales quite often. 

The only thing that I am mildly peeved with, after all these years, is The Sims 3 Store in itself. Having to buy a special currency to use on a website for extra content is just. Not something I really agree with, especially when the base game + expansions are as expensive as they are. But it is a well known fact that EA is greedy, so it's not really surprising. Sadly.

Its not that laggy since i have a older pc, even tho its not origin i have gotten some mods.
If you want an explanation on how to do  mods on steam version, just comment.
Its great for making yt videos, roleplaying and much more!
I have it on xbox but got it on pc for the horse . Horse lover over here!
How ever it is missing alot. like maybe more stuff for the kids/toddlers? 
Its also missing polo raps for horses, More bridles, Actual halters.
But thats not steams fault obviously they didnt make the game.
So if its laggy for u dont blame it on steam from what ive seen its prob ur pc.
I'd say my pc is as old as when sims 3 was released making it easy to play, However i still get a bit of lag in

Later I bought a version for the Playstation 2 but it just wasn't the same and then I just kind of forgot about the game in general and moved on in real life.   But now in 2020, during this whole Covid-19 era, I was reading an article about how people who are tired of being shut-in their homes were turning to simulator games like ""The Sims"" to escape real life and have fun in a virtual world.  It made me nostalgic so I found a free trial of Sims 4. I played it, and it was fun, but something was just....different.  I just wasn't having the instant addictive fun that I had the first time I played the Sims.  I watched some YouTube videos and read some other reviews and apparently I wasn't the only one who felt that way.  Sims 4 is more like a reboot of the series, and left a bad impression on a lot of long time Sims fans.  A lot of people are unanimously saying that Sims 3 is the peak of the series so I dropped $20 on it and took a chance.  And I don't regret it.  Instantly fell in love with the game all over again, and was taken back to when I first played ""The Sims"" all those years ago.     If you're like me and you haven't played The Sims in several years, I highly recommend ""The Sims 3"".   I haven't had any technical glitches or computer issues with the game at all, and I didn't feel like I had to ""learn how"" to play the game.  Its just intuitive, I think.

The Sims 3 expands upon what I enjoyed about the previous games and takes it about 100 steps further.  There is just so much content, freedom and role-playing value on offer, especially when you add the expansions into the mix. 90% of my playtime has just been with one family, with ageing disabled, which is what I'd grown used to in Sims 2 Pets PSP. Honestly, everytime I come back to this game, I fall in love with it again. And during these times we're living in, a game like this is all the more important I think. 

Specific things I like about The Sims 3:
Open World System
Nice attention to detail
In-depth AI
Nice Soundtrack
Great Expansions
So Much Content
High Replayability Value

This is hands-down the most ambitious a life simulation game has ever been. And it shows, for better or for worse. You get dynamic, lively open worlds with a high degree of creative freedom in really every part of making a Sim, a home and a life. It's a very fun and rewarding experience throughout.....except for the performance issues. 

Good god, be wary of the performance issues. You'll need a few mods to minimize them. DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME WITHOUT THESE MODS, you will NOT have a good time. EA did nothing whatsoever to optimize this game after the initial release in 2009. It ran just fine at that point, but 20 content packs and countless separate mini-DLCs have come out since then and the engine simply cannot handle them very well. If you have a good PC you may get lucky and have a tolerable experience out of the box......maybe it'll even be smooth once you install those mods. BUT DON'T COUNT ON IT. Expect a brilliant, funny, satisfying, creative game undermined largely by poor performance.

Still, I couldn't recommend this more. It's a hell of a game. I've put 5000 hours into it over the last 9-10 years, and I'm not stopping anytime soon.",1549594456,1590335737,True,57,5,0.792924344539642334,9,True,True,False,76561198063896497,52,9,6,0,6,1549594444

The core components are basically the same with each sims version. Aging and other effects create a slightly different dynamic. Would I buy Sims 4? Only if it came in a bundle sale on steam and had smaller game save files. Do I have fun with it? Sure, but then I can have fun with a lot of simpler games. It's cheap to get if you grab the bundle on holidays and hours of play if you like Storytelling. Yes, its basically playing with a digital dollhouse or ""action figures."" Then again, most games are in the most basic sense the same concept of make believe and playing hero or bad guy.

Sims 3 does have a number of bugs that have never been addressed even now. Sims 4 is reportedly less game breaking. NRAAS has appeared to solve a lot of issues with Sims 3 as a community developed fix. As I understand it, it's a script that cleans up things in the game each day. re-routing stuck characters, removing extras, turning off televisions, etc. 
It's not a bad though it is a broken game if you play it long enough without the community fixes. With the fixes it trudges along and on sale days it's cheaper than sims 4.",1412751479,1589520227,True,4,0,0.504015564918518066,0,True,False,False,76561198034515681,155,28,40097,0,11547,1589997996

61,69142732,english,"I will be frank, growing up me and my friends always thought the sims was a childish game. There is zero 18+ stuff, and everything revolves around being nice to people. Meh i rather play grown up gritty stuff...

You can imagine how at 21 damn years old i had the biggest surprise of my life when i decided to eventually buy the base game and see what the fuss was all about. 

The sims 3 lets you create a character and guide it's life with a maximum degree of freedom (within an utopian society where F UP stuff doesn't happen) through his entire life, then proceed playing if you have raised children. The range of interactions with people around you is Mindblowing. Add to this the fact that this game has better home-building and decoration tools than any program every created for actual arquitects and it gets insane. 

The Sims is not about steppin into a story. Nor is it about a story where things change based on your decisions. It's about creating whatever story you want and choosing how it will unfold thru your actions. You can be anyone and do anything (aside from the BAD stuff). 

I was amazed and played it for a long time, despite having a prejudice with this game for 21 years of my life. I was missing out.

Now about DLCS: The base game is certainly fun, but to have the best experience possible you'll want to grab the major DLCS that you like. Some let you be a wizard or a vampire, Some let you have animals in your house, Some add all 4 major seasons to the game and their beautiful effects. It's up to you but i don't suggest picking them all up even if you have the money, the reason being the more DLC you have installed the more demanding the game will become. So do your research and only buy what you truly want. Also DLC is expensive. Like very expensive. Don't buy dlc if you can't spare the money, it's probably not worth more than having money for essential and outside leasure stuff. 

Pros: You can live an entire different life in a fully interactable Open World with extremely complex and different characters to meet. The game has infinite replayabilty because you can always start as a different person and make different decisions. Also you can create the house of your dreams with the best home designer tool ever created. And with DLC you can have ten times the replayability because of the new Open Worlds to explore and new stuff to do. 

Pros over the sequel (The Sims 4): It's open world and the world feels alive. It also has so much more content that the comparison isn't even funny. And the Art style is miles better than whatever the hell they decided to greenlight for the 4th game. Sims 3 is superior in every single way minus stability. 

Cons: It crashes. Not frequently, but it does. No matter your hardware. The game also gets laggy if you have too much dlc installed. With all dlcs my game is unplayable. But with 3 maxium i can run this well, untill it crashes. Always save every 10 minutes. The autosave is a joke. Also this game lacks any type of 18+ content, which can be boring for people that want more realism. Plus the price of DLC is insane. Much better games are beeing sold for way less than a SIMS 3 expansion.

Takeaway: The Sims 3 is the best simulation game out there. If you like simulations, get it. If you only like games with explosions and gunfights and crime and war and drugs and whatever mature thing you want then it's definetely not a game you'll find interesting. But you should give it a chance because i did an it blew my mind. 

Btw i'd like to make an observation: More games should build around the concept of the sims 3. Customizaiton in this game is TOP NOTCH and it's something that is lacking in 99% of the games out there. The SIMS is the living proof that customization sells.

Game is soo much fun BUT, I do NOT recommend you to buy most of the DLC's as they are way overpriced. Especially nowadays. I remember back then buying the Sims DLC's for around 3$ or so EACH. Now, they cost the same as the base game. And most of the DLC's only provide you furnitures and vehicles stuffs, there's already a community made mods you can addon into the game which is FREE and wayy more good looking. So the only DLC that I can recommend to buy for this game are the DLC's like, Seasons, Pets, Generations, Late Night, etc. As they cannot be modded and they could improve the gameplay alot more than the others. So I highly suggest to only get this game on sale so that you will be fully satisfied with what this game has to offer.",1530112602,1589436574,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,76561198334935132,234,17,2605,0,2025,1594646126

The Sims 4 is still a pretty decent game but I prefer the realism and more of the open world aspects and content that The Sims 3 has to offer.

15,68268425,english,"[i]Full Disclosure: Before purchasing The Sims 3 on Steam, I played around 500 hours of the disc version and 300 hours of the Xbox 360 versions (both The Sims 3 and The Sims 3 Pets, which were separate). Additionally, I bought the original The Sims on release in 2000 and have thousands of hours in both it and The Sims 2 and many expansion packs in the two decades since.[/i]

You know what The Sims is. Considering The Sims 4 has been out for a while, perhaps you're here because you wonder if The Sims 3 is still worth it. It is. My review focuses on grading the game for how it stands out in the franchise, not to players new to the franchise in general.

Back when The Sims 3 came out, I heard about all its new features and was put off. It seemed Maxis re-evented the franchise and added so much new stuff that I barely recognized it. It wasn't until my husband (a console gamer only) rented a copy of The Sims 3 for the Xbox 360 that I realized those changes were [i]good[/i] by watching him (a Sims newbie at the time) play the game. I promptly started playing it myself, and it became my favorite of the franchise. Despite the total overhaul, The Sims 3 manages to get most things right and add so many things that, while previously unnecessary, only sweeten the experience.

The aesthetic of The Sims 3 differs from the first two entries; while at first I found it too cartoony, it grew on me and now I prefer it. Colors are crisp, Sims give often over-dramatic yet entertaining expressions, and there are enough options in genetics to make individual Sims look different from one another through the generations. The wish/trait systems is a new addition to this entry that I was suspicious of at first but became the main draw; rather than simply having goals for your Sims mentally stored away as you control them, the game suggests wishes and goals for you to complete for rewards (physical rewards and ""upgrades"" for your Sim by making them less likely to get hungry, keep friendships for longer, etc.). These wishes are suggested to you for different reasons. For example, if your Sims visits a park, perhaps they wish to go fishing, pick up seeds, or eat hot dogs from a nearby grill. Sims may wish to kiss a friend if fate dictates they find one another attractive (shown as a moodlet), or if your choices steer them in that direction (flirting). Wishes aren't mandatory. You can pick and choose or ignore them completely. In either case, its guiding hand has gotten me to play in ways I never have before, by exploring different career paths or trying self-imposed challenges (The Asylum, Baby-maker, etc.).

The other [i]huuuge[/i] change in this entry are personal traits, which gives each Sim a unique personality that is a game changer for the franchise. If you make a Sim insane, it's likely they'll talk nonsense to others or argue with themselves. Making a Sim a kleptomaniac not only gives them the chance to randomly swipe stuff from locations they visit, but you get to keep the stuff as well, and they'll likely want to join the Criminal career branch. Depending on the traits each Sim has, their lives can become easier or harder, and they'll judge other Sims accordingly. Some traits cause Sims to clash or become easier to befriend, though it's possible to overcome it if they clash. Failure was always failure in The Sims and its sequel; in The Sims 3, making Sims with the worst traits possible isn't only a valid option, it can be downright hilarious.

The Sims 3 has its problems, of course, and most of them stem back to EA, whose grimy hands taint everything they touch. Even the game's store page reeks of pretentious triple-A BS, with them stamping ""TM"" within the name of the game everywhere. Despite its age, The Sims 3 has so many expansion packs at such outdated expensive prices it's ridiculous. The game also wants you to sign up with an online account through its launcher, but doing so only unlocks more annoyances. There's now a digital currency, and it's nauseating to see they offer real-currency-only items before in-game items in Buy Mode and while choosing outfits. This is the main reason I didn't support The Sims 3 upon release, and it's the main drawback to the game now. The Sims 3 is a wonderful game, and EA's unending greed only sullies its name and legacy. Additionally, The Sims 3 has more glitches, issues, and crashes than is acceptable for a game this old and this full of microtransaction BS. I've put about 150 hours into the Steam version over the last two weeks (it only tracks about a third of my playtime for some unknown reason), and I've had countless freezes, lags, crashes, and many odd bugs. The same happened to me in all versions of the game before it.

The Sims 3 is what happens when developers innovate with such ambition that they end up with an outstanding success. For me to say that means a lot considering EA's filth still floats in every crevasse and the game's buggier than a honey farm. I suggest buying while on sale to limit the cash you hand to EA, though no matter what price you're buying at you'll get your money's worth.",1588203292,1588203308,True,62,8,0.826711177825927734,0,True,False,False,76561198124275446,1632,57,3120,0,3120,1588200496

The mechanics in the Sims 3 are convenient when travelling your world and accessing each Sim in a given household whenever you want to switch the controls. The smooth game play along with the casual escape from reality is ironic, given that you have to pay bills. But it's fun to go out and buy food, meet random Sims, and go crazy with creativity.

Try this game before getting Sims 4. Sims 4 is faster, more modern, and is programmed better for builders and designers, but the Sims 4 DLC packs are so expensive, and have minimal content which you'll get tired of easily. Sims 4 has less traits, no color wheel and create a style, less worlds, less interactions, and life states. You get all of this in the Sims 3.

This happened to me on my recent playthrough: 5 hours in, nothing I could do could make my Sim happy; he was in such a bad mood all the time that he refused to clean anything as soon as he came near it, even without negative moodlets; this was caused by a bug that has to do with a temporary positive moodlet accidentally applying a permanent negative moodlet of the same value).

Aside from that, it's standard Sims gameplay with some neat things to do and see, and it's still a great time today if you just want to spend a lot of time relaxing improving your Sims' skills.

The Sims 3 was one of my favorite games since the release in 2009, I was stoked, I was always into The Sims as a kid, still am. Owning The Sims 1, The Sims 2, and now The Sims 3, I can say the improvement is very noticeable. I'm here to type this review since I had this game for quite some time, I've been addicted to the game recently so I figured to do this now while I'm inspired to do so.

[h1]What is The Sims?[/h1]
If you aren't familiar with The Sims, this is a kind of game with a Life Simulation, sure, playing with virtual dolls in a way, but somehow it's very addicting and quite relaxing. The Sims has a unique playstyle for each individual person. Some like to be architectural and build houses to pass the time. Some want to have their own challenges in creating a family and see how far the generations will go. Some people just want to drown their Sim for enjoyment just for the hell of it. These are just examples of what you can do.

[u]The Concept[/u]
Every Sims game has a ""Needs"" bar, to bathing, Eating, Entertainment, Social, these are examples. You would simply replenish these bars by cooking, watching tv, etc.

Your Sims are basically humans, they live under a house. You can build your own home and can really unleash your architectural talent, or just practice in general with your imagination. Otherwise, you can simply move your Sim into a pre-made house if you wish to. Living in these homes you can add furniture to whatever you desire to fit the lifestyle of your Sim.

Your Sims have a personality you can give them, do you want them to be romantic? You can do that. Do you want them to live miserable and happy? You can also do that. In The Sims 3, you are given more to give to your Sims compared to the other games, however, the concept stays the same.

You can also edit and dress your Sims to fit their personality as well. Do you want to give them a Tatoo? You can do that. Give them a Cowboy hat? Of course, you can also do that. [i]I'm sure you get the idea...right?[/i]

[h1]EA Game, must be DLC Hell.[/h1]

It is, unfortunately. The Sims is known for their expansions, however, most are indeed worth it. The Sims 3 is fair of $20 in my opinion, however not for most expansions by how old this game is. The Sims 3 does go on sale often to $5 including each of the DLC's often, so I would snag them when they reduce to that price.

In my opinion, I would recommend these Expansions to start out with:

- The Sims University = Enroll your Sims into a University for better jobs.
- The Sims Pets = You can add Cats, Dogs, Horses into your family.
- The Sims Seasons = Add Weather and Holidays in your gameplay.
- The Sims Late Night = Able to use Apartments and enjoy the Night Life
- The Sims Generations = More things to do, extending the Family Tree.
- The Sims Supernatural = Able to have Vampires, Werewolfs, Witches, etc.

The rest of the Expansions are optional, I can recommend them, these are just some I think would work best for most people, however, having all these Expansions will add more to your gameplay. Again, these do go on sale for $5, they are an absolute deal if you get them at that price.

[h1]The Sims 3 or The Sims 4?[/h1]

This section is very opinionated, The Sims 4 is an improvement for sure as your Sims can actually multitask on what they do, especially during socializing. The Sims 3 lacks that of course, it's older. Graphically I like The Sims 3 more than The Sims 4 because the 'Cartoon Graphics' 4 has personally displeased me. The Sims 4 Expansions weren't as fulfilling as The Sims 3 had for new content. The Sims 3 has an Open World where The Sims 4 does not, which does include performance issues that The Sims 3 has for weaker end systems, even stronger ones, I suffer with it sometimes.

Overall, each one has its advantages and disadvantages and just varies on taste. The Sims 4 is only available on Origin, however, at some point, we may see it on Steam since EA has been more open with Steam recently with newer titles.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]

I hope I provided enough, for people just looking into The Sims or Veterans, I can recommend this, full price at least for the game, though, again, the game does go on sale for $5, same as its expansions.

Modding support is still alive, in fact, I'm using some right now such as Worlds and Clothing for certain Sims. These can be easily accessed from a few websites.

So in conclusion, yes get this game.

Of course, if you want to buy a game that works as advertised without needing lots of unofficial support, this is not the game for you. The good news is, the community can fix many of the problems with the game. Bad news is that 10 years later, EA couldn't be bothered fixing their mistakes, though they didn't hesitate to raise the price without fixing the game itself. I want to give it thumbs down, because EA deserves that, but the base Sims 3 game deserves thumbs up.

Place a toilet in the living room and watch family members refuse to speak to one another for weeks from the embarrasment and oppression of it all (they'd do that in real life, anyway). Don't you want to watch your sim named Rings and Pins the Conqueror try in vain to take out the trash, when the can has been deleted? These poor sims are your personal zoo animals, and their awkwardly constructed house is the zoo. Sometimes the best things in life cost under fifty dollars.

Played 44.8 hours.  Had an okay time.
The launcher stays active in the tray when the game's off, so shutting down my computer required an extra confirmation step every time I was done.
Now the game won't launch at all.
I'm sure there's an easy fix, whereby I do half an hour's research, open up/save/restore files, or maybe uninstall and reinstall the whole thing, and then we're back to square one.
I'm certain I have better things to do.  This game is a lemon.

Later: Okay, not sure why the game stopped launching, but here's a little more to it.  Once you've started the game, the launcher just keeps on trying to pop up ads for DLCs, additional material you might obtain for a modest fee, and generally keeps looking for content that is no longer available to it.  This can actually slice off a chunk of your available computing power while you're playing the game.  So, all you have to do is pause your game, open your save options, re-open your launcher, and then close the launcher.  Then you can play this damned game.  Alternatively, you can save the launcher files to another folder, possibly titled ""Annoying Obsolete Backup Crap"", and launch the game old school from Sims3.exe in your file search thingy.  See?

34,64003343,english,"I would say this game is pretty good. I love the open-world gameplay style to it, it's nice to have your sims be free to go where ever they want without having to wait on loading screens. Speaking of loading screens, they are quite long. It takes about 2 minutes per loading screen for the game to load up for me- thankfully, they don't happen often and only do when I start up the game and load up a save. I really enjoyed the free customization. It made home designing unlimited, as I could change the materials and colors of any wall paintings and furniture. I made myself a cyberpunk neon home thanks to iy. The same applies to character creation, it's great to NOT be stuck to the pre-made clothing designs.

I own the Pets expansion pack, I recommend it unless you're the type of player who doesn't like it when your characters are distracted from reaching their goals. (Pets require lots of attention and care, and may slow down whatever goals you're trying to make your sim reach) I love the extra building and clothing items added to the expansion pack as well.

My only issues with this game is the numerous bugs, glitches and freezes. I have a Windows 10 computer, my settings are set low as possible, no mods or creator content yet the game continues to lag. Not to mention that the interactions between sims seems less energetic than those in the Sims 2. I feel like my Sims aren't really into each other when they interact and it bores me at times.

Overall, good game. I would rate it a good 4/5.",1582477429,1582477429,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198426159838,5,1,54192,0,37934,1598969131

Luckily, there are many passionate people out there for this blessed and cursed game. Mods that will help run your game smoother, and custom content creators to make your characters look refined and attractive.

As told by how many hours I've played this game, I absolutely love it. It was a rough start because of all the problems at hand. But I dived deep into CC and mods which made game play all the more fun. The base game is very boring, but you have mods to thank to make things more interesting.

DLC has my list of complaints (and I have almost all of the ones that add actual content instead of clothes and items) - I don't like the fact that you have to get DLC just so you can have pets in the game. And even then, Pets is usually the culprit that slows down your game because of the excessive amount of animals that run around your town.

Another one is Worlds DLC. Having the option to go to different places is great because it adds more flavor to the vanilla, BUT, once again, these places also have sims running around with pets spawning in there too! 

However, if you can look past all the neglect, bugs, and lag, you can find a very blessed and heavily cursed game.

One of the most addictive games I’ve ever played. You can spend some time without playing it, but once you open it again, I’ll be the only thing you’ll play for days.
Although it’s very superior to The Sims 4 in many aspects (open world, vehicles, graphics, style editor, etc.) it sadly has some serious performance issues, along with game-breaking bugs, crashes and eternal loading screens (all of these get worse with the more DLCs you have installed)

[b]The good: [/b]

✔Incredibly addictive and fun.
✔ Huge variety of objects, jobs, places to visit, etc. (more with each DLC)
✔ Excellent build mode.
✔ DLCs, though their price is excessive, some of them are really good and add tens of hours to the game.
✔ Soundtrack, graphics, everything good for its time.
✔ Style editor (textures), which for some reason this tool is not available on The Sims 4.

[b]The bad: [/b]

✖ Serious bugs and crashes without reason.
✖ Very long loading screens (even more with DLC and store items)
✖ Poor performance with FPS drops. It doesn’t use more than 2GB of RAM.
✖ Very high DLC prices. They are worth the same as the game.

[b]Notes: [/b]

• In my opinion, the following DLC’s are essential: Seasons, Pets and possibly Ambitions, the rest are not important.

• The “Stuff Packs” are basically all useless, I don’t recommend any of them if you don’t yet have all the expansions (except for Into The Future, Showtime and Supernatural, those are bad)

• Before I could buy it on Steam, I played this game for more than 500 hours (approximately)

• Buy The Sims 4 for better performance and a much more playable game, or buy The Sims 3 for more gameplay options and a better game in general, but be prepared for serious bugs, fps drops and all kinds of problems.

[b] Though it has some serious issues, The Sims 3 is still the best one in the series, and for me the best game of the year 2009.

4,61539954,english," Simply not a very good game, Normally, the game is overpriced and the DLC is also very overpriced. When browsing for a new game, I Saw that the sims 3 was on sale and all the DLC was too. So I got a couple of DLCs that looked good, and the base game. My PC is 100% good enough to run the game. I wait for the game to download, and as you can see I played 1.3 hours before closing the game. I didn't play the game again, and also requested a refund.

The game ran very poorly, despite having a computer more than good enough to run it. I experienced frame drops and a couple of crashes in my hour of play. As well as this, it was very confusing to play. There is a launcher which I fail to see the relevance of, which prompted me to log into my EA account. After putting in my login details, I tried 3+ times to log in without any success- they didn't even recognise that my account existed (I made sure everything was correct!)

They also gave me some product keys- one for the base game and one for each of the DLCs that I bought along with it. Again, these were useless to me and I could play the game without them.

Overall: Confusing to run. Doesn't work very well. Simply not fun to play- I would strongly advise purchasing any EA games (specifically the sims) on Origin, even if Steam is your preferred platform, If you still want to buy this game or any DLC for it on steam, I strongly suggest you wait for a sale. It's not even the newest installment of the game, yet it's still quite expensive. (Overpriced, for sure.).

Knowing Maxis games, having purchased some before, I knew that it would either be worthwhile or a heroically ambitious fail.

It loads slowly, and you have to pay for premium features. Also, the texturing sometimes is a bit painful on the eyes and sometimes a bit glitchy. However, it is not to be said I don't like this game. It runs smoothly, and there is a great opportunity to not be 'guided along' on a story line. The world is your canvas, with something for the clean honest guy who works hard for their goal or the dirty hacker who cheats all their cash. Also, with a couple of expansion packs (which I got when they were on sale, trust me, it makes things much better) it makes things much more enjoyable, but get them when they're on sale, it'll save you a lot of money.

[b] My Personal Favorite Aspects [/b]
 * [strike] torture [/strike] creative storytelling
 * design (both houses and sims)

[b] DLC [/b]
 1. Seasons
  a. festivals, aliens, and weather
 2. Pets
  a. Not only cats and dogs, but horse and smaller pets
  b. hey, at least you don't need to buy DLC for your DLC like Sims 4 Pets and My First Pet
 3. Generations
  a. This probably isn't worth it if you don't play with sims aged toddler through teen.
 4. University Life
  a.  the actual gameplay isn't wonderful, but I enjoy the items and clothing provided
 5. Supernatural
  a. Vampires, Witches, Zombies, Fairies, and Ghosts. All of them are pretty well-rounded, expect for the Zombies who just 
   ruin your gardens and make weird noises. Just as zombies normal do.
 6. Showtime
  a. the performance aspect of the pack is ideal. The irl social aspect of the game is useless unless you have friends who 
   play this game still and are on at the same times as you
 7. Late Night
  a. adds vampires (unless you have Supernatural, in which is adds more vampire features) and many nightclubs. If you 
   enjoy clubbing and the nightlife, get this pack
 8. Ambitions
  a. makes some professions interactive
  b. introduces ""work-at-home"" professions with ""create-your-own-hours""
 9. World Adventures
 a. adds a slight puzzle element to the game. This can be avoided if you don't want to, but a good portion of the vacations 
  become null
 10. Into the Future
  a. I'm disappointed in the way this one turned out. I was personally so excited for this geeky pack, but it was a let down 
   due to its lack of substance.

[b] Special Note [/b]
A lot of comments have noted issues with Showtime and Island Paradise. I, personally, have not experienced any issues involving Showtime. Island Paradise does possess an issue involving the Scott Family. All you need to do is just delete them and then the game will work smoothly. I have also seen comments saying that entering the cheat (DiscoverAllUnchartedIslands) in the console command (CTRL + SHIFT + C) helps as well, though that could ruin a part of the exploration and discovery aspect of the game.

Create the lives you've always wanted!

Ready to live a freer, more creative life? In The Sims™ 3, you can let your fantasies run wild as you design your ideal world. Start with your Sim, refining each shape, color and personality trait until you get the precise person that pleases you. Design your dream home, but don’t let a grid limit you; place, rotate and stack furniture and walls freely and to your heart’s content.

Once the “hard work” is over, it’s time to be a mentor. Guide your Sim’s path through life, developing a career, finding love, and pursuing dreams and desires. Spending time with friends and family is just as important as mastering painting or accumulating knowledge.

Take things to the next level and record movies of your Sim’s adventures and share them with the ever-growing and thriving community. With a huge catalog of expansion packs and fun objects to discover, there is no end to the possibilities awaiting you.

At most I had at least 2 hours on it.
When I got the DLC I played it a lot more! I started out with Pets, Generations, and one other that I can't remember. They were a little to expensive for me, since they had a lot glitches and bugs, that became pretty funny to look at. With the pets DLC, I loved to create a small clan, mainly with very few cats, or dogs.

The way EA Origin handles expansions is terrible.

Update #2 12/21/2019: This game is optimized very poorly. Game saves often become corrupted and won't load. Origin is still needed and using that to ""repair"" and ""verify"" the installation does nothing. This game is broken if game saves don't work.

This game would not be worth it for someone that just wants to sit down and play.

Compared to my 200+ other games, this one might just get the reward for worst menu's. It takes forever to find the options you want, or to get to / back to the main menu. Same goes with switching from and to the neighborhood. All the hints in the top right telling you how to play get annoying real fast and why do we even have custom content? If we want that, we'll install mods. Basically, simpler was better when it comes to the Sims. (also, I miss my electric guitar. Didn't care much for the acoustic one. Adding it was fine, but why remove the original guitar?).

Other then that, the Sims is a classic that everyone should have played. I would just recommend getting an earlier version (will be tricky to get your hands on though).",1576841043,1576841043,False,4,0,0.534890592098236084,0,True,False,False,76561198065057794,269,21,631,0,631,1576709012

Pros: World feels large. Can edit the appearance of almost anything. Animations are fun. Editing the town is simple. More nuances to people's relationships to each other. Can do fun things with houses like multiple basements, balconies, archways, half-walls, etc. Personality traits are fun to play with.
Cons: Steam version seems to have trouble clicking objects into place when in build/buy mode. Hairstyles are limited. Create-a-Sim heavily leans toward Caucasian features and hair. If you want to read into it, there are some real shallow ideas about materialism and money here- all sims are programmed to want more stuff and more money and they're fulfilled when they get it. Everyone's kind of a caricature of a human being. Up to you if that's benign or not.
University expansion is, weirdly, belittling to its players. An object description, for example, reads: ""You're full of revolutionary ideas! You'll forget all about them when you learn about things like mortgage and car insurance! But for now, buy this flag!"" Several other moments like this.

It runs like hot garbage on Windows 10 but the game is very enjoyable and when compared to the lack of polish EA puts on the Sims series you might as well get sims 3 which is cheaper and more fun (imo) than Sims 4; it's also easier to get up and running on Windows 10 than Sims 2. The nostalgia factor help the score for sure in my case. It really is a nightmare when it comes to optimization though, like its genuinely awful to run.

UPDATE: Finally upgraded from a laptop with a i3 and integrated graphics to an actual desktop and my Radeon RX 580 GPU makes the loudest weeeeeeeeeeeeeerrrreeeeeerrrreeee noise and is whining everytime i load Sims 3, I went into the files and changed it to where Sims 3 knows my graphics card but the noise won't stop no matter the settings so I now would not recommend buying this game unless your GPU is from before 2014, if you do buy it make sure to get it when it's on sale for 5 dollars.

UPDATE 2: Finally got it working after downloading a Skyrim FPS limiter mod and just extracting it to the Sims 3 bin folder, I couldn't get AMD Radeon software to limit my FPS in Sims 3 so I'm happy this method worked.

24,59459296,english,"This is a fine game. However, after hitting nearly 50 hours I've seen most it has to offer. Some of the fun mechanics are DLC-exclusive (like opening a Laundromat because the laundy items are locked behind DLC, or opening a store to sell stuff because the mechanics of a functional store are locked behind a DLC). So, it's not possibly to experience this product to its full potential without spending hundreds of dollars at asking price.

Essentially this is a perfect product if all of the DLC were contained in one big bundle.

However, we have content segregation due to the capitalistic nature of AAA company business models that try to house so many employees at the consumers' expense, reflected in high prices of their products. 10 years down the line, the DLC for this product are not worth their asking price, yet the company doesn't seem to care.

If you want to spend $20 to get roughly 50 hours of entertainment, be my guest. I think it's worth it. Some people get more, but I've already seen all the game has to offer. I'll still play it, but the experience is already dying out for me. $20 per DLC is just not worth it when I can get another 50 hour experience from a different (possibly more entertaining) game at that price. I'd say each DLC is worth $2.00 USD if you want to be fair to consumers (and we'd probably buy them all at that price).

Anyway, that's my review. You allowed Capitalism to ruin what could have been an experience to stand the test of time, essentially segregating over 80% of the world's population from being able to afford your product. So, each of you from EA I hope you're enjoying your salary, because a lot of people can't enjoy your content because of it. Even if you have no control over prices, you still benefit at our expense. Go indie like Kojima.

3. There's few glitches did make me bewildered, but on the other hand that's funny though.
4. Can't lock FPS in the game.
5. Too many DLC and pricey.

What i like in this game:
1. There's few interesting things i found in this game, Be friend with a ghost for instance.
2. Season and sims lifespan are controllable, Your sims can live much longer.
3. Lifetime Happiness have great impact to my sims and around it.
4. etc.

26,25500285,english,"I can't say whether I recommend the sims 3 or don't recommend it. This is one of those games where you can't make up your mind. I'll admit it, I've been a big fan of the series, having the complete collection of the first one and its online remake ""FreeSo"", the sims 2 Ultimate Collection and the Sims 4. Out of all of them, the fourth instalment is the worst one and the second instalment is the best one. The sims 2 is one of those amazing sequels like Team fortress 2, halo 2 or timesplitters 2, a game which expands everything and makes change that kept bringing you back to it.

With the third game, I don't know how to put it, I have good things and bad things to say about it. The good things about this game is that the AI is far smarter than the previous games. The AI in this game isn't stupid and needs don't decay ridiculously quickly. I also like how time now progresses as I play along, it feels like a real interactive story is going on when you play this game, people age and make friends and enemies, an aspect which I adore about this game. Playing the second one you have to play in rotation whether you like it or not which was one of my main issues with the second game but maybe that is what encouraged more interactions with each family you have in your neighbourhood, building more on the story you want to tell. Now that time is always moving, you can sit back and enjoy what happens in your world. Build and buy mode was also vastly improved with the third game, everything clicks into place properly and you're no longer limited to a small grid. The gameplay of the sims 3 is brilliant, its much better than the second, first and fourth games

Now comes the issues with the sims 3. First and foremost this is a game that you have to mod to enjoy whether you like it or not. The story progression, while it is good, is shambolic at times and you have to install Nraas mods to fix up the performance issues as well as the story progression. For instance, default story progression will have your sims buy a horse even if they didn't have a stable for them (if you have the pets expansion that is) so what sense does this make? ontop of that, you need mods, especially clothing and slider mods to make your sims have character. The character creator in this game isn't good but to make it better you have to download slider mods. And when all these issues are fixed, the game shines very well.

But this doesn't stop technical problems from occurring. First off you have the launcher. Any game with a launcher always brings bad luck from my experience and I hate them, why do I have to launch the game twice and overload my disk?  Uplay games have this same problem and games after the 3d universe of GTA have suffered from the same issue to the point that GTA IV was broken at one point and GTA IV EFLC is still to this day, BROKEN because developers aren't doing anything to solve the problem. The sims 3's launcher is clunky with a poor UI designed for it. I especially dislike how some mods are put as ""downloads"" which can only be added to the game through installing them with the launcher whereas others can easily be put in the mods folder with no issue. Launchers are some serious issue not with just this game but with any game on steam. Another technical problem everyone faces is CAS lag spikes whenever loading everything and this is by far the most annoying, other issues include random lag stuttering for no issue whatsoever.

One final issue I have with the sims 3, is that creating your own world is not user-friendly at all. One of the key reasons I play this series is because I make my own characters and worlds. The second game was really good at this, lots were easy to place and world were also easy to create with the ease of simcity 4 (another brilliant maxis title). With the sims 3, I don't think CAW is supported with windows 10 because it is completely broken and refuses to install on my pc. Luckily, many CC makers have made really good worlds, especially for people with a low amount of expansions. But even then, putting in rabbit holes is an annoying job, why couldn't they just include them in the lots tab? 

Look, I don't hate this game, I like the gameplay, it is a good game. But the stuff you have to do just to make it right is real time consuming. Expansions need to be bought (Seasons is by far the best one), mods need to be installed (Which make the game 10x better) and technical issues need to be fixed. I love the gameplay of it but it depends on what you're up for when it comes to this game. As for the future of the sims series, most people said the game died at 3 which I can agree with. The fourth instalment is a total joke and a cash cow encouraged by annoying YouTubers who love giving EA the spotlight. Hopefully, Paralives can learn from the second and third games and shape up to be the best life simulation game possible

28,43256025,english,"If you've ever dreamed about creating your own virtual avatars and living out the lives you desired or want to explore without reaping the consequences in real life, then this is definitley the game for you! Although this game has been out for almost a decade and EA has stopped supporting Sims 3 in favour of Sims 4 for a few years now, I still think it's better for anybody interested in simulation games to purchase this instead. For one this is available on Steam, EA Origin, and retail (DVD) so you don't have to worry about having to sign up for exclusive services just for a single game. Another benefit(s) are the different strengths of this game that have been omitted or weakened in the sequel Sims 4, such as having to see a loading screen each time you visit a different part of the town. Finally, this game has huge mod support much like l4d2 (even to this day) so you can fix issues and expand upon the content. 

Of course, this game is known for having poor optimization due to EA not properly supporting the game on newer systems both soft and hard so anyone with Windows 8 or newer and with graphics cards beyond 2013 will run into problems. The most obvious being low framerate and extremely choppy camera...unless you modify some files to force the game in recognizing your GPU (doesn't seem to work for integrated, sorry) and limiting the framerate through Nvidia Control Panel or AMD Radeon Settings as Vsync isn't an option through in-game settings. Speaking of which, if you don't restart the game upon changing the video settings your computer will crash and force reboot and any progress will be lost; each driver update seems to revert them back to default. Also, playing the game for more than a number of weeks in-game time for any save file causes lower framerate and less stability too (can be fixed with mods).

It may seem bad but if you go through a little optimizing yourself, the game should run fine and there won't be any problems anymore. Sims 3 overall expands upon and improves its predecessors SIms 2 and 1, and is considered by many fans to be the best game in the entire franchise. In addition to controlling virtual avatars known as Sims, you can renovate, upgrade, and customize homes; change the landscape and the residents of the town; explore a wide variety of places like the beach, art gallery, pool, fitness gym, etc. with only one loading screen; complete many oppurtunities, skills, hobbies, career paths, and life goals that intertwine with one another. There aren't really any predefined goals so likg Gmod you have to decide yourself what to do aside from a few objectives that are not mandatory. Be forewarned that your Sims can die and if they all pass away then the save file can no longer be played.

Customization in Sims 3 is not limited to homes, but also to the avatars and the town - features like breast size, voice pitch, tattoos, real estate, business development, eviction, etc are some of the many available. The simplicity of point-and-click along with a HUD that changes depending on the mechanics is a good approach at catering to gamers whether it be casual or veteran. For a ""childish"" game the music and sound effects are nicely done and don't seem to over the top or the quality of indie/retro games with the former playing under certain conditions like l4d2. Graphics wise, it isn't the best looking game even back in 2009 with many textures being poorly done or just photos compressed on to 2D surfaces, though the lighting and shadows give off a cartoony look. The polygon count and models make Sims 3 contribute to the game looking alright, not the best but not mediocre even after all these years. 

Going to your GPU's settings can let you improve the graphics further with Vsync, AA, and Filtering Mode (a must) while lowering the settings in-game that affect the rendering of trees, households, and objects improves the performance. Due to the lack of support for newer hard and software, avoid playing Sims 3 at 1080p and beyond unless you don't mind the text and HUD being super tiny. EA released about a dozen expansion packs but they're expensive so only buy a few of them during holiday Steam sales as most cater to people with specific preferences or give players extra stuff. I'd recommend getting Seasons, Generations, Late Night, and Pets, while others like World Adventures or Island Paradise are up to you to decide. If you were never interested in simulation games, then don't bother; however, if you buy this please optimize the game and only buy the game and DLC during sales as EA is a greedy company (less so than Valve)?",1530571731,1574878175,True,1,2,0.523809552192687988,1,True,False,False,76561198353978732,132,28,11629,3,5073,1602028444

The game worked like crap when it first came out, so I thought I didn't have the best hardware for it at the time, but it's still lagging like crazy today. Even with a beastly desktop machine on any setting.

Trying ANY so-called solution or ""fix"" over the years has been a great waste of time. From forcing the game to recognize newer video cards, verifying steam cache, clearing the games cache, resetting all sims, uninstalling custom content, reinstalling the game, lowering the graphics settings, playing offline, etc. etc. ... ad nauseam ...

It's just not worth it. Again, I like ""the sims,"" and I've even put many hours into this particular sims game, but at this point I can no longer recommend The Sims 3. I know nothing of Sims 4, but you might just wanna go for that one instead, or you could just go outside and make some real friends!

It's basically a digital dollhouse. Great for casual gameplay, plus it has features for playing with friends, & sharing stories over social media. Cons?

The one thing that I like about this than the other Sims games, is that you can go to other towns/cities/future. with the DLCs (true other Sims games have some of that, but I think that Sims 3 does it much better). However, there is still some of the DLCs that are not worth having, even for free; looking at you Katy Perry!

You will have a clearer visual while scuba diving. 

The singer career from showtime has a bug where sim goes invisible after reach a certain singer career level. To fix that you just have them change their career and then return to singer career and  they will be able to reach singer career lvl 10 with no problem.

First, this game is really addicting, seeing as how you can make your own people (or yourself) and see how they survive in a virtual world. However, this game is pretty boring if you only want to play it without any expansions. I like the different life states, so I constantly use them in my worlds, but this leads into my second point, and this one is a very bad one. These expansions, some are really good and bring many good and fun things and others are just glorified skin packs, are expensive as hell. Yes the old EA microtransactions curse. Each and every one of the expansions are $20, just as much as the game itself. Now ask yourself, am I going to need any of these, absolutely not, but why not have a dog or cat,or be able to become a mermaid by eating a bit of kelp. Take my word for it please, wait for a sale to buy any of these. Its a waste of money for all of these packs. Now for the final verdict.

16,55831769,english,"The best The Sims game in the franchise.

Graphics are better than The Sims 4 (cartoony graphics that has nothing to do with real-life) and The Sims 2 (faces are ugly), there are a lot of expansions and mods, it has a real open world with amazing custom towns, memorable soundtrack and a lot of features that didn't make to The Sims 4.

That was a list of advantages. Sadly, it's a game published by Electronic Arts so there are many problems with that.

First of all, if you want to enjoy this game to the fullest you need to buy expansions. In my opinion, they are too expensive considering the fact that most AAA games have their GOTY version with all DLC released that cost even less than The Sims 3 with all expansions after around 10 years (6 if expansions' release dates are counted) of being on the market!

In addition to that, there is ""The Sims 3 Store"", which works like real-life furniture/clothing/whatever-you-imagine store but virtual. You can buy stuff with your virtual currency bought for real money. The main problem with that is a way too high price for that stuff. For $10 you can add 1000 SimPoints to your account. and for that, you can buy, like, 10 furniture or 10 hair. There are also few worlds that can cost even $50! They even increased the price to be a little higher than the exact few thousand to make you buy more simpoints! For example, Aurora Skies cost 4307 SimPoints. you can't buy 4307 SimPoints so instead of paying $43 you have to pay $50 for remaining points that you might not need at all! Thankfully, they didn't ban mods so you can download even better stuff for free from the Internet. It's not that easy with expansions though because there aren't many mods that are equivalent to features from expansions.

Alright, so what if you are naive and rich enough to buy all/most of these Expansion Packs/DLCs/Stuff Packs/whatever-they-are-called-by-EA? You have a problem then because they couldn't even optimize this game! Yes, they are taking a few hundred (maybe even a few thousand because Sims 3 Store stuff is really expensive) dollars from you and it works like poop. They left this game broken and never cared about fixing it. Roads are broken and cause many performance and scripting bugs, scripts tend to save file corruption, it stutters as hell even on modern pc, memory leaks are common, multithreading is broken, sims get stuck without any reason, if you play longer newly generated sims have the exact same face, new GPUs aren't recognized, v-sync doesn't exist so it's possible to get a lot of FPS and stress your GPU and a lot more. EA doesn't have any plans to fix these issues. There is still a hope that they fix some problems eventually because the 64-bit version has been announced for the macOS. 64-bit port could mean that there should be less CPU and Memory utilization problems so we would be able to enjoy this game with all expansions at least without stuttering and FPS drops.

To sum up everything, The Sims 3 is a really fun game but thanks to greedy and lazy EA it never got treated as it should be. Instead of fixing the most expanded game in the franchise they just threw many main features away, added some new and released it as a new game, of course with more expansion packs that add similar features that sims 3 expansions did for you to buy once again. Owners of the previous game got f**ked twice and EA is happy with that.

For that reason, I don't recommend paying EA for this game. If you really want to play it legally though you can buy just a base game on sale because it's the only thing that works alright. You will miss many features but at least you won't overpay and your game will work ok.

The Sims 3 is a ""real life simulation game"" where you play as some loser and do the things that your social anxiety prevents you from doing in real life. You'll start out buying a house and then getting a job until you die. Along the way, you'll decorate your house with various items and furniture, and maybe find a special someone. There's also some ""wacky events"" to prevent the game from causing existential dread, especially if you have some of the DLCs. The game's fairly simple and is obviously meant for casual players. You don't have to interact with a lot of things and often your character will just ""do something"" with the meter building up, specifically when it comes to working jobs. The relationship mechanics are fairly standard, where you'll be repeating the same ""friendly actions"" over and over again until someone likes you enough to sleep with you. Just like in real life. There are ""life goals"" and each Sim is different in their varying traits. It is fun to watch your Sims grow from children to adults, and move out on their own. Speaking of which, the ""living world"" is actually fairly decent, where each Sim will do their own thing and also die. Just like you.

It should be apparent that the latest Sims release was criticized due to its lack of an open world, which is fair criticism since in this game you can go wherever in the town without any loading times. Therefore, if you want a Sims game I would recommend this one. Still, when it comes down to it there really isn't a ""ton"" to do even when you have all the DLC, especially because of that whole ""you're not going to interact with anything, the meter's just going to fill and you pretend your Sim is doing something"". The most enjoyment you're going to find in the game is building up your house and creating your own little dynasty, maybe making it so everyone in the town is related to you. The ""special events"" really just cause you to deviate from monotony in order to get some more cash or earn more points in order to get ""life time rewards"". This game is a ""real life"" situation, so maybe it's wrong to expect really much more than what it already is, and it does a fine job at what it is. It lets you ""simulate"" a life that you'd rather have, while also adding jokes and ""fantasy"" elements to keep it from becoming boring. Overall, if you want a life simulation game, just get this. 

[h1] Pros: [/h1]
[list]
[*]Towns feel completely lived-in with everyone going throughout their daily lives, making you never feel alone
[*]Relationship mechanics are sweet and lets you have the friends you never could have
[*]Creating your families and watching them grow has a certain satisfaction to it, along with building the homes of your dreams
[*]Huge variety of customization options and the graphics still stand up pretty okay to this day
[*]There are a significant variety of things to do, but most of it is just new settings to interact with people or get your meters up
[*]Fun fantasy and sci-fi elements to keep the game from feeling too bland
[/list]
[h1] Cons: [/h1]
[list]
[*]Relationships are super mechanical, if we could make friends by hugging them 30 times without consent then life would be very different
[*]Sometimes you're just going to get bored of doing the same things over and over again and watching your Sims age
[*]While the world is ""lived-in"", NPCs lives could be a bit more dynamic than they are
[*]Most of the environments and buildings are going to be identical throughout towns
[*]DLC is still overpriced and much of it doesn't add much
[*]Water DLC

Although The Sims 3 does not have a better and higher quality graphics like The Sims 4, but who would have thought that I actually enjoy my time in The Sims 3 to the point I get so absorbed that I played it for more than 200+ hours. It is surprisingly way better than what I originally expected from The Sims 3.

The Sims 3 is well-known as a life simulation game, but honestly, it is more surreal than what you are imagining and expecting. As a player, you'll get to choose how your Sims live their lives. You're tasked with making them happy, and seeing them through adulthood and into their senior years. Along the way, you may pursue any number of goals, participating in player-made challenges, or simply attempting to complete their lifetime wish.

Even though there is a lot of strategic depth to explore, yet it is also highly accessible. You don't have to be a 'gamer' to enjoy the Sims games, you just need a computer or laptop and to use a mouse. This game is definitely an ""everyone"" game - children, teenager, adults or even elderly could even play this. 

The Sims 3 also shows a lot of depth with its socializing system. Based on personality, charisma skill levels, and character traits, Sims will be able to perform a huge array of social interactions. Your Sim will develop relationships over time, and may have friends, enemies and even fall in love to eventually get married and WooHoo to make a baby. The interface for socializing is simple and intuitive, it is very easily to understand even for new players who have never play The Sims before.

Overall, The Sims 3 is truly a very entertaining life stimulation game. If you're a gamer and you like games with a lot of depth, and open-ended gameplay, you'll probably enjoy the Sims 3. Moreover, it is a game which anyone could play regardless of ages. If you have not play The Sims before, I highly recommend you to try play The Sims 3 and you will not regret it.

However, in between those times it really is a compellingly addictive game of architecture, interior design and God-like manipulation of little humans.

The Sims is still largely in a genre of its own. There is little else like it... Except the other Sims games, which are VERY much like it. Unfortunately the Sims 4 may never come to Steam, but it's so similar it doesn't really matter; the main thing it improves are the graphics and character customization. Sims 3 has larger more open worlds (fewer loading screens!), packs more content into the base game, and generally feels more immersive, interactive and alive to me.

The DLC adds a lot. Into the Future and World Adventures were my faves. Avoid Island Paradise; it's still too buggy to play.

9,55093168,english,"Sims 3, in my opinion, is way better than Sims 4. I have played a little bit of both, and while Sims 4 offers a bit more customization in how the Sims look, it's still nothing compared to the interactivity in this game. While yes, I bought 20/21 of the expansion packs, there is still much more content in them. If I didn't have them, I'd say I would still enjoy what the game had to offer. From house building, to mastery of skills, to advancement in careers, there's usually always something you can do or try out. 

Personally, the expansion packs add a ton more fun and engaging content. The main must-haves are Into the Future, Supernatural, Pets, Adventure, Island Paradise and Seasons. These packs provide lots of content and hidden secrets that make the game less “watch your sims go through life” and more “engage with my sims”. Especially the Adventure and Supernatural. 

Second to those would be University, Showtimes, Ambitions Generations, and Late Night. These are more for adding new skills and events/items to interact with, but I feel I didn’t use all the much. Especially university. I haven’t played any content through that expansion, and the main thing that you get from it is a degree that makes your sim go 3/10 levels in the chosen career. Maybe it’s more entertaining than I originally thought, but I have yet to try it. The stuff expansion packs are more for interior design. Some items are interactive, but most just provide boosts in mood because it’s comfy or high-end. I wouldn’t recommend buying them unless they’re on sale (that’s when I got them). 

But the main thing I enjoy getting (despite some dependence on owning expansion packs or paid items), is the Exchange on the Sims 3 website. Creators make custom content ranging from families to lots to even whole towns. It’s like visual mods, but can make the experience goofier or more realistic. And it’s all free to download.

This game isn’t for everyone. Even for me, I play it for about a week or two straight, and then put it down for months. It’s a good game to come back to or bring yourself back into gaming when school has kicked your ass. It’s as engaging as you make it be.

11,55070897,english,"Fun Fact: That product key that nags you each time you play? It can be used to redeem a copy via Origin so it's a BOGO deal here!

This game is a [b]classic[/b]. This game really helped me cope with severe boredom and loneliness back in the day. I'm sure some of you once had a point in your life where nobody wanted to visit or hang out for one reason or the other. I've become so engrossed in this game, used to have custom maps, and had some great saves I wish I'd backed up.

The Sims 3 is the best in the series. Some will argue that TS2 is superior, and that's fine. TS2 was fantastic as well (I missed out on this one and played it later) but This one introduces some great features not available in any of the other games. Create-a-Style (CAS) Where you can manipulate in-game textures and materials... in-game! You can customise everything to your heart's content, this includes selecting patterns and even fine-tuning colors! This works on Characters, objects and buildings! This game has near limitless potential for the ones who put in the effort! I've managed to get so much fun-time out of [i]just[/i] the Base-Game alone! Another exceptional feature this game has, that makes it's core is the ""Open world"" environment. The gameplay takes place all on a large inter-connected map. Lots are separate ""plots"" which back then, not rendering them made the performance bearable. You can explore the entirety of the map all to your heart's content! Also there are Expansions that append to the experience. 

Also the soundtrack has really grown on me. While I'm a bigger fan of TS1's mix of Jazzy, classical and Piano-tune music, The soundtrack here isn't bad at all! I didn't care much for it at first, but I eventually really began to like it. It's hard to believe it's been 10 years this came out! It's a shame that EA didn't give the core engine the love it needed; namely optimization. The Successor (if you can call it that) actually REGRESSES in many ways.

This game would benefit so well from modern CPUs with all these cores and threads. Even current high-end CPUs will give sub-par performance with this game, not because our PC's suck, but because it all runs on just 1 core, so keep that in mind as 2009 wasn't really on the multi-core train yet, despite quad cores being a thing!

Not to mention, there ARE mods out there that do fix some issues, i.e. stuck sims, adding more life to the town by changing AI behavior, etc etc. 

There also exists ""The Sims 3 Ultimate Fix"" that can resolve startup issues, but it also behaves like a ""NO-CD patch"" which bypasses the ""Launcher"" and can be played offline.

Is this game perfect? No. Long answer: Noooooooooooooooooooooooooo. There are bugs that may still be to this day unresolved. This game unfortunately is one of the ones you [i]need[/i] mods to really get the best experience. 

If you feel lonely, have no one around to spend time with and have some free time to kill? Get this game and enjoy. At least you'll have a much higher frame-rate than I did back in the day, unless your PC is also from 2009.

36,41307803,english,"Pretty much got this because the Sims2 stopped working... Waited until sales hit.  

Sims 2 was better, Sims 3 is basically more or less much of the same as before.  If you have a working copy of the Sims2, you already have a better game.  If your like me and you had to move over to the Sims 3... Eh... I miss the Sims2.  

Off the bat, it feels too easy, not the Sims was ever a franchise with a lot of depth, the issue is its *too* simple.  I created a Vampire and 10 days like it was immortal, as soon joined her 3 days later her husband (also a vampire) and as they grew up, their 3 children. 

With the Sims2 you can say you got a better game over the original, but aside from some graphic updates and tweaks here and there, it doesn't feel like much of a different beast to the Sims2. 

I can't thumb it down because, aside from the in-game coins thing trying to make you spend money on content they don't sell with any packages, its not a bad game.  But no Sims game is truly bad.  Its just that the add-on DLC, as with all past versions makes you wonder what is truly being added to the game.  It gets worst in Sims4, so this is likely the best of both words overall with the Sims3, so take it or leave it because after this game... The future looks grim.

Edit:
Going to add in a few more things... So... An issue I have with this game is its full of needless fluff.  Sims and Sims2 have fluff, but their more streamlined.  Some of the intereactions a Sim can do are needless. 

Adding to the previous comment about Vampires being too easy to make immortal, there is also the Fairy.  Both these beings make the game too easy, you have no reason to play a normal Sim unless you want the challenge.  Within 15 days I had my first immortal fairy when I tried it.  

Other critques include that there are tons of items; you will not use 75% of them.  This was a problem in previous sims yes, but... IT gets worst in Sims3 the more items you own via packs or items from the Sims store. You will never ever use most of the content of the library because the item is either trash, not that useful or useless. Often what happens is for example, you want to buy a telescope.  Well you buy a cheap one to start with.  Then you wait for the money to buy a better one.  Except... The most expensive isn't ""better"" all the time and often a cheaper one is better. So you never fork over money for the most expensive Telescope.  In fact you'll likely only fork out money for those 2 telescopes, the cheap one and the decent one.  There is something like 4 or 5 of them... So 2 or 3 will never get bought.",1522967481,1567332862,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198025376643,651,129,20556,0,1837,1591997751

50,54815336,english,"(I've put countless hours into Sims 3 off Steam)

If we were to judge each main Sims game off the base game then Sims 3 is the clear winner as it is the most feature-complete and personally caters to my play style. It also changed the gameplay from that of 1 and 2 and still even from 4 by going true open world, allowing for vehicle transport, neighbourhood strolling and proper rewarding exploration. The Create-A-Sim mode is also the best in this game with the colour swatches AKA Create-A-Style, additional clothing slots and strong customisation features such as the face and personality traits.

The building side of the game also saw many improvements, conveniences, new features and more ways to make the lot of your dreams. Although you can't make your own town from scratch in-game, a world map tool came to be that let you essentially do the same thing.

The SimPoint microtransactions are disgusting, over-priced, unethical and still to this day, but they also meant content that adds new gameplay features to be added in the game. Unlike other Sims games that didn't really allow for this.

The graphics aren't that great but they are better than previous Sims games, the most common complaint being the weird plastic-like art style that make the sims look like dolls and lifeless. Additionally, the performance of the game is really garbage, installing many mods and/or expansions can cause incredible slow downs and extremely long load times. But now in 2019 with a beefy rig, these performance issues are no longer a thing, which lends this game to stand the test of time even moreso.

Sims 3 is my favourite Sims game, even with all expansions installed, but of course Sims 2 and 4 did certain things better or have features not seen in other Sims games. However, I think Sims 3 offers more good things than it did take away bad ones and I highly recommend buying this and the expansions on sale on a decent rig.",1566836583,1566836583,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198031089250,1391,34,732,0,84,1589132816

Much better than Sims 4 in a lot of regards, especially if you like customizing every aspect of your Sims and other creations and the OPEN WORLD which is awesome compared to Sims 4's very segmented pieces. What that means, though, is that Sims 3 is probably harder to run on most PCs than Sims 4 is, funny enough. The NRAAS mods like Master Controller, Story Progression, and Overwatch are imperative because the game is honestly not very well optimized and without those mods you'll run into problems all the time. I would also recommend using the 3booter launcher, because it will cap your FPS to 30FPS so that your CPU isn't working at max speeds to run this game at hundreds of frames per second while the game logic itself still runs at only 30. I played this game for over 200 hours before I found that launcher and it's a godsend. I wish I could still track my playtime but it's a trade I'm willing to make.

Another thing to note is that when you update your GPU drivers ALL of your settings get reset. Your save data will remain but even things like the aging scale are all reset, so make sure you take note of all your settings before you update drivers.

As far as DLC goes, wait for sales because during the Steam Winter/Summer sales they will go down to $5 instead of $20. I haven't bought any Stuff packs but I have most of the EPs and would recommend all of them for the sheer amount of cool content that they add, including entire worlds.

Completely not worth it. The Sims is a fat cash grab by EA and is garbage. If you enjoy the housebuilding mechanic or the management of sims then I'm happy for you and wish I could enjoy these core features. However, for me most of the gameplay loop (Job, piss, poo, whatever other bs you have to deal with your sim) is a chore and keeps me from enjoying building.

Went into this as my first Sims since the original Sims, so here are some differences and my opinions on them: 

Sims now age and die - not a fan of this, especially with the very short life span on default, though in the menu you can increase lifespans to a point where aging pretty much wont happen

Sims have goals/wishes - these are nice, it gives you something more to do than just focus on making money and advancing your career

Besides regular careers, there are other ways to make money - these are nice additions, you can make a living as a fisherman, street musician, odd jobs from phone calls, etc

Sims have cell phones - nice to be able to use the phone whenever, though I don't know why they still allow you to purchase a land line phone?

Not everything is in build/design mode, you can go to stores and actually shop - this is a very nice addition, gives your daily routine more variety 

Design (or decorate, whatever you call it) mode has very little option - in Sims 1 i recall having so many items to choose from it was very easy to make your house unique, this game (base version, no DLC) honestly has very little; though i know thats part of the ploy to get you to buy the DLCs",1566509520,1566509520,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198027708122,271,77,703,0,654,1567517418

During that short hour, I have already crashed into a billion of paywalls, which is saying something. Oh, you want to start in a nice-looking map, or you want your character to wear this nice costume? Nope, you gotta pay up, buddy. While I'm not completely adverse to micro-transactions, there is a ridiculously minuscule amount of content I can access within the base game, which isn't exactly cheap.

Secondly, this is a personal preference of mine but my god, the character customisation feels so... bad, for the lack of better term. I usually love customising my characters to the point that they have to look exactly how I imagine it in my head. Most games I have played can usually come pretty close if not identical to my mental image, but every character I've made in this game ends up looking like a demented child with every bad genes imaginable.

THE SIMS 2 Season เป็นภาคสี่ฤดูแสบได้สัมผัสกราฟฟิกใหม่ๆ ตัวละครใหม่ๆ ได้สัมผัสความคมชมชัดของตัวละคร และ ตัวเกม แถมเกมยังทิ้งกลิ่นอาย ของภาค 1 ไว้อยู่มาก แต่ข้อเสียก็ยังเหมือนเดิมยังไปไหนยังต้องโหลดหน้าตัวไฟล์เกม แต่ตัวเกมมีบรรยายทีดีกว่าภาค 1 อยู่มาก มีอายุ มีฤดู เข้ามาเพิ่มความสนุก แถมยังมีอาชีพให้เลือกอีกมากมาย มีการตอบคำถามเกี่ยวกับอาชีพด้วยว่าเราควรรับมือยังไงถ้าเกิดเจอเหตุการณ์ และ สถานการณ์แบบนี้ และ The sims 2 เป็นเกมที่ขาย DLC เยอะมาก ถ้าจำไม่ผิดมี DLC ทั้งหมด 18 ภาคหลัก แต่ มีภาคเสริมคือพวกแฟชั่นอีก 2 ภาค ตอนที่เล่นเถื่อนรู้สึกมีความสุขมากแต่เล่นไปนานๆ เกมก็เริ่มมีปัญหา กลายเป็นตัวเกมไม่สามารถบันทึกไฟล์ได้ พอเวลาเราเล่นนานๆ แต่ความโชคร้ายยังมีความโชคดีผสมอยู่ Origin ได้ประกาศ แจก The sims 2 ฟรี เป็น ultimate edition ก็ได้ทำการไปรับแถมตอนนี้ยังดองไว้บน Origin อยู่ดี จากนั้นก็เริ่มเล่นภาค 3

THE SIMS 3 Late Night เป็นภาคที่มีแวมไพร์ และ มีตึกใหญ่ๆ เป็นภาคที่ Open world สุดๆ ได้สัมผัสกับกลิ่นอายความแปลกใหม่ของ The Sims ที่ทีมงานได้พัฒนาออกมา เป็นภาคที่ชอบมากที่สุด และ เป็นภาคที่ (แดกสเปค) สุดๆ ด้วยเหมือนกัน ตัวเกมสามารถปรับแต่งตัวละครได้อิสระมากขึ้น แต่ตอนนั้นก็ยังเล่นเถื่อนอยู่ดี แต่พอเราเล่นไปเลื่อยๆก็เจอปัญหาเดิมๆ ด้วยตัวเกมเอง ไม่สามารถบันทึกเกมได้ ถ้าเกิดเล่นไปเวลานาน ทำให้เราได้รู้สึกถึงความน่ารำคาญ จนต้องกัดฟันซื้อ ภาค 3 ตอนช่วงลดราคา 75% และพอได้จัดภาคหลักมารู้สึก เล่นแล้วมันไม่สุดเลยทำการเหมา DLC มาทั้งหมด 18 ภาค เป็นเกมที่ต่อให้เรากลับมาเล่นใหม่ เราก็ยังรู้สึกสนุกและยังรู้สึกมีความสุขกับเกม ภาคนี้อยู่มาก เริ่มไปภาค 4

THE SIMS 4 มีแค่ภาคหลักอย่างเดียวเพราะตัวเกมต้องเล่นใน Platform Origin ซึ่งส่วนตัวไม่ได้ชอบเล่น Origin เหมือนตัว Software ค่อนข้างกิน Spec เอาเรื่อง แต่ตัวเกม Sims 4 ถูกสร้างออกมาคล้ายๆภาค 2 แต่ได้เพิ่มลูกเล่นออกมาคือ ตัวเกมค่อนข้างสมจริงมากขึ้น และ ทีมงานเองยังไม่ลอยแพ ภาคนี้ยังพัฒนาภาคเสริมอย่างต่อเนื่องแต่ DLC ภาคนี้ค่อนข้างแพง เลยทำให้ตัวเองยังไม่ค่อยเล่นภาคนี้มากเท่าไหร่ 

แต่ยังไง ก็ขอขอบคุณเกม ดีๆ แบบนี้ ที่ทีมงาน ยังพัฒนามาเป็นเวลานานมาก และ จะคอยติดตามผลงานของตัวเกมในอีกทุกๆภาค ส่วนคะแนนที่ให้ สำหรับภาค 3 ให้ 9/10",1482904613,1564760149,True,2,3,0.526446759700775146,2,True,True,False,76561198108794708,315,9,6123,0,,1565113626

Upgrading your characters through achievements is fun

Cons:
Expansion packs are ridiculously expensive and there's even more micro-transactions for single objects in the game.
Some of the time mechanics make no sense at all (for example you can't socially interact with someone while doing a job that seems to take ten times longer than you would in real life - who the hell spends more than an hour making pancakes?!)
Ridiculously slow to load no matter how powerful your machine is.
The triple speed when people are sleeping or at work is still too slow. Those moments are perpetually boring - if I were to design this, I would add a ""dream"" activity and a ""job"" activity because people do not pay this much money for a game to be bored.

A lot of potential to mess around and goof around if its your thing.

I would recommend the bundle they have on here, it has the three ""must-have"" dlc with it for a decent price.


DLC is, admittedly, a little expensive for my tastes. While several are definitely extensive and add a lot, they have a high price tag for some of them, you have EA to thank for that. I would recommend LGR's reviews of the dlc packs if any of them interest you.

Customisable textures are pretty fun, I'd miss them if I went back to Sims 2
Open world is kind of decent but actual worlds are limited without forking over extra money and can feel a little small.


Cons:
Decade old game whose DLCs cost between £10 and £30.
Basically no content without buying the overpriced DLC. Very little content if you only buy one or two.
Loadscreens from Hell.
Bugs from Hell.
Could just be me, but sims take a long time to look half decent and tend to be a little samey.

79,53465165,english,"Sims 3 is great! It has hours upon hours of things to do and the game lasts as long as your imagination does. 

Creating Sims and houses are fun and easy thanks to the create a style system, where you can add patterns and colours to any item you want. You can really make your Sim and house unique and different from what someone else has made. 

Gameplay is never a dull moment, you have skills to improve, simoleans to earn and romances to find... among maybe trapping a few people in a pool or lightning a fire in your worst enemies house once in a while.

Performance and graphics can be lacking depending on your system however. Since the game is open world, it is very resource intensive and some expansion packs can easily lag or straight up break the game. A big problem I've been having is lots of screen tearing and there doesn't seem to be a vSync option.

The expansion packs vary in quality, however they are all jam packed with stuff. Stuff packs are really lacking however, with only having furniture and clothing items and no gameplay and you don't get lots for the price you're paying. There is also an in game cash shop that sells even more furniture and clothing, alongside a few gameplay options. I would have prefered these be added into the existing expansion and stuff packs, but with enough patience (and lots of ads) you can get the in game cash items for free.


Other than the performance and the amount of extra content EA tries to tickle your wallet for. The Sims 3 is great and I highly recommend this if you're in the market for a life simulation game.... and I also very highly recommend you buy this instead of Sims 4.",1562214731,1562214731,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198060689392,68,3,2905,0,107,1594345151

Get them when they're heavily discounted, but keep in mind there are several sites out there that will allow you to mod the absolute hèll out of this game, and also some with [b]TONS AND TONS[/b] [i](and I mean TUHHNZZUH)[/i] of FREE content, like:
[list]
[*]New Careers & Social Interactions
[*]Improvements to Relationship Panel
[*]New types of stuff to Build/Buy
[*]Ridiculously swank custom houses
[*]Completely custom made towns inhabited by handmade sims
[*]Custom Create-a-sim features like Cat/Vampire/Supernova Eyes, and realistic skin, and better hairstyles, and better clothes, and Bling.
[*][b][i]New Frickin Vehicles[/i][/b]
[*]Disabling the annoying carpool after you have your own ride
[*]Mods that clean up the junk in your game every night, like radios/tvs that were never turned off, and abandoned cars
[/list]
There's so much stuff is kind of insane actually. I won't post the links to the sites here... I'm always weary of clicking a random link on a forum post. I recommend just Googling [i]Mod The Sims[/i], [i]Nraas[/i], [i]The Sims Resource[/i], and [i]Carls Sims 3 Guide[/i]. So yeah... if you're ready to sink your life into making a life for something that doesn't exist, then yes - you should buy this game.

90,53433947,english,"Honestly, I love the level of control offered in the Sims games.  I've enjoyed them since I was a very young child, and think that different platforms have different great things to offer in the individual games.  Sims 3 in particular is one I keep coming back to.  I adore the default towns and have a lot of fun just exploring and familiarizing myself with the neighborhoods and town lore.  Obviously designing your own original or themed/fan characters is a huge plus, as well as designing and coloring your own homes!  I legit spend hours building my houses alone, and usually base them off of interesting houses I've seen IRL, or nice-looking blueprints for fancy homes online.

This game never feels stale because there's always something different to do.  Play as your own original characters, play as the NPC neighbors, play as your offspring, etc.  The possibilities really are endless in the Sims games, and the towns and custom descriptions for every item in the game really are charming.  I usually find myself snorting or chuckling to myself when I decide to peruse them.  Sims has such a nostalgic, happy feel for me, and it's associated with some of my most peaceful and positive memories growing up.  It's just a nice game to relax with and kill time in a way that's enjoyable.

And even better - get it on Steam, which has frequent sales, unlike Origin, so you're not shelling out another 20 bucks every time you want an expansion pack.

I just finally decided to buy the whole experience during the 2019 summer sale Prix and even though I am recommending this game (Because the Sims 3 is a great experience and still a better one than Sims 4 ATM) I still want to call out how absolutely greedy EA still is with this game. There are still BS microtrasactions for things that are already in the game that you downloaded (after so many f-ing years after this game's release) and not to mention the advertising for pointless stuff that you can buy from the store occasionally coming up in the notifications during gameplay. Though I still don't see the need for that with this old game, as even with the steep 75% discount on sales it still is a little bit more expensive than fully priced Triple A games by today's standards for the full experience. Luckily you don't need any of these as the Sims 3 has a great modding community and there's already a lot of high quality free custom content that you can download on the internet. 

TLDR
(1) The game is great
(2) EAs pushing of micro-transactions and locking of content already on (and taking up space on)  your system is not.
(3) The Sims community is very welcoming and great. Plus, There's a lot of free content that has been accumulated over the years, that is way better than anything that's on the Sims store.

Unfortunately, I was rather disappointed. You see, the game is very empty and lacking in content, likely just so you will buy the many many expansions. There wasn't much for character customization, and there also wasn't very much in the way of decor and such. I like to try and build rather beautiful homes in games, even if the game isn't meant for you to do so (case and point: 7 days to die) but in this game, where it should have been rather easy, the lack of things available to decorate with was pretty on par with games where the point isn't to do so at all.

Something else I had an issue with was sims just not taking care of themselves unless I watched them. Yes, I know there is an option to enable them to take care of themselves. This option was turned on, and they would take care of themselves, but it seemed if I left the game running while I went to get a drink or something, I would come back to find they totally stopped taking care of themselves. It is of course just a coincidence that occurred several times, but the fact it would happen at all when they are suppose to fulfill their own needs is problematic.

While it is a giant scheme to take your money it is a good one, because I find myself returning to my little overhead view of my simulated persons and pets making them do silly and sometimes serious things living out their little simulated lives in their simulated homes with their simulated pets and simulated families, friends and neighbors all the while talking their little nonsense sims language bla bla bleebing about nothing.. ah.. its just like real life.

The Sims 4 is more cleaner, but they have taken out a lot of the details that can micromanage every aspect of your Sim's lives. For example, The Sims 4 removes the ability to make the bed, your Sims automatically make the bed every time they get up, even Sims with the Messy trait. Your town is fully loaded and live in The Sims 3, whereas in The Sims 4 it only loads one specific house/lot at a time. Granted, there are lot of bugs in The Sims 3, but these can be quickly squashed with some fan-made patches easily and readily available online.

Sure the sims 4 has better graphics and sims 1&2 have nostalgia and that great old timer game feel to them but sims 3 is just superior overall.

First off the main game is pretty good even without the expansions. Even if it might get a bit boring without the expansions it doesn't mean the base game is bad, imo the base game in sims 3 is the best out of the whole franchise (cause we all know how much sims 4 base game sucks)
the free roaming over world is something i desperately wished would have been added to sims 4 because it just made the game feel that it had more depth. The character customization is not bad but i have to say that the character graphics are.... a little underwhealming and not THE all greatest, but they are not bad, just a little above avarage.

The expansions of sims 3 are maybe one of my favorite ones out of the whole series!
world adventures - bring a lot of exploration and traveling options making everything feel more lively and out of the ordinary for everyday life.
Late night - vampires, parties and alot of fun party options. what more do you need ^_^
supernatural - maybe my favorite expansion out of the whole sims 3 expansions. It's a must have if you love fantasy, cryptic/mythical creatures like vampires, werewolves, faries and witches. Not to mention the potential for creating awesome potions to spice the game up.
Ambitions - is another must have, gives you new jobs, traits and possibilities + they finally gave us laundry :D
Pets - pretty self explainatory, if you love animals then this is a must have.
Seasons - not a must have but defenetly a good expansion if you want to make the sims 3 world more life like and real with the ability for different season.
Generations - another expansion that makes the world feel like more life like and lively. It brings a lot of different ways for your sims to bond with their children and grandchildren. It also makes growing up as a sim much more enjoyable and rewarding.

i recomend the sims 3 game alot if you want a great game with decent/good graphics with enjoyable expansions and replay possibilities. But i would sugest buying the games when they are on sale since usually sims 3 expansions go for good prices especially on summer sales. usually 50% off or more.",1561811564,1561811564,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198118809171,54,4,21257,883,12700,1601829761

But, if you are one of these unfortunate humans [i](Perhaps serendipitous from some perspectives.)[/i] The Sims 3 is the last game in a human/town simulation from Maxis that EA has allowed on other clients. 

I apologize for the gratuitous “salt” but I do have a slight chip on my shoulder so to speak in regards to EA. (That's Electronic Arts not Early Access, thanks again for that needing to be explained every time. Even [i]within[/i] context.)

[b]The Game:[/b]

The Sims is by in large a town/life sim with the expected uncanny humor that Maxis has a small reputation for. I'm not going to get into any significant detail as this game is well known. But, being as I've not played it since the initial inception and subsequent “Livin' Large” expansion; I figured I'd give my perspective on the matter. 

The town is a nice feature, which was not present in any meaningful way in the original. The lots  would load separately and “going to the store” or “meeting friends at the park for a picnic” was simply unheard of. You could invite people over and they'd spawn in your lot but that was the extent of it. I have fond memories of the simplicity. Owning transportation, BASEMENTS and having specific individual and family inventories just weren't a thing. So, from this, the main base game of Sims 3 I think has dramatically improved upon many features. 

Now, the Sims actually age in this game and have lifetime fulfillment sorts of goals. All for you to dictate, manipulate and direct as you see fit. But, the slowly aging and borderline non-contemporary gamer that is me who is not used to such features, thankfully, you are able to turn off aging without the presence of mods or any DLC. Which is nice. But, the fact your Sims can depart from existence due to old age as well as children actually becoming adults can make things seem more significant. Rather than just simply managing a bunch of needs and meeting requirements for what are very “gamey” mechanics. 

There is also this very “Animal Crossing” sort of vibe happening. Wherein you can have your active Sim gallivanting around town looking for minerals, catching bugs and fishing on top of all these other things that lends itself to this almost extinction level of addiction. There are also some quality of life features regarding caught/found records of those things. As well as records of skills obtained. Though, personally, I'd like some way to dig deep into the finances to derive precisely where my income is coming from. 

[b]The Good, the Bad and the Ugly.[/b]
[list]
[*] The base game I think has a decent amount of content for the $20 it is currently listed for at full price. 
[*] The DLC business model of this game is abhorrent. There is no reason to have this many DLCs that are the same price with almost no option for a discounted bundle. Especially so long after being released.
[*] Buying SimPoints is dumb, I'm not going to do it. Take those items out of my buy/build menus if my “wallet” is empty. (Edit: There is an option to do this. However, SimPoints are still dumb.)
[*] You can download user made content. Homes, objects, Sims, clothing objects, etc for free from the website.
[/list]
[h1] LET ME BE CLEAR[/h1]
The DLC practices behind this game are simply egregious, anti-consumer and downright despicable. If not, duplicitous. I do really enjoy this game and I do recommend it but the DLC stuff is really, really bad. Please take caution regarding the expansions when buying.

18,51138599,english,"The SIMS 3, one of my favorite games, and also the worst one. 

It's incredibly demanding on my computer, just shy of a gaming computer. The loading screen game is fun, but lags minutes behind. I can get up and leave, have a coffee, and come back, and sometimes it's still flashing on the last found item somewhere random on the screen.

Saving takes just as long sometimes. But if you don't save, you risk losing some incredibly important life event when the game silent crashes on you. Just, whoops, there you are, desktop, no more pregnant patriarch. Let me tell you, that unexpected weight gain, the surprise of your in-shape father of the family giving birth in the yard when he's supposed to be raking? Gone. All gone.

So yeah, save often, and wait, wait, wait.

As for the game play? Here's a plus, you can actually do well! You can advance in your career and be rich, or you can just forgo traditional methods of employment and create a team of robots to garden and harvest fancy books from your omni-plants for funds (Need the future expansion for the robots, otherwise you have to do it yourself), or you can buy everyone a computer and force them to write novels, articles and short stories until they start doing well at it. Or you can hunt for flowers in spring and sell those (if you have seasons expansion and turn off the other seasons, that works better). Anyway, you can actually advance and do well in the SIM world, unlike in the original SIMS, which I also love but never quite succeeded at with all the pausing to just keep the things alive.

And on that note, the free will option is great, and sometimes results in some surprises. Sometimes in some not so pleasant surprises as I found out when I made my Leader of the Free World quit and try to get a job in another track. He would not leave the house. Me: Go to Work. Him: Make me. Me: Go to Work! Him: I think I'll play video games.

So basically, it's an awesome, winnable game with dynamic game play, interesting scenarios and options, but the price of all that awesomeness is a demand on my machine that's greater than running Everquest on a raid with the particle density turned all the way up, which is to say ridiculous.

80,50646918,english,"This game is a great fun classic. While the game itself is extremely fun it has major flaws. Throughout this review i will be comparing sims 3 to sims 4. The reason i rate no is because i believe the negative side of this game out weighs the good

Cons:

 Stability: I can play gta v on ultra setting but yet i cant play this without lagging every minute (with most dlc unlocked). There are several workarounds I've tried but it does not work well on my pc at all. The same problems i have currently with this does not change even after i upgraded my pc. For some people the game works great meanwhile others like myself are stuck like this and cant do anything to fix it. If you do not believe me you can check the many threads on the sims forums with the same issue as myself.

 Crashing: Eventually as you continue playing you will continually crash due to poor implementation of vehicles and stuck sims causing errors. The vehicles are never cleared out of the database so as sims use vehicles its continually saving it to the file to a point it causes several stability issue's. You can fix this by installing some performance enhancing mod's but its kind of sad that ea still has not adressed a lot of these issues in order to favor sims 4.

 No support: This game has been completely abandoned by the most part by ea. if your wanting and or looking for support the best you can get is by joining a forum and seeing if some other user on there can help you. 

 High Priced Dlc: It's been 10 years and they still have not lowered the dlc cost at all. As i said before i recommend waiting for a sale

Pros:

 Lots of customization: You can pretty much create as much styles as you'd like when creating your sim which has been completely abandoned in sims 4. 

 Open World: Yet again another thing completely abandoned by sims 4 is the open world concept introduced in this game, this is one of the most redeeming quality's of this game and is  a large open world in which you  can get lost into.

 Worthwhile Dlc: While i hate how high priced the dlc is, It add's a lot to the game that makes it so unique and fresh.

96,50550580,english,"I've been using the Sims 3 to effectively escape reality (being that my fiancee and I live in >overpopulated suburban wasteland city< USA, you can imagine I have a mighty need for what this game offers. 
Recently having visited another country that's infinitely better imo, I now have a base to go off of when designing my Sims cities, lives, buildings, houses etc.
My experience with the Sims games - excluding the joke that is Sims 4 - (which is playable but greatly lacks content) is great and it's a game I always have and will come back to. 
Even if you play it to all ends one year, if you take a break and come back you can make new sims and pursue new careers and mischief all over again.
It never truly ends. 
I've been playing for years with more hours than this account has on record, and I still haven't done all the jobs and I still have a few DLC that I'd like to get. 
That being said, I've also never even used Mods, which grant even more play-ability and allow you to sink more hours of your life into a life that is most likely better- until your Sim dies in an untimely haunted house accident. 
My Sims kid can't seem to flush a toilet properly to save her life, but she's a B student still so I suppose it's acceptable for now.
Sometimes my Sims cancel their actions to go to work- or use their cars or travel at all- for no apparent reason. But hey, who doesn't cancel their obligatory actions once in a while? At least they show some autonomy to entertain me.

But if you want a list here you go- 
Pros: 
- Amazing customization in all aspects. You can completely change a town or city to your liking and replace all the sims and edit (albeit you have to cheat some) their careers and family status to your hears content. And don't forget unlike Sims 4 you can actually edit your sims color of hair, eyes, clothes, furniture, etc. with tons of options, instead of maybe 5 choices where you have to pick the least of the evils.
- With all main DLC you can experience a full life with or without aging on! Make your sims read some horror novels on a stormy night, let the kids out in the yard and help them make a snowman- then get ambushed by a snowball fight from the neighbors rotten ugly ducklings. Download some mods and do some other things like follow your kids to school and control their daily lives even further! There's so much content you could play till your retirement and have many more fulfilling lives between now and then. 

- Sims 3 is cheaper than Sims 4 by a longshot if you wait for discounts when the DLCs are $5-7 each! 

- The graphics are satisfying for most any computer than can run the game, the point of view never really gets old for me personally. If you want to control your sims directly instead of omnipotantly clicking them to success or failure, i recommend sims 2-3 for the playstation or gamecube consoles. You can control your sims with a controller, though building is a little trickier. (I forget if you can actually control them this way in sims 3 for ps3, but I think it might also just be point and click just with a controller.)

- If you're good at multitasking you can easily lead your Sim to entertain you with their life without any cheat codes at all, but certain cheats DO allow for a more enhanced and immersive experience. See above where I gave the example of cheating to edit non active household sims to have different jobs and careers etc. (though you will need to temporarily have them as your active household to do 
this. I suggest if you do, you do all this editing BEFORE you start to play your main household!)

- you can edit housing much more in Sims 3. In sims 4 if you try to create a loft, good luck, it'll autofill the floor you're trying to leave open on the second story to make it into a >room<. GG Sims 4. There could be a work-around for this but, none that I found in my hours of frustration trying to make a damn loft. Sims 3 is easy sailing. If you have the imagination, and the hours of time to make and remake and remake your starter home or dream mansion, you can do it. and you can have a mote.

- it's the Sims and no other game comes close to replicating what it does so well. 

Cons, some are opinion and personal EXP, but yeah:

- Bugs. Such as the aforementioned Sims cancelling actions for no reason. 

- Glitches when cheating- like elongated Sim extremities, and horrific elongated pets when you edit them with cheats. 

- timing. TIMING. Getting up isn't immediate, no, it'll take approx 10-30 Sim-Minutes for your sim to go from sitting to standing. 

- Trying to throw a party in an apartment with an elevator is insane. Will the guests actually all make it up to your apt? Probably not. 
They'll be too busy all waiting downstairs by the elevator, and will leave from there when your party is over- never having actually arrived. Pity. Don't throw parties in APTs at all OR, don't invite more than maybe 3-5 sims to any you throw. 

- it takes forever to load your game and to save. but this is the price we pay for an open world.

- Island Paradise will lag for most people, no matter your specs, because the Devs never cared to patch it. I suggest only Vacationing there, not living, but that's just me. 

- speaking of Vacations, you cannot take one to another location if you do not have the right DLC- even IF you have the location, such is Island Paradise. Without Generations or World Travel installed, I cannot take my sims to a nice island retreat. Plan your DLC buying accordingly. 

- Lag is a thing that'll happen, best to accept that most people can't afford a top line PC or Laptop to run a game smoothly 100% of the time. 

- my one main opinion that I wish Sims 3 had was something like Get To Work in Sims 4, but unlike Sims 4 I'd want it to be optional. In Sims 4 if you don't go with your sim they can't get promoted. This can get complicated and time consuming if you have 2 or more sims to a household that have Get To Work careers. There is a mod for going to school with your sims, but i dunno if there's one for any of the jobs and such. It'd be cool to have one though. 

That about sums it up. 11/10 will never stop playing this game.

I like the sims, as a franchise it's really good, at least Sims 1-3.
I fucking hate The Sims 4, it is such low quality piece-of-shit game that I can't be bothered to play!

In The Sims 3, you have an open world that is probably the main reason everyone loves this game so much. Though the people who suck The Sims 4 dick, will tell you this game is a piece of shit because, of it's plastic looking graphics and the absolute trash optimization.
I only agree with 1 of 2 of those reasons. The Optimization.

This game, personally, has never crashed but, It does lag to high hell every 15-60 seconds.
If the sims studio would've got off their lazy asses and fixed the damn game, I would love it even more.

Now you can help with Stability, Bugs, and Lag if you download the very famous mods from Nrass Industries like: Master Controller, Overwatch, and Error Trap. 
There is also a mod on ModTheSims called: Clean Start 2019 that deletes un-needed files from your Sims 3 bin folder and directories.

This game isn't a soap opera.

Its a horror movie.

And you're the director.

The true Sims experience is to kill as many people as you can in the cruelest and most sadistic ways possible within the confines of a G-rated family game. Entrap them in elaborate mazes or build cruel human zoos, break their minds, starve them, drown them, incinerate them, there are many tools at your disposal. 

Limitation is the mother of invention and it's time to get creative.

Silly jokes aside Sims 3 is the definitive Sims experience. The open world nature of the game expands it from just a one house Soap Opera to a full on city builder as well.

Want to get to my review? Read below.

The game is fun, fun enough for me to play this game on 3 different consoles over the last 10 years.

The customisation is fun, but most custom items are hidden behind paywalls either through DLC's or through highly-priced Simpoints that you can't get without paying. If you want good clothing items, furniture and other items added to your game without paying, there are some really good Sims 3 modders online that allow you to use their items for free, just check the files and be careful from who you download from (reviews of users are very helpful with this).

Gameplay is very open, you can pretty much do anything and it'll be a new experience every time until you've explored most places on all available free maps. DLC is the only way to get a new experience with new maps, items and clothing and with some DLC, some new areas and interactions.
So you don't waste your money on rubbish DLC's, the DLC's that give you the most gameplay freedom are:
- University Life
- Supernatural
- Pets
- Seasons
- Town Life
- Generations
- World Adventures
- Ambitions
The rest are either rubbish or only add a few items/clothing options into the game.

45,50057074,english,"I've always been a fan of The Sims series.  I owned 1 & 2 with all the expansions, but of course, they were on DVD.  Though there are ways to fudge them to work on Windows 10, Steam is my primary gaming platform, and it is certainly easier to deal with the installation that way.  I didn't like the whole ""Origin only"" policy of The Sims 4, so I didn't even consider that route.  At least with The Sims 3, I have the choice of running it on Steam or Origin if I choose.  However, I recommend running it on Steam, as Origin will change it to the 1.69 version which hasn't been received particularly well (Steam runs 1.67).

My initial thoughts are that  I am definitely pleased with The Sims 3 on Steam, though there are pros and cons to The Sims 3 in general.  The cons are that The Sims 3 tends to load slowly (though one can get around that with mods), and the blatant attempt to monetize additional items (via The Sims 3 Store) is pretty sad.  Still, one can turn store items off in the settings, which I was quick to do.  The other big con is by the time you've purchased the expansions, it costs a small fortune (why in-game item sales is particularly a pathetic cash-grab), but we're talking EA here, so one has to expect that.

Nonetheless, even though the game wasn't on sale, I went ahead and picked up the expansions, as I prefer to have a ""complete set"".  Though I spent a lot, I feel it was a semi-worthwhile investment, as I really enjoy the series, and this particular version is as enjoyable, if not more so.  There are a plethora of customization options, and the open world allows one to really create anything their heart desires and go in any direction versus The Sims 4 more linear progression.  Some of The Sims 3 DLC offers various adventures, and that is a nice addition to the series.  If you get annoyed with the Store listings, be sure to turn them off in the settings.  As far as I was concerned, I had already spent enough money!

The graphics are great, and personally I think have aged very well.  Though I'd recommend purchasing the game and expansions on sale, if you really enjoy the series and can't wait, I don't think you'll be disappointed.  Just be ready to jump through some hurdles with registering the keys and downloading the additional content.  Once you get the hang of it, the process is tolerable.  Like I mentioned, it really is a great game, and a huge plus that it is offered on Steam, I don't think I'm missing out on anything by not owning The Sims 4, I'm quite content with The Sims 3.

If you are looking for a diverse Sims game with a lot of customization and open world gaming, this game is for you.  It is a nice relaxing simulation that allows one to be truly creative.  I've already created Sims for my family members, and hope to create a world that mimics my local neighborhood, so I can create a house close to the one we live in.  The modding community is quite active, so that is yet another plus.  So far, I'd say that this version has been the best of the series, and that The Sims 4 is almost a step backward in some ways.

Without question, the Sims 3 certainly has its pitfalls, but the more I play it, the more I like it.  I really enjoy the creative freedoms it offers, and the fact the Steam version also plays on Origin is a huge plus!  Yes, it is without a doubt quite expensive, but if you are a real fan of the series, I believe it is worth purchasing!

It's my go to game when I'm bored, and it's the reason I even joined steam in the first place; because this game is so cheap when it's on sale. It's amazing, the gameplay is great for the price (even when not on sale!) and I have sunk SO many hours. (It only looks small, because most of my gameplay time on this game is spent offline; and therefore not recorded)

People have been complaining of the bugs that this game brings; and they kinda have a point, because this game is very broken, UNMODDED. This game has a very active modding community, and they have almost patched in all of the holes that EA left in on release. It's honestly amazing, and if you have any problem, you can always go to the VERY active community for help.

Let's not even talk about the custom content scene. (similar to the modding scene, but it's for custom content like hairs, clothing, etc) I have spent LITERAL HOURS just fretting which texture to use, which default eyes looks better, mindlessly clicking ""Download this"" on any Sims CC website available. 

And the core of the gameplay. GODDAMN IT'S SO GOOD. There are those small, tiny, details, like the outcome of an opportunity that you forgot to fulfill, or the scary music when a burglar comes in, that make this game as awesome as it is, and also why many people are still playing this game, because the sequel to this game, The Sims 4, is VERY lacking in these EXACT details. 

People complain about the DLC a lot, but TBH it still has more content for the price than something like The Sims 4. (Can you notice I REALLY hate the sequel?!?!) Anyways, this game is worth playing, for any purpose you want: 3 hour fun with a weird looking green dude that woohooes everyone? 80 hour fun with a perfect white-picket fence family? Your choice!

Something that was never accomplished in my opinion.  Imagine what they could have accomplished if they had waited 8 and 10 years between iterations rather than 4 and 5.

My last point; and certainly not the least: The Sims 3 isn't a relaxing experience in my opinion:  You're constantly on your toes trying to get everything done.

If you're going to buy this with a package, (for $7.49 on sale) I'd recommend getting pets.

As for the game itself... It's The Sims. Do I really need to explain how it works? You can mess around and either take the game seriously and care about your sim, or torture you sim and see how long they'll live.

I love The Sims. I have played since The Sims 2 and then I moved over to Sims 3, And now i'm back to sims 3 after all these years.

It's still an amazing game, you can just choose whatever you want to do with your Households and cities.
I'm a big fan of these kind of games.

What makes this game so much better then The Sims 2 is that here you can travel around in the city without loading screens, you can just walk and drive wherever you want in the city.

The game have some bugs and lags and the graphic is not the best since it's quite old but still enjoyable.


I rate ”The Sims™ 3” 8/10

I personally don't really like the base game. The game is tedious to play in my opinion. Sitting and watching people die in dumb ways is fun but gets old quick. 

Pro's
1: You can build a houses and businesses in almost any way.
2: lots of options for character design
3: lots of DLCs
4: the ability to build a family anyway you want
5: the ability to give Sims different personalities and opinions
6: hundreds of hours of time you can spend murdering Sims in fun ways
7: More i guess

Con's 
1: DLCs cost A LOT. Like as in an extra 400$ CAD
2: For me the game play got stale quick
3: Sims often die in dumb ways 
4: Most of the game is Pay walled ""need to get DLCs""

Everyone was doing their thing until the hunger meters sunk. Alfons got up and into the kitchen. His mission; cook a stew. Due to fatal stove malfunction, a fire broke out. A mix of emotions broke out, Alfons and Roland were panicking, while Christin was celebrating the whole scenario. Fortunately one of the elderly neighbors was currently visiting and swiftly stepped in with a cool mind, armed with a fire extinguisher.

After the chaos cleared up, Alfons' attempt at cooking went bad, so bad, that Roland even caught fire. Fortunately for him, after Christin cheered, she extinguished him. With the stove now completely destroyed, It was Christin's attempt to ""cook"" something. However, there weren't many options, since the stove burned out, so the whole household had salad for supper.

...here's what you do. 

Step 1: Wait for sale (Like the one on now 05/02/19).

Step 2: Add game and all expansions to cart

Step 3: Enjoy the potential thousands of hours of gameplay that you can discover here.

OR

Just start with the base game and if you like it, add the expansions that interest you most. 
However, you will miss out on a lot of opportunities and extra content that you might have otherwise discovered being one of your favorite things about the game, so I'd still recommend grabbing all of them, especially if you liked the previous games.

This one is pretty easy to get running on modern hardware and the modding potential is huge. It offers open world exploration, with loads of possibilities and it feels more alive than ever with the progression of the families and events around you. 
No longer does the entire game revolve only around your active lot. The entire map is your story now. Gone are the days of only people in your household aging, but your best friends/romantic interests and even family members who have moved out stay the same age forever. They will age with you, they will pursue their interests, they will find jobs, move house, get married, die of old age.
You can influence how these things happen with interactions, making you feel like you have more control what can happen than ever in the series. 

The biggest con I can think of is that it's no longer being updated and the performance isn't great on some machines, especially when you add mods to the mix. 
It's only a 32bit .exe so you wont get all the performance benefits that modern hardware can offer you, however most decent gaming PC's shouldn't have too much of an issue running at a playable framerate. 
There are also plenty of tweaks out there to help get a bit more juice out of your rig if you feel the need to seek them. (Check comments for a couple of recommendations in regards to this, however what may work for some, won't necessarily work for all. Follow instructions carefully and USE AT YOUR OWN RISK)

The game graphically isn't all that impressive, but it was never about the visuals here and it's not by any means a bad looking game, especially considering how old it is and how much is going on in your game at all times.

I'd also recommend The Sims 2 if you can find it, but it can be a real pain in the ass to get running on modern systems. 
If you have the patience to get it running, it's truly fantastic and you can tell it was made with a passion and a team that really loved what they were doing.

Additional content is awesome. It has it's purpose and I can totally understand why it would have a healthy price tag when you first release it. But Sims 3 has been out for ten years and its downloadable content costs more than brand new games with all of the expansion packs (on steam). There are over 15 different packs you need to buy if you want to check out all that the game has to offer. These packs are seriously marked at $30 or $20... Steam needs to catch up!

The second issue I bumped into was a lack of auto-save mixed with random/uncontrollable deaths! I was having a blast designing the home of my dreams when I got a little ""quest"" to fix a stereo. I tried to do so, and I was shocked to death. With no feature to automatically save, I lost hours of progress and tons of customization. My only other option was to lose my main character and have my wife live on mourning my passing. After all of the time building his stats, it seemed a little crazy that there isn't SOME way to reverse this. The game is casual, and not meant to be some hardcore random perma-death type of title!

12,48058230,english,"IMPORTANT NOTE: I recommended you get this game only when it is at a 50% or more discounted price.

Now if you're like me and you've never played the sims 4 or any other big life simulators, this game would be awsome to play. There's so much to do in the game, build your house (which I spent 5hrs building my mansion), go on dates, ""woohoo"", cheat on your partner, invest in properties, fire people that work for you, etc. there's so many things to do in this game and that's what I love. 

Now here's what I what I DON'T like:
1. The built in-game browser is awful
You have the option to create a separate EA account for the game which would unlock features and allow you to share things to other people in the Sims 3 community. The problem with this browser however is that it doesn't work well. It's slow (my internet isn't slow), and even after waiting I have to refresh the page a couple of times to load the page. I looked online and found other people experiencing this problem, but found no solution.

2. If you want more simple features for the game, you have to make an EA account and spend money (yeah there's micro transactions..)
The game has a currency called simoleon points. There are two ways to get simoleon points: 1 is through daily rewards by visiting the browser (again the browser is awful), and 2 is by spending money to buy simoleon points. These simoleon points are then used to buy more furniture, clothing, and different worlds. Now the game has it's own default furniture, clothing, and ONE world for you to explore, but if you want more of those you'll have to make an EA account and buy simoleon points. 

Another note: There are both premium and free worlds that you can download. Though, to get another free world, you have to make an EA account (again, through the terrible browser) and select the free world you want to download.  Also I've read on a forum that some of the premium world prices cost just as much as the entire game. I can't confirm that to be true because I'd hate to open the built in-game browser again, but if that is true, that is just... GENIUS!!! (sarcasm)

~ Summary ~
The game is good, you can sink a lot of hours into the game exploring the given default world and features. Though for what EA does, locking additional simple features of the game to make extra money, I think it's not entirely worth your money to spend on it's full price (currently $19.99). I recommend you be patient and wait for a sale when it's at a discount of 50% or more, like now if you're reading this comment and it's still on the winter sale.",1546482714,1549065367,True,34,0,0.755380690097808838,4,True,False,False,76561198402370487,93,15,1859,0,893,1549519790

36,48483724,english,"Hoo boy. This is prolly the first PC game that I played a lot of, back in my tweens. It's easy to get absorbed in designing, colour-coordinating, and micromanaging these little little lives. 
You make one, you make another to play with when the first one is at work, you make some children to see what their facial features look like when you put them together, you micromanage the child, you make a dog, screencap the disgusting glitches, buy the goddamned DLCs, make another sim to keep them company, make another sim to match the curtains.

I reinstalled the Sims 3 last year, and played it only twice, spending an hour per sim in Create a Sim, maybe another hour colour coordinating the house, then a few minutes making them binge study and get jobs.
Installing the game took roughly the same amount of time as all that put together.
(For that reason, I have not uninstalled the game, for despite the fact that I hope to God I never play it again, if I do, I don't want to have all that extra time to spend thinking about it.)

The Sims, I suppose, is no more a waste of time than anything else is, but the Sims is special, in that it makes you feel the existential dread that most other time sponges are able to drown out, as your sims do their homework, get promotions, look after their children, do taxes, make the children match the curtains, colour the swimming pool tiles red to make the water look red because you're an edgy tween who didn't have the Supernatural DLC but still wanted to pretend your sims were vampires- what was I saying?

watch your sims become forensic scientists right out of highschool- the goddamn gifted little fuckers, why can't I be a forensic scientist

My point is, the Sims, depending on your point of view, is either a curse that drains you of the time you could be spending on being productive in your own life, giving you momentary highs of gratification that you prolong for as long as possible because you know as soon as its over you are left only with a slightly more ingrained sense of self-loathing than you were before, and are filled with the desire to go do things that make you hate yourself in more productive ways, at the very least

OR. Or this game is a lesson, designed to beat you into wanting to stop playing it, so you can go walk the dog, or become a forensic scientist or something.

If that is indeed the case, then A + on the find-the-item loading screens, the Origin program, the constant badgering to register your game online, the DLC that EA keeps advertising in Create-a-Sim, and the house-editing menus.
Never before have I felt more motivated to turn off my laptop and clean up the entire house.
No, my real house. My real house that I live in, with my real relatives, that have mild hoarding problems.

Thank you, EA. You helped make me the hard worker that I am today.

Play this game, if you must, just remember- Ambitions and Supernatural are the only add-ons that are worth the bother (unless you need some screencaps for your creepypasta, in which case, get Pets), try to come out of this with the USEFUL type of self loathing, and remember to excorcise your poor obese harddrive as soon as you regain your strength of will.
And don't for the love of god get any of your friends or family into it. This is a test, for which you may come out stronger, but there's no garuantee that your loved ones will.",1548140950,1548140950,True,1,0,0.512195110321044922,0,True,False,False,76561198328863143,26,4,1675,0,1470,1526068924

The Sims 3 has been a game I've always had installed to every PC I've owned since 2009. It's great for those who like a more maticulas and slow paced gameplay experience (or if you really like torturing/killing Sims). While the Steam version does remove the need for a CD and give a slight boost in performance, you'll still run into some bugs that were never truly fixed. The new bugs seem to only affect the Steam overlay and can be annoying from time to time but aren't too serious.

Out of all the sims, including 4. This would be my favorite one. Though as 2 came after one and 3 came after 2, it seemed like packs came with less and less. But Sims 4 to me is the biggest rip off of them all. Sims 3 was the last one that offered still a wide range of extras in packs. Far more skins, items and you could even drive a car across the map or ride on a horse if you had pets added. You could even befriend a unicorn and take it home.

This would be the last open world pack in the sense you could actually explore every inch of map without load screens and not a few blocks or small sections at a time along with plenty of stuff you could interact with and collect. The only real thing that Sims 4 has against sims 3 is the higher quality of graphics and being able to get real close up to your sims. Besides that I feel sims 4 lacks a lot of content. You are stuck having to search for customized stuff created by others if you want more which only leads to risking issues with the game play down the line.

In this game, like all the others, you are able to build and create your own house or all/any plots. Depending on what pack you have you can build buisnesses and clubs. Another plus is you can mix revenues where as in Sims 4 its a bit more tricky to do or near impossible depending on what you are aiming to mix.

If you take a look and compare sims 4 packs to sims 3 packs, again you will see a lot is left out and lacking.

8,48085245,english,"Okay, so I love this game.

I've had this game for just over a week, and on the winter sale I got the downloadable content for generations, ambitions, and university life.

First complaint is not towards the game, but towards Steam itself. If you're going to advertise that the Winter Sale is going to be through January 3rd, make sure it is for all the timezones. I checked in at 5pm California time and it was gone, when I wanted to buy stuff. 

But I have plenty to say, good and bad, on the actual game itself.

First of all, it's so fun! Sure it's time consuming, but it's addicting. You can do anything (almost, aside from a few things) that you can do in real life. You can have kids, which I love, and some of the DLCs feel worth it, IF YOU LIKE THAT PARTICULAR ASPECT OF THE GAME!! If you don't really like kids and the family life, Generations isn't really worth it.

However, there are many things.

First of all it crashes repeatedly. This is a new computer so it shouldn't be due to the computer. I only have this problem with one other game, and that one doesn't crash.

It tends to crash in Create A Sim. Which is really annoying, because then you have to entirely restart the computer.

I also think that the DLCs are overpriced.

But this crashing problem is why this review is negative and please EA, see this and fix it!! I hate to have to give you a thumbs down when I absolutely LOVE THIS GAME!!

...and if you are really seeing this EA, please don't make your DLCs so overpriced, they aren't worth it if they aren't on sale. I'm sorry but it's true.",1546567301,1546567301,False,0,1,0,2,True,False,False,76561198875534109,9,1,12275,0,80,1583113233

36,47970837,english,"I have played The Sims since owning a potato computer back in the 90's. Sims 1, 2, then 3, and even 4. I will give a quick overview of the differences between the Sims line of games.

The classic Sims 1 is good but restricted compared to the current versions, and has aged quite a bit. The needs system needed some work and was frustrating at times, but was a fun game overall. You got to play God in people's lives, what could be better than that? The Sims 2 improved some things like the needs system a bit, plus some slightly better graphics. The Sims 3 has even better graphics, as well as some more to do in the game, especially with some DLC packs. I think the largest jump in gameplay is from The Sims 2 to The Sims 3, and The Sims 3 might be the best game in the franchise. 

Comparing the two most modern Sims games, 3 and 4, they are basically the same thing. The exception is that 4 has slightly better graphics, the ability to plop pre-built rooms onto your lot and connect them like puzzle pieces. The building system is a bit more intuitive and user-friendly. And Sims can multi-task, something which lends very well to the game. Sims 4 is also much more expensive. I bought 4 for 5$ and each DLC is 30-60$ each. 

If you have no worry about money, I'd say go for The Sims 4. It's the most user friendly and building is much easier than previous versions. If you're on a budget or want to save money, go for The Sims 3. You can buy the DLCs for 5$ each, and the game is only 5$. You can get a good chunk of gameplay for 20-25$ (Base game and about 4 add-on packs). 

I have a few DLC packs for The Sims 3 and will not buy any DLC for the Sims 4, as it is overpriced. If The Sims 4 gets boring and I feel like playing a Sims game that has more content, I will jump on The Sims 3 to take advantage of some of the add-on packs I have. It's basically the same game as 4 with slightly downgraded graphics. 

So yes, in the current market I recommend this game. And I recommend it regardless as The Sims is a classic and leading life/people simulator and it's possible to sink so many hours into the game.

Get this in the bundle with Generations, Pets, and Seasons probably the best DLCs available. At the time of writing is under 13$.",1546211372,1546212606,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,76561198306196278,42,2,6419,0,2678,1549235479

Sims 3 is not worth its price as the base game stands, you might as well be playing on an XBOX 360..
Currently, I purchased TS3 at a discounted price of a very low $4.99.. Must be saying something about the overall enjoyability/quality of the base game if each DLC module was lowered to the same cost.. (L0L . . .)
Anyhow, I would overall say this game is not worth buying, unless you happen to catch it @ a modest sale..
You'll still want to end up modding it anyways, because let's face it; PEOPLE BUY THE SIMS GAMES BECAUSE they want to either make people they know IE. themselves, or real people in the world. and without the massive selection that only MODDING can bring to this game(not to mention, no steam workshop ; /) you're left with accepting a character that is sub-par to the one you're truly wishing you could create.
 
I'm still personally on the fence if I should keep this, until I can actually afford the DLC's required to install the mods I want, or refund before it's too late and.. To.. R'..rent it.

Price aside, Sims 3 is a great time sink. Its charming and funny and really lets a player develope their own game world. The problem is, the game lacks an autosave feature, crashes frequently and even worse, often crashes when manually saving. Very often, I found myself losing hrs of gameplay to crashes, and lockups when manually saving. After putting up with the risk that any time I played my entire entire session could be lost if the game froze when I saved, I finally called it quits when for no reason I can discern, all of saves disappeared. The entire save directory was empty and could not be restored. Apparently that is what I get for not manually duplicating and backing up my save in another folder outside of The Sims 3 game directory.

37,47266767,english,"The Sims 3 is a game I've been interested in for a long time, And boy howdy do I love it! So instead of rambling about all the bad or all the good and only slightly mentioning the other side, I'm gonna put it out blunt with some hopefully comedic commentary!
Be warned for (possibly censored)Swearing, And running in circles.
~~~~~~~
First off, Sims. S'great game. Runs fast on my computer and glitches appear to be low and unnoticeable unless you fuck with the cheats! At least, On my end.
In Sims 3 you can create a house or buy an existing empty one and make a household, Whether it be a single mother, An elderly couple, Or literally a cult. The game is fun but don't buy it while it's at 19.99 because HOLY MOLY Is it not worth the price!
While it's open-ended, You get one default town from the get-go and get some more when you buy DLCs, Which are the same price as the game. Most of the time these DLCs give you little things, Which DO NOT work with the price. Seriously! You gonna give us pets for 19.99? Throw in some lizards, turtles, birds, pettable insects, bees, And capybaras and THEN we'll talk!
Once you get past the horribly inflated prices that EA throws at you though, The only problems I have with the game are the limited sim creation options, The dependancy on the sims 3 exclusive currency to buy extra outfits, Hairstyles, And more. These are irritating and are thrown at you at every opportunity, But nevertheless are optional, Only proving to be important if you want a certain item that you NEED to spend simpoints to get, Which, If you have none, Or don't have enough, Cost money.
Gameplay is fun if you want to kill time. You can have sims set their house on fire by failing horribly at cooking, You can trap people in your closet by deleting the door and letting them starve, You can collect pretty rocks, And more. It can get boring and repetitive but if you have the right things you can just entertain yourself with more things, Like re-enacting twilight in the sims or giving sans undertale a deathfish.
Or a gun, If that's your style and if there's a mod for it.
Nevertheless, The Sims is great but not worth the price. I'd still reccommend it though.
Again, Wait for like, A sale or something.

Long review:

The sims is a sim simulation game. You will start by creating a family or a person and start decorating your house or buy a prebuilt one. And then you will find a job and advance in your career and get married and have kids and die :D Simple as that.

Cration is one of the storngest features in this game. You characters will have traits that will result in different options and interactions with different elements and people. You can change the looks of your sim of course. From eyes to whole body and accesories. You will be able set preset outfits for situations like sports, outdoor, casual, sleeping. All visual customizations are free at and all options are avaiable whenever you want. The traits can only be set at the beginning or when there sim is born.

There is town with neighbours and it is a dynamic environment. They will be working and moving around and getting married to each other. They will want to visit you or call you over. It is socialable. It is free to move in town and go to places and venues. You can also buy them and you may not work ever again.

The household creation is very detailed. You will be managing every architectural aspect of your house including painting and interior design and decorating. There are enough options provided to make you able to create completely different houses or mansions. Outdoor decoration is also available. Pools, parking lots, gardens and whirlpools etc. Inside the house, from trash cans to doors, lambs, decorations, ornaments, all housing devices, hobbies are available. You will find yourself surrounded with choices.

The ai behind sims are relatively acceptable. They don't always get stuk if you opt in the free will. But sometimes they do not exactly do what you tell them to do because of some weird reason. And you will notice they are standing around doing nothing but complaining :D But overall, the game manages your sims effectively. I have created a house of 36 people and they were all getting along well :)

You will have small daily wishes and big lifetime wish. Your sim will gain points to unlock abilities. The career progress is sometimes depends on skills like logic, charisma or painting etc. You should work on your skills. There are couple of aspects of your sim. Social, bladder, hygene, hunger, sleep and happiness. You will be watching for these situations.

The interaction between sims are mostly based on their treats. Some sims will be shy or evil for example. They may not be very good with people. Or some sims are charismatic and atrract people. There are actions to take in the game and this is where the sims is based on. There is a mechanic behind every action and it is based on the relationship level. When you want to do a good action, you may not alway be able to hug the other sim. But if the sims are close to each other, you will be able to do even more. You will start by introducing yourself and discovering treats and advancing through being an aquaintance to wife or husband if you want :D

There are couple of career options available. Each will have their own working hours and days and pays and requirements to promote. You can complete more than one career if you want.

There is a lifespan feature in the game. You will be able to adjust the length of the time required to advance. You will start as a baby, and toddler, and then teen and young adult and adult and elder. These can all be adjusted and it is amazing. I have shortened the baby, toddler, teen and young adult sections and extended the adult section and completed 4 careers :D :D I was like a sim god :P

There are services to call. Like maid or nanny. Police, fireman and repairman is also available. Tinkering is the key to improve some skills but be carefull. Sometimes you may end up initiating a fire while trying to fix the owen. Or even while cooking. My sim died because of  electricution while repairing the stereo :D And grim reaper came and turned my sim into ash and took the soul with it.

There are lots of additions for this game. Some contain social interactions and some contain household tools and decorations. Some even have game modes. But the base game already has plenty of options. So you are good to go with base game + 2-3 additions. Choose wisely.

There is a video recording tool in the game. I he heard there is a movie making thing too but i have never tried it. I assume it is another creative tool to get creative :)

The biggest drarback of this game is performance. The interiors of buildings are sometimes loaded asynchronously, thus resulting in white manifolds :S This happens when lots of elements are being processed. So it is not much of an issue at the beginning. But even with a powerfull computer, you will end up seeing this weird loading effects.

I also have sime 4 and ai is kind of improved in that game. But i would not recommend it since sims 4 base game is too limited and you will definitely need expansion pack to enjoy.

Overall: Sims 3 is recommended.",1543160918,1543160918,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198085792193,283,103,1653,0,1653.0,1453058646

Every single screen is plastered with microtransactions and is begging you to make an account to hook up to the online functionalities. You can't make a sim, design a room, buy some new furniture, or practically do anything without some simcoin microtransaction being plastered front and center to tantilize you. 

If you can ignore all that the Sims 3 is a great game and probably the best in the series but to me that's all just unforgivable and I'm very sad to see EA ruin yet another franchise buy squeezing blood from the stone.

My only complaints:
-The game is still priced high for it's (almost 10 years) age; I do not recommend buying it unless it's on sale or you're desperate.
-The vanilla game by itself can be fun, but can also get ""old"" after a while. Buy expansions and DLC on sale and never full price

The game alone is great, but better with mods. I completely and absolutely recommend registering your game on the Sims official website and becoming a commmunity member. On the website you can access the Sims Exchange and it's basically user created addons. I find it hard to play the game without the Exchange now.

Regardless of how many times I've played it and how repetitive it gets I'll always come back to it, if my wifi is out or even if I'm bored and fancy making a new sim and making the leader of the free world while starting a family or making an evil criminal focused on becoming a criminal mastermind! Whatever my goal is for my new playthrough, I'll always enjoy it, The Sims 3 is always fun in my eyes.

However, I think it is completely ridiculous that I'm expected to play £20.00 JUST for the seasons, yeah, that's right, you have to literally pay for the weather. Although this may not come to you as a surprise as this is a game published by EA. So all the DLC in the game and how ridiculously expensive they are for the little number of things that you are getting isn't a problem with The Sims 3 personally, it is with EA. 

Despite my extreme dislike for Electronic Arts' theme in selling games along with a number of DLCs that contain items that should be in the main game already and also what you would naturally expect to be in a game, this game is still great. I don't want to make it sound unfinished or anything like that, there is still a decent amount to do and like I've said before, the DLCs don't really add anything, sure pets and a new town sound good but other than that, the other DLCs just add clothes and items in the game that really don't have any effect. So, this game is still good minus all the DLC, it's how I play it and I enjoy it every time. I recommend this game, I love it.

Only other expansion i may get would be world adventures.

I dont care for pets, showtime or supernatural.

Stuff packs are a waste. I did get fast lane however for more car options.

This game is superior to 4 in my opinion.  I dont think i will get any future iterations at this stage.

91,45580545,english,"The Sims 3 is an amazing game, and in my opinion it is one of the best Sims games. It has open world, and it has story progression. Story progession is this gameplay function where when you are controlling your Sim(s), other Sims that you aren't playing as are still living their own lives, such as they can get a job, get married, have kids, earn promotions, age, and eventaully die. Story progression is actually one of the things that makes The Sims 3 better than The Sims 4, as in The Sims 4, story progression is not there, unless you install mods.

Now, the pros and cons. (I added a gray area, for things that aren't bad, but aren't necessarily good)

Pros:
Story Progession.
Open World.
Quite realistic simulation of life.
This is a game for all types of gamers, the beginner gamers, casual gamers, normal gamers, or extreme gamers.

Gray Area:
AI isn't too bad, but it can be improved.
Graphics can be improved, although they aren't bad.

Cons:
A lot of microtransactions.
Expansions may not be affordable for some.
The base game without any DLC gets boring very quick.

I definitely would recommend this game, I recommend the base game at it's regular price, but if you want to buy all of the expansions, then wait for a sale for all of the expansions.",1541157801,1541157801,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,76561198080380856,287,3,5370,0,5231,1549275579

It's a game that has stayed with us over the years and has individually followed us into adulthood. CD's are not always viable so having access to The Sims through steam allows for easy game play. 
One thing I have noted is that the original PC version is the best. I have played it on PS4, Xbox One and also through this downloaded version and none of them compare to the original The Sims PC game you loaded with a disc, or 4 ;). 
The original PC version provides more variety with building homes and multiple family's. I have found that with this downloaded version and other gaming platforms, creating your character, adding families and building homes can be fairly limited in the respect that you can't easily switch from house to house. It's a minor annoyance however, and in the greater picture, doesn't really effect the game overall.

87,44867185,english,"We all know how much I love, love, love Sims 2. However, with Windows 10 being what it is, Sims 3 and 4 are the next best thing to experiencing the nostalgia of Sims 2. I won't deny it: there are a lot of improvements, both major and minor, that Sims 3 offered:

- Most meals now fill Sims' hunger meters up completely
- The game is more ""open world"" and provides fewer loading screens when traveling around lots
- You can now place furniture more freely (via the ""sub-grid,"" as I call it)
- The writing/painting systems are far more thorough
- Traits allow for more diverse Sims 
- Graphics are well rendered

There's just a lot about Sims 3 to love! 

I AM giving Sims 3 a positive review overall because, yes, it is fun and enjoyable, despite not being Sims 2, and yes, as mentioned above, there are a good number of improvements and tweaks that make Sims 3 superior to Sims 2. However, there are also a few cons that I would like to mention:

- EA charges the same amount for each and every expansion as they do the base game (makes no sense)
- The Design Tool is mostly better, but can be a nuisance to use sometimes
- Hairstyles get worse with each iteration of Sims (for both 3 and 4)
- Only one neighborhood template by default (Sims 2 had many)
- Cheats don't work quite as easily as they did previously

Overall, though, Sims 3 is a great contribution to the Sims franchise. In fact, most of my anger about Sims 3 is the first bullet point - specifically, EA making it very financially difficult for me (and I imagine others) to buy the expansions. In my opinion, a lone expansion shouldn't cost more than half the base game (about $9.99 for Sims 3), especially considering how many expansions there are.

I have also played Sims 3 for much longer than it says here in Steam because I initially installed it from a disc. I have also played Sims 4 and I personally still prefer Sims 3. The saying ""never change a running system"" applies here - the developers tried to make it new and exciting and then ended up ruining good aspects of the franchise. Anyway, Sims 3 is amazing and I love playing it to wind down and relax. I will say that even if you're familiar with older/other Sims games this one might be a bit overwhelming in the beginning and the mechanics take some time to get used to.

It's a bargain for how much game you get, especially when you realise that it's sequel, The Sims 4, has less charm, less content in the base game, charges more for the expansion packs, and for some reason sacrifices the living and breathing, seamless feeling to the game worlds that the Sims 3 did so well and replaced it with smaller contiguous play areas, and separates even neighborhoods (which are often just a small street with 5 or 6 houses) within the same town with loading screens. Yes, The Sims 3 is worth every penny. And if you're smart, you'll grab all the DLC next time they get a big sale slapped on them. In The Sims 3, there really are endless possibilities.

----

I wrote that review four years ago. My opinion on the SIms 3 hasn't changed much, but I have - and my computer has.

When I wrote this review I was in a place where I desperately needed control over my life - school, family, mental health... all of it. The Sims 3 gave me that. Control.

I still enjoy the Sims 3. It's a wonderful game. It has it's flaws (by that I mean bugs) but it's always fun. It gives you the endless freedom you always wanted. Whether that's making yourself and having your Sim-self live their best life or murdering your mortal enemies in cold blood, that's up to you. But the Sims 3 is always there, and there's always something new to try.

I've played the Sims 3 almost since I came out - I had it on disc once, but it broke, so I ended up buying it here, where it's techincally forever. Even though I've played this game for longer than I'd like to admit, there are still things I haven't seen. One of them is a pretty funny story.

My boyfriend once borrowed my steam-login because he and his friend really wanted to try and play the Sims 3 over a weekend. So they installed it on his computer and had some fun - until the husband of the family got kidnapped by aliens. ""That's just what happens,"" they thought. But they noticed that he kept having this moodlet that said he wasn't feeling well.
When he eventually gave birth to a tiny blue alien, they called me in a panic. I was both ecstatic and outraged. It was absolutely hilarious that these two, who'd been playing for maybe 3 hours in total had gotten an event that I, after countless hours, had never actually managed to get.

And I think that says a lot. I still haven't seen this event in the Sims 3.",1402044060,1535638484,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198060442114,24,16,36153,0,33884.0,1420312501

Enter [i]The Sims[/i], a series so consistently in-depth and interesting that it’s no wonder its the go-to game for people who don’t play games.

That said, if you do play games you’re still going to find a lot to like about [i]The Sims 3[/i] (if you prefer to complain about them on Reddit you’ll just find yourself annoyed by how much DLC is available). Create your household, set them up with a job; teach them a new skill; throw parties - you can do just about anything you can imagine a typical whitebread American family doing in the small town of Average, VA. Little counters along the bottom of the screen keep you updated on what your little avatars want; how they’re feeling and why; how close they are to levelling up a skill - the world is your oyster. It’s easy to identify what needs doing to keep your little man or woman happy, and you’ll end up so obsessed with queuing up actions for them to do that you’ll complete transcend just how weird it is that you’re playing God with people who don’t even exist.

There are hundreds of hours of micromanagement here, and not a whole lot to complain about. The loading times aren’t great for a 9-year-old game, some of the user interfaces are unintentionally obscure, and you may find chunks of hard work deleted because you pressed ‘back’ at the wrong time and the game didn’t let you know that this menu was a point of no return. Other than these minor gripes, the only thing anyone would complain about is the abundance of (optional) DLC, but these people are the type who’ll complain about anything; with no DLC, [i]Sims 3[/i] is as good a simulation title as you’re likely to find, and is well worth the price of admission.",1534899717,1534899717,True,11,14,0.646171033382415771,0,True,False,False,76561198058159844,921,263,5892,0,1378.0,1585549708

• Mods! If you don't like how a certain thing looks, there's probably a mod for it. Want to make more efficent sensory deprivation chambers? There's a mod for it! Anything you could want to do to a Sim, can be done!

• Basements! The perfect tool for creating a [strike]torture chamber[/strike] [i]Painting room[/i]!

• It's fun to make mazes. [strike]Especially when something essential to Sim Life is at the other end of it. My record is 7 hours from start to finish![/strike] Yes. Hedge mazes. Nothing sinister here. [b]MOVE ALONG.[/b]

• A DLC and Content price tag that would make Train Simulator blush! Well, it wouldn't be an EA game without a literal imperial ton of overpriced DLC and microtransactions. [spoiler]Someone did the math, and it added up to roughly $74,500, give or take. I mean, if The Sims is more than a game to you, and more of a way of life, more power to you. It's still cheaper than buying an actual house. Just.[/spoiler]

[b]Actual Review:[/b]

I'm having a lot of fun with this game so far. Found a house that I like a lot, got a decent family of slaves and overlords going. Got a bottle of [strike]wine[/strike] [b]nectar[/b] that's worth $14,000,000. Life is good for the Williams Family. The Wainwrite family, on the other hand... Yeah, they're my painter slaves. My primary source of income. The husband hasn't seen his wife in over a year. The same bland, plain, concrete cell. Day in, day out. Year after year. Will he ever get to experience freedom again? Only time will tell.

I'd reccomend waiting for it to go on sale again, though. Same for the DLC. But it's not a bad purchase for $20 if you enjoy micromanaging a family's day to day lives. Or, ruining them.

The most prevalent downside to The Sims 3 is it's glaring influence from none other than EA, which is found through the bloated list of expensive add-ons. While the content found in many of these Expansion Packs is quite refreshing and in some cases even better than that found in the base game (The Sims 3: Seasons, The Sims 3: Generations, The Sims 3: University Life), the fact that they are downloadable content and not part of the base experience are noteworthy.

Without a doubt, this is the ultimate Sims game, which corrects many of the major flaws throughout the series (including flaws which were reintroduced in the subsequent game), although there are many issues even after the game's complete development. I'll begin with how it compares to the other entries in the series (including the new Sims 4), then some major flaws, the unavoidable question regarding DLC, and lastly how to make the most of your game.

Starting with the earlier games, a common gripe with Sims 1 is that Sims have no sense of self-preservation, and would often die without complete micromanaging from the player. In the Sims 2, the Sims reach an uncanny valley effect with most every Sim looking seemingly identical. In both of these games, Sims had vary little in the way of varying personalities, with altering their traits only changing the rate of which motives grew or decay with an occasional unique interaction here or there. Also in both games, there's little in the way of varying gameplay. No Sim seems to act unique, so it's incredibly easy to feel as though you've experienced everything the game had to offer once you clocked in a few dozen hours (even with all the DLC). But one of the more major issues In 1, 2, and 4 is that Sims are locked specifically to their home lot with little in the way of freedom.

The Sims 3 rectifies many of these issues, starting with the introduction of the trait and moodlet system, which gives each Sim a unique personality that you actually see reflected in the gameplay. In addition, Sims are intelligent enough to sustain themselves indefinitely, although they will need player input for major decisions in terms of careers, skills, or relationships. There is even now an open world with no loading zones, so your Sim is free to walk off the lot and use parts of the community to gain skills, refill motives, or improve relationships seemlessly. There is even an optional ""story progression"" button, which allows the neighborhood to progress with your active family. As the cherry on top, this game finally gives a convincing face editor which makes Sims look both expressive...and not all creepily identical both facially and physically. 

The Sims 3 isn't without major flaws, however. Even with all the (major) DLC, there's many bugs which, while correctable through player input, continue to hamper the game, such as ceiling tiles floating in the sky, Sims getting stuck, or minor gameplay mechanics not working. As I said, many of these things are correctable through some trickery as the player, but some bugs--while either minor or rare (such as cars eventually filling up parking spots on community lots)--can only be corrected through mods. But at least they're out there.

Another issue is the mountain of DLC. Each DLC is definitely an improvement upon the game (with some entries definitely stronger than others), but they are expensive and rarely go on sale. The game stands up fairly well vanilla, but the DLC is rather tempting, especially given that this is a game which can consume hours of your time. With all the DLC installed, however, you will encounter a problem. There are no in-game neighborhoods which come with all the DLC content in one place, forcing the player to either move from town to town to experience all the complete game has to offer, or make their own neighborhood with all the content themselves (which can take a considerable amount of time). There is a solution to this in the way of player created content, however, as many players have created neighborhoods (some of which are just modified versions of the vanilla neighborhood) with all the content present, and the game is made so that it will automatically replace objects you are missing (due to not having the DLC) with their closest available variant. All of this can be handled with the packaged installer, which makes downloading player created content (read: NOT mods) all the easier.

Now that we've tackled the major positives and negatives, we can start addressing the gameplay. As I said, the gameplay is phenominal. Sims are able to take care of themselves, will age and die, and form relationships as you go along. No life cycle is the same, with varying personalities and experiences that can make each new generation feel fresh. Difficulty of the game even varies with your own decisions, with larger families obviously being more troublesome to juggle. The Pets DLC also gives a new facet to the self-imposed difficulty, with cats, dogs, or horses effectively being seen as the halfway point in difficulty between adding an entirely new Sim to the household. With the inclusion of the phenominal story progression mechanic, you can (and are expected) to stick with one family the whole game while the entire town ages with them, and if you're ever feeling spoiled for choice, the game's ingame ""Wishes"" system always gives you goals to acheive. 

There's a lot to experience with this game, of course, but there's a common error that many new players make that can put a damper on your fun. To get the most of your gameplay experience, I would recommend using the default Sim lifetime (as you can modify it yourself) even if you want to test new content. Sims live just long enough that they pass away of old age when you've had enough of them (to put it coldly) and it gives just enough leeway for you to learn new mechanics and experiment. You don't have to make your own house (although it is satisfying to see a house you planned be interacted with by your family), as using the provided houses in the game work well enough. But if you must (which is tempting given how customizable everything is--down right to an in-game texture editor), then try to plan large. Never make rooms less than three tiles in width/length (including hallways) and give each interactable object at least a tile or two of wiggle room. Sim lifespan and the physical size of your house are the two biggest hurdles in terms of enjoying your gameplay experience. 

Ultimately, I would whole-heartedly reccomend this game, even if you're unsure of the creative aspects of it. There's obviously ups and downs to the game, but the gameplay is still deep, fun, and always offering something new, and the challenge is, as I said, self-imposed, but there are plenty challenges you concoct yourself or find online. Even if you're not the creative type, the game offers plenty of stock elements for you to use without sacrificing the gameplay experience. The sequel to this game, the Sims 4, is unquestionably a downgrade to this phenominal game (quite literally, as the Sims 4 outright removes gameplay elements--including the open world) and the Sims 3 will give you countless hours of entertainment for years to come.",1533383160,1533404489,True,11,0,0.671906828880310059,4,True,False,False,76561198002294036,142,2,23813,0,8024,1583545312

I know this game is old but bear with me and read below why I think this decade-old game is still worth 19.99 as a standalone without any DLC:

TLDR: This golden standard of the genre has no limit to how deep the gameplay can be. Gently sugggested by the game, the story is entirely built up and polished into a masterpiece by you and almost everything is costumizable. Easy to pick up and nearly impossible to put down once you get going. I still would recommend to wait for a sale, but that is true for almost every game on Steam. There are many triple A games that cannot offer the same amount of entertainment for the hefty price tag of 60 bucks. 

I made a musically inclined single mother Sim with a teenage boy. She is a brave and good parent that always hepled her son with homework and spent her time selflessly on him. And he was a straight A high school student and a genius little chef with a great sense of humor that helped with the house chores while his mom worked late shifts at the theater to pay the bills. She climbed the ladder all the way from a backstage nobody to a rockstar. Her silk fingers were also good at raising a perfect garden to fulfill her life-time wish. She had a few bad relationships and never really settled down. Once she became a celebrity she would hold parties almost everyday and with their different schedules she slowly fell out with her son. One night she was upgrading a speaker for a friend when she got electrecuted, but being the stubborn lady she is (and I didn't know the danger of being electricuted twice) she continued tinkering with the stereo and got a fatal shock that brought in the Reaper. Gone from Sunset Valley in body, she was immortalized in the music and pop culture.
The boy dropped out of school. Became a recluse. Broke up with his girlfriend and lost all his friends. He still got by with the money his mom left behind. Grew frail and dirty. His books became his escape. He read and wrote his feelings all day for months. Slowly the now young adult got over his depression and took up writing seriously. Slowly crept out of his shell and found a new love, a pretty artist that had big dreams of being the next Picasso. The adult man then published a masterpiece kids book, and now is expecting a little angel that he will name Ellen, after her late grandmother.

   Joodeen started out as a young bachelor living alone and working for the military. His dream was to become an astronaut and see the wonders of space. He worked very hard in life, often collapsing on the floor in front of his bed after arriving home from work. Every girl he talked to friendzoned him, and he found it very hard to make friends. His neighbors would often stand on his lawn and argue him if he happened to leave the house. It wasn't until late adulthood that he was finally married to an evil human lab rat whose skin had turned blue from high amounts of radiation. They were married only a few days from his birthday. He soon had two creepy gray alien children whom he loved very much but was moderately afraid of. About a day from their birth, he became an elder. With the sweet release of death quickly approaching, Joodeen worked as hard as he could to progress in the ranks at the military so that he could achieve his dreams of going into space. Unfortunately, he died in his sleep one day before he went into space. His whole evil family witnessed his ghost passing into the next life and were terrified, but also relieved, as they were now free to pursue their goals of conquering earth. 

RIP Joodeen, you never achieved your goals.

It costs less than a hard copy and allows you to download it on steam and Origin, so two for one.

Although I recomend buying the base game from steam I would suggest playing it through Origin. When you first launch the game through steam it gives you a Key which you can use to activate on origin as well. 

Playing through origin will let you use your old(or recently bought) hardcopy expansion keys.

EA is to blame for the DLC price. Too expensive to try buying one through steam to see if it will activate on origin as well.

59,43740423,english,"Player it via Steam in the first time, but then only via Origin, since there was a big sale on Origin only, I believe. Anyway, overall I really enjoyed this game, got many many hours (Steam hours as mentioned before were the first time) of playtime and they were all worth it. I purchased every DLC (Origin), because I'm a collector but also because all of them give some more content ofc, yet they are really overpriced. But if you really enjoy this game like me, you gonna get them all, since you can buy them cheaper via several trading sites. If you consider buying Sims 3 or Sims 4, I definitely recommend buying Sims 3, since it is just a difference between worlds, in the Style of play, and I missed very many aspects of Sims 3 in Sims 4, though Sims 4 is a good game aswell, not to get me wrong here. I think there is nothing much to say to Sims in general, since it is the only big game series in his genre and I think everyone knows immediately what there is to do, if they here ""Sims"".

Ok, much talk, there is one big contra: 

The game plays in a ""free-to-move"" world, means you can walk through the whole neighbourhood you are currently at, which is one of the big differences between Sims 3 and any other Sims parts. Anyway, the problem is, that also all NPC's (all other Sims and Pets (DLC)) can do this aswell, not being a problem first, but the more DLC's you have running at the same time, the laggier and more unstable the game gets, resulting in huge freezes if you speed up the game time, making it almost unenjoyable and unplayable. This is caused, as you can read up in several forums, of bad coding of the game, so that the pathfinding / routing of the NPC's is terrible, causing what I stated. There are several mods though, which could fix this, however it didn't work for me at all, and I don't like playing with activating and deactivating some DLC's rotational, only because it is lagging. However, for the beginning there is a mod called ""Nraas"", which is almost essential for everyone playing Sims 3 and pretty easy to install and understand. You can read up it's information in the Internet of course, if you want to. One more ""big"" (well not really big in my opinion, but many just really hate it) contra is the Sims 3 online shop, where you can buy Simpoints via the official Sims 3 website and then purchase diverse items, many people just don't like this way of money making.

After much talking, I just say I can recommend this game, but also keep in mind, if you are ever going to play with every DLC at the same time, it will keep freezing and lagging.

The developers really listened to the fans by adding in new features and touches such as;
                +Able to move camera freely around the environment and town
                +Can watch your sim visit the park or travel down town

I bought this game on steam because all the DLC was at super low price and have majority of the Ingame content. I do not see myself getting tired of this game anytime soon. 

The Game Itself:

The Sims 3 is basically a life simulator where you play God over your Sims. Sims are low IQ creatures that you control in everyday life to making food and going to the toilet to sleeping. The more often you perform actions, the more your Sims do actions that you do  automatically. For example, if the icecream truck comes by alot, and you always buy icecream your Sims will start doing to automatically instead of you having to do. Jobs are a essiantial. You can be many things from a Cook to an astronaut. It is hard work as different jobs require different skills to master. You can be a world renown surgeon  but it isn't easy work. You need many skills such as logic which can be obtained such as playing chess and much more. 
Although you don't have to, the game plays out like this (in the most basic form). 

1.Get a job
2. Get a promotion
3.Find a girl/ guy and woo hoo
4. Marry the girl / guy
5. Get the girl/guy a job
6. Make Kids and raise kids
7. Promotion to the max (if you can)
8. Become rich
9.Die
10.Repeat with your children

Building: 

Building is very fun. Creating giant Mansions are a joy to do. Making the perfect home for your Sims are a big part of the game. The building mechanics may look very difficult to new players, but when you get the hang of it, it becomes very fluent and you can create many things. You can create your dream house that you will never have, and it never becomes boring to do. From a small trailer park to a big mulitmillion dollar mansion, you can do it all.

Cons:

The thing that sucks about the sims 3 is that it is in the hands of EA. EA are greedy. and greedy means they want lots of money. The DLC cost alot and are not worth the price you are paying. As good as they are, the stuff packs are just not worth the price that EA puts them at. I strongly suggest to everyone, wait till a sale comes. The Sims 3 barebones no DLC can get grindy and boring after 40 hours as you did pretty much everything. There are mods that can extend the playtime, but you need DLC for certain mods to work. 

Conclusion:

 It's a life simulator. You can be what every you want. It's unlimited freedom. Be a physco and kill sims by starvation of drowning. Plauge the entire city with zombies (from supernatural DLC) if you want. It's great. Don't get the game in Origin as Steam provides cheaper prices and more sales.

9.5/10
good meme. would play again.

While I can't fairly compare - I love Sims 3. All of the options to expand environments, story lines, and characters are on point. However, I am bewildered as to the decision to charge $20 CAD or more for each DLC pack, when there are nearly 20 of the damm things! THIS MAKES SIMS 3 a $400+ GAME! Not only that, but this is not the newest release in the franchise... what other game series out there has done this? It's ridiculous. I'll find them in thrift stores, and on third party sites on sale instead... Very disappointing.

PROS
♠ Seemingly endless gameplay options, excellent replayability
♦ Smoothly functioning game, I very rarely run into glitches
♥ Access to the online Sims 3 community, custom items etc.
♣ Feels like what a sequel to Sims 2 should have been
♦ You can change the color and pattern of any item/surface
♠ Easily accesible cheats menu

CONS
♠ You cannot change the key bindings
♦ Insanely over-priced DLC, as well as real-money cosmetics shop
♥ More support is available for Sims 4 instead now...
♣ Many basic items, like a hot tub, are only in some DLCs
♦ Only 2 towns available in the base game

The sims 3 is like any other sims game. You make your sim and/or their family and you put them in a house. Your sims grow old and die. They have relationships, families, jobs, and more.
One of the biggest pros I can think of is the cheat codes. The game is fun, yes, but with cheats? Unlimited fun! 

[h1]Sims is like that game ""five more minutes mum!!!"" and next thing you know, it's 4 in the morning and you've killed your entire family. *cough* sims family that is.[/h1]

+Cheat codes
+Hours of fun
+Never the same, so much variety
+Can make your sim force themselves into a household and end up breaking a relationship.
+Can kill you sims >:)
+Can torture your sim and npc sims >:)
+So much to do

[u]Cons:[/u]
Is there any...? Hmm.
-Lots and lots of expensive dlc. Of course, you don't need to buy them, but the game without dlc is...well a bit dull.
-Can get boring, it's not for everyone. But if you've played a sims game before you know what to expect.
-Expensive for it's age.

Gameplay: Fun

The game is super fun and a great time waster. If you're bored and want to do something, sims is that game you'd jump to.

Clocking more than the 57 hours steam says I have played, I can say that even with just the base game, there is short of endless things to do and explore. It's a shame that The Sims 4 didn't build on all what 3 offered (then again, EA has its reputation to boot).
Usually I wouldn't even dare to give a possitive review to a game published by EA, much less give them any money. However, The Sims 3 (and its expansions packs) are my exception: I am weak, as much as I hate the developer, I love this game a 1000 times more. And it's very simple: everything that made The Sims 1 and 2 great, The Sims 3 just builds on and allows you to go beyond, offering so many great experiences that you simply can get lost in this game (again, steam says 57 hours, but I'd say it's over 200).

You gotta find the solution yourself and make it  recognize your graphics card (edit game code files). Even THEN! The game has performance issues... it CONSTANTLY STUTTERS, LAGS and FREEZES for whatever reason. 

If it weren't for the bad performance I wouldn't consider the game play experience bad but it is... ITS BAD. Online comments I found said this is normal behavior. So much for a $200+ game. Plus you think you got all the content?? Nope!!! There's more.. even after you buy all the expansion and dlc, they got other stuff online for the same price. You gotta buy their currency then spend it that way. Just a money grab.

At this point the textures of the sims are pretty poor. I'm dissapointed but with an old game that is to be expected. 

Actually I think I just might sell it back if I can. Too bad it can be entertaining but with with the huge performance issues, definitely not worth the AAA price. it's OLD. My suggestions $5 base game and $1 each for DLC.  Thats it.

Edit: If you play this game past the 2 hours mark and only then start to realize the performance issues it will be too late for a refund on the game and ALL DLC (even if you never played the DLC). Don't get burned like I did.

***Note I may have fixed the game for myself since I made this review but I'm keeping this review AS IS.  There is no reason why I should spend this amount of money on this game and then also have to spend hours modifying it, hand coding and basically end up in my own tech support role.  This game remains a major money maker for them and they haven't bothered to make any patches for it in over a decade.

46,42895804,english,"My sim urgently needed to go to the toilet but instead he decided to watch the TV even though he hates TV and is an outdoor sim 11/10 - IGN.


In all seriousness, to me, the Sims was always a weird series, it's like, life is bad enough as it is now, why would i want to play a simulation about life?

Well, that aside, i had lot of fun on the first Sims with its expansions back in the days, i played the second game, not as much but played it for at least more than 30 hours but less than 150 hours.
Spent above 150 hours on the first Sims.

I've never played the Sims 3 until recently, i decided to give it a try, i can say that it's pretty fun, i generally do not cheat on the Sims, i may have one or two characters who will cheat but not my primary character/family and the others, that's just how i like it (honestly though, i'd cheat right away if i could in real life).
It seems that this game has quests/missions or some kind of quests/missions which is pretty cool.

Expansions are a must and i'd suggest getting everything that the in-game store has to offer, you do not need to pay for the store items though, up to you to find out how.
With all of that, you'd have enough content for all your sims and families.

The Worlds from the store are pretty cool, i'd say thatmy favorite so far is Dragon Valley.

So yeah, it's a good game with lot of replayability, lot of content but here comes the flaws.

- Overpriced expansions/dlc and most of them should have already been in the game, they've released almost all the same DLCs for each game, come on now, just release it before the game is released but what do you except from EA Games?
- Expensive store, having all the items is pretty cool but let's be honest, you won't pay for it, you're better off downloading it online especially after having paid above 200$ for this game and its expansions/dlcs.
- Katy Perry dlcs... Do i need to say more? 
- Long, very long loading, i heavily recommend to install it on an SSD.
- You have twice your store items in your documents folder, by that i mean that if for example, you have 4gb of store items then it will be 8gb, to fix that, you have to rename the Sims 3 launcher to the name of the other executable and rename that executable to the launcher name, delete the .tmp files in DCCache and you're good to do, you should also delete files in DCBackup but not all of them, if you want a detailed guide, just let me know but there's probably already one somewhere on the internet and probably even on the guides of the Steam community but i still find it pretty dumb that EA Games has never fixed it and that's why it's a negative point.
- Optimization is bad, like every ""The Sims"" games, the game will run fine even on an old computer but except it to take time to load everything, the game being a 32bit game doesn't help at all.
- Distant textures are bad and it's pretty limited, there are workarounds online to make it better though but it still is a negative because sometimes it feels like a console game because of it.
- Can't go to other Worlds without having to create everything from scratch which is kind of a shame to be honest.


Now i'll go over its positive points quickly.

- Open world, you can now move your sims freely in the World which is a biggest plus for me, it's pretty cool.
- World Editor, you can download the World Editor online, unlike the SIms 2 which uses Sim City 4 as a World creator, the Sims has none (which would have been pretty great to be honest) so neither the fourth so that's why i'm putting this as a positive point.
- Lot of content once you got everything.
- Expansions are pretty cool except for the crappy Katy Perry stuff.
- Lot of things to do, lot of new content for the ""The Sims"" and ""The Sims 2"" players.


Honestly, it's the best Sims to date in my opinion but the Sims and the Sims 2 are still worth playing even today but once again, that is my own opinion, the Sims has that something that makes it so good while the Sims 2 has the already existing families and locations which are pretty cool too.
Forget about the Sims 4, it's not worth it, it's just not worth nor your money nor your time, it feels like a mobile game and a downgrade from the previous games, and a big one while at it.

(Though I 110% recommend for you to wait till the DLCs go on sale because $20 for just one is WAY, WAY too much!!!)

Though, there are some bugs that I doubt will ever be fixed, most don't break your game. (As long as you have the equipment to correctly play the game.) The only real bugs I found that I had any huge issue with is:

1. The loading screens take a while and it can be a bit annoying at times (But I also have 5 or 6 DLCs so that may be my issue)

2. When on the house building screens I get a bit of lag when I'm building for any longer than 30 minutes.  

3. Occasionally when I jump between buy mode and live mode the game will freeze for a short moment, which at times causes me to get concerned because the game has crashed because of this once or twice. 

4. The constant ""Hey you can get this to add to your game if you pay money"" is annoying and I really wish there was a way to turn it off.

Besides those, I've had very few problems, and any other problems I've come across have been hilarious, such as my toddler sims suddenly flying around the house when they move or my sim standing straight up while riding her horse. But besides that, I've haven't had many issues with the game.

Its very time consuming and great for those who love multitasking. Characters can be silly to look a like to your real life self. Its nice to have a game where you can live out a dream life, with just a click.

Pros:
+The vast ideas of what a character could look like.
+The DLCs, add more to the game when applied.
+Building a home from scratch is fantanstic with the tools they provide for you.
+You can download other player made sims, to give yourself the friends that also play.
+You can make a story by creating and being whatever you like.
+Finally got to have a loving family.

Cons:
-You have to buy DLCs in order to get the real good stuff.
-Paranoid with teaching my children to swim, (I TOLD HER NOT TO GO IN THE POOL)
-The big one, is there is no multiplayer...(I know it wouldn't happen, but it would be cool to be able to buy a sim server and host people from around the world to go into your world and live there too. But guess thats reaching for the moon)
-If you own a DLC then purchase a new one, it tends to bug the previous DLCs, had to redownload a few times, so the pets would stop being invisible, really annoying when you have a pet and its yelling at you that its sad or lonely and you can't see it to help. ; -;

As someone who also played The Sims including a few expansions I am rather dissapointed with The Sims 3.

Apart from the marketing of extra content in the launcher and in game the game becomes more and more of a drag the more expnsions you use.

Want to take a new job on an old map, better be prepared to make some time consuming and annoying map changes to your town. 
What bothers me the most is that they were not able to improve the interactions between Sims. They still block each other and sometimes take ages to start new activities.

For example my last game ended the very moment my character was married and bought a bigger house. Not even a really big place, but middle sized. And the game started to freeze every few seconds. Totally unplayable. The game before that (with a different PC and Windows version) ended when my character moved to a different town. It ran well for a few minutes and then started that same freezing problem. Using certain console commands I was able to get it working for a few minutes and then the problem was back. It was not fun anymore.

Apparently there are utilities that try to alleviate these problems but I haven't tried them yet. I have heard that they may help a bit, but are not a perfect solution.

I would think paying around £400 for a game plus all its DLC would be completely outrageous at the best of times, but this game is 9 years old! It's an utter joke that EA believe it's an acceptable price especially considering the main reason for my outrage;
Bugs, game-breaking bugs. 
The Sims 2 was relatively stable, most people were able to play with the game heavily modded without issue, this game however has many people (including myself) experiencing game-breaking bugs with completely unmodded saves.
The two issues I've had was getting stuck on loading screens, which I spent a full day trying to fix (where I discovered this is an extremely common problem, and there are dozens of posts around the web from people with this issue) before realizing that oddly, the loading screens work fine if the game is minimized, so I went on with my game for a while.
Then out of nowhere, I attempted to load my game yesterday and recieved the error message  ""A serious error has occurred. It is recommended that you restart the application"", despite what the message implies restarting the game does nothing.
So I went to search for a solution online (where I once again discovered this is an incredably common error, so much so it has it's own page on the simswiki) however this time I was unable to fix the problem, I spent all of yesterday and the first half of today trying every solution presented online, none of which worked (which didn't surprise me since most people on the various forums about this issue found no success with them either) meaning the only real solution is the delete the corrupt save file. Then what? Start a new game and hope the same thing doesn't occur after pouring many hours into another save?
Honestly I actually wish the error had appeared SOONER, then I might have a leg to stand on while asking for a refund.
I mean ffs, I only brought a fraction of all of the DLC but the cost still totalled £155!!
I spent £155 on a game that can corrupt your save out of nowhere!?

There's also annoying microtransaction pop-ups during build mode which I am not sure can be disabled, but what more can you expect from a game published by EA?
On an unrelated note, I came to buy this game after being very dissatisfied after playing the Sims 4, and the Sims 3 is LEAGUES better because there's just more depth and challenge to gameplay and way more pros that outweigh 4's gimmicky new features.

23,41728415,english,"The Sims 3 is a sandbox game.  If you like to set up scenarios and see how they play out, you will find few games that offer you the power and flexibility that this game gives you.  The Sims series attempts to simulate ""real life"", especially the interactions between people.

There is a tremendous amount of content available via DLCs and the user community.  Good instructional videos and reviews are plentiful.

Though this game is old, the graphics are surprisingly timeless.  It may be that you adjust to attune to the style of the game.

The Sims 3 is the last game in the series that features a relatively large open world.  The Sims 4 uses 3 to 5 house neighborhoods.  This has a significant affect on the gameplay.

While there is a great deal of criticism for the number of DLCs (and especially for the prices), significant discounts are frequently available.  If you load up during one of these sales, I believe you will be happy with the value.  Though the stuff packs generally provide marginal benefits, most of the expansions significantly increase gameplay.  The full set is particularly impressive.

The game runs smoothly on my system, even with all the DLC.  There is a known performance issue with the Island Paradise map.  It can resolved via mods.

27,39243256,english,"***THE GOOD***
---EVOLUTION OF THE SIMS SERIES: Sims 3 is everything that was awesome about the Sims 1 and 2 and dialed-up a few more notches with some awesome new stuff tossed in for good measure. Sims 3 isn't just more of the same, it's building on the foundation set by its predecessors and does an amazing job of it.
---REPLAYABILITY: The Sims series, generally, has infinite replayability. In essence, unless you're just messing about with drowning your sims or something like that, the challenge of the Sims games is to create a family and see how many generations you can keep it going. It seems like a fairly straightforward goal but there's lots of stuff to do along the way and a whole bunch of ways you can go about doing it. I've, personally, gone 3 or 4 generations in one save file and not had to replay content because there's so much in this game that you can do!
---REFERENCES: Sims games are packed full of clever references to pop culture. For example, if your Sim works as a doctor at the hospital, you might get an event that references the hit medical drama 'House, M.D.' and there are some fantastic Godfather references in the criminal career path. As a gamer that seriously appreciates clever use of references, this is a definate plus!
---VIRTUALLY UNLIMITED CREATIVE FREEDOM: Besides clothing and hairstyles, which are fairly limited without purchasing the DLCs (not so limited that you'll find yourself saying ""really, game?"" but noticable nonetheless), the Sims 3 gives you a world, some characters and a plot of land and tells you to go nuts. If you've got the Simoleons, you can build pretty much anything. Castles, big sprawling mansions, elegant cabins, dark horrifying dungeon house, etc, etc, etc. The list goes on and on. The character creator in Sims 3 is shockingly in-depth for a game of its age since it gives you the freedom to create just about any size and shape person you like. You can make some seriously deformed individuals if you've got the mind for it.
---A LOT OF WAYS TO GET KILLED: There are a LOT of ways to die in this game. I'm not certain exactly how many ways Sims can die in Sims 3 but here are some that I've encountered (not an exhaustive list, by any means):
   1.) Immolation
   2.) Electrocution
   3.) Struck by freaking lightning (with Seasons DLC)
   4.) Starvation
   5.) Drowning
   6.) Time Anomaly (with Into the Future DLC)
   7.) Old Age
   8.) Hit by a meteor
   9.) Death by ranting
   10.) Eaten by a shark (with Island Paradise DLC)
   11.) Flew too high with a jetpack and fell to your death (with Into the Future DLC)
---YOU CAN GET META: Now, in case you're not aware, when you create a new save file in Sims 3, you create a new town. Thus, if you have 3 different saves, you've got 3 copies of that town, the only difference being the family you've decided to create and play with. Now, you CAN, if you want to, have multiple families running on the same save file in the same town. Of course, you can only control one at a time but it presents an interesting opportunity for you to really go nuts and make the town into anything you want it to be!
---CHARM OUT THE WAZOO: Lots of stuff in the Sims games is total unexplained nonsense. The language, the currency, the fact that you age so darn fast compared to real life, the fact that you can set it so you can't age at all, the inexplicable cultural significance of llamas, and teleporting lawn gnomes. But, as rediculous as all of that is, it grows on you. The Sims 3 is a really charming game.
---YOU CAN HAVE CHILDREN WITH THE GRIM REAPER (IF YOU'RE WILLING TO KILL A WHOLE BUNCH OF PEOPLE): This is hard to do without using the developer console but here goes. If a Sim dies, the Grim Reaper comes to collect their soul. If you're quick enough, you can strike-up a conversation with Grim before he departs. He doesn't stick around long enough to befriend him though but if enough Sims die, he'll come back frequently enough that you can start a relationship with him, Woo Hoo (sex) with him, and have reaper babies. Hard to do without the console (with the console, btw, shift-click on Grim and select 'add to household' and he'll become playable. Note that this has been reported to be gamebreaking but, hey, it's your choice).

***THE BAD***
---DLC DLC EVERYWHERE!: Sims 3 has a metric tonne of DLC; all of it WAY overpriced. The fact that there is SO much content available in those DLCs makes them tempting to buy but trust the Steam reviewers who say that they're only really worth it if you can, somehow, manage to snag the base-game or, better yet, the DLC itself, on sale.
---IN-GAME INCENTIVES TO BUY THE DLC: They aren't everywhere but when you're browsing the more creative menus in the game, you'll see lots of banners and ""you could have this"" or ""all this could be yours for the price of..."" style blurbs trying to tempt you into buying DLC packs. Intrusive and annoying but, honestly, not a deal breaker for me.
---MONEY: Now, I'm going to preface this by saying that this is probably just my experience with the game. However, I found that money, and my lackthereof, in-game is scarse unless you get work. Though, I think, there should be an option to begin the game with an inheritance or something, there isn't. So, I find myself using the old 'familyfunds family name #' console command a lot to finance the dream mansions I like to build. Underhanded? Mmhmm, but I don't regret it. There's a reason everybody talks fondly about the money cheat in the Sims community. (Press CTRL+SHIFT+C on main menu and type testingcheatsenabled true and hit enter to enable cheats, by the way. Use CTRL+SHIFT+C to open the console in-game from the on.)
---MANAGEMENT HEAVY: If you're not the kind of gamer who enjoys such games as Roller Coaster Tycoon, Sim City, or other such games that require a degree of skill with micromanagement, you probably won't enjoy the Sims 3 either. As fantastic as the Sims 3 is, there are times when it feels like all you're doing when you're not designing, buying, or building things for your sims is making sure they don't die because of their own ignorance. I get that this is intended to be part of the game's charm (and, I admit, I do find it charming that the sims themselves can behave in very bizare ways), it can get tiresome. This isn't a game I think you can play all-day, it's best enjoyed in short, 2ish hour play sessions once in a while. Otherwise, you might burn yourself out on it.

***VERDICT***
Solid 8/10 for me. If you've got $20 (or your regional equivalent) to spare and you're looking for a neat game that you can sink a few hours into here and there, pick-up the Sims 3. It can seem dated at times but it's better than the Sims 4 in literally every measurable respect.",1515626724,1524852675,True,0,0,0,3,True,False,False,76561198042596615,83,21,30723,20,12414.0,1601319643

36,41652632,english,"The Sims has always been a series held close to my heart, but this edition has to be my favorite. There are so many details that make each minute fun and intriguing, even with the occasional glitches, which, in my opinion, are kinda funny anyways. I will advise, however, that you not buy anything, the game, the DLC, anything, until it is on sale. I managed to get all the DLC (minus the Stuff packs) for no more than 60 bucks in all. Definitely wait for things like the Winter sale or something similar.

Also, here's a quick list of all the non-Stuff Pack DLCs so you don't have to dig through all of them:
 - Late Night
 - Ambitions
 - World Adventures
 - Generations
 - Pets
 - Seasons
 - Supernatural
 - Showtime
 - University Life
 - Island Paradise
 - Into the Future

Although, honestly, you can just look at the name and see easily which is which. Just look for stuff that doesnt say ""Stuff"" in the name.

Personally, I like this game better than the sequel, Sims 4, mostly because 4 has a lot more unnecessary bells and whistles, as well as it being basically incomplete in an attempt to make people buy DLC. There is a DLC for getting a job. Honestly.

The game itself is full of a lot of interesting quirks, especially once all the content DLC is added. Crazy stuff like aliens coming from space and falling in love with your family robot, or your friendly neighborhood vampire forming the unfortunate habit of going on the balcony every day to play guitar. There's a lot of crazy stuff, which makes discovering new things all the more fun and entertaining.

The only issue I encountered is the free downloadable community maps you can get from the site, they were good and all but some of the houses were straight up locked (No gates and the fence/walls just locks all the sim(s) inside the neighborhood houses). Legacy Island III is probably the best IMO and I recommend downloading it if you want to add more content and stuff to do in the game.

51,41569380,english,"One of the best Sim games out there. While I wasn't really into this type of game for the Sims 1 & 2, I have played them and prefer 3 over both and 4.

The amount of hours I've put into this game over my life is more than I'd like to mention, and lord knows how much time I'll sink into it now that I have it on steam. It cam be incredibly boring if you only do the surface level tasks; get a job, find a spouse, make love, have baby and do it all over again. Once you start to diverging from that, it becomes incredibly addictng. You could also just murder the entire town by inviting them over for a party and deleting the doors so you can watch them all slowly starve to death. Your choice.

It gets a lot of shit for the price of the DLC, but I'll give you a bit of advice:
Buy Ambitions - expands job and work life opportunities
Buy Generations - expands what each generation goes through in life
Those are the only two that I think would be worth it to everyone considering they not only add loads of content, but also expand upon a lot of lacking areas in the base game. The rest of the DLC can be skipped without fear of mising out on much. I will list the DLC that can be worth buying if you're interested in the subject, though:
Pets - I like this expansion, but not everyone enjoys the added responsability (and annoyance)
University - I don't much care for it, but others seem to love it. Seems pointless in my eyes. It takes forever to put your sims through it and you don't really gain much.
Seasons - Love the idea as a weather fanatic, but performance suffers and it's not uncommon for weather to ruin a lot of the game for most of your sim's life when on default. I've had kids who get Fs in school because they only went one day and the rest of the childhood phase were snow days so the school was pissed at their attendance.

The rest of the DLC is so topical and specific that you'll know if you want it or not. Be warned, some of it (like supernatural,) can really mess with the delicate balance of being a life sim and pretty much all challenge can be lost. Also with a lot of the DLC and store content your sims have an unusal focus on it. Like the store's ice cream maker and deep frier. You can have a house full of millions worth of futuristic entertainment but your sims will still spend all damn day cooking deep fried chocolate ice cream. Households full of 8 sims will likely have a que for the fucking things.

And seriously, DO NOT INSTALL ALL OF THE DLC! I see people do this all the time when they torrent the game or get it from a friend or just buy all of it because they think they'll be missing out. It will be next to unplayable, especially on an older computer. They're released the way they are so you can pick and choose what content you'd like in your game. Having all of it will tank your fps even on a high end machine and cause your sims to be so confused and bipolar that you won't be able to keep up with them. They'll go from casting magic spells to having issues with hormones to fawning over a cute dog to filling out university surveys to pissing themselves because they're so busy.
Install the two I mentioned and pick and chose what you think you'd enjoy in your game. Trust me, they're more than enough to see in every expansion pack.

Despite all the DLC, the base game itself is still very much worth it. It feels basic, but it still very fun. Think of the DLC as adding on your favorite spices and sauces to an already nicely cooked meal. They're not needed, but give it the personal touch it needs to shine.",1524137020,1524137020,True,1,1,0.507462680339813232,0,True,False,False,76561198379224647,25,7,5304,0,529.0,1526542565

As for the Sims... i had a lot of fun with it... maybe more than Hitman.

Now, to choose in between a very advanced life simulation game and a game where you can be a badass emotionless bald assassin who must use stealth as his philosophy... i chose this one since this one has more content than the Hitman one... and also cuz i got a last minute advice from some guy who played it until the end.

Granted Sims 4's packs have added gameplay features that it's prededecessors haven't seen.  However, The Sims 3 was missing little refinements a heavily expanded Sims 2 had that made migrating to the new season a reluctant transition...  Three packs later, The Sims 3 came into it's own and became a worthwhile step up from that point on.
The Sims 3 takes everything that made it's predecessors the engaging hit franchise it had become and brought your Sims experience into a seemless open world, leaving lot loading along with the entire world aging together even for a more realistic and immersive experience.  With one of the more recent expansions, Island Paradise you can have your sims live and traverse a life that invokes TV shows like Magnum PI.  Between the content available from the packs and the modding community, The Sims 3 is worth getting if you want a rich experience within this franchise.

If you're going to get into The Sims, buying the The Sims 3 (fully expanded/boosted) here on Steam is the only way to go, as Origin can be a nightmare during installations/reinstallations with missing product keys you have chase EA up for.  Again to bash EA Origin, but NOBODY does a sale quite like Steam - This one such game you should only get when the big sales roll around!
As for Macintosh users...  Because of how EA handled the porting, this game is an unstable mess and I would recommend buying The Sims 2 Super Collection (App Store) for the next best thing if you're looking to get the best experience at the best price - Otherwise if money is no object, I suppose you could go all-out and spend half a grand or more on The Sims 4 and all available packs.

Now aside from gameplay issues (glitches, quality of life aspects lacking, etc), there's still a pretty big issue with buying this game: it simply won't run. 
It's not just a problem I've had, my sister tried to buy and run it, and encountered the same thing.

Spent 2 hours trying to figure it out with various online guides, messing with advanced system computer settings, etc, no luck. 

This game is dated, and while fun for its time, probably not worth YOUR time and stress. Do yourself a favor and get sims4 if you're going to spend the money.

when i first opened the sims 3, i instantly noticed the difference in graphics and how annoying the opening scenes were. the resolution was stretched and the game ran a whole lot slower than the sims 4. but once i got into the game, do you think that i cared? no. i spent ages creating my sim and her house. as well as her pet.

i did buy the sims 3 game on sale, and i did buy all of my expansions on sale. asking 20 dollars per expansion is a very ea thing to do, and its a waste of money, no matter how good the expansion may be. i bought the game around the lunar new year sale of this year, and ive been playing it practically since then.

I played for 8 hours straight in the first 8 hours that I owned it. 

This game is beautifully created, and it runs completely fine on my 2010 model WIndows laptop. You can create your own town in this game, and it's really fun to experiment with a different amount of Sims living together, and you can also, in a way, create your own stories with it.

98,40467463,english,"I don't know why I like simulating regular human life so much but no other game has really tried.
I played The Sims 1 and 2 for 1000s of hours when I was young and I've tried 4 for 100 hours.
What impresses me the most about the franchise is the AI and the sheer level/amount of code running in a busy neighbourhood playing 8 sims + pets in an enormous cluttered house including sped up time and a fully free camera.
In #4 they shrunk the map and chopped it up with loading pages so it could later be released on consoles. The Sims 3 is PC dedicated.
I've become so efficient at scaling an 8 person family into epic riches that I now prefer making my sims live homeless or in squalor. I love using the texture customization tool on furniture and decor to make piles of decrepid junk and virtual filth. As far as their personality, I'm much more interested in making crazy/evil sims with as many disorders and phobias as possible.
When building I find myself making bomb shelters, vaults and torture chambers 40 feet underground with a camouflaged entrance and security checkpoints at each floor.
Once in a while I will just build -or buy then upgrade- an elaborate dream home and max out every skill while chasing ambition points, but it's simply not as fun, realistic, or memorable than simulating terrible/bizarre lives. 
I have most of the DLC but just let me tell you that vampires, fame and magic can pull you out of the realism quickly. Furniture and Clothes packs aren't worth it. I recommend just a couple of your favorite large expansions and they'll come with plenty of new assets.
I would never buy sim points either.
Thanks Maxis for all the simulation! There have been rough patches, cheesy marketing gimmicks and times I thought the bugs had ruined it all, but I will always recommend The Sims because summing it all up, I've just had too much fun not to.

Pros:
+ Oh, my, the sandbox. In this game, you can do ANYTHING. And by anything I mean ANYTHING. It's kinda like a realistic Garry's Mod. This is my first experience: here's your sim, here's a city, bye-bye now! In this game you can go to the dance party... as Lenin! And call Stalin on a dance-off! Yeah, man, now we're talking!
+ Open world. You can go anywhere you want. No restrictions. Want to read a book? Go to the library! Want to workout a little? Go, go to the gym! And you know the best part? No loading screens. Magnificent!
+ Doesn't get repetitive. Sure, you might say: ""But you should manage your sim's needs!"" Well, yeah, that's true. But the whole management process and ways of fullfilling even the basic needs are anything but repetitive. Sure, you can live a boring life of ""eat, sleep, urinate,"" LOL, but that's not the point of the game. You must fullfill needs [i] at the right time [/i] and [i] in the right place [/i]. These actions don't take long. They're blazing fast unlike, say, in fucking WoW. If the action is extremely slow you can speed up the game or plan your next actions. And the amount of actions is INSANE!
+ Speaking of planning. No, it's not just a virtual dollhouse. It's a down right RTS merged with an architect sim and RPG. You have needs to manage, goals to achieve, actions to plan, skills to level up, friends to get, lots and cities to build and money to spend. Planning, planning and planning again. That's why Sims 3 is not Garry's Mod. And that's why it's so unique.
+ CAS. Yeah, it's not [i] that [/i] cool as The Sims 4's CAS but it has a Create-a-Style and still better that TS4's CAS in some areas. And it's functional. The Exchange proves it.
+ Story progression. When you're doing your business, city's inhabitants live their own lifes. They age, have kids, steal an ice cream truck and die in a horrible pain on fire. And if you download Story Progression mod, the sims' life becomes even more varied.
+ Did I mention mods? It has lots of them. They're awesome.
+ Build mode is well thought-out. So many options to choose from. You can make the house of your dreams. Or horrors if you want to turn your sim's life into nightmare, you monster.
+ 14 floors! 14 fucking floors!
+ Over 100 ways to kill a man without getting your sim's hands dirty.
+ Kids turturing, yeah! 😃
+ Traits! These things affect how your sim behaves. There are lots of them!

Cons:
- If you have uncompatible mods/too much mods/bad weather outside/too much stuff in your room/God knows what else the game will go NUTS! I stopped experiencing issues after a third clean reinstall and presetting the lifespan before installing mods but God knows maybe I'll have more. Or you'll have more.
- Game lags frequently. Probably because of so much stuff to compute.
- Loading times. They're ASS! FUCKING BLOODY ASS! EXTREMELY long, IRRITATING AS FUCK! But you can deal with that.
- There's A TON OF DLCs. To buy all of the Store items you probably need to sell your house. Thankfully, DLCs are sometimes sold with a 75% discount making the base game with all the DLCs cosl like your regular AAA game (THANK GOODNESS).
- These DLCs increase the loading times [i] even more [/i]. Oh, the horror.

The self automony is pretty good, sims will keep their levels in check and based on what traits you assign they'll keep their surroundings in order. I just wish they payed their own bills and repaired stuff as it breaks. Minor inconvience, but I guess you can't get everything.

Visual wise, graphics still hold up, everything looks visually pleasing. I was able to set the game on my monitors native resolution of 1440p and 144hz refresh rate. Great!

Also the music in the game is good with a variety of tracks to pick from. Usually with games that have music, you end up turning it off. I haven't done that with the Sims 3. 

So yeah pick it up, it's a nice stress reliever, just make sure it's on sale first. That's my recommendation. Don't buy it if it's not on sale though. 20 USD per expansion pack is silly especially being how old of a game it is.

54,40133579,english,"I had The Sims 3 for years but lost it a while ago, so I decided to purchase it on Steam. I had The Sims 3 and The Sims 4, and honestly in my opinion, The Sims 3 is much more fun than The Sims 4. The Sims 3 has an open world, a bigger world, more things to do and you can have hours of fun with just the base game. Though on The Sims 4, the worlds are small, many loading screens, no open world and there were things pulled from the base game and were put into expansion packs just to get money out of you. If you want more of a realistic expierence, The Sims 4 will give it to you. But if you are wishing for more exciting gameplay, The Sims 3 is for you.

The Sims 3 has some bugs here and there, and the loading screens take FOREVER! The game takes even longer to load when you purchase expansion packs. The Sims 3 base game gets somewhat bland if you get hooked because there isn't much to it after a while, that is why there are so many expansion packs, to earn money more and more. I recommend getting the base game and expansion packs on sale only because there is too little to do for the amount of money they cost. Expansion packs will spice up your gameplay though, so if you aren't sure you like The Sims 3, get one or two packs to start with or just start with the base game. Don't buy the ""stuff"" packs unless you really, really love the game.

The Sims 4 is boring, too little and way too expensive! $40 just for the base game, and it's not even the ""deluxe"" version, and that's not including all the expansion packs that they are adding. And these expansion packs include stuff that are from The Sims 3 base game! Yes, the game looks more realistic but The Sims 3 has more things to do and it is just more exciting overall. Don't let the age of The Sims 3 stop you, it's so much better and you'll get hooked right from the start.

You can start relationships, friendships, families, build your own home, go to work, hang out with friends, explore different locations and basically live your dream life, but virtually. You can almost do whatever you want with your Sims! I recommend The Sims 3 all the way, you totally need to buy it, but only on sale. It is not worth the $20 price. Thank you,

Despite having a laptop that just barely meets its minimum requitements, I can run Sims 4 with almost all of its expansions and game packs installed. Sure, it lags at faster speeds, but I'm fine with that. On the other hand, I tried to change the wallpaper in my Sims 3 house and it nearly overheated my computer... that's not okay. I knew Sims 3 had performance and optimization issues, but I didn't realize it would be that bad...

The open world is kind of neat, but I found CAS and Build/Buy Mode to be rather limited as far as variety go. I did really like the wishes/lifetime achievement system, it had more ""weight"" than the whims/reward traits in Sims 4, I guess (and just having more traits in general was nice, which is one of my biggest gripes with Sims 4). Unfortunately, due to the aforementioned performance issues, I wasn't able to delve too much deeper into the gameplay.

Maybe when I upgrade to a better computer, I might try out Sims 3 again (the fact that I would need to upgrade to play a ten year old game seems rather silly).

Sims 3 took some getting used to (after sims 2) but it is by far my most favorite in the series. The vast choices you have in both gameplay and design wise are absolutely satisfying. 
I just love designing/building houses and put a lot of hours and effort into them, a new project can keep me busy for days at an end and then I haven't even started raising my family yet! 
All the (free) CC avaible for this game next to all the official DLC will just add to all the fun and create a new experience. 


Granted that after all these years it's not worth it to buy it for full price but when on sale I most def. recommend this game for everyone who loves to design, be creative relax and play around in life. Also sometimes you need a little bit of patience. as there will come bugs around with your installs if unlucky (like me) but 9/10 of the problems are solvable by just reading up on tips on the webzzz and taking the time to apply it to your own game instead of just re installing it. 
Best EA game IMO.

And hey, if you ever need help with an issue or are looking for someone to share your experience/builds/family with feel free to add me!

86,39926638,english,"This game is actually a pretty great game. However, since it's an EA game, there's nothing much to expect from the developers towards a game that is almost 10 years old. The EP's are extremely overpriced, and I'm just gonna mention that I don't have any of them, or the stuff packs either. I believe that the things you get in the EP's are simply things that should've been included in the base game, like Seasons, University life, etc. I recommend picking this game up on a sale, it normal goes on for around $5, I think. Just know that it is the most neglected Sims game, but I still prefer it more than 2 & 4. If you plan on playing it, I highly suggest that you download Nraas mods, especially Overwatch, ErrorTrap and MasterController, since they help run your game much easier. If you want to also be reminded to save your game once in a while, download Nraas saver, I think the deafult is 30 minutes real-time. Before you download any mods just make sure you know how to download CC (custom content), and make sure that you know the basics. Your cc folder should have three files in it, packages, overrides, resource.cfg. You can download the frameworksetup file from the internet, specifically from a website called Mod the Sims. After that, just rename it to ""Mods"" and you should move it to documents > Electronic Arts > Sims 3. That's it. CC is great, and it allows you to get so many cool stuff in the game such as clothes, hairs, skins and all that. You can also download custom worlds, houses, etc. one of the most well-known websites for CC is The Sims Resource, and it has a lot of things for you to download, just make sure you download stuff mainly from featured artists, since a lot of CC can be bugged when you get it into the game.

Just be ready, and understand that this is an EA game, so it's broken with no support from the devs.  Luckily, there are mods that minimize almost all of the game-breaking issues.  If you do plan on getting this, I suggest that you also get mods from NRaas to help protect your saves, and generally fix problems that this game can cause.  A few mods that you need to start off with would include:  Master Controller, Error Trap, and Overwatch.  Also, stay away from the Exchange on the Sims 3 website.  They will cause issues if the files have corrupted files embedded in them.  And, loook at all of the dlc!  The game runs better with a few of the EP's installed.  If you want more, expect the game to slow down.  And look at those prices!  Wait until they go in sale!  They normally go for around $5 U.S.  If you have any questions about bugs, glitches, or other game problems, google them to find 10 years worth of community forums.  The community on here is pretty decent as well.  With plenty of people willing to help you out if you have issues or just general questions!

Sims 3 is A very good game w/ most of the expansion packs. If your low on cash don't bother buying until a sale. (You'll save a lot more money that way) The Base game is very empty without some DLC. (Most of the DLC should of been in the base game IMO, but EA are a bunch of money hungry bastards...)

I reccomend Generations, Pets, and Seasons, they are a necessity in my book.

There is also a pretty active modding community. You'll have no trouble finding more content to give your sims. Just remember, the more Custom content you add, the longer the loading times.

I'd also like to note the longer you play sims 3 on a save game, the more unstable it gets. I reccomend downloading the NRAAS Overwatch Mod ASAP.

After buying most of the expansions pack and putting in well over 100 hours into the game I have to edit my review.

- The gameplay is very fun, there are many things to do and many challenges to attempt if you are bored
- Many custom made maps, houses, characters, hair, clothes, etc.
- The graphics are not nesicarily bad, while sims 4 does have better, the graphics are actually still quite good, and for a game with this theme, amazing graphics are not needed.
- The music is ok, but the game is more fun with your own music, or perhaps chatting with people while playing.
- The game is best bought on sale, but still worth 20 dollars.

[b] Cons[/b]
- Certain DLC, are very expensive! Only a few are actually worth the money, and almost all should be bought on sale, or even better they should just be put on lower prices.
- Sims 4 does improve on lots of things that Sims 3 didnt have, but overall they're quite the same.

ahhh, the Sims. the love of my life and the bane of my existence. ive sunk nearly 700 hours into this game, and have hundreds more logged into the XBox version back when i was younger as Desperate. what's to say about this game? well, for starters, it's way better than Sims 4, so jot that down. Sims 4 may have the graphics, updated animations, and looks, but Sims 3 has all the charm, customization, versatility, and open world. Sims 3 has long loading times, but you only ever get one big loading screen for a whole world, as opposed to a gajillion small loading screens.

i've been in love with the Sims series for a long time. i'm a sucker for character customization in games, and Sims 3 is basically ""Character Customization: The Game"". I guarantee at least 50 of my gameplay hours are JUST me making tweaks to my Sims. and, indeed, making Sims is almost an art form. as you play the game and get a better feel for what looks good and doesnt, youll find yourself going back to update old looks.

i will say though, the vanilla base is fun to play and versatile on its own, owning the right expansion pack is what kicks it up a notch from good to great. i personally recommend Supernatural for Baby's First Expansion Pack, if youre into vampire husbands and occassional zombie infestions paired with a lovely gothic aesthetic and chairs wearing corsets for some reason. if that doesn't appeal to you, try Into The Future, for all your solarpunk desires, weird hairdos, bizarre picasso clothes, and expansive questline needs. Pets is another popular expansion, but i would not make it your first, personally, as the pets are a bit buggy. unless, of course, you like when mr fluffles turns into an extended slenderman polygon abomination. i own Pets and it's good fun, but it adds another layer of micromanagement i often forget to bother with (oops).

pros of game:
+character creation
+character creation
+character creation
+can make a self insert and have them date your fave fictional character
+make a hideous goblin and breed it until it has pretty babies
+the modding scene is huge, active, and full of fun stuff to install (caveat: always back up your game. a wonky mod can cause pretty nasty side effects)
+the micromanaging is super friendly to control freaks like me. pause and fast forward whenever you like!
+character creation
+healthcare is free, accidental pregnancy isnt a thing, there's no racism or misogyny, life is good
+the expansion packs only add more layers of fun gameplay and quest lines

cons of game:
-microtransactions, anybody?
-still full price for some ungodly reason despite being old as balls and the sequel being out
-expansion packs are also full price
-stuff packs are not worth it. ive waffled on buyng them solely to say i own every expansion but decided against it. some expansion packs are also AWFUL
-seriously the microtransactions in this game
-WHY IS IT STILL FULL PRICE IT'S BEEN YEARS, EA
-if you hate micromanagement, you will hate this game
-game is HUGE, will eat all your disk space and CPU, and has the nerve to ask for more
-i run this on a (decent but not gaming oriented) laptop, so maybe this is just my computer being a stupidhead, but it still chugs on me on the lowest settings, so be warned
-the character customization can be overwhelming for a new user

i recommend this game to:
+people who love roleplaying
+people who love micromanagement
+people who LOVE character customization
+people who enjoy silly games without much violence or conflict
+people who love messing around and doing dumb stuff like recreating shrek but with the Sims

stay away from this game if:
-microtransactions are a deal breaker for you
-you hate micromanaging
-you don't care for character customization
-your computer overheats easily
-you crave action, conflict, and fast-paced stories. the stories in Sims 3 affect me about as much as a gentle breeze, and im the emotional sort

Tl;Dr
A good game, has good and bad aspects, but personally i would get it on sale because why the shint is this game still full price

Without third party mods this game is a downward spiral of bugs that will start caving in on itself after about 30 hours of gameplay. Meanwhile the developer still tries to sell this title at a premium price and continues to push on-line content in your face while playing.

23,39105174,english,"How to make broken game title EA Games Dev diary: 

1st: Ripp off whole previous title.
2nd: Add some minor features into content you ripped off. 
3rd: Wonder why the fu it keeps crashing so hard, since it is ripp off with new features which collide with each other.
4th: After long hours of fixing and seeing it goes nowhere just give up.
5th: Give up with this title since this ripp off from The Sims 2 has too many collisions and just start making The Sims 4 with new engine, because now you know that ripping off old textures and codes and trying to make them work with new ones aint very wise.
....
Too many bugs, too many crashes, too many problems. They gave up fixing this game and rather made The Sims 4, because it was easier. 

Is this game unplayable? Nope. You can play it, but before you buy lots of DLCs like stupid 8===D (like me) here is a way how to make it work:
1. Dont buy many DLCs - they will collide. Lot of community members suggest to buy only 2-3 DLCs. Less DLCs = Less problems. 

2. Dont buy DLC: Island Paradise - the most unfinished one - bugs, freezes and crashes. Need community patch to only play it, but still it is not working correctly. 

3. Google: NRAAS mods for The Sims 3 especially these otherwise you will have hard times to play this game.

    A) NRAAS Master Controller - allows you safer interaction - like dont use wardrobe or mirror to change appearance - it can cause scripting error of your sims which might result it many crashes of game. With this tool you can customize them again and again and much safer + it has lots of very usefull features (like removing fame level from celebrity sims which later becomes troublesome). 

    B) NRAAS Overwatch - deletes non-used cars and turns off TVs and Radios in non-active families. Reset stucked sims and pets (very useful!). This way it removes frame lags which would happened without this mod. 
    C) NRAAS ErrorTrap - fixing gamebreaking bugs. 

    D) NRAAS Traffic - allows you to set 0 celebrities limo - once you get your own limo - game starts spawning them to you and it will cause frame freezing and crashes. Not with this mod. You still can have limo from your carrier, just those celebrity ones are buggy. 

    E) NRAAS Woohooer (not-compulsory) - this mod allows much more sex in game + it fixes dialogues options (in vanilla game if you ask about age, sign or job - you are flirting.....this mod marks these and similar dialogues into friendly actions, not flirts),

   F) NRAAS Decensor - allows you to downsize or fully remove censoring. Nothing to get pumped about, since chars are like barbies and kens - details are missing. Good only if you dont want censoring crystal big as your whole bathroom.

   G) NRAAS Story Progression  (voluntary) - this one makes your city more alive, with more living citizens who are actually doing something - they are getting married, changing work positions, buying stuff. CAREFUL: this mod requires high end pc since it is really demanding. SUGGESTION: Never use this mod in University, World Adventures - China, Egypt, France. Use it only with your home towns. Because if you use it on university - students sims are starting to look for jobs instead of studying and will try to live like normal cities but it isnt allows on university and it will cause some troubles (not with performance) like nobody will graduate etc.

- you can travel to other parts of the world if you buy the world adventures expansion pack!
- you can actually travel freely in you town!
- building and running a resort is always fun!
- you can build your sims up by getting them into their dream jobs and maxing out their skills!
- making a whole town one massive family is fun ........
- putting custom sims in your town makes for some good times! 

Cons :
- you only get about 10 % of the game with the base game . the rest is unlocked when you buy the 10 + expansion packs and Stuff packs!
- this game runs VERY POORLY on old systems!
- it can glitch with in compatible content

67,38955077,english,"This game is pretty great, though not without a few bugs which can easily be fixed if you look at google for the said fixes. the game has been out a long time so there are fixes out there.

But in saying that, this game is Quite old and shouldn't be priced so high as old as it is, it shouldn't be $20+ for almost every DLC for it. That is just stupid. >:C 
Especially when the Sims 4 is out and is quite high priced, that should mean the sims 3 should go down in price by quite a bit. but nope. silly EA, has to keep the high price point. least eavery DLC doesn't cost $75 like it used too. 

So you guys should only buy it when it's on sale. It's the only real downside really, other than a few bugs, and if you want to do ""more"" then you need to buy the DLC's. which Sucks, but the only ones you need is Pets, Seasons, Univeristy, and World adventures. Those DLC's are the ones I reccomned the most. It makes the game feel more complete in my opinion. I do like the other DLC's but they aren't needed unless you want more Supernatural feel to it or be more hands on when it comes to jobs or rasing toldders/kids/teens and even be A vampire, werewolf etc.
Oh and if you want surpnatural kind in your game, best to go for ""Supernatural"", cause it inculdes everything from vampire's werewolfs, faires, ghost types, whitches...jelly bean plant.. etc
But not needed. but depends what you want out of the game and your play style. 
But yeah those four DLC's I recommded is a must if you want to play it. :)

So I do recommned this game, just only when sales are on so you get more bang for your buck with this game and its stupidly long list of DLc's and Stuff packs.

Gameplay-Simpler than you may think, but not smooth all the time. See the section on graphics below to find out why. Gameplay Score-7 out of 10.

Items-Plenty of stuff to find, use, wear, and so on. This includes items you can buy from The Sims 3 shop. There are a lot of items you may have to buy from there, so be aware. Items Score-8 out of 10.

Weapons-If you count all the wands your witches can use, then yesh, there are weapons. People have provided guns to download free also...Nice! Weapons Score-8 out of 10.

Ammo-The only form of 'ammunition' is the mana bar all (Or most) Supernatural Sims have. Therefore, it's not enough to warrant an actual score. Ammo Score-N/A.

Armor-The only 'armor' Sims have is their clothes, and they don't offer any protection. Sims don't really need it anyway. Armor Score-N/A.

Plot-With an uncanny ability to create your own plot (or plots) by making use of pictures and videos, the possibilities of having a 'perfect plot' in The Sims 3 are endless! Plot Score-10 out of 10.

Characters-Once again, depending on how many Expansion Packs and/or Stuff Packs you purchased, you can surely create just about any character in The Sims 3. Characters Score-9 out of 10.

Sound-Most of the sounds here are easy on the ears, except maybe for humming a tune or perhaps releasing noxious...Yeah. This is it. Sound Score-7 out of 10.

Music-Like many other games of the 2010's, the music isn't really of the best quality, but some folks may disagree with me on this one. Music Score-4 out of 10.

Graphics-Well, there may be some problems here, as the graphics may result in much lagging or even crashing. Sometimes, I've even had to reset my EA password over this! Not cool. Otherwise, the graphics are nice to stare at. Graphics Score-6 out of 10.

Final Score-The Sims 3 can be a truly great game...If you can afford all or most of the expansion/stuff packs it comes with. And even if you have all those, you'll still have to make additional investments from The Sims 3 Store to make your Sims, their homes, and skills unique in your own way. Final Score-9 out of 10.


Sure, the game and its expansion packs together will cost a lot of money, but if one were to carefully save up a little money every month (Even $25 would be enough) then they could have a near-complete collection in a relatively short frame of time...If one is patient. Yes, the game has its fair share of glitches, but unlike in Skyrim, one can have more pets and more children! Plus, those children and pets can have children of their own once they're old enough. The possibilities are nearly endless in The Sims 3!",1456595476,1514574282,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198042775868,48,17,38191,0,19957,1589429850

The gameplay controls and mechanics were admittedly difficult to get accustomed to and took a few hours to work out, but as soon as I picked up the basics, I understood the game and how everything worked, and so I found the game entertaining to control my own Sim and live a lifestyle.

The custom content - not to be confused with expansion/stuff packs - was a great addition to the game too. Clothing, hair, objects, and many more items could be implemented into your game through the Sims 3 website for free.

One of the most repelling things for me was the sheer amount of DLC the game offered. As EA made this, I should've known better. I refuse to purchase any additional content (minus custom content) as the base game itself is plenty enough and most of the DLC offered are nothing but money grabs which add no value to the game experience in my eyes.

In my time of playing the Sims 3, I rarely experienced any lag or frame stuttering, and kept consistent frames around the hundred mark, while rarely falling below ninety, which is fortunate for me as I play on generally high settings, in particular, the Sims detail, texture detail, and shadows/lighting detail. A note that custom content can [i]severely[/i] impact the performance of the game, but not by much unless you have a few dozen custom content added to your game.

-Because you won't be seeing them again anytime soon with this game.

60,38589510,english,"Pros:
- Sims 3 it's the best one in the franchise.
- It's one of those games that you play 6 hours one weekend, get bored and play another 6 hours with a new family after some weeks.
- The best part for me it's designing and building houses.

Cons:
- Even when the game it's good, if you only buy the vanilla version you feel that there are not a lot of objects or stuff to do. (I was disappointed by the amount of objects/furniture).
- It's really expensive to buy all the DLCs even on sale.

Conclusion
I would recommend to get the vanilla version and try it, if you feel like there's not a lot of stuff and you have the patience, research and install some mods. I wouldn't recommend to buy the DLCs. Get the ""The Sims 3 Plus Showtime"" bundle, it's cheaper than just the game.

There is everything from 
- ""freezing when you try to go to university or otherwise travel"" (always save prior to travelling or enrolling or dropping out, re-load the last save, go to Edit Town, click in the top left corner the university or travel setting, don't do anything in university/travel location and just click ""return to game"" on top of screen, now try to travel again)
- freezing and stuttering when the game gets too big (8 GB RAM and tons of GB hard drive don't matter, it happens at memory footprints of 1-2 GB already) or interactions get hang up somewhere in the world where you aren't even looking
- items getting bugged (you can't remove an object that is in front of the baby crib as the object is considered still in use and your baby is starving to death because you can't step close to the crib because of it -> use a cheat to delete the object, huge bummer if the object is the patterns doll ...)
- corrupted saves which won't let you select your family anymore or members of it or the family trees or name of everyone are messed up (click on edit town, move the family out and move back it or to different house, usually that fixes it as somehow THERE the tree and names etc still exist)
- corrupted people that are invisible now (use a dresser or such to change the outfit to make them visible again)
And yes there are load screens. Lots of them. And it takes sometimes several minutes to load when travelling. But usually that is only the first time or between generations to university. Afterwards it goes much faster.

That being said ... the game is incredible addictive. I've played Sims 1 many years ago. Had Sims 2 but the latter was just a pain on Windows 10 and modern sized screens. I've waited a long time debating if to get Sims 3 as it is a steep price even with sales of 75% off and Sims 4 out already (roughly $100 for the whole Sims 3 pack). Was wondering how much all this money would be worth it. Finally bit the bullet and I don't regret it except these insane game instability and corruption issues that make the manual frequent loading so important - and saving takes 30-60 seconds at least. But there is so many new features and things to do and explore that makes we be in awe for the complexity of this game. You can now play a career as architect where you get paid to remodel and re-decorate people's houses. You can edit colors and textures on everything, objects, clothes, doesn't matter. There are adventures on travels, for example you can explore the Great Pyramid in Egypt, something like a puzzle game with looting items. You can learn songs from people of different nationalities and teach them to others.
Lot's of these make it well worth the buy. I just wish they would bring out a remastered version that was more STABLE/TOUGH. I would honestly pay extra for such a thing...",1513140859,1513140859,True,1,0,0.525862038135528564,0,True,False,False,76561198116322634,110,50,9417,0,3674,1585284005

42,31911381,english,"(I would like to prefice this review with the fact that I have logged at least 200 or more hours on another computer when I had played the disk-based version of the game on my old laptop. Long-story-short, the laptop broke, I lost some of the main disks, I said fuck it, and bought the whole thing again on steam to avoid the same problem. If you take any part of this review to heart, then know this: do NOT buy the physical copies of this game. I don't care how cheap it is, that will be money lost to the void once that computer breaks and the steam version is at least a little more user friendly in transferability. Alright, here's the review.)

I love this game. I grew up with this game, and have seen numerous ways to create, love, hate, kill, communicate with, etc., my sims.

The game, in summary, is a life simulator. It's basically just that in the base game; that is to say you create sims (or, if you're weird, use some template sims) that you have to manage the basic life needs of food, social interaction, fun, toilet usage, and so on. Although, this is just a base, because the place where the game REALLY shines is the DLC. And yes, I know its already lost points in your mind and that this is just another EA money-maker, but hear me out on this one.

Yes, I admit that the only way to experience the full extent of the game is to buy all the DLC, which also means that you are either stupid, rich, or stupidly rich. That's just EA being EA. Despite this, the game is FANTASTIC if you CAN afford the DLC! They open your world to a multitude of possibilities in several different scenarios.

In Supernatural, you can become a werewolf, fairy, witch, or vampire and do many different things with the Supernatural world presented to you, like starting an impromptu zombie apocalypse or creating a wide variety of mystical potions with awesome effects.
In Showtime, you can take up a large number of different jobs in the performing arts, from Pop Singer to Escape Artist (don't quote me on the names, just trust me they're there), and become a celebrity of varying magnitudes in the process of rising to the top of the charts.
In Into the Future, you can travel to (you guessed it) the future, where you can meet your descendents, discover a whole new world of technology, and either screw over or progress the future depending on your actions in the present.

The list goes on. This is also leaving out the unique maps specialized for each individual expansion pack and the special secret things that may come with the packs (like the ability to have men give birth to alien babies in Seasons). Regardless of any of these perks and gameplay aspects, you still may not like this game unless you happen to enjoy managemnt games revolving around the every day lives of some group of gibberish-speaking bozos. I happen to be fond of such games and the bozos that reside within them.

In my opinion, this game is wonderful. Not the best, but an easy 8/10 in my book, even with only a few expansions. If you plan on getting this on a budget, get 2 or 3 of the actual expansions and, if you feel that you need a little variety, 1 stuff pack. I can't determine what combination would suit you (Seasons and Generations for normality or Supernatural and University Life for a weird-stupid-good time), so just see which one fits your fancy. My only major advice is to not get the Master Suite Stuff. It's just terrible considering the price.

When I was feeling stupid and rich, I bought almost everything I could. I spent two months working off the debt. It was not worth it.

The real negative that I have about Sims in general is that it is published by EA and all of the expansions and packs are way too overpriced. Never buy these games or the packs at regular price, they go on sale at least once a year and you can get them for a reasonable amount around then.

The game is solid enough, but so much content is arbitrarily bundled into DLCs to the point that the basegame is just not a satisfying experience, combined with the several GB of additional ""store"" content purchased through microtransactions.

In total you would have to spend several hundred dollars to get the full sims 3 experience, and the content in the store and DLCs are NOT just what are advertised. Any towns besides the one or two default are hidden behind paywalls, as well as several random features such as laundry, smart phones, the ability to do real-estate with your phone, and the whole celebrity system, as well as numerous skills, the overwhelming majority of furniture and clothing items, and several careers.

All in all it feels like every time they started to make a content patch, they decided to release it as DLC instead. Hell, most of the bugs from launch are still present in this game, and many features promised before launch and in trailers aren't available anywhere, even in the DLC.

The entire game is also constantly trying to sell you its shit, even when you already own it. Between giant notifcations about store content in-game, advertisements for DLC and store content on the loading screens, and giant ads in the completely unnecessary game launcher as well, though the launcher ones have all been replaced with equally gigantic sims 4 ads.

These disgusting business practices combined with the fact that the basegame is so slim on content and the fact that all of it is so agregiously, ludicrously overpriced means that I refuse to recommend this game to anyone, despite a couple hundred hours of playtime.

The passing of time in it is awful as well. Time passes really quickly, so you have to do stuff really fast. Unless, that is of course night time, in which case most people are asleep. Why did I buy a game where I would have to sit staring at my screen, listening to Sims cry out in rage, just to make sure I could always have a Sim to play, whether it be night or day in-game?

PROS:
-Feels like the world is alive around you.
-Even though the game is almost 9 years old, the graphics are still very good, and almost every gaming PC can run this game smoothly at very high settings. 
-You choose the way you want to play, whether it be starting a family and living the simple life, or becoming the President in this game, you have almost unlimited freedom to do what you want. 
-There are plenty of mods out for this game that can make your experience more fun and enjoyable. From new user created maps, to murder and nudity/sex mods, there are plenty of mods for every player for this game. 

CONS:
-DLC for this game is outrageous. The base game is $20, and all 19 DLC for this game also costs $20 each. 
-The game is still a little buggy and glitchy. 


Overall: 8/10

My recommendation for the DLC is to get ""The Sims 3 Bundle"" when it's on an 85% off sale. This bundle includes the base game, and in my opinion the main 3 DLC, The Sims 3: Generations, The Sims 3: Pets, and The Sims 3: Seasons. These 3 DLC are in my opinion the most important and most content filled DLC for the game. Some, possibly many will disagree, but it's my opinion.

I usually play my CD version, due to havig all DLC there, but I'm currently in a year-long process of switching to the Steam version for the simple fact that it's way more convenient. I've probably amassed half a year of my life playing any version of Sims (I've played the original, 2, and now 3 -- I hate 4 though...) The Sims 3 does have rather poor performance from the start, whereas my Sims 2 didn't start having awful performance until I downloaded over 3,000 CC + mods. That's annoying, but I've learned to live with it to ease the addiction. I'm waiting for Sims 5 to come out before buying 4, so hopefully I won't have to adapt to 4! Though I have seen 4 played on a friend's PC & it does seem to run a LOT faster. My recommendation is: if you're new to Sims, get 4. If you've played 3 at all, get 3. Even if you're coming from 2, if you haven't played 3, 4 is much closer to 2 than 3.

Starting off with base game, its pretty fun in its own right but without new twists and things to do, it gets pretty boring after a while. Although not all the DLC is worth it full price, so its better to get them on sale. Some packs are pretty cool to get when you can though, like Supernatural, Seasons, Pets, and etc. There is pretty much a pack for anything but again, better to buy on sale as not all of the packs are worth the $20 pay. Sims also has a website for extra content like worlds, clothes, hair etc. Which is pretty nice as well since you can get them with simpoints, but not worth to send money for as you can either redeem a game and get 1000 for free or watch some ads to get some. 
You can either add game packs or expansion packs. The difference? One adds little stuff for housing or for sims, and the other adds new worlds, things to do, stuff for both sim and housing. So yeah, choose wisly.

42,37265915,english,"This game is a robust but not (unsurpringly) accurate depiction of real life. But importantly, it's fun, with virtually infinite replayability, and expression of arhitectural creativity especially.

Pros:
-Build mode is AWESOME. You can create any house you want easily! And unlike CAD software, you can see, control, and influence people within them.
-The included towns are extremely content-filled and fresh. I absolutely love the open world concept, it's just AMAZING. Just go explore.
-Customization of the actual Sims seemed kind of silly, but's it's actually pretty deep! Now I know the diallemmas women face while picking what to wear. (Maybe.) 
-Did I mention the thriving open world?
-Social groups and personalities for Sims
-Customization of items! Put any texture almost anywhere!
-The game is really what you make it!

Cons:
-Sometimes interactions feel a bit ""fragmented."" When there's a party going on it feels like a Sim is just part of a small interaction instead of the whole scene, at least to me.
-Some annoying bugs with Sim interactions, sometimes they will wait forever to do something even though another Sim is right there and available.
-Even with a fairly high-end PC, there is still some performance issues, especially drops in frame rate on occasion and camera lag
-Even with fast SSD drive, loading can take A LONG time. However, not a huge issue, the amount of content in the neighorhoods and item/clothing options is staggering!
-EA is trying to push it's Shop-Mode crap on your pretty hard. Turn it off in settings, but there still is that rather annoying (but not obtrusive) icon in Buy Mode to buy virtual stuff with real money...
-BIGGEST CON: Massive amount of overpriced DLC. Each DLC is worth about $3-$6 on average. They do deliver though, there are some great ones. Need at least a few of the good DLC's (Seasons, University, Generations, Late Night, Pets)  for an excellent experience.

But I'm sure once I can afford them my love and passion of the game will develop even further and I am very sure it's a game I'll be playing for the rest of my life as I have already been playing it since I was around 12 years old and now I am 19.

THE SIMS 3 (was and still) IS AH-MAH-ZING! 

Disregarding my absolute hatred towards EA's business practice, The Sims 3 is just sooo much fun to play and the Expansions truly feel like they actually are Expansions that you can always opt in and out any time, unlike their most recent addition to the series (which I also admit to be an addict to).

The base game for The Sims 3 is alright, and you might have seen or heard people saying hundreds or maybe millions of times which Expansions are best and essential for the *MAXIMUM IMMERSION*, but I'm really not favoring one over another since they really all do feel like they expand the base game, as fun as it already is.

The pacing for The Sims 3, in my humblest of opinion, is very much like the original in that the needs bar is rather quick to deplete and I love it.

Gameplay style has ironed out many old flaws from S2, but as usual, there are plenty of new bugs!

Sims 3 are the best sims IMHO, and I've tried each iteration of the series. Only things holding it back from a 10/10 are the BULLSHIT DLC policy (with the cost of this game + all DLC, you could literally assemble a decent rig, it's 19 DLCs at 20 dollars each, plus another 20 for the base game... you do the math) and the performance. The game's engine is clearly pushed past it's limit and too often you get problems like glitches and ""lag"" because of this (I know it's not ACTUAL lag, since it's not an online game, but you know what I mean). It's infuriating to play this game almost 9 years after it's release and still struggle to make it run well. 

So, I'm downvoting the game because the whole DLC thing was pushed WAY TOO FAR here... I love The Sims 3, but the cost is simply unbelievable. It shows you how much EA cares about the playerbase.

The faces you can create always loo kinda similar, the fact that there are not very many hairstyles to choose from (compared to games like Oblivion) doesn't make it better.

Firstly, I enjoy playing this like going to college, doing sh*t, pick a girl and marry her on the same day, etc etc. Until the game crashes on itself, so I must repeat the sh*t I have done, yeah maybe that's my fault you know actually I forgot to save. On the second time, I remembered to save, and the game still crashes on some point. This happen continously until I wrote this review.

Second, back when I played this on my laptop, the game didn't crash, but worse. So for example I have finished my degree, got a promotion on job, a wife, a new house and sh*t happens. My sims stuck on the bush in front of his office and even he can't die although he had reached his last day. That's just one in a million problems this masterpiece could have. Sometimes, you could get a state where you can't load your savings, or the menu on game didn't fully load so you can't play, etc. That much of bugs you can fix it by delete your savings and repeat from the start. You know I have the supported graphics card and this game just too broken.

Third, this game past eight year and the devs can't fix any bugs or think about pricing on DLCs and the game itself. I realize that so many people spend their 20 bucks only for the base game.

As for how it compares to the Sims 4, besides a bit dated graphics the Sims 3 is superior in every category compared to what can easily be called a gutted cash grab with little inspiration less.

The main downsides to the Sims 3 that is very noticeable is the loading time, if you have an SSD it isn't that bad, but for anything else prepare to wait a long time to the point you question whether the game froze or not (it didn't just wait). Beside that, the price tag on the DLC and base game is way too high for the year it came out. The DLC is a big cash sink, but do you research and pick what is right for you if you only want a few.

Biggest complaint is the sheer price of the base game and its expansions. Twenty dollars is excessive for some of the content they add, and the lack of discounts makes it even worse.

I've played this game for many hours and I can say it is definitely worth getting,  The wide variety of customization options and available activites for the Sims add almost endless playability.  However, I have only ever played the game with DLC which brings me to a complaint I've seen come up in a lot of reviews: the price of DLC.  Many people complain that the game and DLC are still being sold full price even though they are so old.  Here's the thing, I have the core game and six DLC, while having only payed about $30 to $40 total (a single full price DLC is $20).  This game and it's expansions go on sale relatively requently and when the do they get a MASSIVE discount.  Like the DLC drop to five bucks each, same with the core game.  There are bundles that become an even better deal.  So here's my reccomendation: put the game and any DLC you want on your wishlist so you are notified when they go on sale.  Then get them while the prices are down.  You won't regret it.",1507497327,1507497327,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198258739146,37,3,31384,177,5146.0,1602079398

Also, there are more ""paywalls"" (Clickable items in the in-game store that ask for REAL money) than I'm comfortable with, but hey, It's the freaking Sims.

On new hardware you will need to do a bit of work to get it running properly and even then the performance will progressively lag as the in-game world accumulates clutter, needing further modding to get optimal functionality.

On top of that the game is still by default priced stupidly high, likely to put people off of buying it in favour of the similarly priced Sims 4?? I don't know.

The gameplay, as the Sim's careers progress and they go from broke to stinking filthy rich is probably the best the series has produced, although The Sims 4's ability to have Sims multi-task is something I already find a glaring set-back.

The building construction is the series' best, and has had its functionality stripped back considerably for 4. Although if you've tried 4, and then move on to 3, it will look old.

4's isolated lots replacing the open world also results in a much more stable game that is able to handle many more sims in the same space at a time without performance issues.

The Sims 3 is the series' high point, but no one should ever pay the price they're currently charging. Given its overall performance and the constantly increasing content via its many updates, I'd probably recommend 4 at this point unless you can get 3 for cheap. Then again, The Sims 4 is also grossly over-priced, so maybe go and spend the money on an indie game and save EA Maxis their smug satisfaction.

Some careers cannot be advanced, some events can't be attended, the option to let your sims age or not randomly toggles and sporadically will stop working until you delete numerous files. The status of the check box is often the opposite of the status of the option, so sims will age while the option to have them age is turned off.

60 FPS

This game is generally quite addicitive, and at first there seems so much to do. After playing it for a while, you'll run out of things to do, and all you're doing from there is the same stuff again. 

50 FPS

Thankfully, this game has modding support. So you start downloading mods to give yourself more things to do. Some make the game much more interesting, and soon the game is fun again.

45 FPS

So you're continuing to play, settings yourself challenges, and eventually doing massive tasks like creating massive families with specific goals, and completing one of these tasks that you set for yourself feels fantastic. You really feel like you're able to manage it all, and with the right choices, you can complete any task at hand.

30 FPS

The game feels strange after a while. Something is.... off. You can't quite put your finger on it. Things feel a little more sluggish. You continue to do challenges, as well as just mess around, and doing interesting things like, for example, letting a sim do their life completely autonomously and seeing what they get up to. Sadly, they don't have the free will to leave a lot on their own for anything besides work.

20 FPS

Woah! Lag spike! Woah! Another one! You don't remember the game running like this. Whatever, maybe your computer is getting old. You can always replace it...

15 FPS

10 FPS

5 FPS







I cannot reccommend this game. It obviously wants you to keep playing, but here's the thing. The longer you play this game, the slower and slower it will run. It has horrific cache problems, eventually building up to the point where 2 seconds of in-game time took about 20 in real life! You will probably eventually quit due to how poorly it runs. The developers clearly cobbled this game together, and did not test what happens in the long run. I'd say to go buy The Sims 4 instead, but that game is void of so many features that The Sims 3 introduced. 

In other words, pick your poison. The sims 3 that becomes unplayable eventually, or The Sims 4 with missing most of the fantastic features.

I admire it for the multiple town locations to live from and the vast options that have been brought that The Sims 2 (PS2) could not deliver. The Creation system has expanded massively and revamped their reward system from ""Wants and Fears"" to ""Wishes""!! The option called Story Progression allows sims within the neighborhood to have free will which allows the sims to be uncontrolled. There are multiple ways to Die in the game as well like Age, Starvation, Drowning, Electrocution, Meteor Shower, A Mummy's Curse, Thirst, Watery Grave, Human Statue, Transmutation, Freezing, Ranting, Shark Attack, Running out of Air, and Time Anomaly... lots of ways. There is a mobile phone version and a console version both of which are pretty decent.The skills in the game are much more refined than in the predecessor but with a larger selection to chose from and same goes for careers. There is even a ""Create a World Tool"" !!! Sure there are fualts as any game has and all games have limit and price to pay.

So I hope one day I can create a MV featuring my sim and the crazy out of the ordinary neighbors.

Sims 3 by far is my favorite out of all of them you can do so much in building, customizing, character creation, and many more. You can do anything you want in the game you could create a sim, find a dream job like a chef for example and work your way up to the top becoming the best chef in the city! Or you could become a family man and have a wife or kids and watch your kids grow up, and finally you could just become a crazy evil sim and cause chaos throughout the city either by stealing other sims stuff, inviteing them over traping them in your basement and forceing them to paint, or you could trap them and burn them to death. The things you can do in this game is endless which why it makes it a fantastic game I highly suggest getting Sims 3 if your looking for a good simulation game Sims 3 is worth every penny.

8,34451873,english,"Ok so something that has been on my nerves for a while is how buggy this game is and has always been.

So to start off with some of the bugs (the uni bug where you can lose your save from many many bugs) that have been there from very early on have never been fixed, instead EA just rolls out another expansion filled with stuff (and even more bugs) to distracted you from the old bugs and charge you an arm and a leg for it.

This game Still costs a small fortune with is in my opinion insulting as they are still getting large amounts of money for a game that they won't fix. (and these are small bugs but game braking, I will never play this again level bugs)

Now some of these bugs have been fixed but the fan made patches and EA still has not fixed them. now some of these bugs could have been fixed with some of the old ""Cheat"" commands however unlike sim 2, the sims 3 has a much smaller amount you can do with out going in and messing with code or getting a mod.

Now don't get me wrong, I have spent and will probably continue to spend way to much time on this game, It is a really fun game. The issues with the game are not with the game but EA.

The fact that every new replace of the sims comes out with out any of the content that WILL reappear as an expansion that cost almost the same as the base game is expectable at this point, We are all well aware that EA only has a small fraction of a care about the games and only really care about is how much money they can squeeze out of use for the same games remade over and over, (at this point I'm wondering if EA even has a development department or just a rehash department).

If you enjoy the creative and somewhat freedom of the sims and have a load of spare cash sure get it, but I would suggest look at getting the sims 1 and 2 as they had a lot more to them, less buggy and more control over the system if there was an issue (plus you could do some funny things with them too)

All in all, I feel that the Sims 3 is a prime example of the failings of EA and their lack of respect to wards the gaming community and their customers as a hole. I love the game but I can not in good consciences recommend this game due to the unending list of bugs that have not and probley never will be fixed by EA.",1503545938,1503545938,False,5,2,0.501112937927246094,0,True,False,False,76561198024463566,497,7,110977,0,26872,1596490370

I think it's because sometimes, you need a game where the chaos isn't ghouls running up to you and screaming at you. Where it isn't someone running you over with a million dollar car in GTA online. No, sometimes, you need to escape life with your own little charming parody of it. And that's what the Sims franchise has always been to me.

If you get it I'd suggest heavily modding it to get a bunch of great stuff.

Expansions I'd personally recommend would be: 

The Supernatural EP for potions to boost abilities, turn people into clowns or frogs or even change a human into supernatural beings! Then there's zombies which are super annoying during the full moon but can be a fun ""Zombie Apocolypse"" scenario creator, witches which can buff/debuff, upgrade objects and even curse people, werewolves which can scare people with roars, hunt down resources and bite people to transform them too, vampires which can hunt and drink blood and can make sims fall in love with them through vampiric mesmorization and new kinds of ghosts each fully controllable and different colors to represent different deaths.

Ambitions adds a bunch of professions and adds more specific verisons of some existing career paths and the ability to become self employed. It also adds Genies, go figure.

World Adventures for martial arts, chinese/french/egyptian decorations and furniture, the ability to make tombs (which are fun to create gauntlets and run unsuspecting trapped sims through MWUHAHAHA!) and some really nice premade lots to take back to the regular maps.

Pets for Horses, cats, dogs, even lizards, bugs, rats, raccoons, birds and even unicorns (there's some really crazy modded animals for this one) and also strangely this one adds the ice cream truck? Weird o.o

I mean sure, my first Sims game was practically like the PC versions, (Unless you count Freeplay, then who am i to judge) But this game combines what 1 and 2 did perfectly. It's a good thing you have an open world to explore this time around, instead of 1 (Heck, if you even call it open-world exploration) or 2. If you need a impending decision of which Sims game to get first, don't get 4. This one is better.

Sure, it may lag your computer some, and DLCs are over-priced, but heck, who can't pass up traveling the world, getting the profession of your dreams, own a perfect pet, experience the supernatural, Live in a bustling club-filled city, be a singer, go to college and have the time of your life, experience all four seasons, Make all ages have perfect family time, Live the island life, and even travel to the future? It all sounds like a dream to me.

Please, if you're looking for the perfect life simulation game, buy the sims 3.

Wanting to make him a serial killer of women, I was upset to learn that I cannot kill people in this game without mods.  I looked up onlin the best way to kill people, and most of them said to lock people in rooms, burn the house down with people, or to drown them in the pool by taking out the latter.  My first attempt would be to lock a girl in a room.  I put her in a small bathroom, deleted the door along with everything else, and waited.  A few days go by and she starts making weird noises.  I let it go on for 2 weeks before her annoying voice made me let her go.  Killing that way was out of the question now. My second attempt was to lure someone to a pool, and delete the latter.  The girl then climbed out of the pool, and this was another failed attempt.  My third idea was to get a bunch of people into a house and burn it down.  I threw a large house party, bought a fireplace, carpeting and a bunch of plants, lit the fireplace, got my sim to walk out, and deleted the doors.  The people actually started to put the fire out on their own.  I attempted this 3 or 4 times before I gave up.  My 4th and final attempt was when I decided to get a woman in the bathroom, deleted the door, and light the house on fire.  This started to work well, because the room that the fireplace was put in burst into flames.  Unfortunately, the fire wouldn't enter the bathroom, and just ended up burning all of my stuff.  I ended up giving up my evil ways, for I was not able to kill a single person through my attempts as murder.

In the end, Jack Ripper ended up getting married to the girl I tried to burn to death in the bathroom, and they have a nice sweet daughter that dreams of becoming the leader of the free world.  She's adorable as fuck, and I feel like a grandparent.

I highly recommend clicking on the tips/tutorials that pop up in the upper right. Once you learn all the many new things offered in this game you will be hooked!  

The Cons have been listed by many others before me but I will repeat. 
I don't like the push to connect online or to ""buy"" items with gold sim$
Only one family can exist in a neighborhood at a time in a story.

Pros- this is for the bundle
Love the interaction within the city- you do not have to pause your household to move around the town.
More job paths/ options such as part time jobs
Everything about seasons, finding seeds and making a garden. 
More personalization in game options, you can change length of seasons, life span and much more.

- Needed to generate income to live properly, so the sister had a part-time job after school.
- The old lady had to be the maid, chef and as well as the handyman, so the household won't crumble to dust. But somehow, everytime she uses something, it breaks.
- The boy had to make paintings and sell them.
- The school gave homeworks everyday, they had to finish it while having a part-time job and selling paintings so they get good grades.
- Managed to run everything smoothly.
- Sister got a raise a few times.
- The old lady excelled at cooking, cleaning and being the handyman. Fed them well and repaired every broken things. Although it was mostly caused by her.
- The boy improved his painting skills, thus his paintings cost a little more.
- The old lady tried to upgrade the stereo so it won't break anymore. She got electrocuted. She left it alone and decided to upgrade the microwave instead so it would cook food much faster. She got electrocuted again, which she then died, met the grim reaper, made a deal with him and they both vanished. 
- The kids were in school when it happened. Both mourned for 2 days straight  after they heard the news. 
- Sister had to cook and work while do homeworks everyday to keep both of them happy.
- The boy still had to paint.

After sometime living without an adult, with hardwork and dedication...

- The sister became a five-star chef. Married her old co-worker, and has twins from a different father; a girl and a boy, who became a musician and an athlete.
- The boy became a novelist and an artist. Every sunday, he makes more than 10k, and his paintings cost around 1k to 3k. Engaged with his old friend he met from school.
- They all live in a villa house up on the mountain.

16,33742319,english,"Skynyrd broadly fit into the hard-driving improvisational blues format pioneered by the Allman Brothers, although the band's welcome bent for brevity keeps most of the tracks tight and to the point. On the other hand, their nine-minute ""Freebird"" jumps out of the group's debut LP: It offers a tour of blues guitar expertise, conducted by Allen Collins and to riveting effect. In fact, Skynyrd work with three lead guitarists, a density of stringy instrumentation at times recalling Byrds as much as Allmans.

Eclectic (a shared predilection for much Southern rock), Skynyrd leans on everyone from Rolling Stones (""Tuesday's Gone"") and Ry Cooder (""Things Goin' On"") to Lovin' Spoonful (""Gimme Three Steps""). Lead singer Ronnie Van Zant mostly sounds like Keith Relf imitating Mick Jagger. Al Kooper's unobtrusively dapper production emphasizes the English connection with ever an eye to poppy parts, a mellotron here, electric 12-string there. But the blunter blues tracks form the album's meat with cuts like ""Simple Man"" revealing a no-nonsense powerhouse rock unit of modest proportions but considerable promise.

When Lynyrd Skynyrd harks back to Allmans and Wet Willies, Mose Jones suggest John Fred or the Box Tops, appealing to the Top 40 heritage of white Southern rock. Jones (previously called Stonehenge) forfeit Skynyrd's energy, relying instead on Uncle Al's dandy studio sweetenings — if one can ignore for the moment an atrocious Kooper gospel goof, ""Get Right (With God),"" which unfortunately opens, closes and gives Jones' album a title.

The band's style ranges between spruced-up acid rock (""Here We Go Again"" — a Moody Blues rerun), loping New York Rascals soul (""Kiwi Stumble Boogie"") and Motown — modified Allmans (""What Kind of Woman Would Do That"" — one of the record's better cuts, conceptually and musically). While vocalist Randy Lewis strongly recalls the Guess Who's Burton Cummings, the band, with Kooper at the controls, proves adroit in all fashion of disguises.

Kooper handles Jones as well as Skynyrd, but ultimately it is the latter's intensity that impresses most. Both bands could profit from a more concentrated and single-minded approach, even where proficiency partially forgives virtual parody. But for Skynyrd at least, magnolia muscle carries the day: a significant victory for Kooper's Southern Strategy.

By now I don't want to play anymore with the 2, only with the 3 because the graphics are good and the game itself has so much more options and choices to make. Yeah the developers forget about a lot of potentials, I have a lot of ideas, what could make the game even more better for me but hey, it's still goog enough to make me spend a lot of hours of my life with it.
Well... if I wanted to count all the hours and days when I played with this, it surely would reach at least a 1000 hours. Seriously, since the 3 came out, I played a lot a lot a lot with it. Too bad that I was a cheapass b*stard and didn't buy it till I got a Steam account and the game was very cheap. I played only 31 hours since I bought it but I remember all the memories, mad and funny moments from the past.

For me, The Sims 3 is nostalgia, feeling and entertainment. A way to get out of the real world and make my own to rule it.

The only thing I have to say about this really is that, with such a large Sims fanbase, I find it hard to believe that all the DLCs have to be priced so high, hence why I bought them only in the sales. I feel that they probably have so many people buying the DLCs that the sheer quantity of sales could probably equate to less money needing to be asked per DLC, but as I have no SIms development knowledge, I guess there is only so much I can say on the matter.
My mum has been playing Sims games as far back as I can remember, with my sister and I watching her, so I think for me SIms will always be a nostalgic game, and I think Sims 3 is one of the best Sims games that I've played overall.

[b] some of the good: [/b]

-sims 3 has by far the most customisation. you can personalise almost everything in this game, from clothes, to hair, to pets, to even the hardwood floor patterns in your home. 

-the custom content community is outstanding. you can get just about anything for your sims, and for free.

-most of the expansion packs add lots of fun new things for your sims to do, but some of them are pretty silly. i spent over 1,200 simpoints on a washing machine/dryer pair for my house, and months later i installed Town Life, which implemented laundry things that i could buy with simoleons. which i'd known that sooner.

-there are entire cities with lots of things to do, and there are different ways of transportation to get there. you can buy a car, use a taxi, or just buy a bike. you can also get a magical flying vacuum, if you're into that.

-you can play this game however you want. realistically, or fictionally. this game has no boundaries.

[b] some of the bad: [/b]

-this game runs like total crap. i will fully admit that. even the base game by itself can be slow, and lag like hell, but when you start installing expansions, you'll see the performance tank. mine will get hung up and freeze for a few minutes. you can download mods like NRAAS overwatch, which help a little, but not too much.

-the longer you play this game, you'll start to notice textures disappearing, sims not rendering, and things glitching out. you might hear your computer's fan kick up a few notches, too. my custom built gaming PC is no match for sims 3.

-unfortunately, this game is very easy to break. i've broken mine just by planning my sim's outfit twice within 3 minutes. it just stopped loading create-a-household. 

-there's no autosave, of course, so if you're going to play this game for long periods of time, you need to save it manually every once in a while, because once it freezes and crashes (which is pretty damn likely), you'll lose all of that hard work.

-the further your sims progress, the longer your loading time will be. my very first save file takes about 45 minutes to load, and i'm running the game off an SSD. 


i will always recommend sims 3 as a great game to start with for new simmers, but people also need to be aware of the bad things about this game, especially the performance issues. it can be very discouraging.",1500237094,1500237094,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False,76561198178815657,42,5,72113,0,25163,1577243757

61,33490306,english,"So I do love this game, but not at base price. Caught most of the dlc for this account on a major steam summer sale. 
Have played a family through 4 generations before I got bored, but super easy to switch to another family in the neighborhood, move, or just destroy everything via fire, drowning, or starvation. Comparing this to previous titles such as the original Sims, or Sims 2, I still prefer the Sims 3, including after briefly trying Sims 4. 

I hate that I had to buy everything over again when I wanted to have all of the dlc from Steam, already owning two DLC discs and the main game, but that's why I waited for the sale, and would say it has enough content within all of the DLC to be worth the $98 I caught it at. 

Don't be fooled by the hours listed here, I've played this game on three different computers on different account types, using Origin via disc, and a different steam account on a different laptop, and a desktop I'm using now with all of the dlc. Probably have about 1000-1500 hours on it, mostly on the base game with Pets and Supernatural dlc. They are my two favorites, but wish I had tried Seasons sooner, gives you more activities for your sims and easy lifetime happiness. 

If you can't catch a sale, at least do the base game with seasons, generations is pretty neat but not really worth it. I originally bought pets because I was excited about the interactions with horses, and was not disappointed. It is also monetarily worthwhile if you're looking at it as a way to support your sim family. 

I did use cheats for the previous sim titles like rosebud, but don't feel the need to mod or use cheats in the Sims 3 to get nice stuff or make a good/bad life for my game. 

tl;dr Great game, get it on sale, most of the dlc not worth it, make a family and make them succeed, fail, die, cheat, or fight; or just build house and lots. Takes about an hour to start your own family, but more fun that way.

83,33390711,english,"First of all, the full price for a game and DLC of this age is shocking, especially considering that Sims 4 has been out for a fairly long time as well. I definitely wouldn't have bought any of it if it wasn't for sales.

I'm mostly a fan of building stuff and don't play the way most Sims fans seem to play (make families, advance in careers, having babies and all that). I mainly enjoy building on the city map, which Sims 4 does not offer. The ability to recolor really everything is priceless and another feature Sims 4 doesn't have. So for builders, Sims 3 is clearly the way to go. The base game already has a good selection of materials and the various DLCs and mods let you build pretty much anything you can come up with.

But the performance. Jesus Christ, the performance. I have every mod under the sun to make the game run better, I read every forum and guide. And the conclusion is: your PC doesn't matter. Either the game likes you and you can run it on a potato laptop older than the game itself, or the game doesn't like you and would crash, freeze or eternally load even if you put it on a NASA computer. I'm in the latter category. Just starting a new game can take up 20 minutes, depending on the city. Once it runs, it is all consuming and even alt tabbing will crash it. I can only play it in offline mode, too, otherwise the game freezes if any minor thing happens in the background. It runs somewhat smoother in windowed mode, but won't let me navigate the city map - which is kind of important for me.

Since it all depends on luck and if the Sims stars align for whatever system you try to run it on, I don't know if I should I recommend it. It sure is a lot fun for a city building fan to design individual buildings, but it is also frustrating to have your entire progress erased due to some mysterious file corruption from just trying to load it.

If you like to gamble or are dead certain luck is on your side, knock yourself out during a sale, I guess.",1499563331,1499563540,True,1,0,0.534161508083343506,0,True,False,False,76561198256291224,481,88,37696,41,36447,1601742430

If you're thinking about getting the Sims 3, and you're looking at it on Steam, you've made the right decision to use Steam as a means of doing so. EA, and Ea's Origin aren't exactly the most loved things out there. Don't get me wrong, I loved the Sims 3 and 4 while I was able to play them on Origin, but due to an inncident with the company I am definitely no longer using their services. In short, what happened to me was that my account was hacked and all of my games were completely removed. I switched credit cards a number of times after having bought the Sims, and since I needed certain credit card information from the company which I used to purchase my games with, I would have to run through 3-4 different companies for credit cards whom I no longer used just to try and get my games back. This effort was fruitless and I ended up losing what was probably 100 or more bucks in expansions and other games etc. After trying endlessly to use EA's forums and live-help it was clear to me that they weren't goinng to do anything to help me. I was sad because I really had enjoyed playing the Sims family of games for a long time. Once I found it on Steam, I was ecstatic. So, due to EA's rep as a company, I definitely recommend purchasing this game through Steam.


( Review of the Sims 3 )

Alright, I don't even know where to begin with this game. As you likely know, the Sims family of games is a life-simulation game. Simple. However, simple is definitely not a word one would use to describe the Sims 3, the ammount of customization options is absolutely incredible, especially when you take into consideration the ammount of content that is at your fingertips with custom content and expansions that make this game, in my opinion, the best, most personal game in the world. The Sims 4 definitely improves upon a lot within building homes and creating sims, but this comes with a hefty cost. Say you find this amazing shirt for a sim, and you'd like it in a dark pink color, to match the color scheme you've picked out for your sims athletic wear. In the Sims 4 they've ripped out this function completely, meaning in this case you get to choose between only 3-5 options for color combinations. If you had this dilemma in the Sims 3, you could choose the EXACT color you were looking for easily! I can't stress enough the word EXACT!! Literally you can go to a color wheel, mix colors or find a number online for the exact color you want and paste it in. Don't like the texture? Import your own, or apply one of the many textures already available to you within the game! It's incredible the ammount of sheer personalization available to you in the Sims 3. In my opinion, the Sims 3 is a preferable alternative to the Sims 4, only because it's actually open-world and offers tons of customization options that are stripped in the Sims 4. 

I reccomend grabbig a few expansions while they're on sale, the two i reccomend as essentials are seasons and generations, and probably late night, since they add really important features to your game. The rest can be added depending on what you like. For example, if you really want to raise a horse, or a cat or dog or something, pick up the pets expansion. If you want to be a mermaid and run a paradise resort, pick up Island Paradise. It is important to know that the Sims 3's controls may be hard to learn at first, but once they're feeling smooth, you'll be amazed at how much fun you can have, and at how many hours you can sink into this game. I think that a lot of games are often found appealing by how much they allow the player to sort of 'begin anew' and 'start a new life', which is literally the whole entire purpose of the Sims. If you're interested, be sure to note that if you don't like the game, you will probably have played over the time you are allowed to for the return period so possibly ask a friend who has it if you could try it before purchasing if you're still on the fence.

26,33239749,english,"So let me get started here by saying a few things.  First, I’ve always been a long-time fan of The Sims but I had to learn early that not every expansion is worth the money.  With the first Sims I, quite literally, owned everything you could possibly own.  Sims 2, I became a little more selective after I purchased one or two “Stuff” packs and realized they weren’t really that impressive.  Now that Sims 3 is here I’m avoiding the “Stuff” packs all together.  

When Sims 3 first came out I purchased it immediately (physical copy).  Quite frankly, the core game let me down.  Coming from such an amazing experience with The Sims 2, the third in the series felt like a step backwards.  You didn’t get to experience owning a shop, or a club, and you sure didn’t have any sense that your character existed outside what you did at your home.  If you’ve played an earlier Sims game then I’m pretty sure the core Sims 3 experience will let you down too.  With the Steam Summer Sale I felt the time was right to give my beloved Sims series another chance.  I wasn’t disappointed. 

If you were like me, and were on the fence about buying The Sims 3 because you look at the DLC and just go “WTF?” then let me help you out here.  Right away ignore any “Stuff” packs because, like always, you can find better items on “mod” websites that will cost you NOTHING.  As for the expansions, there are some that are good and some you should avoid.  During my purchase I did some extensive research to find out exactly what would add to The Sims 3 experience, and what was a waste of money.  What I came up with was the following;

University Life opens up a large new campus town with an entirely new way to gain work experience prior to entering the workforce.  It opens up relationships for your teens, social groups, social networking, and an entire platform of awesome.  This is most definitely a MUST for your Sims3 experience.

Supernatural gives you the ability to get away from the mundaneness that is human.  It opens up zombie “attacks”, werewolves, witches, fairies, and all kinds of cool supernatural skills and abilities.  This is a must for anyone wishing to take their Sims experience beyond a real-world simulation.

Seasons brings in just that, the ability for your Sims to exist in a season other than summer.  You’ll see the trees turn color, snow start to fly, and with that your Sim will be able to perform tasks and run into issues due to those seasonal changes.  I found the Fall particularly challenging, as there was a lot more rain (which increased illnesses) and the ground was covered with leaves that brought more “cleaning” tasks than you would normally have to deal with.

The Pets expansion is another must-have, for the simple reason that if you want to experience a simulated life you have to have all the options that life gives you.  There’s nothing more boring than playing The Sims without the ability for your household to have a pet to care for.  Along with that comes more interactions with not only your own family members, but random animals as well.

Generations, put simply, brings actual “Life” to The Sims 3.  Like normal life, each stage brings about a new desire.  Children, for example, excel at imagination and make-believe while their Grandparents get more out of life by watching their grand children and reminiscing about life.  In addition the Generations expansion adds to the University expansion and opens up several more career branches for your Sims to enjoy and experience.

I was on the fence when I looked over Ambitions, I really was.  From the description it seemed like all that was added were new career options.  That said, I didn’t realize how important those options were.  Not only did it open careers like being a Firefighter or Investigator, the careers were more playable than other careers.  Instead of going to a workplace and simply vanishing into the building while you worked, you actually played-out some of these locations.  For example, as a private eye you had to use your home computer to seek out cases, then go and solve them.  As a firefighter you go to the fire hall and do all the things firefighters do while waiting for a call.  It also brings in more eco-friendly traits and a few self-employment options that I have yet to explore.  I was glad I got this expansion.

The Late Night expansion was another one that I was kinda on the fence about.  While I was fairly intrigued that it added Vampires and Celebrities to the mix, I wasn’t really sure if I would make full use of the “clubbing” scene.  That said, with the addition of celebrities came the ability to become one, with all the upsides (fame/fortune) and downsides (scandals/paparazzi) that comes with it.  Or, you could simply skip all that and become a member of the film industry in other ways.   Did I mention it also adds a completely new “city” area and a bunch of new party items?  You could easily skip this expansion but I felt it added that one missing aspect that I enjoyed in the expanded Sims 2 game.

So, you might now be asking yourself, with so much DLC required to make this game actually good why am I recommending it?  Put simply, because after the mentioned DLC is added, the game IS really good.  I, honestly, wouldn’t buy The Sims 3 as a stand-alone product, or with the DLC at full price.

That said, if you can manage to buy the base game, with my suggested expansions, on sale then by all means GO FOR IT!",1499188864,1499188864,True,3,0,0.557275533676147461,0,True,False,False,76561198078187111,464,101,2615,0,1008.0,1585957910

Be aware that this game needs some serious updates,

the game itself (from what I have managed to play) is dull. If you've played a sims before then its the same game with minimal (trivial) new features. you are better off sticking with the last one you've got. At least that way you won't have to fork out for all the ""DLC"" **** all over again. 

My personal experience is this game is a withering cash cow. They will pump you for money and not give a damn about your enjoyment or overall experience. i attempted to contact them directly regarding the issue and heard nothing. That was over a year ago. Why did I never chase? The game just isn't interesting enough to care. 

Maybe you'll have a better experience than me but just be aware of the company ethos and the risk you take.

-Late night (Bars, celeberties, apartments, new jobs and skills..pretty cool.)
-Generations (Tbh it's mostly centered around children. So if you like sim kids, get this.)
-Supernatural (Spooky creatures, a new town, jobs, skills, traits..)
-Into The Future (40 dollars, so get it on sale. You can make robots, change the future, skills and jobs..)

My least favourites:
-Pets (20 dollars for pets? Tbh not really worth it. But you can use horses for racing to gain money.)

70,31381613,english,"Note: I got The Sims 3 while it was on sale for 5 dollars, it is normally $20 (Extremely overpriced for an 8 year old game that barely works!)

The Sims 3 is a game that may appear cool at first glance, but is actually very badly made and you can tell that EA just put together a sequel (You could call it a prequel) to The Sims 2 just to make a quick few hundred million dollars. The game appears to have better graphics, until you look at the sims themselves, and see that they look like round faced dolls and that the charm of The Sims 2 art style is gone! The music is really great though! Unless you have a really expensive computer, you probably won't be able to have a smooth time playing this game. It comes with a beautiful open world, but it slows down the game too much. The game is very stereotypical when it comes to sims, and most good gameplay features from the previous game are trimmed down or removed, such as aspirations, fears, or interests. But you can do some pretty interesting stuff. Read on to find out more:

Score: 3.5/10- the only reason it isn't zero is because of the immersive world and this stuff:

Pros-
Cool/weird things you can do in The Sims 3-
Fall in love with 10 people at the same time
Burn to death while cooking pancakes
Be really rich
Kidnap neighbors
Kill people that you don't like
Crush kids with meteors
Crush their parents with meteors
Crush their parents friends with meteors
Crush the whole town with meteors
Be an evil witch/warlock that sets people on fire
Woohoo with 3 people in photo boothes on one date
Get married 5 hours after meeting someone
Collect space rocks
Stay out past curfew (Almost impossible due to stupid telepathic police!)
Be a magician
Go tomb exploring
Build torture houses
Set your house on fire
Be friends with Death
Revive people
Own a business
Have kids with 10 different people
Have a family that has been around for 10 generations (Legacy)
Freeze your sims to death
Go to university just to get killed in a fire that your pyromaniac roommate started
Create an obese guy with green skin
Find a genie lamp
Get crushed by a bed
Have a bake sale with your kid
Buy from a kids bake sale
Steal from a kids bake sale
Drop a meteor on a kids bake sale while the kid is standing there
Befriend aliens
Woohoo 10 times in a row
Kill old people to free up space in a household
Use cheats to make a baby age up and die of old age within 2 minutes
Play a sim from birth to death
Marry your imaginary friend
Smash a dollhouse
Egg houses
Marry a rich person, them drown them
Marry a premade woman, and kill their premade childhood best friend that was supposed to marry them 
Become a celebrity
Make a crazy cat/dog person
Be a kleptomaniac (Steal stuff)
Harvest (Steal) plants from a neighbors garden and they don't care
Take toys from your neighbors child's toybox and they don't care
Be best friends with everyone in town
Be hated by everyone in town
Save sim lives as a life guard or firefighter
Kill sims and build a huge cemetery in your yard with their graves
Don't pay bills, have tv repossesed by repoman, invite repoman over, trap him in a room and starve him as revenge for taking your tv
Have your sim devote their life to writng books and never do anything else except occasionaly socializing, using the toilet, eating a small meal, and napping
Get a nutcracker guy worth 1000 dollars while trick or treating 
Invite neighbors to a pool party and drown them all
Meet a spring unicorn, befriend them, adopt them, and have them set your enemies on fire with their powers
Be struck by lightning 

Gameplay pros-

Immersive gameplay
You can play generations
Creativity to design house and sims
Fun events 
Lots of creatures to play as (Requires expansion)
Beautiful, open world (Slows down game so you cannot enjoy it)

Cons-

Game is extremly slow on any computer that is not over 2000 dollars
It crashes constantly
It limits cooking by time of day (Cannot make waffles for lunch)
No aspirations or fears (Replaced by unrealistic wish system with only wants)
No actual stores (Your sim disappears when they go inside)
Premade sims suck (Example: Bella Goth is an 1st grade idiot with oversized eyes, no cool alien story/womanizer story/dead husband story like in sims 2, premade sims are obviously geared towards small girls)
Children are extremely limited (Cannot play piano or garden), but they can somehow MIX POTIONS and INVENT THINGS
Curfew is insane (Police cars come out of nowhere and arrest your teen sim who is far from the road!)

No Rodney's Death Creator :(

Dumb mourning system (Sad for stranger in the same household that you hate, not sad for best friend neighbor)
Pointless forceful punishment system for kids and teens 
Limits you to 8 sims per household (Unlike The Sims 2, there are no cheats to bypass this)
No rotational play 
Cannot drown sims by removing ladder (Sort of good)
Deaths are stupid and badly animated- Person fades into ash after burning (Obviously fake), same with vampire thirst death, and people disappear into the water after drowning
Lots of pointless ""traits"" (LUCKY!!!?? UNLUCKY!!!?? How are those even traits!?)
Very stereotypical (Traits largely resemble stereotypes of flirty people, nerds, evil people, good people, insane people, etc) and ages can be very stereotypical (Look at the elders or toddlers/children)
Sims are ugly plastic dolls- All the sims (Especially kids) have these ugly plastic faces and weird clothes, take Bella Bachelor (TS2 Bella Goth)- A premade sim, for example. She looks like an oversized ugly doll that was made to represent a toddler, not a child. (Look her up online), Extra pro- I can kill her or do a makeover
Cars are terrrible- They are stored in your sims inventory (Yes, you read that right: INVENTORY) and they magically appear on the street when they are needed. And when your sim gets in, they just FADE OUT and REAPPEAR in the car!
Bikes are just retextured cars (Look at previous con)
Sims don't have interests like in the sims 2 
If your sim has long hair, it glitches into their head and it looks like have a bald spot
If your sim has a dress, the laptop glitches into it when they use it on the ground
OVERPRICED DLC!!! One small world costs more than the game! 20$ for a 3 year old pack of 10 pointless items
90% of the stuff I mentioned that you can do in the game require DLC- No pets, RAIN (Come on! An expansion pack for such a basic feature!), university, unicorns, meteors, bake sales, witches, celebrities, vacation, bands, piano, aquariums, lightning, seasons, firefighters, or aliens in the base game (The Sims 2, an actual good game, had aliens in the base game)",1493235636,1497201548,False,8,12,0.575340569019317627,1,True,True,False,76561198183430382,34,4,3589,0,3335,1480124032

I mean, this is the best version of The Sims there is (barring the ridiculous DLC, which has been talked about extensively) and if I could give it a mixed recommendation instead of only yes or no, I'd give it that.

While there are many hours of fun to be had with  just the base game, I would suggest getting an expansion or two as well.

98,32136528,english,"Based off of my currently limited experience with this game, I would love to give a neutral response, but that is sadly not an option.  The Sims 3, on it's own, is a great game.  The customization is acceptable, the graphics look nice but aren't over the top, it runs on my outdated computer, and I enjoy playing the game.

Here's my problem with the game.  There is a large quantity of really good content locked behind a very large quantity of money in the form of DLCs.  While for most games this isn't a big deal, I feel like The Sims 3 DLCs don't provide enough bang for their buck.  I personally cannot afford to be throwing twenty bucks into one game just because I would like to access some new furniture or game mechanics.

If EA games were to take a hint, I would suggest that they make the DLCs free, or at least put a huge discount on them, once The Sims 4 begins to surpass The Sims 3 in revenue.  Most people are going to move on to The Sims 4, so why not make it easier for those people with outdated computers to enjoy the full Sims experience?

I would gladly put at least $100 into this game, but the combined prices of the DLCs and the game far exceed this limit.  It is still a great game that deserves plenty of playtime, but if you're on a budget, prepare to be dissapointed by the massive quantity of good stuff you just simply can't afford.",1496432529,1496432763,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198135368122,180,6,1879,0,852,1523214873
0,32132363,english,"You may complain about the price now but have you even seen the prices for the sims 4 and it's expansion packs? Nowadays, each and every game pack and expansion pack costs 20 to 40 dollars, and the packs only offer something that is far more exclusive than the games before it. Making them well, more expansive.

I grew up with the sims, and my naive child mind, despite dodging every single innuendo the game threw at me, always had a soft spot for this franchise and its a shame that EA threw it into this rut, milking it for what it's worth. By now, the total for all the Sims 4 packs combined is probably way more than what this game provides. And even bundles for sims 4 game packs don't do it's justice, providing about a 29 dollar savings for what already totals to be more than 70 dollars if bought separately. And since more game and expansion packs were just released/will be released in the near future, there is no possible way those prices are ever going to go down.

But back to the older games, In my own opinion, 2 and 3 were the golden age of the Sims, and I barely remember anything from the OG (since I haven't played it since I was like, I dunno 7 years) so it's hard to comment on it. But all the older games seem to have a lot more to it, especially in their base form and with no mods attached. If I were to do more extensive research on it, I totally would! But unfortunately I along with my family have been in a bit of a rut financially so I really cant invest in such a thing. But I digress.

My point is, Sims 3 was possibly the last good game from the franchise, sure the sims 4 looks nice and pretty, but my hunk of junk called a computer cant even run that high of a quality. But it is super dumbed-down with what you can do with the game without expansions and the always online DRM is a total turn off. But in the Sims 3, being online is optional, and the game is still fully functional offline.

And say what you want about the prices, once the Sims 4 era ends all the expansion packs for that game will make the other ones seem like a steal more than anything.",1496419630,1496419630,True,4,0,0.535002350807189941,0,True,False,False,76561198161355663,6,1,28868,0,4363.0,1591042033

33,31865791,english,"The Sims 3 is notorious for its overpriced DLC. However, this issue no longer scared me off once I found this Steam release. Now, the game consistently goes on sale for 75% off, including all the expansions. That means that all the expansions are only about sixty dollars. Considering how much content each expansion offers, I'd say it's worth the price of admission.

The Sims 3 honestly has extremely fun gameplay thanks to the deep mechanics held inside. There's plenty to do, and as long as you don't cheat, it's also quite rewarding.

The biggest star here are the mods. New neighborhoods, items, clothes, vehicles, gameplay, etc. Even with just the base game, this game can still be very engaging with the assistance of mods.

In conclusion, now that the expansions can be purchased way cheaper than before, it's easy for me to recommend this game to anyway.

Thing is with every DLC costing as much as the base game the price quickly racks up to absurd levels. The stuff packs aren't worth it and you can avoid those entirely as well as some of the more gimmicky DLC but Seasons, Generations, Pets, Ambitions, Late Night and World Adventure are musts in my opinion with Island Paradise and Uni life also being great dlc.

Its a huge timesink where you recreate an idealistic life while neglecting your own.

This would be a kind of half-hearted joke review as the game does have a very catharthic sense of fun all in all, but the excessive dlc definitely doesn't help endear the game, I have ambitions, Late Night and generations Expansions and the game feels heavily incomplete without them, the other ones are relatively passable but the 3 aforementioned EPs (alongside seasons) do feel neccessary.

 Given the fact I hear Sims 4 is even worse in this regard, I'm quite glad I skipped it, in fact, I always feel *heavily* reluctant to make any purchase for this game, I would say with the packs it is actually alot of fun, and very modular (unlike sims 4 at the moment).

 But irregardless, this game cannot get an honest review and still be positive, with such massive reservations i have about this addition to the series, especially since Origins blatantly negelects the steam version which can be easily broken, I did get my moneys worth out of it undeniably, but its almost a requisite more than entertainment at times, given the excessive cost.

If your a sim fan, you likely know alot fo these pitfalls and tricks, so heres what I found to be really good addons:
City Hub instead of neighbourhoods makes your sim feel in an expansive world
Ability to customize and paint outfits, furniture etc. is welcome
With the mentioned EPs, you get interactive careers added and alot of new minigames and life goals for stuff like building robots, a true City as opposed to suburbs, Nightclubs and hotspots to meet VIPs and get famous etc. 
Finally Generations heavily revamps all ages of your life and specific moments like weddings, Check the wiki for more details.

If your not a sims fan but are very interested in being one, I would pick up the base game first if you can get it for roughly 10 dollars max, but this is effectively a trial version, I have been steadily adding EPs year by year and the games cost has started to bloat, but indeed the game feels tellingly more complete, but at a cheap price, you can carefully evaluate it for yourself.

So the game is actually more like crack: Very addictive and rewarding in a petty way.... but also quite a drain on expenses... and the dealer is obnoxious and petty himself (EA)",1410642508,1494438994,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198056096151,320,105,1776,0,1735.0,1467656160

59,31614604,english,"This game's really what you make of it. I set out to make a haunted mansion so, of course, I needed some ghosts. I took a family of 8, piled them into a room full of fireplaces, rugs, stoves, and swimming pools and set about the task of slowly killing them all. 

After all the screaming stopped I had one survivor, the mother of the family. She had somehow avoided burning to death with her husband, siblings, and children and wasn't in the mood to swim so I kept her alive with all she had seen. With a little building prowess I made her a dungeon below the house so this, now rather beastly woman could forever remain with her family as their ghosts terrorized the new family. I was certain hilarity was about to ensue. 

I had hoped that the dead would bring forth unholy vengeance onto the world and rampage through the house, driving the new owners to their graves as well. What I got was...Well, rather than do anything terrifying, the ghosts just came and went as they pleased. They'd sit in a comfy armchair reading books and watching the couple sleep. They'd take baths and go to the toilet. One time a ghost made a chair levitate but that was about the extent of their haunting. To top it all off, the mother didn't really seem to mind after a while. She wasn't traumatized at all. 

What I'm saying is, murdering an entire family and leaving the mother as the sole survivor for entertainment purposes really isn't worth the effort. So I left that family of ghosts and made a new family only to have more fun ruining their lives in more conventional ways, like social ineptitude and poor financial management.

This game takes a whole new turn some may say for the better and others may say for the worse. I've played the majority of my life in video games on the Sims 2 and the Sims 1. These games absolutely no object other than to see what will happen, I've always found this really appealing about these games. Recently, my manapause has kicked in and has seen me created large dynasties of families and going back and looking through the families I had created. I huge pet peeve of mine with the Sims games is the need to purchase extra content in order to fulfil a full experience, while there's companies like Rockstar and Bethesda who release almost montly free Download Content, that adds more than some of these weak ass expansion packs do. I will say I am happy that you no longer need to download the expansions in chronological order meaning you can purchase whatever expansion packs tickle your fancy. Another thing that pisses me off and has no place in video games is stuff packs, what's the point. Paying twenty dollars for new skins of furniture, what a waste of money. I will say I did purchase three expansion packs and they were very much so worth it. These packs made me very happy as they added content to every aspect of the game. That being said not all content packs are worth the twenty dollar price tag. Luckily, you can find them on sale many times. The formula for the Sims series is still there, all Sims have needs and aspirations that need to fulfilled in order to keep your sims happy and their lives moving forward. One huge aspect of the Sims 3 that a love is the lack of loading screens and the ability of an open-world game. This is definetly worth the purchase itself. And I'm glad it's on Steam unlike any of the other Sims. Some of those other money hungry aspects really make the game worth less than it would be but it's still deserving of a purchase.

But, it's best to buy it with some expansion packs because the base game can get boring on it's own. The problem with that is, the expansion packs are pretty expensive. Nearly all of them are the same price as the base game, without a bundle or deal. Considering most of the expansions don't double the content of the base game, that's kinda a rip-off. That being said, some of them are pretty fun to have, such as the Seasons, Pets, and Supernatural that can add new types of sims and make interacting with other sims more entertaining. But some of the expansions, like the ones that just add furniture or clothing, which still cost the same as the base game, are completely not worth it.

18,31176223,english,"In The Sims 3, you basically create families (or play pre-made families) and live their lives as you would your own. The Sims franchise has improved throughout the years and I'm pretty satisfied with this version. 

If you have never played before, you can do almost everything you would in real life. Own a house, go to work, go to stores, go to friends houses, host parties, learn to cook, play chess, watch TV, and have relationships. 

It's a really fun game. The Create-A-Sim is also fantastic because you can customize basically every part of your Sim, including your build, clothes, and personality. It also has a memory book where it saves important parts of your Sim's life, such as you got a promotion or had a baby. It's also customizable. There are websites you can go to where you can download extra clothes and items. 

There are a few cons, though. The Sims 3 is integrated with EA's wannabe Facebook, so it prompts you to login in a lot. It also has a few glitches and problems, but what else do you expect with an EA game? I recommend backing up your Sims and houses in case of a problem in the future.

I have gotten addicted to this, raising a virtual family and seeing how their life plays out in front of me. Sims is one of the best, if not the greatest life simulator game ever. The good thing is if you want extra things added into the game, it is one of the easiest things to do. One downside I have had is when downloading an expansion pack at the same time as the game it seems to take a little longer yet suprisingly fast for a game this large. The game has many possibilities. I myself only have the pets expansion but I feel I got my moneys worth out of the game. At first glance it is expensive (I got it on sale a year ago for Chinese New year.) but once you play you realize just how much it adds into the game.

I myself am one who searches for the most enjoyable RPG games, and ones which can offer many things. So, I personally recommend if you're looking for a ""Live your Life RPG"" get this game with the following DLC:
- Seasons -> Creates worlds with 4 Seasons [ More RP Events, Things to do..] + OBJECTS
- Pets -> Duh. Pets. [Dogs, Cats, Horses, Birds, Rats, Hamsters, Fish, etc.] + OBJECTS

Honestly, i've played so much sims in my life. But sims 3 is second to the best for me, cuz sims 2 is still my number one favorite. 

This is my real review.

Sims 3 is a really good game for me despite the lag and crashes it gives me when i get DLC's. The sims 3 opened a whole new kind of experience with so many choices of DLC to choose from. 

and that's the thing with Sims 3, they have DLC unlike older versions of sims. I'm not sure if i would treat that as a good thing or what, because in my opinion, sure the DLC we buy gives more features and more things to do but it's not enough for the price we have to pay.

This is why i prefer sims 2. When i bought my Sims 3 Pets, i expected so much, and this only cost me disappointments. I was expecting to get a PET PARK/PET SHOPS/PET ETC. but all i got are pet furniture, and well...pets with the addition of horses you can ride. The addition of horses is okay for me, but i didn't bought Sims 3 HORSE SIMULATOR, i bought pets, so why is it that only horses get a special building. 

Cuz in sims 2 pets, you are literally experiencing everything about having a pet. Dogs can use trees as toilets, pets have their own park, pets have pet salons, pets have everything. 

That's what i feel lacking in sims 3. Their DLC's for me doesn't have ENOUGH features as much as the sims 2 has. 

but still, i would recommend it cuz i still find it a good game, i just voiced out what i felt was lacking. :) happy gaming to you all~",1488385101,1490724229,True,12,1,0.645117282867431641,4,True,False,False,76561198331448043,42,9,958,0,542,1488009657

17,30607492,english," you're looking for a game review you've come to the wrong place. But if youre looking for a fantastic ravioli recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients
- To Make the Dough
375 grams (3 cups) plain flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 eggs
1/4 cup (50 ml / 3½ tablespoons) olive oil
1/2 cup (120 ml / 8 tablespoons) water
Extra flour for dusting 


- To Make Cheese Filling
15 ounces (425 grams) container Ricotta cheese
5 ounces (142 g/about 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons) ""3 Cheese Italian Blend"" (Parmesan, Romano & Asiago)
Note: grate these cheeses yourself and create your own custom blend.
1/2 cup cheddar cheese
2 eggs, lightly beaten
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon pepper


- Extras
Your favorite sauce for the ravioli (i.e. marinara/ marijuana)
Parmesan cheese
Basil
Fried vegetables
Shrimp
Fish slices
Chicken pieces 
Make the Ravioli filling.

- In a small mixing bowl, add the ricotta and mash with a fork.
- Add in the 3-cheese blend, Cheddar cheese, eggs, salt, and pepper.
- Mix all ingredients thoroughly until you have a smooth, paste-like consistency.
- Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and place it in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes. 

Make the Ravioli dough.

- Crack eggs into a large mixing bowl and beat them with a fork. Add water, oil, and salt. Mix.
- Add 1 cup flour to the bowl. Use a fork to mix the flour with the eggs, water, oil, and salt. Repeat with the rest of the flour. Mix until a smooth dough is formed.
- Clear and clean off a large work surface and dust it with flour. This is where you are going to roll out your dough.
- Take the dough out of the mixing bowl, shape it into a ball, and place it on your work surface. Knead for at least 10 minutes or until it becomes elastic.
- Dust a rolling pin with flour to prevent the dough from sticking. Roll out the dough until it is about 1/8 inch (1/3 cm) thick, or about the thickness of 2 stacked quarters.
- With a cookie cutter or upside-down water glass, cut out circles in the dough (will make about 15-20 dough circles).
- Ball up the unused dough and either roll it out and make a couple more raviolis, or wrap it and put in the freezer for another time. Dough can keep for weeks when frozen. Just make sure to wrap well so that it doesn’t suffer from freezer burn or absorb freezer odor. 

Fill the Ravioli shells.

- Take the ravioli filling out of the refrigerator and place a tablespoon of it in middle of a dough.
- Fill a small bowl with water, dip your fingers in, and moisten around the outer edge of the dough circle.
- Fold the dough in half over the filling, making a half-moon shape. Be sure all the filling stays inside. Pinch the edges together and then seal the edges of the ravioli with a fork. Make sure to press firmly and go all the way around. This will add a “homemade” touch as well.
- Repeat this process for all your dough circles.
- Dust the finished ravioli with flour to keep them from sticking together. 

Form the Shells and Fill Using a Ravioli maker.

- Roll the dough into two sheets
- Place one sheet on the ravioli maker, and form the filling cups.
- Fill with the ravioli mixture.
- Lay the second sheet of dough on top, and roll it out. This will seal in the filling.
- Remove and separate the finished raviolis.

Cook the Ravioli.

- Fill a large pot with water and bring to a boil.
- Place the ravioli in boiling water for 5-6 minutes, or until they float. You can also test for doneness by nibbling on the edges to test.
- If you don't want to make all the ravioli at one time, you can freeze the rest 
- Take ravioli out of boiling water with large slotted spoon and place on warmed plates

Serve it up.
Top with your favorite sauce, grate some fresh cheese over it, and enjoy!",1489899680,1489899680,True,2,2,0.406115442514419556,0,True,False,False,76561198122801414,220,66,648,0,323,1531951351

My BIGGEST gripe is about the addons: WHY ARE THEY ALL $20?!?! That is as much as the game costs! They may add to the game, but I don't think that ANY of them should be $20. The amount each adds to the game varies, as should the price, but NEVER go over $15.

My prices for each DLC is as follows:

University Life - $12

Release barebones as possible for 19.99 and then buy shit that should have been in the base game for another 19.99

One could argue if you put so many hours into it why not support them? I dont like the buisness model, I dont want to throw the worst company in america another 20 dollars so I can have weather in my fucking game. Any other game would have just patched that in as a fan service but EA has to charge 20 dollars. The gall of this company. Sims 4 is out and they are still charging 20 dollars a fucking pop for expacs.

Not only all of that but they nickle and dime you in the damn game. There are plenty of indivual items that they taunt you with that you have to drop $$$$ on.

The DLC is way too pricey, holy mother of god... The DLC is x13 the price of the game itself, even on that heap of garbage named 'Origin'! Of course, I wouldn't expect anything different from a money-thirsty company like Electronic Arts, but £329.80 for a 7 year old game is insane! Especially with the release of Sims 4!
This goes to show how nobody wants to use Origin to purchase Sims 4 because you refuse to add it on Steam; it is a failed business model, especially with Steam existing.
Of course, you can use the argument that revolves itself around the business side of things and how EA, like the vast majority of companies, however the fact that they want to maximise profits by upping the prices to a ridiculous value is stupid.

61,30373548,english,"Here's my issue with The Sims franchise in general - they give you a base game with huge chunks of content intentionally missing, so that in order to actually enjoy it, you'll need to spend additional money on expansions.  And then more expansions.  And then another expansion.  And after about $100 sunk into it, you'll finally have a fun game that resembles the previous version of The Sims that you upgraded from.  See:  Sims 2, Sims 3, Sims 4.  Knock it off, EA. This is why people gleefully pirate your games and never feel the slightest bit guilty about it.  

Anyway, I finally decided to buy a legit copy of this on Steam because it went on sale for $12 (base game bundled with a few of the most important expansions) - which is reasonable.  If you get the other expansions on sale for $4.99 each, that's also reasonable.  If you're thinking of paying full price for any of it,  you're out of your mind.  And don't even waste $1 on Island Paradise because it's buggy as hell and you won't be able to play it.

62,30377849,english,"Sims 3 is a fun, enjoyable game that I have spent countless hours playing. 

I would like to be able to 100% recommend the game, as it is a virtual world with unlimited options and customization, however, there are also reasons why I wouldn’t recommend it. 

I’m choosing to not recommend it, and this is not because the game itself isn’t good, it is because of the numerous glitches and issues that come along with the game. 

I have been a fan of sims for years, and have Sims 2 Pets for Game Cube, Sims 3 for Wii and Sims 3 for PC. Out of these three, Sims 2 was the only one that didn’t have a lot of glitches. There were some small ones, but nothing that makes the game unplayable. 

However, in both the Wii version and PC version of Sims 3, while the game starts out being relatively glitch free, as you progress through the storyline, the glitches gradually become more frequent and begin to affect the fun of the gameplay itself. 

As of three or four years ago, I had to stop playing the Sims 3 for Wii, because every time I would try to load the game, within two or three minutes in live mode, it would freeze completely. 

I purchased Sims 3 last year during the summer sale, along with the Pets expansion. There was a special offer that meant I was able to buy both for way less than the normal price. That was the only reason I even considered buying the game.
I love Sims, don’t get me wrong, but given that I know how many glitches were in Sims 3 for the Wii, I wasn’t willing to spend full price on a game that may or may not be playable at some point in the future. 

To give you an idea of the types of glitches I have encountered, I will first of all list all the expansions that I have currently.
I have:
Sims 3 Pets
Sims 3 Generations
Sims 3 Supernatural
Sims 3 University Life
Sims 3 Seasons
Sims 3 Ambitions

I got the other expansion packs at the beginning of this year, again on sale. 
The game, while it often lagged a lot, worked relatively well until the beginning of February, when a strange and very frustrating glitch occurred. 
I was trying to get my sim to walk to the fridge to get some food, but every time I tried to issue the command, the bubble indicating that they can’t go there came up. My fridge was in the same exact spot as it had been since I started playing that save file. I couldn’t figure out why my sim couldn’t get to the fridge, given that there wasn’t anything visibly in front of the fridge door. So, after trying to remove the invisible object, I decided to move my fridge one spot to the left. I issued the command to my sim again, and they simply walked over and completed the task. However, the fact that there was some kind of invisible object blocking access to half my kitchen still remained, for which I couldn’t find a permanent solution. 

There were other annoying glitches as well, but for the PC version, this was the one that really made me frustrated, because while I could just move houses, I had everything in my current house the way I wanted it and I didn’t want to have to buy a new house because of some invisible object. This, in addition to the numerous issues I have encountered with the Wii version as well as the PC version is what caused me to get so frustrated. 
Sims 3 would be an extremely fun game, but the enjoyment of playing it is greatly diminished by the glitches that interfere with the gameplay. 
In conclusion, I do not recommend the Sims 3 game, unless you are willing to deal with the problems that will more than likely occur the more you play the game. I wish the developers of the game would have taken more time and effort to smooth out the issues instead of trying to get it done quickly in order to be able to sell it to the public. Quality is always more important than quantity.

I recommend waiting for steam sales before you buy any of the DLC though, and stay away from the ""stuff packs"" they are generally not worth getting, especially for the price.

One important thing to note is that the loading times in this game, as well as the time it takes to save are unforgiveably bad, I recommend putting the game into windowed mode and then forcing it into windowed borderless with the windowed borderless gaming software so you can tab out and do something else while it loads / saves. Thankfully the game only has to load once since it is open world (unless you are traveling to a new neighbourhood, then it needs to load the new neighbourhood as well)

Before you start playing The Sims 3 I strongly recommend you get some important mods, nraas overwatch as well as nraas debugger. Overwatch will do a check and cleanup of your game neighbourhood once ever 24 hours to fix the awful performance that plagues this otherwise great game and fix sims getting stuck etc. Debugger will allow you to wiggle around other bugs and issues you run into, it will basically allow you to do anything for debugging purposes.

Pros

- Endless Sandbox. The game is never predictable. The game never ends.
- So many contents. Without the expansion packs.
- Awesome soundtrack.
- Enitre game World feels open, alive and connected.
- Sims not under your control can age and die and have life of their own.
- You can customize the lifespan of Sims and their pets.
- Vastly Improved AI over Sims 2.
- Very engaging character customization screen.
- Wonderful house editor.
- Create-A-Style lets you practically create your own dress textures.
- Huge Mod Support.

Cons -

- Load / Save times can be extremely slow due to staggering number of contents (especially if you have 2+ expansion packs)
- Sims cannot multitask.
- Some Annoying NPCs will often bother you.
- Sims have problem with staircases often.
- If left on their own, Sims can make the stupidest choices.
- Partially intrusive Sims store ads in-game. You can turn these off, but bad practice overall.
- Overpriced DLCs. While expansion packs are sometimes worth getting, Stuff Packs do not add new features to the game bar a few cosmetic items and costs as much as the base game itself!

Recommended Expansions:

Pets
Generations
Seasons
University Life



For all those interested, this game does not come with any additional DRM except Steamworks. There is no cloud save support and the save game sizes can be huge. You need to back them up manually or get a software that does.

I do like the ability to turn free will and aging on or off, to tick off certain weather types, adjust time frames for growth stages and seasons, etc...

I like the lifetime wishes, opportunities, roommates, choices of traits, lifetime rewards...

What I hate, however, is the game becoming unplayable at times because a glitch occured during transfer from university back to home (for instance). My Sims can't be selected, in fact, the whole household dissapears from the house altogether while their roomates keep on going about their activities. I had to delete a gamre and start over because of it! I eventually found a way to fix it by making a copy of my household, saving copy to library, evicting the old household and replacing them by the new copy, but that means they lose all their connections with friends, etc... You'd think that, with the kind of price each expansion sells for, these sorts of major glitches would be ironed out before the game is released, or patched at some point...

+ Purchase a house for your family or build and design your own with hundreds of customisation options. Buy pools, decorative garden plants, televisions, computers, exercise machines, kitchen appliances, cars, toys for toddlers, sculptures, pet animals (DLC)....the list is huge! 
+ Work as a master criminal, a journalist, celebrity or even a detective + more! Attend University to further your studies and become a video game designer, sports agent or arts appraiser (DLC). Go travelling to Egypt, France and China (DLC). This game is packed with plenty to do.
+ Many different skills for your sims to level up, science, cooking, athleticism, logic, charisma etc, so you can have a very diverse gameplay experience.
+ Optional quests or objectives will become available from schooling, work and elsewhere, allowing you to participate in one-off opportunities with rewards.
+ Several neighbourhoods to play in, each with a unique layout.
+ There's a large amount of playtime in the Sims 3 for players of all sorts. I managed to get over 100 hours out of it.

[h1]Negatives:[/h1]

- Micromanagement is very unresponsive, Sims refuse to complete workplace objectives over and over and decide what they want to do themselves, instead of what you've told them. High free will means Sims react to basic needs problems like feeding a baby or bathing themselves, but it also results in ignoring your human commands repeatedly, which gets infuriating after a few hours.
- While I acknowledge graphics aren't a major focus of Sims gameplay, it could definitely be improved. Aesthetically, this game is disappointing.
- The game is quite expensive, even though it's now 8 years old (as of 20/02/2017). DLC is also pricey, so make sure you absolutely want this game before paying in full, or wait for a sale.
- Bad pathing by Sims, they don't interact with the environment well and get stuck in certain spots. Could be much smoother.  

- Despite the vastness of Sims 3, it can become boring after awhile. Once you build a mansion filled with the most luxurious objects money can buy and had a family, there's really not much else to do. This game has a cycle of repetition, whereby you continue to do the same tasks over and over, just in different ways and styles. Sure, the kids in your family grow up and you're able to control their lives, but it's like starting from scratch again, where's the sense of accomplishment in that? It's the balance between fun and repetitive content which the Sims 3 suffers from. There's a real conflict here, with the many facets of variability trying to shine, but then a monotonous feeling sometimes overshadowing it. 


Overall Score: 7.5/10

I bought the Island Paradise, Pets, Generations, Ambitions and Seasons as those either added content I was interested in or expand the game in interesting ways.
 First impressions were really well, everything is highly customizable and I spend an hour making a loner fisherman/scuba diver and his trusty dog and finally move into my housboat. The troubles soon became apparent though as the game freezes very frequently for 5-20 seconds. Now I read elsewhere that it's especially bad with Isla Paradiso as there are tons of pathing issues that cause these lags. EA just never bothered fixing their 35$ expansion pack....
I downloaded a modded version of the worldmap but have to start a new playthrough and I also read that there are mods that watch for these pathing errors and resolve them more quickly than the game's own routines but this is a sorry state of affairs.

Sims 3 seems to otherwise really be the high point of the series and I wish there would be a ""Remaster"" with most of the expansion packs but mostly bug free and on a better technical base that can actually handle all the assets. That would be way better than the trimmed down Sims 4 or whatever they have planned with 5.

<edit>
I have since bought the Late Night expansion and started a new playthrough in Bridgeport to see if that has unplayable lag too. No Lag! Oh joy!
I played all day, getting a lone teen (created a mother then deleted her) with her two cats through school and into adulthood where she started a career as a mixologist and I was looking forward to opening my own Bar at some point. Saved and quit to eat dinner, loaded again and I can't interact with half the objects anymore. What the heck is this?? Quite a few people seem to have the same or similar issues, some other players may give well meant advice but nothing worked for me. Not buying a new toilet or deleting my cache files.

I should know better than to give EA any of my money but it's been ages since I played the Sims 1 and I really wanted to again. When the game actually works it was a real joy and I'm amazed by the breadth and depth of the gameplay but if all my games end sooner rather than later in a technical game-over then I'm not motivated to start again.

Basically finding the best way possible to make every Sim as miserable as possible. If you want to be different, then I guess you could play normally but there's no fun in that.

Tried it within the games interface, on EA's website, which also kept telling me my serial number was invalid even though I copied it straight from the steam startup page!
Then I found another EA webite (why does EA have another site that essentially does the same thing?) It eventually accepted my details and told me I had registered my game! Yay! It also told me I had 1000 sim money whatever it's called and when I get in the game I can download some sim stuff. Great I thought. Now I knew I needed to register the game so that I could get achievements and use the store to buy things etc. I figured that out eventually. So I start the game, setup the graphics and sound etc. I find the Download button, click that and find nothing there! I start looking around all over the place, and realize that there's no sim money, no stuff to download to help you start off!

25,23823400,english,"I can say that this game is way better than The Sims 4, this game is the one that changes how The Sims work (most of it). Personality is the biggest changes made, in The Sims and The Sims 2 you can only change Neat, Outgoing, Active, etc. but in The Sims 3 this is where personality becomes more specific, from Absent-Minded to Charismatic sims, the base game is already fun but purchasing the DLCs (I'd recommend expansions pack instead of stuff pack) makes the game more complete.

The game is open world, so the loading screen may be longer compared to other The Sims.

Before purchasing the DLCs make sure to go online to see what features it offers, also ONLY buy the DLC (at least try to) when on sale. because they are overpriced. Want to know why to buy the DLCs on sale? Check the total price of The SIms 3 plus DLCs, it's just mental.

44,29754081,english,"The Sims franchise has earned its place in my top 5 all time favourite games. Only WoW could rival the number of hours I've put into these games. The Sims 3 builds nicely on the previous Sims and if you wait long enough the DLC becomes extremely affordable. I bought the base game at launch years ago and the only redeeming quality back then was the sheer amount of amazing modders who put items up for free for download. EA has tapped into that and offers an in-game and launch screen store where you can top up on furniture, clothes, and other sim items. I've personally never put any additional funds into peices of furniture, but if that's your bag it's there. If you own all the DLC you don't need to seek outside downloads. 

What other game lets you simulate yourself and IRL people to tortment or woo-hoo in the shower with?

Sims 3's sim creator makes for almost infinite cosmetic and personality options. Although Sims 4 is out and I've owned this game since launch, it has enough staying power to hold me over for years to come. As a general rule you can wait to buy the newest Sims game for a year or so and pick it up on the extreme cheap during the Winter/Summer sales. The only real changes from version to version is usually graphics and some improved AI for the first while. There isn't much incentive to leave this version when the Sims 4 has limited DLC. You get used to your sims going to university, having seasons, taking vacations, and being vampires that terrorize the neighbourhood. And yes, you can still torture and burn your sims to crisp, create a little graveyard, and have the ghosts torment the new family that moves in.

*EDITED AND UPDATED!!*

The Sims 3 is the third major title in the life simulation video game developed by The Sims Studio and published by Electronic Arts

Sims 3 is the perfect example for a brilliant, fun game that works without any violence… right. It's both more of a role-playing game than it's ever been before, and more of a design game than it's ever been before. It may suffer a few glaring compromises, but it's an essential play for anyone with an interest in what videogames can achieve outside of a targeting reticule.

My life is a mess, I had to grow up so fast. Just yesterday I was a little girl, now I'm a grown up vampire trying to survive in this suburban nightmare called SIMS. I tried picking up this chick who bartended at an underground dive bar in the graveyard, but somehow ended up bitch-slapping her and that ended real quick. I'm passed out in front of the library at 3 something AM and I'm just TIRED how did my life come to this?

I really like this game and its really easy to get into it and spend all day on it without meaning to (i suggest setting a alarm for urself to get off if u dont want to be on it for long). One bit i dont like is the days go by really fast and by the time the sims come home from school/work there iznt alot left they can do with the time thats left before they are to tired. At times its also annoying when the sims dont sleep right thru the night, ending up waking up at like 2-3am and being tired for the day. A funny glitch (im guessing it is) im getting with 1 of my sims, is if hes rushing to do stuff, he will end up just not getting dressed and just leave the house to go to work NAKED! It was akward him being naked right in the middle of a kids birthday party as well hahaa. I love the fact that sims can have their own car! Its something i was wanting soo bad throughout sims original/sims 2. I also like that theres so many options for jobs and things to do within the game.

Overall this game is really good and i would recommend this to anyone.

UPDATE: Discovering simpoints and the web store to buy new items.

The webstore is really good coz it lets u bring in more and better things. But its also a bad thing coz the game itself has very little options for items and these buyable items should be in the game already. Theres some good items in there none the less. Even if some of the stuff is over priced. I like the fact that you get a 1000 simpoint bonus when u 1st sign up. The main thing i DONT like about it tho i buying more impoints is bad. they are well overpriced and just ripping people off. Cheapest lot is $15 and barely gives u enuf points to buy anything. There is more things i would like to buy from the store but theres no way im paying them rip off prices just to do it. I really hate all these money greedy developers.

The sims are actually quite realistic and literaly seem to have pesonalities of thier own. You can create two identical sims right down to their traits and they will still surprize you. They are real enough infact, that its possible to feel for them when they have good times and bad. 

After investing alot of time in this game, about 200 hours, I have noticed there are alot of problems as well. There were many times that I found the action menu options and how the actions are executed were impractical or down right nonsence. I've noticed easily hundreds of times the asperation system failed. Options normally in the action menu tend to sometimes go missing when the sim has an asperation related to said action. Sometimes asperations do not get checked off no matter how many times you complete the task. The asperation system just plain sucks on how the sims seem to mosly get asperations after you just completed the action rather while you are working on the task, at least in cases where  they are learning skills or advancing in a profession. Several times I've seen a new lifetime wish pop up even though, the sim already completed its lifetime wish. I have a sim that never did get a lifetime wish. Most notible problem I have run into with this game are the crashes, not so bad by themselves, but add to the fact that even with a SSD the time it takes to save the game is terrible. This game makes me hate saving to the point that I lose entire game sessions due to a crash. That said, saving can cause a crash itself. This is the worse, because when it crashes while saving the whole save file is lost. I lost a whole family I put about a hundred hours into developing over this ...thanks EA Games t('.'t)... That said, It may be a great idea to regularly go into your save folder and create backups. I think this game is great, but EA with 19 expansions got sloppy on the way fitting it all together it seems. 

Don't buy this game at regular price. Personally I think this game and all expansions should be combined, debuged, streamlined and repackaged for sale at about $60 USC.",1486143999,1486150635,False,0,0,0,1,True,False,False,76561198045148362,526,9,12065,0,11175.0,1532724399

69,29642258,english,"First of all this is a great game. Everything is beautiful and the concept is very clean. I played sims 1 and 2 at launch many years ago and i skipped the sims 3 for 7 years before trying it but it still looked great! This is a real classic revamped without competition in the industry.

Second, never ever buy this game if you are a gamer. Everything seems nice until you really invest in it. 

The review says I've played 37 hours but i've loaded the game for about 7 hours of the time. The first couple of hours works like a charm, then you try something new. Then you begin to get 4 fps after 15 minutes of play everytime you reload the game. Then you spend 2 hours on forums checking what you should do to speed up your game. Cleaning of the game cache, deleting a couple of files, ok.... There is no greater disapointment abandonning a game so well designed because of technical issues.....

After 5 tries of solutions that worked for other people, you get really sad because even if you are a game engineer (which I was for almost a decade), you still can't find the solution to your problem; Welll, the last solution people on forums is that I should get a super computer. Sorry guys, I don't believe having 8 more gigs of RAM on top of my 8 and 300 MHz more clock speed on my i7 will do the trick, this isn't how it works.

I think the root of all the problems is one of the DLC i got from steam for free that causes all of the problems, but I tried to re-install the game without it and the launcher gives me a fatal error if it isn't there (pets dlc). Now I am just enable to boot the game (haven't tried more than 30 seconds though, think it stills try to load old files from previous install in the document folder).... if you can't figure how to launch a game in 2 min... than you are not in 2009, less in 2017.

So, should you buy this game, don't buy any DLCs. Get the vanilla game and make sure you are good before installing anything else. Play at least 20 hours of it and get your sim making another baby sim and make it go to adulthood.

At this point, I think I'll just skip everything Electronic Arts does from this point...

87,29513112,english,"The Sims 3 is really fun and addictive! Still, it is important that buyers be aware of what they're actually getting prior to investing in this game. If you do not do a little research ahead of time, you may end up feeling disappointed once you begin to play. 

The Sims has always been a franchise built around DLC. If you are trying out Sims for the first time and you decide to only purchase the base game (to experiment and save some money), keep in mind that you will not be able to do many of the things you probably have seen in player videos and previews. That being said - I would suggest reading through the descriptions of the available DLC prior to making your purchase. Choose what might be worth investing in based upon what you hoped to get out of this game. 

For instance - are you simply looking to play around with one character - walk him/her through their daily life, get a job, climb the career ladder, etc? If so, the base game may work out just fine for you. If you're looking for more, you may want to choose a bundle, or purchase the game with some DLC, right away. Still, think carefully before spending your money. DLC for The Sims is relatively costly. If you know you would enjoy playing with cats, dogs, and horses, and engaging in outdoor seasonal activities - the main bundle (with generations, pets, and seasons) may be worth the expense. But, if you're more interested in traveling the world, creating vampires and witches, or living the college life, you're probably better off skipping the bundle and just buying The Sims 3 plus one additional DLC that meets your needs. 

In short - The Sims 3 is a great game - but you may be disappointed, or end up spending more than you'd like for content you do not need or care about, if you do not do some research before making your purchase.",1485483026,1485483047,True,346,10,0.944267690181732178,7,True,False,False,76561198346228186,41,2,2379,0,2026.0,1491350137

-I make a family where the man is an inventor and the woman is an artist. After about a one week of sims time: man has set himself on fire 3 times, electrocuted himself about 4 times; And ofc his wife saved him every time he caught on fire.

- I make a witch family and plant the yard full of apple trees  with the apples that I have conjured. Zombies start hanging out in my giant yard and try to eat my apple trees, obviously I go and ice spell them so they freeze solid. So yeah.. there are now 3 ice zombie statues in my yard..slowly melting.

- I create a crazy lady with too many small pets. I tell her to pet a snake, it's cute, but then she gets bitten. I am not sure what I expected to happen...

- I create a family consisting of young people that wish to be in a band and make money with their music. They start practicing their guitar skills, but  one week in game time the cat has made more money than the two humans combined! Ok yeah, he found a really rare beetle and a rare lizard while hunting and I sold those along with dozen of other small animals, but still, this cat pays the taxes in this family.

-I have a poor family that decided to have a child, they manage it somehow financially and things are going well. Taking care of the lil leech isn't quite hard as I thought...so I decide to let them make another baby to add some difficulty. They get twins. I am doomed.

54,9578241,english,"The Sims 3 in the least, is a very Dynamic and enjoyable game. There are tons of new things added from the previous game ""Sims 2"" (Yes I know this is very late considering the 4th one is coming out). But also, there are things that I were felt missing from the previous game. It's weird to explain what they were, it just feels... gone. But, it makes up for it with new features, such as Perks, and added features.

The only real problem I have with this game, and what's preventing from giving the a 10 or even a 9 is, that the DLC is WAY over-priced for what it's worth. DLC at it's Maximum should be $20 not $30-$40. Average DLC on any game is usually between $10-$20. And then you occasionally have the $25 DLC. but, Anything more than that is far too outrageous. Especially, if some of the DLC costs more than the actual Base game. I doubt even SOME Die-Hard Sims fans would be willing to pay for that much.

My final score is and 8/10

I would recommend this game to people who are very creative and enjoy creating pretty much anything.

EdIt: Gotta say I can't recommend this game unless it's on sale. Once again the games good. The Price isn't. Buy the Expansions in bits and pieces when they go on sale. This game's price needs to be lowered once again since the Sims 4 is now released. I'd say the DLC needs to get down to 10 bucks AT THE MOST.",1395362830,1483934080,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198038829622,231,4,6530,0,6347,1500527703

Naturally, they clash at first: she can't stand how he leaves his dishes everywhere and runs around on all fours sometimes, while he finds her stuck up and pretentious. But over time, they start chatting more and realizing how much they have in common.

Their friendship hits a rough patch at the full moon, when he transforms and ruins a bunch of furniture, and she goes a little nuts and attacks him (apparently there's an action called a ""lunatic slap"" during the full moon that she did on her own). But they bond over fighting a robber together and playing lots of hopscotch, and soon their bond is stronger than ever. It pretty quickly moves to ""Romantic Interest,"" and all of a sudden they are flirting and kissing all the time.

After a few in-game days of this, it's time for them to ""woohoo"" for the first time. He gives her a big dip kiss, and they go to the bed with swelling music and falling rose petals. Right as I'm wondering how birth control works in this game, since I'm not ready to raise a hybrid werewolf-vampire baby, she falls out of the bed and dies. The grim reaper shows up and takes her ghost away as I stare at my computer in shock. Apparently she died of thirst, unwilling to feed from him and not wanting to interrupt the romance to go drink.

Now he's walking around the house grieving, surrounded by walls covered in all the paintings she made. He tries desperately to resurrects her while her ghost is still haunting the place, but can't find the necessary ingredients to make the potion he needs in time. He finally moves on when he finds a puppy at the animal shelter that needs a home, and starts forming a warm friendship with the zombie next door.

After playing the sims 3 for around 300 hours I can surely say that the game is fun and provides a enjoyable experience. In Sims you basically make yourself a character or family and go on through the game while seeing your characters grow up. Your family will slowly grow as your starting character begins to grow old and ends up sadly dying as death himself comes through your front door to take your orginal character's soul away. The gameplay is a little bit repetive as you basically give your family characters orders such as cook/eat food or go to work/school everyday until their is a holiday or weekened for them to take off and instead chill at home. You will have to pile up money to expand your house and add new additions to it, which may be a grind, but you may easily use cheats or gain a well paying job to quickly create a fair amount of money. Graphics are nothing to praise or spit on, but it is thankfully easy on the eyes as you will be playing for sometime to see progress take place in your world. One down side is the DLC really which is a valid reason for some negative reviews about this game, yet I wish to note that the game is still fun without any of the DLC. You will still have fun with the base game and if you ever wish to try something new then simply start a new family or pick up one of the DLC packs when they are on sale. I reccomend Sims 3 to those looking for a different game that requires you to have a little bit of devotion to have progress take place.

Download recommended mods such as AwesomeMod or NRaas. AwesomeMod is said to not supported in Steam version of TS3, but actually it is just because of different versioning. It should run smoothly despite warning messages on not using supported version.

CC can be made completely by you or found on the internet and made by someone else, but it gives you capability to fully customize your game, and the fact that the developers let the players create and install CC is grand. the DLCs make it possible to live in the city, or with pets, etc. Without it, if you were to let's say install a pet, it wouldn't work out. The DLCs and CC make the game much more than the base game is. As well as the many other versions of the game that you can buy, it puts so much more variety into the game and makes it so much fun to play.

If you need a challenge, start out with two or three sims, buy the biggest empty lot you can find, and make them live homeless until the two of them get enough money to build a house. To add to the challenge, don't let anyone die, and make them do well in their jobs. Good luck! I'm doing the challenge right now tbh cx

This is a complete waste of money, where I could buy about 30 games with $400 rather than getting a bunch of DLC that are a complete waste of money. I don't mind buying/paying for DLC, but when I have to pay for extra content to get the full experience, and it will cost me $400 when I have already bought the game and if I want to have couches, fridges, clothes, expansion packs, etc, it will cost real money, this just makes me question how stupid does EA think we are?

72,27352056,english,"new review:
Still downvoting cause of how shady it was. a 2 hour refund time limit eaten by an hour of loading?  Also newcomers can't really get into the game for at least 5 hours(it took me a further 3 hours to figure out the hybrid of controls i needed) in between character customization(hint! don't start out with a toddler sim in the family! you want some perks from later in game or you'll just be sitting there constantly taking care of it....my original household basically starved from lack of money to buy food...) house customization and the still outright janky controls. It tries SO hard to be done entirely with mouse and you simply can't do that. 

on top of that theres been some bizarre behavior with the game itself. For absolutely no reason i can see(i'll cancel out EVERYTHING so sims is the only thing running) the game's fps will just flat out tank. i'm not a graphics and fps freak like it seems 80% of the internet is..but it was choppy. my cursor going and appearing and disappearing over the screen choppy and sometimes seeming to almost crash.

in 20 something hours my play has been mostly boring money gathering stuff. most exciting thing was someone dying right outside my fence and the grim reaper appearing. character was brave enough to take the grave(and apparently the body and ghost...?) to the cemetery...


Original review

First off i'll say that for those that like this sort of thing go for it. But i believe the PC version has janky controls. I kept trying to rotate the camera and kept zooming in and out instead. and I'm not one for graphics (I'll happily play snes games[secret of evermore] alongside ps3 games) but theres something a bit off putting about the sims faces with certain eye and facial styles..and the hair not sitting right on some just added to it.


The real reason I've downvoted this is it took me an hour to get into the actual game itself! registering,trying to figure out how to enter the codes that were already automatically downloaded(this was my first main sims game. i played castaway before) and then the loading screens for the game ate up so much time that by the time i realized i needed to refund it asap it had already squeaked over the 2 hour limit (by probably half a minute :/ ) for refunds,,and continued squeaking by! 

 i had accidentally launched the launcher again and didn't realize it!

PROS:

-Graphics are decent, the default hairstyles and clothes aren't horrific like they are in The Sims 2
-Still fun without expansion packs
-Obviously tons of customization
-Lots of playability
-Open-world, unlike other Sims games
-Can chat with the grim reaper

CONS:

-The expansion packs!!!
-Oh my god the expansion packs!!!! Why do they cost so much!!!!
-I like the face/body sculpting idea from TS4, wish that had been a thing
-As others have mentioned, the game sort of destabilizes over time. The game lags and the visuals ""catch"" while the sound keeps going. You have to wait a sec until it fixes itself. Happens more the longer you play in a particular neighborhood
-Not all the DLC is good. I've tried all of them and some of them are a waste of time and money. I find the item packs pointless as I can just get items from modding, some of them are super unstable or just plain boring. Island Paradise (??) is pretty unstable - I still play it because I can deal with it. I recommend University Life, Supernatural, and Pets if you're going to buy some. WAIT UNTIL THEY'RE ON SALE THOUGH!!

I still recommend the game!! I've dumped so many hours into TS3. By far my favorite sims game

Pros: 
- Good character creation 
- More personality traits. 
- More job opportunities. 
- You can rotate furniture diagonally. 
- You can change how long your character stays a certain age (toddler, adult, elder, etc).
- More ways to kill them. 
- Last Sims game with pools. 
- Better storylines for the premade characters (if you're someone that really gets into the story aspect of it).
- Relationships with other sims is more complex (in a good way). 
- And much more that I can't think of off the top of my head.


Cons:
- You can't go inside buildings anymore (meaning you can't see what's inside the building). 
- Dating is kinda weird (you don't really know how good the date is going). 
- Group outings are annoying. (they just are, I'm not quite sure how to explain them). 
- Aspiration rewards aren't ""tangible"" items anymore. It's character traits or abilities to ""enhance"" your sim. 
- I still haven't been able to figure out how to get rid of roomates completely (if anyone knows how lemme know bc those b*tches are annoying as f*ck)

The Sims Pets have brought in horses as well! You can choose from a number of breeds and then cusotomise your horse's coat, bridle, sadle, and reins. The horses have different outfits for shows too!

[b]PROS: [/b] Unlike Sims 4, 2 and 3 was a big leap in features, graphics and content. There is so much that can happen, and the city continues to move even if you're just watching the events of one household. Building homes has been drastically improved, very gorgeous results can be obtained.

[b]CONS: [/b]Cash shop features have snuck into the series, a nauseating and unfortunately effective addition. Third party is invasive even after the splash screen?? Why? The biggest thing for me is the music; The Sims 1 had one of the best soundtracks, a series of hilariously peppy muzak renditions that filled the game with a  so the soulless feel of the newer ones is worth mourning. 

[b]WORTH: [/b]Pricing for expansions is absolutely asinine, and they don't go on sale often. $379.00USD for all DLC of a game released in 2009? Insanity. Still, when they DO go on sale, they go up to 75% off! Your patience will be rewarded.

[b][u]OVERALL: [/u][/b]If you like to build a world, this is the ultimate sandbox to play in. If you can step around all the microtransactions, you will find underneath, a spectacular game worth hours of your time.

Hypocrite Alert, -- I keep buying them at full retail but fuck I just cannot get enough of this.

----- STEAM TO ORIGIN USERS
Log into your Sims 3 Account via browser; register the CD Key from Steam under Account, removing the hyphens and when you open Origin (Assuming you've used the same EA Login) you'll get a prompt telling you there's Packs for you to download.

Steam Key appears - XXXX-XXXX, etc. so when you enter it on the TS3 site, it'll be XXXXXXXX
------

Get it on sale, never buy any Sims game at full retail price, if there is another game (The Sims 4) in the series.

EPs I recommend; Pets, Seasons, Generations, University Life and Supernatural. -- Ambitions if you're feeling like Professions is lacking variety - You won't get professions unless you have either Generations or Ambitions (not sure about any other EP.) 

These together add to a massive amount of replay value and is the ultimate realism (excluding SN) if you're doing Legacies, etc. Avoid Islag Paralagalot (Island Paradise; unless you're OK with having to delete, remove or modify loads of shit)

If you get pets; and I cannot stress this enough, turn Pets [b]off[/b] in story progression after two sim days to avoid lag / stuttering when spawning strays (and this game loves spawning strays).

OR - you can get Nrass - Overwatch mod. It becomes the watching eye and fixes in-game errors where you cannot. -- such as sims being stuck and not being able to find them etc, etc.

Again, if you buy this full price, just expect a lot of content but a lot of bugs, etc. [b] there are mods that contain patch fixes etc, but quite a few of them are out of date or are featured in another mod, for example ""No Fridge Shopping"" removes the option to buy food; which is what was needed, but adds silly recipes for them and can't be changed without having to download a stand-alone program to open and edit the files.",1474919714,1477516343,True,2,0,0.5026131272315979,0,True,False,False,76561198145124488,356,197,3830,0,3768,1476831061

-better graphics than previous versions
-overall more options for building sims, including personality traits
-designing houses is pretty fun! they have all new elements to choose from, from a VR set to coffee makers
-sims have more actions to choose from when interacting with others, which makes gameplay more interesting
-occupations transpire into career goals which also adds another facet to gameplay
-you can still use the 'motherlode' cheat to gain $50,000 or whatever the sum is

cons: 
-although there are seemingly more features, when designing sims you can't change their height which is annoying
-sometimes all the features can be cumbersome
-building house features are more complex than in sims 2 and seem more complicated than they should be
-gameplay can be laggy

I've only logged abput 12 hours so far. I don't remember running into any major bugs, although the gameplay can be laggy sometimes when theres a lot going on. I read some reviews and I guess you can fix some 'stuck' erros by typing in the code ""resetsim first and last name"". 
also apparently you need to enter a product code in somewhere after you purchase Sims 3 and start the game. Steam gave me a code but I have yet to enter the code in...I have no idea how to do this (am I missing something?) but I can play the game just fine, so that's weird.

I searched the Steam forums for solutions, and managed some workarounds.

You want to take the gamble? Google the problem with this game and you are welcome.

28,25773197,english,"Both Sims 2 and Sims 3 are the best games in the series, although Sims 3 has a lot of bugs. Most of them are easy to fix though. I will write a list of bugs and how to fix them, and then the major game breaking bug I'm still trying to fix.
These are glitches I ran into in my 58 hours of playtime with all expansion packs installed:

1. Sims getting stuck in a frozen position.  How to fix: use cheat ""resetsim first and last name"" 
2. University seems to be stuck in loading screen. How to fix: Edit town right before going to University, although you can also wait it out, but it loads for like 30 minutes.
3. Can't adopt stray cat or dog even though you are BFF with it. Fix not confirmed, but might work: ask stray to leave, and when it returns the adopt option will appear.
4. Sim stuck in sneak mode after getting grounded. How to fix: Either send your sim to boarding school, or go to edit town, evict your family with their house, bulldoze the empty house, place the family and house back where it was.
5. Can't use bed. How to fix: The same fix as glitch number 4. Not the boarding school fix, the eviction fix.
6. Can't get mail. How to fix: use the buydebug on cheat and testingcheatsenabled true, shift click the mail box, click object, click delete it, go to debug buy menu and buy a new mailbox.
7. Grim Reaper not taking away dead sims. How to fix: This glitch means the grim reaper is stuck, just do resetsim Grim Reaper in the cheat menu to fix it. Reset the dead sim where the reaper got stuck too if you can find the stuck reaper.
8. Bowl of food or any object getting stuck in your sim's hand. how to fix: resetsim first name and last name.
9. Certain sound effects stopped working. How to fix: save your game and load it again or relaunch the game.
10.  The worst most game breaking glitch of all, and the one I only know a one time fix for... Sims stop aging when your new generation sims have a baby, even though aging is on. I tried a few stuff that the devs said would work, but it didn't work. I fixed the issue once with the help of a youtube video, but that fix only works once. If your aging stops again, it won't work. That trick is to go to main menu and copy your saved town by clicking copy town next to the delete button, and then play the copied town. Aging will be back in working order until your 3rd generation's baby grew up into a toddler. That's where I'm stuck at the moment, and I searched for a solution for quite some time. People say either use mods or start a new game and delete the old save. I refuse to delete my save though, I played 58 hours with my family. Also, I don't want to download any mods, because the mods changes some things I don't want to change, plus I don't know how to mod games in general. I hope you found my fixes helpful though, and I hope one of you guys can give me a permanent fix that always works once the sims stop aging, because I really want to continue playing with my family. 

Why do I still recommend this game? Because it's excellent and the world feels alive and completely dynamic and open world.  It not only feels that way, it is that way. Literally. For example, while you are living your life, other sims will live theirs, and you can see them do it. They move, get married, have kids, adopt pets, age, die, go to visit others, visit the park and other places, etc, plus you can affect their lives by interacting with them, like you can break up a couple by kissing someone in front of his or her lover, etc. I bought all the expansions in the sale for about $74. Great game, lots of content, and if it's 75% off, affordable if you want to buy all dlc.  As I said, the only bad thing about the game is the bugs. The aging bug in particular. I heard some people had success moving them out and back in, but I haven't tried it yet. Anyways, if you got the money and you like sims or the genre in general, you will love this game.

44,25695536,english,"I bought the Sims (TM) 3 on sale. I have played the original one and the second one aswell so I knew what I was buying. I bought 5 DLCs aswell; Seasons, Generations, Pets, Film and Supernatural. It all came to about 20 £ or 20 USD. I have played it for sometime, just to see what it is. Here is my opinion on it:

It doesnt get more causal than this. There is no end goal at all. Just buying stuff, and making the sims interact with eachother. You can give your sims a life goal. I have not tried to achive that yet. As of now I am in a relationship. We have a dog. And he and I get to work. Then I buy stuff and then I wonder ""What am I doing?"" I dont know if I find it boring or funny or what. 

As I said, I knew what I was buying, but it was more for curriosity of the franchise that I bought it. Especially out of curioisty for the many, many, many DLCs for the game. I bought 4 DLCs and I dont understand how they work. Are they in the game? DO I have to play other maps to use it? How do they change anything? I see that some Sims are now zombies. I guess that is the supernatural one. Also there are animals running around. I guess those are the pet ones.

So the ""game"" is a... thing you do. And I guess its okay. What I find objectionable is the ingame currency thing. I have bought 5 DLCs and it feels almost like I just get the option to buy more things with REAL money. I can buy things in the Sim store with more real money (not sim money). I dont feel there is much add-on things I can buy in-game with the DLCs.

I really dont like micro-transactions in game. But I guess that is what I get for buying a EA game.
Also the whimsical soundtrack annoys me.

Now... Why do I still recommend it? Because you should know what the game is. And if you like this types of games, the drawbacks is just a reminder. If you like soap-opera games, where the charaters live theire lifes and do nothing but exist, and you dont get depressed or sucidal by it, then this game gives what it says.",1474820329,1474820927,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198091294768,50,6,248,0,238.0,1492981665

One of the best Sim games in my opinion, all the expansion packs are so lively and fun.
One of the biggest props I have to give is how much better a sims game is in general on PC,
I guess I have more time logged into the origins edition even tho I originally got this on steam.

The job choices and skills are totally fun, Generations, University Life, and Ambitions makes it so much better.
From Kung Fu Master to Video Game Designer, my wildest dreams are coming true!

It's hard to keep a family going after say the first generation dies as you'll just be repeating everything unless you have more to do. By regularly buying the expansions, the sims will continue to be enjoyable and allow you to try new things. I would suggest buying these on sale however as I don't think they are worth the £29.99 they are charged at.

Also the gameplay is slowed down considerably so if you don't have a fast upto date computer only stick to a couple of DLC's. Certain one's are better than others. Into the Future for example is good as it allows you to have new tools and enter new worlds, along with the additional accessories and lifetime achievements.

Buy the base game on sale if you want to try it out, buy the better expansion packs ONLY ON SALE if you want them, be sure to watch a review on them first before you buy!! Can't stress this enough.

UPDATE: As much as I would hate to, I may have to give this great game a downvote for EA's greediness, the dlc's are STILL 20$ each. Despite that there's a sequel AND the sequel has its own dlc. Not to mention that the game is 7 years old at this point.

But remember, EA's ""player first""",1432947419,1474501842,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198064322239,196,18,17175,0,11943.0,1523587658
99,25627500,english,"First and foremost, Sims 3 is a nice game. I don't like how much dlc it has but the base game itself is fun. Since it's on sale, I went ahead and got the bundle. I suggest you do the same before it's too late. The price for everything kept me from getting this game for the longest time and now's the time to grab everything. Personally though, I'd just grab the base game and maybe the bundle. One other complaints I have by the way is that the game tends to crash from time to time. In about 3 or so hours I've had two crashes. It doesn't break the game for me but it that bit definitely isn't fun.

On to the game itself, it's precisely what you'd think it is. A Simulation. A simulation of the day to day lives of people. I like to think of it as a doll maker that let's you take it a step further by letting you watch your characters come to life and follow their dreams, aspirations, and then die a hilariously human death. The game can feel a little off putting upon first starting it up. After my first hour, I felt rather unsure of what to do next. I had created two characters based on a favorite book of mine, ""Good Omens,"" and then had them move into this house out near the country. I contemplated whether or not this game was for me but when I was a child my sister had Sims 2. I remember enjoying it so much that it got me to stop playing World of Warcraft for a few days. That was truly quite the feat back then! After spending some more time with Sims 3, I now know why it temporarily broke my addiction back then. Because the Sims too is a fun and addictive just like my all time favorite game WoW! Now then, Sim 2 isn't Sims 3 per-say but it's just as I remember it. You got a few characters, have them go to work and do basic upkeep, form relationships, etc... Every little virtual day they grow more and more. Heck, after a few hours with this game I feel hyped up to go clean my house, continue working on my skills, and follow my career. Let's play the Sims first though heh...

All in all, I recommend Sims 3. It's a classic game franchise that's both fun and relaxing in nature. Perhaps one of the nicest things about this game is that it's a game anyone can enjoy. There's no tremendous learning curve, no brutal challenges, and no end in sight! Unless you count crashes but still... Play as you wish and there's no rush. If you've been looking for something to relax with, maybe get a little creative, or perhaps take a break from constantly dying in other games, then Sims 3 is for you!",1474501089,1474501089,True,9,1,0.625683307647705078,0,True,False,False,76561198032287659,282,12,450,0,449.0,1563166839

Of course, I've been playing the Sims 4 since it came out, and despite all the content, it's lacking more content, you get me? Then I see the Sims 3 on sale here on steam and I thought, hey, why not buy a bunch?

So far, worth it.

It's pretty nostalgic and exciting to play the Sims 3 again. There's just so much content on this one than the Sims 4 (they really need to catch up a lot). The one thing that I missed about this was the colorpicker. Creativy is much more flexible here and the imagination is endless. Then there was the open world aspect of just this huge town and city, no loading screens whatsoever. It's just.... Ahhhh, relieving.

On the other hand, the Sims 4 was a little more entertaining with all the hype graphics and awesome changes, especially the sex and gender where a sim's sex would be male but identified himself as female, or vice versa. Gameplay is less laggy for me than the sims 3, probably because it wasn't open world.

Either way, it's hard to compare and contrast both worlds, since ""one was born from the last."" They're both so good if you can really play it right.

Overall, I like them both. So worth to play The Sims 3 again.

The Sims 2 on PS2 was my favorite out of all the games, because you could control the sim instead of just telling them to do this or do that. However, my second favorite game in the francise is The Sims 3 for PC. Now, I've played more than just The Sims 3, so I can honestly I like it better than The Sims Castaway, The Sims, and The Sims 2: Pets. Note: The Sims 3 is the only one I have played on the PC, the rest were for PS2. There's just more customization, better graphics, more actions you can do, more speech choices, and more ages. I would love to get the DLC's, especially Pets and Supernatural, but as I said in the beginning of this review, it just doesn't seem worth it to me. I know the developers and everyone else involved in making the game deserve to get paid for what they worked so hard creating, but the prices aren't realistic. Most average gamers don't have the money to pay for all of these DLC's that, really, don't add near enough to the game to be worth the same amount as the actual game itself. This is why I give the game about a 8/10. If the prices of the DLC's were the same as what I paid for the game (CAD $4.99 during the 2016 Summer Sale) and they had included the option to have control over your sims like in The Sims 2, then I would give this a 10/10.

I know that alot of people do not take this game even closely seriously, and just make goofy looking characters do stupid things for a laugh, and hey, some people like this game that way. I play this game seriously, I put great detail into each one of my created sims, so much so that they hardly fit in with the other sims. I have quite a few DLCS, While not all, I would DEFINATELY Recommend Into the Future and Generations, as those offer ALOT of stuff. If you want different types of people, want to cast spells or be a werewolf, then get supernatural. Get the sims 3 With Pets to save like 10$ on the pets expansion. There are a few DLCS i reccommend that i don't have, those being Ambitions, Showtime, and Late night. This is An amazing game, While there aren't as many mods and things to add to your game as there were in the sims 2, the sims 3 makes up with that with some great new features and most of the main Expansion packs offer WAY more stuff. One downside i saw in this game was the sims 3 store. I don't want to have to Pay extra to get 1 item or 1 house in the game, i would rather have these extra things in the store for free, now that sims 4 has released, i would like to be able to play my game with more things, but sadly, that isn't possible. There are not many things that you can't get just because of sims 3 store though, most of the extra content is in expansion packs, i suggest at least 3 of them with this game, Those Being: Generations, Ambitions, Into the Future. With these, you have a TON of more options, and the other expansion packs offer way more to your game when you get bored. That wraps up this review. I give this game a very honest 10/10 rating, it is one of the few games that really deserves such a high rating, this is a masterpiece.

99,25110290,english,"The Sims 3 is a very interesting game that can be incredibly tricky to get into.

First off, don't buy all the expansions. If you play the game whilst running every single expansion at once, your performance will tank and there will be so much shit in the game that it will be impossible to play with any kind of focus.
The best way to experience THe Sims 3, in my experience, is to install the Seasons, Ambitions and Generations along with any of the stuff packs that interest you, if any (though most of them aren't worth it.) Your game will still run silky smooth, you'll have loads to do and your sims' lives will be flushed out to the best degree possible without the sheer amount of content becoming overbearing.

I know many people think that EA is cheating them by splitting the game up into 20 some expansions, but it's not meant to be played all at once. It's designed for you to pick the expansions that interest you most, playing with all of them simply isn't possible unless you really enjoy consistent lag spikes.

The game has a lovely sandbox feel to it. You can make a sim that looks like you and see how your children could end up looking 20 generations down the line, or you could make a fat black man with a voice that could break glass named Nethaniel Ticklehack that really enjoys setting other people on fire and sleeping with balding men in his spare time.

This made me laugh so hard my sides hurt!
     About the memory that made me cringe. This time I was being kind to me best friend, and she wanted to play the sims with me. well, we made our sims, and I got up to use the restroom, within 5 minutes, she managed to start a fire.

Is it buggy as heck? Yes (but theres a fan made mod called ""overwatch"" that easily solves it).... plus the less DLC you buy the less buggy it is

Is there long load times? Yes, if you are like me and ""gotta catch them all"" DLC... again, this can be fixxed with overwatch or having a better computer (with all the dlc the game is about 30-40 gigs (my wife has 3 dlc's and the game makes it 12 gigs).

Are there microtransactions? Technically yes, but you can disable seeing them and they are ussually for purely cosmetic items or don't really have an impact on the gameplay (you can also use fan made mods to get your own unique items) and basically function identically to the DLC.......its the Sims....your either gonna kill your own virtual family or raise them for several generations...... i am pretty sure its not a deal breaker for you if you don't buy the ""Monte Carlo costume pack"".

93,24533558,english,"Ok my play time doesn't actually show how many hours I've sank into this game just how many I'v accumlated to buy extra content from steam on the cheap. First off your sims 3 codes you buy off Steam now works with EA origins. This is important if you previously own sims packs. Steam makes you buy another copy of the Sims 3 to buy the extra content. Not cool steam its livable. On the good note; during the steam mega sales you can pick up more content for about 4.99 - 9.99. I have all expansions all store content and am missing only one world and a handful of stuff packs. 

In general I love this game. I've owned it since it came out. Purchased most of my content pre-steam and amazed how cheep you can get stuff for now.  I've scored most of the store content by watching adds on EA and about all my content was purchased for free.  Now that steam has its new controller I am slowly migrating my content onto steam. 

This is the only sandbox you will ever play that lets you actually make your own video game in whatever style you want. You download the world creator tool and you have hours of interesting things you can do with your game. Program in story lines and challanges for your sims and you have a whole new game. You have the ability to generate maps and new worlds. You get mod content and the sky is the limit.  Lets face facts the sims 3 is just wierd and its not for everyone. How many games do you know that allow you to have ninjas who work as a perfessional jockeys riding unicorns and only eat tofu cheesesteaks?  

Now for some of the negative reviews I'm reading. I'm running a top of the line graphics card I play the game on highest levels. I do not have the new nvidia pascals. Only a 970. I have no issues at all. Most of the people who are griping do not realize that there internet cache actually plays a roll on how well the game runs when its in online mode. You donot have to use online mode unless your working on showtime achievements or your planning on buying something in game.  All players need to regularly clean out internet explorer even if you don't use internet explorer to maintain a healthy game.  Because it is how the game originally connect to EA. Most of the lagging etc comes from IE beeing the worst of all the browsers and no ability to change this in your code.  Another issue is too many expansion and stuff packs on at one time. While I run all expansions and all my content most pcs are not capable of doing this. EA suggest limiting how many packs if you want quicker load times.  I don't bother because I use a special mod called Overwatch that peserves the integrity of my game by optimizing the game in other ways that EA didn't think of. Mostly by removing lost sims stray horses and animals and cars that your sims careless forget to drive back home to there houses.  This makes the who game run much smoother and keeps the game from becomming currupt do to user neglect/error.  Mods make this game you can find nearly any type of mod you can imagine.

I bought this while it was on sale and I would definitely reccomend that. During the next sale I will be buying one or two expansion packs like Ambitions.

6,24413391,english,"   Having spent more money on this game than any other - indeed somewhere in excess of fourteen times as most of my purchases I'm - disappointed.  Firstly it has either not crashed at all or only crashed once on a Windows 10 machine with virtually every extra installed (I went for it in last Steam sale).  But...

    1)  The towns now feel completely depopulated.  Particularly difficult in the nightlife city where every second NPC is a celeb and your interactions are limited with them.  Neighbours just don't run or pass by as much, colleagues from work don't come home, and the time clock moves so quickly that you can rarely interact with anyone long enough to have an impact. 
   2)  The moving to real time now messes badly with character development.  In Sims 2 when you left your house time effectively froze so when you came back it was the same time you left, no matter how long you were away.  This enabled you to have 30 - 40 hours in a day - and far easier to get stuff done.  Here it is real time throughout - but punitively slow.    Showering, going to the toilet, and cooking and eating some waffles now takes two hours.  There simply aren't enough hours in the day - even with shortened work hours.
    3)  Building anything is a complete pain in the butt.  In the Sims 2 you'd simply select a lot and then place the pre made building there.  Having a task for my Sim to go to a bar and there not being a bar in my Sim's world (and they can no longer transfer - major downer) I tried to build one. And tried.  And tried.  Even after searching the internet I was no wiser.
    4) Everything is very expensive.  You have to rise high in your career before you can do much more than cover your taxes.
    5)  Loading is even more ponderous than Sims 2 although the spot an object game (flawed) helps the time pass.
    6)  After spending a LARGE amount of money on the game it was disappointing to see so many items still shut off behind a Pay Wall.

    This is not a bad game.  More hours in I might appreciate it more.  But it is A game, no matter how thinly E.A. slice it.  At 75% off in the sale I spent more on Sims 3 than a brand new AAA game.  And it's not as good as Skyrim which I bought for £5.00.  Few games are but still - E.A. charge VERY HEAVILY INDEED for this game.  For the money they are taking this should be an unalloyed joy... and it isn't.

    E.A. seem far more focussed on gouging ever more cash from their customers than giving them great gaming experiences.  After this I wouldn't buy Sims 4 at 90% off.

However, the DLCs and paid stuff burn my wallet. So if you are considering buying this game, be sure to buy on Sales. I don't like EA with this reason on the top - You have to pay DLCs much more than the game! And without the DLCs you play nothing.

Another thing, I think Sims 3 is better than Sims 4 becuase you can always have a full view of the whole world, as well as where your Sims are, how they moving etc. This is extremely important expecailly when you are playing more than one Sims at the same time.

Pros: Addicting gameplay full of action and drama
         Satisfying to see your house(hold) build up and become
         even better and larger
         Great maps and lots of features
         And you have a goal, so it's not just the usual ""live your life""
         and just repetitive gameplay. It changes, the more you play,
         the more drama, and it gets more exciting the deeper you get
         into it and the choices you make reflect upon you. It makes
         you happy that you did that certain thing.



Cons: In-Game Purchases
          Not having everything and
          having to buy them with ""Sim Points"" or real money
          DLCS costing the price of the game, and the ""Seasons"" aspect
          being implemented into a DLC. Honestly the ""Seasons"" really
          should've came with the game.
          No changing character height. (You only get taller as you age)
          


Overall:
       Overall this is a great game and worth the price, if you really want a DLC,
       do what I did, wait for a discount, but if you can't wait, it is worth the price.
       I would also recommend that you buy this game WITH a DLC Pack, it's only
       10 more dollars, so if you have $30 dollars on you, go for it. Either way
       even without the DLC it's a great game. If I had to rate it out of 10 it would be
       probably a 8.5/10, because they didn't implement those aspects on the base game
       instead, you had to buy the DLC. That is why I took away 1.5 points. The base game
       needed more aspects that were important to the player.

Short version: 
Buy the game during a sale (not for the full price) if your focus is not on building fancy houses with a lot of different furniture  but on interactions with other sims, career and the ""real"" gameplay. 

Long version:
I bought the main game - during the summer sale - and got a pretty good game for 9 euros. I have no dlcs because I was not willing to buy the ""full gaming experience"" for about 130 euros (summer sale price!). 

So, what is good (compared to former sims games)?
+ Nice open world card without loading screens
+ more interpersonal / social / skill features
+ you got a cellphone - you can even take photos with it (what a time to be alive!)
+ game works fluently under windows 10
+ even going to work is now much more interesting as you can decide whether you just wanna hang around at work doing nothing (with the negative consequences) or you can work your butt off to get some goodies

What are the Cons?
- You don't have that much equipment to equip your home
- The first 3 items of each category e.g in the buying mode are things you have to buy in the online store if you want to have it - so you are permanently told what you _could_ get but you don't have 
- The game is from 2009 - from a time where such games had very .... let's call it ""interesting"" ... graphics... Even the graphics from The ""original"" Sims weren't that odd. It's edgy and stuff.. just like they tried to be cool (and maybe they were in 2009 but today it seems just odd)

Conclusion:
I really liked the ""original"" Sims and the Sims 3 somehow reminds me of my first experiences with The Sims (I didn't like The Sims 2 very much even though I had all DLCs). However - the Sims 3 has a open world so you can walk from neighbour to neighbour, from park to fitness center and so on which is quite nice. And don't forget the much more interactions with other people - even if they aren't always that logical, but somehow funny:

- a burglar breaks into your home
- he gets caught by the police because of my Sim's alarm
- my Sim runs panicked into the room where police and burglar are having a huge fight
- the burglar falls in love with my Sim (because f**** you thats why)

As I've said in the short version: buy the game for some bucks (during a sale) - I would not recommend to buy it for the full price - and try it out. But note: If you want to play The Sims 3 only for equipping your home as majestic as f*** than you won't have much fun with the main game because there aren't so many items.",1467656640,1467656885,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198247642126,42,4,2173,0,475.0,1588289828

Seriously though apart from the guilt factor of spending so much time on creating your Sim and house when you should be, you know, reading a book or going outside, this is a great game. Of course it's laggy and you don't get steam achievements but it's Sims what do you expect? Just be thankful you have it on PC and not the unspeakable disgrace on consoles. Because, occasional lag aside, this is the best game EA has to offer in my eyes and you can't help but laugh at the glitches, faces, ""memories"" and letters.

Also, the player must purchase DLC for BASIC simulation areas like weather, beach visits, careers, etc.  The whole thing is a pretty annoying money grab.
It's completely annoying that the player spends anywhere from $20 to $60 on a game and the game constantly pesters the player for more money.  
I own many games and DLC that never pester the player for more money.  Sims 3 is VERY unusual in this regard.

Got into relationship and married. Moved to her huge house as the only male living with 4 female roommates. 2 of them were ugly, so I trapped them inside the walls to be hidden. Too bad the wife wasn't rich either, but the house was nice and expensive. I made one of the female roommates romance with a random chick. They got married and had a wedding party at the neighbourhood swimming pool. Right before the ceremony some guy drowned in the pool. Everyone was shocked, but the ceremony was held, no matter what. Made this chick move in with her newly wed bride and made the 2 ugly roommates to move with her. Now there were just my sim and his wife. Knocked her up. Moved to a smaller house and sold the old one. Made nice amount of money by it. Still not having a rich wife so I went to visit the Landgraab family. Romanced with the old rich lady and made her break up with her husband. But then she found out I was cheating on my wife and things went bad. She didn't want to date anymore. Tried to romance with the mother of the Alto family, but she didn't like my sim. Went home, insulted my pregnant wife and broke up with her. Let her live with me anyways but didn't buy her own bed, so she could only sleep on the couch with her huge belly. Went to meet the Goth family. Chatted up the old lady and made her break up with her husband. Invited her over to my place and romanced her while my ex-wife happened to have our babyboy. Went steady with the old lady Goth in front of my ex-wife and son. Made my ex-wife move away with my newborn son. Now I'm on my way to get married with the old lady Goth and then I must kill her.

59,23877652,english,"Right now I'm addicted to this game.
The Sims 3 is probably the most fun I've had playing a Steam game since Garry's Mod. 

The gameplay is simple; you create your own Sim, whether it be yourself, a celebrity, one of your best friends, your boss, coworkers, mom, dad; the possibilities are endless. You then buy a house, furnish it, and you are all set. You can even have multiple Sims in your house as well.

This game is basically a life simulator; give birth, nurse a baby, send him/her to school, get a job, grow old, and die. There is a big and blooming mod community, so tons and tons of mods are available to download. The graphics are a bit dated, and the Sims look more like Barbie or Ken dolls, but the gameplay makes up for it.

There are multiple expansion packs, but try to get them on sale because with a Canadian price of $19.99, that is way too much for only minor changes to the game. The expansion packs are only $4.99 CAD now, so try to get them all before the sale ends.

Pros:
+VERY addicting
+Mods
+Seeing what your Sims do, how their kids do in school
+Easy-to-use interface
+Lots of expansion packs
+Realistic animations

Cons:
-Expansion packs cost way too much money, Into the Future for $39.99?
-The fact it's an EA game
-Graphics look dated, especially clothes, they look pixelated and murky
-The fact Sims do whatever they want, regardless of your control

Overall, extremely fun game, and you will probably get hooked. I say buy this for full price, but if you find it on sale, get it then. :)

After his first day he met a girl who he got on pretty well with until he found out she was married and Craig beat her up (because of the player). Craig met another girl and they became good friends. Eventually Craig invited her over and that's when things went to the extreme. Craig lost his virginity and became a father. After that, his girlfriend had a baby girl and Craig had his birthday. Craig and the player knew that he needed to get married so Craig asked his girlfriend on a date and proposed. The wedding was only two minutes and Craig had a family.

This is how it works: You buy DLC to have extra stuff, then EA makes items within that very DLC you just bought unusable saying you have to pay more to get it.

- You can age up sims before they are due to age up e.g. you can make a baby a toddler staight away
- You can make new outfits for sims who are aged as a child or older whilst playing the game
- The sims look much more lifelike
- You can get your sims to brush their teeth
- You can name teddy bears and goldfish 

Things I don't like about The Sims 3 -
- You can only play one family
- The option to pay actual money for furniture shouldn't exist especially with how expensive expansion packs are..
- There's been a random guy standing outside my sims house for a few days..
- You have the option to follow your sim to work, school or to give birth at the hospital but you can't go inside..

69,23259116,english,"♥ You can do anything.

Want to have a polygamist family? Want to roll around in money? Want to travel to Egypt, steal treasure from tombs, and have an affair? 

With Sims 3, you can. If you only have the base game and none of the DLC's, you can easily get mods for the game that will add an endless amount of things: instant money, incest, custom jobs, etc. With Sims you [i]can[/i] have the character live the life you imagine for them. 

♥ Relationships.

This is by far why I've played Sims 3 for as many hours as I've had. In Sims 3 you can find a boyfriend, marry him, cheat with his brother, and divorce - all in the same day. Sims 3 doesn't have morals and doesn't want you to have them either. 

For that reason, you can cheat as much as you want, have as many kids as you want, or embrace the single, celebrity rockstar life. If you want to have an arch nemesis and revel in kicking their trash can, you can. 

Or you can be the seemly modest grandmother who writes erotic tales at night and takes care of her grandchildren, plays chess with her husband at the park, and bask in your retirement during the day. 

♥ Everything is up to you.

From the design of the house to the look of your Sim to their likes and dislikes, you control anything and everything. You aren't limited in any area for even their needs you can control. If you use a cheat code, you can easily make their needs (hunger, sleep, etc) to 100% meaqning you'll have more time to focus on the fun aspects of their life. 

With Sims, the character is entirely in your hands. 

✘ This game lags.

A lot. It's known for crashing without warning, freezing at any vital moment, and can be quite fussy to run. I've learned that when you first launch the game - DON'T DO ANYTHING. Just let it play through the cutscene and go to the main menu. Don't try to skip it, don't try to rush it.

The same goes for when it freezes and lags. 

Otherwise it's going to sulk and quit on you just when your Sim becomes famous or is about to have their baby. 

✘ The base designs are...bleh.

I used to think they were amazing - the blocky hair, the ill fitting clothes, the ugly looking earrings. However once I discovered the world of mods, I learned how awful the base items are. Unfortunately installing too many mods can severely lag your game - so you'll have to be strict about which ones are worth keeping and which aren't. 

✘ There are bugs.

A lot of them. University can cause errors with assigning you to ""study"" when you aren't enrolled in school, a Sim that is aging up can end up with their bones disjointed and their head all stretched, your Sim can decide they can't walk forwards because dust is in their way, etc.

Pros:
The Graphics are decent for a game realesed in 2009 nothing great but not hideous
The Gameplay is fun and very and addicting (as you can see by my play time.
I have run into very little bugs that I have found (I have a very good PC so I can't speak for those with worse computers)
You can buy it on steam and I don't think you need origin (ew)
Good amount of content in the base game

Negatives:
$380 worth of DLC really EA
Long loading screens.....
Having pets or seasons or alot of things in everyday life is $20

34,22096195,english,"[h1]My thoughts on The Sims 3[/h1]

[h1]The Port[/h1]

The port is a very interesting one. The options menu is very buggy with the settings sometimes resetting to default as well as sound options taking a bit to actually change or just straight up not changing at all. The video options are varied and nice as well as descriptive but not very informative in terms of certain options, such as edge smoothing, as well as there being no settings for keybinds or mouse sensitivity, besides mouse inverting. Overall the port isn't bad besides some awkward Windows 10 support and performance related issues.

[h1]The Graphics/Performance[/h1]

The graphics for the game are not the greatest with low res foliage, decent at best textures, awkward lighting and some rather bad modeling. That being said this game was from 2010, was completely open world and obviously needed to compensate for what it was offering. The performance on the other hand is very not good. Actually running the game is absolutly not problem it's very easy to max out the game on even some low end systems but the game is an absolute stuttery mess, even on lower settings. Many people have reported lots of stuttering on high end and low end systems alike. It's a big problem with the game that I can't let slip. It's not very stable at all with its performance

[h1]The Story/Atmosphere/Characters[/h1]

Non-existant story but the atmosphere of being in a lively environment is very much there but that's all I have to say. I can't really comment on the characters all that much.

[h1]The Controls[/h1]

Direct mouse control with keybinds for camera movement and some menu controls. Besides a feeling of mouse acceleration nothing to really say about this.

[h1]The Gameplay[/h1]

The gameplay is absolutely phenomenal. This is an amazing life simulation game that really feels like you're taking part in, and leading, someone and really being that person. The animation system is absolutely fantastic, besides some bad animation transition, the character interaction is complex and unique and the game as a whole is extremely well done. The AI is a bit stupid and not very good but I can excuse that for how good the rest of this game is. The characted customization is the best I've ever seen, besides maybe Black Dessert Online, with in depth characted facial construction and amazing clothing customization, with the option of creating your own clothing. The only fault is the lack of hair-styles, facial hair, hats and the really crappy body hair and tattoo options but those can be excused.

[h1]The Conclusion[/h1]

This game is a fantastic game with many flaws but I would no doubt recommend this to anyone looking for a good simulation game to throw on to waste some time. Not to mention it's one of the good EA games that are on Steam so there's a major plus.

What impresses me the most is how indepth you can make not only your sim, but their house too.  The DLC as usual was woefully bought, but enhanced the game to greater depths than the base game could have ever achieved.  With this being said though, the Sims themselves are only ever so slightly smarter in their world, they still need much care and attention( which for me who likes to only build dream homes, finds quite frustrating when all my sim wants to do is eat and watch tv..............sounds a lot like me on the weeks) Never mind that last comment.

The Sims 3
The Sims 3: University Life
The Sims 3: Ambitions

Playing on Laptop, Windows 10, NVIDIA GEFORCE 940, no mods installed, very vanilla

Been playing The Sims 3 for two weeks now. I played it two times with the same customized household. Only because the first save was deleted when I reformatted my laptop, so I have to repeat it ALL OVER again. (Imagine my patience.) 

My findings:
- game still crashes even after it's reformatted, even if I followed all the troubleshooting steps mentioned on both Steam and The Sims 3 forums
- still end up getting my data corrupted after leaving The Sims University and going home, even after I followed all the do's and don'ts of what should be done before and after graduating

The second one I mentioned above, seems to happen after my Sims get their second degree. Their lifetime wish is to be a Major Master (three degrees). 

My work around for this is: once they got graded and affirmed that they passed their degrees, I save them as a new household. Then, I move that new household to a house in town, and playing it as a new game. I haven't gone past that. Meaning, I haven't explored any other glitches after that.

Because I didn't play the game for a day now due to the sadness of loosing their friends. They still have all their money, items, skills, and degrees. But they lose their friends, which takes time to build!

I say, don't get too attached playing the game.

But why not? I loved The Sims and The Sims 2. It's addicting that I don't even recall the last time I ate or took a bath. But, well, if you want to play the game, you should:

= be okay with it crashing sometimes, then talking at your computer, praying for it to work continuously this time.
= still love the game even after the number of times that you tried to troubleshoot some glitches.
= be patient if you end up having your data corrupted by some unknown game force.
= still love the game even after you've read thousands of threads and comments about game bugs, glitches, and all that stuff that you didn't know and researched before... because you just really really want to play the game.

I'll finish this review, and play it again. I have to. They still need to have a job and a family and all the blahblah that this game satisfies my mundane life.",1456580351,1456580351,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198284142889,14,1,3987,0,3752,1597228772

[h1]CONS[/h1]
- DLCs are all the same price- some bring some lackluster minor content, while others bring a whole new game. It depends on the DLC- oh, and not to mention, the game is basically worthless without the Pets DLC. At least, in my personal opinion it is. The only reason I'm not playing the Sims 4 is because there is no Sims 4: Pets released.
- After a certain amount of time, the game lags and freezes up. Sims get stuck on things, and if you can't find out who they are and do the required 'resetSim [firstname] [lastname]' cheat, it'll move at a snail's pace on even the best computer.

[h1]NEUTRALS[/h1]
= I.. umh. Limited customization options for the pets? Also, if you give your sims high free will they will do nothing but stuff the dog's face full of treats or spam pet the horse. It never ends. N E V E R.
= DLC's are needed to make the game interesting if you aren't doing challenges. Some things should just have been added to the game since they're so minor. Also, where are the patches? No? They've moved onto the Sims 4 without fixing some of these major bugs the game has had since day one? Oh? Really? That's okay. Toootttalllyyy okay.
= Aliens, no. Nobody asked for you. Stop abducting my Sims while I'm trying to spam level my Logic skill to get a promotion. Stop.

[h1]PROS[/h1]
+ What the sims is known for: CUSTOMIZATION. You can make your sims as realistic as you want, as crazy as you want, as stupid-looking as you want, as insane as you want, as perfect as you want, as.. well, nearly anything that you want. It's one of the game's core features- to grow and develope the family you have produced over many hours of hardships and learning, only to have things set back or your only sim killed by a meterorite in the lands of China. Yes, that actually happened. Not fun. Not. Fun. Otherwise was okay!
+ Random things. You may only start out with one town and you DO need the DLC's to do most of the interesting things, but otherwise it's pretty grand. If you get the DLCs, say, one every four months, the game actually has a long lifespan. Try to go for 'Generations,' 'Pets,' or 'World Adventures' first. Those are just my personal reccomendations- not even I have all of them yet. Someday. Someday...
+Traits and interactions are fun, and can cause a few good laughs every now and then. Yes, it can be unrealistic- you can get married the same day you enter a steady relationship with someone- but really, it's the Sims. What else do you expect?
+ There's mods for.. just about anything. This game has been modded to hell and back. Plus, on top of that, the amount of challenges this game has(see '100 Baby Challenge,' it's one of the most common ones) causes replayability. Just remember to save! 
+ You can bribe Death with a flower.
+ Unlucky sims are basically immortal- they cannot die from any way other than natural causes.
+ Did I hear genertics and hidden traits, anyone?
+ I'm going to add more later, but this is a good game. If you haven't played it already, or seen a video on it.. I'm so, so sorry for whatever rock you've lived under.",1455669056,1455669056,True,2,0,0.541984736919403076,0,True,False,False,76561198072031424,279,8,63923,0,16598,1585596802

Pros:

- Game play was fun

- Easy to understand

- Little learning curve

- Can spend hours playing

Cons:

- All the extra DLC stuff makes my mouth water, but too pricey as hell

- Interface can be overwhelming sometimes

- Time consuming (good or bad thing)

- Can begin to feel like a grind game fast

---

Conclusion: 

It's a decent game, good graphics, re-playablilty which is huge for myself personally, and you can get a lot of fun hours out of this game, though it tends to feel like a grind after a while. A lot of other aspects of this game I would really like to try out, but it's all pay to play, which makes me sour right off the bat. 

All in all I would rank this game at about: 5.5/10

A Solid State Drive is a must for this game, else the load times are just too long. It's gradually matured from a, well, bit of an empty shell, into a fully fledged game, which I suppose is how any game in The Sims series tends to go. 

I still lament the loss of player-buildable ""downtown"" areas. Yes there are some, but most are now ""rabbitholes"" that your sim dissappears into and interacts with via the right click menu, rather than directly. I liked designing restaurants, clubs etc. Ah well. 

The new features are welcome however, such as the design a style feature. Almost infinite customisation, which means I can design different style interiors rather than always resorting to the same two or three sets of furniture or wallpapers.

94,20715907,english,"The Sims 3 is a great game. Many people will say that The Sims 2 or The Sims 4 is better. The Sims 3 is the best Sims game because it has open world. I can't imagine a Sims game without open world. Open world allows you to travel to anywhere in the town. After the initial two-three loading screens, the only loading screens you'll encounter are when you use a mirror to change appearance, a dresser to plan outfit, or if you move, and even then these loading screens are quite short. You can customize your Sims fully, with all of the basics and many more clothing, accessories, hairstyles, and outfits available. Whatever you don't have, you can most likely get from The Sims Store, which you need an account for. You use your money to gain SimPoints, the currency used. While The Sims Store is overpriced and it will cost hundreds of dollars to buy all of the items, if you want to make an emo Sim, you will be able to buy all of the emo clothes, haircuts, and furniture without spending too much money.


Enough about The Sims Store. The Sims 3 is great because of the endless possibilities. You can have an amazing variety of Sims, all with different personalities (which are fully customizable,) careers, houses, families, and Lifetime Wishes. The game runs very smoothly on my computer. There are also Skills and Opportunities, somewhat similar to real life. Opportunities will randomly be presented to you, with a brief description of the Opportunity, usually with some humour added in too. Opportunities often require you to do something in exchange for a reward. You may have to visit certain areas, fix broken objects, make food for certain establishments or Sims, or stay in late after work ends. Rewards vary, and may include better relationships with co-workers, bosses, or other Sims, job or school performance, Simoleons (in-game money,) or Skill gain. Opportunities often have a deadline. Skills are like skills in real life. Skills include Writing (typing), Painting, Gardening, Cooking, Handiness, Charisma, and many more. You can build Skills by practicing, which is different for each Skill, or by doing tasks that improve that Skill, as each Skill is useful for a specific task. You can also build Skills by reading books, watching TV channels, learning from other Sims or by having certain Traits.


Overall, The Sims 3 is a good game that has unlimited replayability. It has its cons, however. The same old Sims get boring quickly, as Sunset Valley, the town that comes with the game, always has the same Sims when it is first started. However, the starting Sim's babies and descendants can vary. By creating an account, you get another town for free. A few other cons are that in a household of 8 (the maximum amount) Sims, it is really hard to have fun. You are constantly taking care of their Needs, which are Hunger, Bladder, Hygiene, Fun, Social, and Energy, and the rest of the time you are building Skills or Relationships, or improving job performance. Also, the stuff packs and expansion packs don't add very much, and are overpriced. The Sims Store is also overpriced.",1453603760,1453603760,True,2,0,0.510902225971221924,0,True,False,False,76561198130309360,68,8,18601,0,3552,1600328236

GRAPHICS
Graphics wise Sims 3 is not impressive, the game is pretty old as it is. Nothing really special about those graphics. If you looked close enough you might be able to see the pixels. The few water sources that there are in the game the water effect is really trippy and ugly. Hope your not one of those graphics only matter people because you'll hate this game for eternity.
6.5/10
GAMEPLAY
The Sims 3 is a life simulator and well it does a great job of being so. The game mainly consists of doing well whatever you like! When you first start up the game you create youre character and pick his traits and 'Lifetime Wish"" which you try to complete during youre lifetime. Quick Tip; If you don't wanna worry about dying of age, go ahead and go to Options and turn aging off. After that you pick a starter home and you start youre great life journey. My character is a weird hybrid of an artist/painter/gardener/athlete who never leaves his house, but what you make of youre Sim is all up to you. I love the gameplay and it's amazing.
10/10
REPLAY VALUE
There's not much to say here, IT'S HUGE. You can play this game over and over and over again and never get bored of it. Oh and if you do get bored of it there's a LOAD of DLC you can get (20$ each DLC). Maybe the DLC is a bad thing but it really adds a ton of new features. Like one DLC is Back to the Future themed, while another is a Paradise island theme, really the DLC'S add a ton of depth into this game.
9/10
Story
Well you sorta make your own story with this game, I will not score it.
Audio
The sims have there own weird language that they speak in. It's really interesting. The music gets INSANELY repetitive and got on my nerves quite fast. The rest of this games sound effects are mediocre and nothing to get hyped about.
7/10
TL;DR
Sims 3 is definitely worth a buy if you're interested in simulation games and a game that aged well and has lots of replay value. Though the sound effects and graphics aren't good at all.

Suddenly, they both wish for a first child. ""Fine. I'll just spend a few thousand to make an awesome bedroom for this wonderful kid"", I said to myself. So I did. I let them try for baby. After a few seconds, nothing. The next morning, nothing. No child. They were unsuccesful. So I made them try again the next night. Again, nothing. I start gathering some lifetime hapiness on both of them, to invest in the fertility trait, while trying again every night. Each night, nothing! This was becoming a joke. Finally, I get the fertility trait for each of them, and they prove succesful. 1 child. 

5/7
- Blood, sweat and tears required for 1 kid.

Just kidding, there's more. 
I let the baby be born, while making sure it lives the best life it can (which is almost literally nothing), and it became a toddler. Awesome. Trained it to shit, walk, and talk as quick as I could, and made it the happiest kid ever. Finally the time comes for this kids birthday. It was the transition from toddler to child. I couldn't wait. I had a party room set up, music pumping, varieties of food, a birthday cake, many different activities to make this the best party ever. I even adopted a puppy, as this childs 'birthday present'. I was stoked! Everyone arrives, everyone has a great time, and then I decide to make it cake time. Everyone gathers, as the toddler blows out the candles, and everyone spins those spinny things and cheers. Those moments felt like minutes waiting for this awesome kid to grow. He did. Everyone cheered, and everyone went for cake. This is when everything turned to shit. Like, not normal shit, ""shit"" shit. Anyway, About halfway through my new child's cake, is when one of the guests stepped up, and died. Of old age. She died, right there, at the kids birthday party. Right there at the dining table. Everyone freaks out. Then, someone else dies. Old age again. I stared at my horrified sims, and thought, ""Damn, EA"". As everyone gets up to mourn, a third sim dies. OId age yet again.

The sims 3 is very fun gameplay and it is very open to do pretty much anything you want.There are a lot of wonderful and clever aspects to the game that have not been done in the previous games. Although it is fun it is very annoying that the game only comes with one map out of the 4 available as well as there are countless amounts of dlc which a lot of them should not need to be paid for. I dont understand why they don't just sell the game at a higher cost like the normal 59.99 and down. or maybe give options to purchase the dlc for the game as a package deal with the game.

just to have them put out another game that takes away all the features you are used to just so they can sell them to you again in the same dlc you purchased for the last one.  So I decided ill just wait and buy the complete version of sims 4 when it comes out.

The only reason I bought it is that I don't bother with downloading pirated copies anymore and the game was on 'sale'. 

Anyway apart from the absurd pricing (not even AAA titles released around 2009 still cost this much) the DLC grab is the worst I've ever seen (compared to it Payday 2 and Rome Total War II shine for their decency) and the game is so incomplete without any of them that you will have to purchase at least one, or get a cracked copy of it.

Finally the only reason I'm wasting my time writing this, really, is that as I mentioned above the game doesn't work properly. Compatibility problems with W7 and 8 are massive and the troubleshooting required is at times just too much. I've been able to play some 4 hours and after relaunching the game everything turned wrong. First the costant crashing every 10 minutes, then every 5 and finally the freezing (every 2 or so). I tried to update again my gpu drivers only to find out the game does not recognise it and pick the built in intel card (playing on a laptop). Not saying the game will never work, but like Bethesda did with FO3 a label stating there are issues with newer systems and graphic cards should be added to the store page.

After so many years few will still buy this game but for the ones considering that option, just stay way. This game is begging to be downloaded ('illegally').",1451325988,1451374850,False,71,7,0.622557759284973145,2,True,False,False,76561198059000255,136,51,1973,0,1538,1565096282

I'm very impressed with the game. It's an amazing one. What I dislike the most are the huge and boring loading times even with a computer that is overpowered compared to the requirements of the game. That's kind of annoying. But I like the 'open world' thingy. Wish they could have optimized better so it's less laggy and less long when we have loading screens. That's probably another busted work by EA sadly.

Overall, this game is lot of fun. It's very first time I have fun making the Sims live. In previous game, I was mainly building house and making beautiful neighborhood. In this game, I enjoy making my Sims live their life a bit more.

PROS:
-The requirements to play The Sims 3 are very low
-You basically have full control of the Sims, which ofc is limited to the features of the game
-There are optional expansion packs available to, well, expand your features
-The Exchange provides additional (and free) downloadable content that are made from other players
-Funny stuff happens while playing
-Basically an endless amount of fun! (aka it has good replay value)
-Get creative with it, no gameplay can be exactly the same because different scenarios happen

CONS:
-The expansion packs are pricey and sometimes don't even add too much to the game
-My Sims has glitched out a few times when trying to socialize with a huge group of Sims (it might just happen to me though)

71,16287897,english,"EDIT: After going back and re-reading my review I noticed that it was more of a DLC rant than review of the Sims 3. I will now attempt to rectify that. For more on the game, go to the paragraph that starts with ""Gameplay:"".

Let's establish the difference between ""Expansion Packs"" and ""DLC""

Expansion Packs are like mini sequals to games. They add new features and expand upon the old ones. An example of a Sims 3 Expansion Pack would be World Adventures or Island Paradice. These two added signifigant ammounts of content to the game, as well as add new features like treasure hunting, and exploring, as well as adding new areas and features to base game items, such as the training dummy, and board splitter.

DLC is usually much smaller than an expansion pack in that the ammount of content added is neglegable to the overall experience of the game. This can be seen in things like texture packs, or more specifically to the Sims 3, ""Stuff Packs"". Or the cutting of features such as the ability to make your own towns, and replacing that with the ability to buy more (non customizable) Pre-made towns.

*Just making the quick note that while you can still create custom towns for the Sims 3, it has been made a far more tiedious process, requireing you to download a seperate program with a less user friendly interface, as opposed to the town creation system used by the Simes 2.

In short, Expansion Packs are reasonably priced additions that improve the overall quality of the game, while DLC is a form of nickel and dimeing justified by the additions of insignifigant content, and should never be the same price as an expansion pack, or full game.

Gameplay: The Sims 3 does not make any great bounds in inovation from the Sims 2 (The sims are a bit smarter, they won't drown if you take the ladder out of a pool now). It's still the same Point & Click style ""God Simulator"" where you can create your own sims (less customization options for vanilla, more added with each expansion pack), create your own house or customize a pre-made one. (While there is decent variety in furnishings etc. the developers still push the microtransactions with an in-game ""Sim Points"" store, and DLC page).

You can still do (more or less) all the same things you could do with your sims from previous games, go to school, take several different carear/job paths (more interesting options with DLC), go to university (DLC), get married and start a family (streamlined without DLC), or even more outlandish things like go to the future (DLC), go live on an island with mermaids (DLC) Become a fantasy creature, things from fairies, werewolves, etc (DLC). Become a preformer (Limited options without DLC). 

You can also controll the longevity of your sims. Change the lifespan of a sim from 30 days to 1000, your choice.

The game is owned by EA. EA has it's own gaming platform (Origin), since EA has it's own platform, it doesn't bother to optimize or patch any of it's steam variants (See Sims Medieval). So if you wan't to play this you're going to have to use Origin (same with any game made by EA really.)",1433924900,1448649210,False,43,4,0.619830489158630371,1,True,False,False,76561198087750744,290,24,29123,0,17038,1589151336

I'm sure that there are plent of other reviews that will tell you all about that, though. This review here is a cautionary tale, though most of you likely won't need it.
There are those of you, however, who won't consider ahead of time what a money-suck this game will end up being. Do not be ashamed to admit this, I myself have this problem.
You see, I'm a broke college student. Living off about $200 a month for food, I have a very bad habit of just not eating for days on end so that I can buy video games instead. The Sims 3 was the first game I bought on Steam. Prior to that, I was a dreaded Xbox gamer.
I bought the base game + pets for 29.99. Let's round that up to $30, remembering that I suck at math. That's our first number. 30.
I bought The Sims 3, rather than waiting just a few weeks for The Sims 4 to come out, because I have no impulse control whatsoever, and thought I'd save money by buying an older game. Perhaps I did initially save money. This, however, went down the toilet after six more DLCs, at 19.99 each. Round up to the nearest whole and our second through seventh numbers are each 20. For simplicity's sake, let's just multiply that out now to $120.
But wait, there's more (there always is): The Sims does this darling little thing where it shows you all of these awesome items and worlds and stuff that you can buy with points, or whatever they're called. I don't remember at this point. Now, I know that I spent at least $50 on these, not all at once, but over time. There was some cool stuff offered, and I like cool stuff.
If we add all of our lovely numbers together, we get $200, though without rounding, I suppose, it would be $199.93. This, however, is a very low guesstimate, due to the points I purchased. Keep in mind that The Sims 3 was not at all new by the time that I spent all this money.
This is entirely my own fault, of course. And I do take responsibility for it. However, with 7 total DLCs (world adventures and into the future likely causing the bulk of the issues), my game was unable to run after a while. It now crashes inenvitably after just ten minutes or so of play. These DLCs are HUGE, and to anyone who plans on buying them, it is important to remember that you really need to choose which ones you really want, they do put a strain on your system.
I actually bought the game thinking that it would be easy for my computer to run, since it was all sandboxy and such. I was dead wrong, and don't even know where I came up with that idea. Pretty much any other game will treat your computer with more kindness than this game will. At least in my experience.

In short, I do, in fact, recommend this game. But I do so with caution. Just know what you're getting yourselves into, and also remember that the Sims may not seem as fun now as it did during your childhood. In fact, in this version, Sims can get out of the pool without a ladder. Isn't that lame? I think so.

42,18705465,english,"The Sims 3 can take awhile to get the hang of it if it's your first time playing a Sims game. But there should be no problem learning since there are tutorials you can view for pretty much everything in the game. Anyways, The Sims 3 is a life simulator and open world sandbox that lets you do whatever you want and play how you like. First thing to do is start creating your Sim. There are tons of different customization options for them from the type of clothes they wear, accessories, facial features, the way their body is shaped, etc. You can also download additional clothes  and accessories from the Sims store and even user created content! You can give them traits which make up their personality, make additional Sims and choose how they are related to each other, name them, then move them on into the world to start living life. There is no story mode but you can choose a ""lifetime wish"" which is exactly as it sounds. As you play, you can work on fulfilling your Sim's wish and in reward, you get lifetime points that you can spend towards special things that can make your Sim's life easier. ...Or you can ignore that and do whatever you feel like if you want! Your Sim could get a job and work to pay bills for the house or you can be completely irresponsible and go dumpster diving if you like. 

Your Sim can interact with other Sims as well and get to know them. You have several conversation options such as chat, gossip, insult, compliment, etc. You could become friends, enemies, or even lovers! The game will let you have romantic relationships with a Sim regardless of their gender. So they can be gay or straight. Your choice. 

Now the next thing to know is that your Sims have ""needs"" which are an important part in the gameplay. The needs are represented by bars and they change color depending on how your Sim is doing. Your Sims have needs such as hunger, bladder, energy, social, hygiene, and fun. You have to pay attention to these because they will affect what happens in the game. Like if you ignore your Sim's hunger needs, they'll die. Or if you don't bath them, your Sim will stink and be embarrassed around others. Your Sims can also automatically control themselves and they will do things such as get something to eat or hop in the shower if their needs become too low. But keep in mind that this does not always work because they may wait until a certain need becomes incredibly low to fix it and it's good to always check them every now and then to make sure they're not too busy talking to someone for several hours rather than eating!

Now, the lifestyle you want for your Sim is entirely up to you. You could work your way up and become rich, get as many friends as possible and become popular, romance up several people and have several girl/boyfriends, or just maybe take a walk in the park. Haha. That being said, I totally recommend this game and there is plenty to do and many ways to live your life however you want. And there are also many expansion packs that completely change the world and add lots of new content onto the already lot there is. I've easily spent over 50 hours and that's only in the base game with my first Sim family. Totally worth it!",1445913598,1445913941,True,2,0,0.525479912757873535,0,True,False,False,76561198088241660,54,2,3113,0,2714.0,1501810905
43,18691412,english,"The base game is certainly recommended, as it's fairly cheap for a solid and highly amusing life simulator. 

There are also mod packs out there for people who want to spice things up without investing in any of the 19 DLC packs. Because seriously, EA. Seriously. It's neat and all that you kept the game alive for as long as you did, but seriously, EA. Can't you at least pretend to not be greedy and evil? Can't you at least pretend you aren't trying to drain the life out of every IP you have by milking it to death, casting revive, and milking it to death again? Can't you at least pretend? No?Seriously, EA.

But yeah, the base game is a bit buggy and a bit clunky, and for me it is prone to crashing (but then, so are Skyrim and New Vegas since I've put so many mods into them) but still recommended! No way in hell I'm buying any of the (at the time of writing) $379.81 worth of DLC packs, though. Stick with the base game only!

People seem to complain about how bland the game is and the expansions cost a shit ton, I just don't care. So here's my thoughts:

PROS
-Hours of fun
-Nice open world to let your sim explore
-Endless number of family members (I think?)
-Many traits to pick from even on base game
-Clothing is great

CONS
-Takes a while to get things ready
-Takes a little bit to get things going to get alot of simolions
-Sometimes sims are just braindead
-Sims just do what ever the fuck they want when they don't need to.

(Though in seriousness, The Sims 3 is the best Sims game by far. Even the vanilla version I found more enjoyable than a complete Sims 2 collection, both of which I have logged hundreds of hours into. It can take a while to load, and on some computers, it can have issues running at even low graphics if there are several expansion packs installed. If you're looking for expansion packs, I would personally recommend  Supernatural but I mostly recommend Seasons (literally they did such a good job with that expansion). Another common issue I find is that Sims 3 Store content is very pricy, but I'm content enough with the vanilla game to overlook it, though I admit, over the years I've dropped about $30 on store content not related to expansion packs. I really do love this game, and although I've spent, total, about $100 over the years on expansion packs and content, I feel that I've honestly played it enough that I more than got my money's worth)",1444165066,1444165066,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198059783378,76,13,1454,0,1454.0,1407370223

I personally enjoy the Sims 3, due to the open world nature(opposed to the Sims 2, just in your house, or Sims 4, with locations, but not just one big world), and the enormous amount of add-ons that can go in to customize your game. Want retro 70s clothes? They have it. Seasons? Check on that. Pets? Hell yeah. Vampires, witches, and things that go 'bump'? You bet! With dozens of worlds, thousands of outfits(and what can only be billions of combination outfits), and hundreds of building materials/household items you can buy, this game is already incredible. But the best part is in life simulation. Every sim, no matter how much you try, will look different, act different, and have different wishes. Even minor things like having a hotdog will propel your sims into a whole new world of wishes and hopes, from cooking, to a new job, to opportunities that accompany this. A brief pass with someone at the supermarket can bloom into a relationship, a family, and any number of other possibilities. Every single playthrough is different, and that allows you to experiment as many times as you wish. Even with a single game is varies greatly day-by-day. One day, you could have an aspiring author, the next, they want to join Sunset Valley's Finest, or their worst. How they react, is up to you.

What I mean is, in order to fully get the full expiernece of the sims 3, you want to upgrade your house, eventually have a family, and have a career. Being a person who is very lazy and doesn't mind playing a casual game once in a while the sims is a fantastic installment in the series...however... there are some flukes to the game. When I first launched the game it wanted me to install a patch that would update my current version (like any normal game that needs updating). I downloaded the patch and I thought that everything was fine... until I re-launched my game and it said to download the patch again. Since it wouldn't let me into the game without the patch notification going away, I had to restart my computer twice than magically it worked :|. Depending on what you are running it on (low or high) the game may look glitchy as well, but in my opinion, a potatoe could run this game. One more thing that I must include is that if you are new to the sims DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME.

The Sims 3 is a life-simulation-sandbox developed by a division of EA known as [i]The Sims Studio[/i], the Sims 3 was released 2009.
The general idea is to progress your character/family through the game by building/buying a house, purchasing items to supply your Sims basic needs; Hunger, Social, Bladder, Hygiene, Energy, and Fun.


[u][b]-Detailed breakdown review-[/b][/u]
[b]Story:[/b] I personally admire Sandbox games because of the flexibility you have with story, and game elements. Each person will have their own personal story playing through the Sims. [i](If you don't care to hear the story of my first Sims game: Skip to Gameplay)[/i]

I created a Sim that looked like me, and proceeded to move into a house and begin to work on building my life. After getting my first job, the car for work showed up earlier then I expected, and I sadly didn't have time to eat my Waffles, so I left them on the street and went to work.
After putting in a hard eight hour work day, I returned to my waffles on the street. [i](I had watched them the whole time from my above view. I watched them... mocking me.)[/i] Now, any sane person would know not to eat waffles left on the street for eight hours, but I'm not sane, I ate those suckers after getting home. Then proceeded to vomit in the toilet for the next few hours.
http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=511831776

Eventually I became familiar with the weird 3D controls, married a lady who turned into a grandma the day after we were married [i]( *Condescending tone* Being the noble man that I am, I reloaded my save file. In my defense, she didn't tell me she was three times my age when we dated!)[/i]

After getting married, becoming the leader of the free world, and having a kid... I died of old age. This is when I realized my terrible mistake; I shouldn't have made an avatar that looked like me. Eventually My son brought me back as a ghost, but I felt wrong after seeing myself die in a video game like that.

[b]Gameplay:[/b] It's hard to articulate how weird the controls are for The Sims 3, you can zoom in and out, rotate the camera, switch between Sims, the GUI [i](Graphical User Interface)[/i] isn't the weird part about the controls... It's when you're trying to learn the key-bindings, “which mouse button does what”, clicking and holding the scroll wheel, among a host of other keyboard shortcuts.
It took several hours of play time to get familiar with the controls, I suspect I might have been helped or hindered with my experience working in 3D modeling programs such as 3Ds Max, Source SDK, and Blender.
There is a lot that can be said about The Sims 3 gameplay, but the best way to sum it up is that this is “a Sims game”. This was the first Sims game I played since trying it at a friend's house when I was younger.
http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=511831787

[b]Achievements:[/b] There are no Steam Achievements on the Sims 3, however if you're objective or goal oriented, there are in-game accomplishments that you can work on earning. These accomplishments are shown on your Sims 3 community profile page.

[b]Price:[/b] This is where The Sims 3 gets sticky, and I start to get cynical... The Core game is priced at $19.99, that's an extremely fair asking price for the core game. But wait, there's more!
If you look in your furniture section within the game, there are advertisements for more furniture that you need to spend real money to unlock! [i](Really EA? We didn't spend enough?)[/i]
But wait, there's more! Each DLC pack (19 packs in total) costs $19.99! This is where many people start mumbling about EA having a money grubbing exploitative business model[i](Or maybe just me)[/i]. If you do want to get the DLC for the Sims 3, it's recommended you look for bundle deals that are on sale to get the most out of your purchase.
http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=510203419

[b]Conclusion:[/b] to recap, Story: flexible and unique. Gameplay: takes some time to get used to the controls if you're new to the series. Achievements: None on steam, but accomplishments in game. Price: Fair for the core game, however the marketing design is to shake you down for more money.
I recommend this game to people who enjoy simulation games, play casual games, and like building houses.

Do you like the way EA sells DLC for The Sims 3? Or do you think they should include more in the core game? Feel free to let me know in the comments, thanks for reading my review.

47,17861224,english,"Firstly, this game is really good and highly addictive. The base game is good, graphics are nice, gameplay is involving and good fun. I'm no expert but this is the best Sims game I've played by far.

The big downside is that you only get one world/map with the base game and there's one additional world you can download free. A huge amount of the content for this game is essentially in-game purchases, where you are forced to spend your real-life hard earned cash on buying new stuff for your sims. This sucks, and particularly when 'building' the game hassles you to spend more money and is essentially teasing you with content that you'd have to pay real money for.

If you're prepared to spend about £100 on this game (incl. the base game) then you should be able to have a game with enough maps and 'stuff' that you can get a lot of playing time out of it.

Even after spending that though, you'll probably realise that some of the additional worlds you've downloaded would be much better if you also had a similarly themed expansion pack (e.g. Dragon Valley  better with Supernatural expansion, Sunlit Tides world better with Island Paradise expansion). So then you're looking at more £30 expansion packs to get additional features which you would expect to be with the actual world itself.

If you want the 'complete' game, you're looking at well over £500, possibly somewhere nearer £1000.

The Sims 3 is much more fun than a cheap car, but if you're not carefully you'll have spent enough that you could've bought one. It's such a shame really, as it's a brilliant game that seems overshadowed by it's awful payments system and expense.

If you have the disposable income and think you'd like this game and like the concept, then buy it. It seems to be the most acclaimed Sims game and really is great fun to play.",1441283189,1441283263,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198216233576,78,9,107731,0,5992,1598908997

You are constantly making sure everyone's lives are planned out. In fact, you can make yourself a sim and manage yourself in this world. These sims will literally learn, mature, get a job, reproduce, complain and eventually die. The gameplay is endless and unpredictable. Play only if you want to micromanage things. Every gameplay is different; however, the vanilla game is limited so after that it is mundane and boring with no extra content unless DLC is picked up.

You can also be the devil and torture various sims to death. 

Expansion is worth picking up. It will add loads of more hours, features, jobs, options, etc. to the game and you will find it difficult to stop playing unless you hate managing things.

But after what just happened, I'm uninstalling it and never touching it agian. There is this error code, error code 12, basically if you play the game for too long it loses the ability too save. Mind you, this error is VERY common, if you play the game for over an hour you run the risk of running into it. I'm just playing vanilla too, with very little custom content (like about five pieces of it), from what i've read installing expantions just makes it worse, especailly seasons. So anyway, I'm doing a challenge called a hundred baby challenge, for anyone who doesn't know what that is it's basically where you try to have a hundred babies all with different guys. I was at 78 and had been working at it since last summer. I had just finished woohooing a guy and I went too save and got error code 12.  I was frustrated and didn't want too play a half hour of game agian, so i tried doing a save as too see if it did anything different. I still got the error, so I closed out. I went into play tonight and what do I find. I DELETED MY GAME! The game I  had been playing for a year, and was so close to finishing. For people who are going too say or think, ""Well this is why you keep multiple saves"", just NO. You do not release a game with this serious for a bug, and if it does get realesed with it your fix it. From what I can tell, they never came out with a patch for this problem, making it very clear that the creators just do not care. Other problems with the game include the fact that it takes forever to save and load, crashes are very common, the vanilla version can get boring after a while meaning that if you want a more exciting game you have to drop another 25 dollars on it for an expantion, so it's a game that can end up costing well over a 100 dollars, some of the expantion packs are things they should have in the base game like rain or dogs, this game eats up a ton of memory, and the clothes and hair in the vanilla version are ugly, so you have to either get expantions, buy new hair and clothes from the store, or get custom content. I know that last one sounds like a nitpick, but the game is a virtual doll house, dressing up your character it half the fun, so that's a big problem.

To finish the game you have to live a long successful life and then die to be completed. BUT... If you are into building houses and landscaping, then I highly suggest this game. I can spend days building a property and then it is fun to share them with the online community and see how many times they are downloaded. The game itself comes with many items to build cool stuff with but there are a ton of expansions to buy which makes this game the most expensive but the best I have seen so far where you can build any house and property you can dream of.

Protips:

- Install the mods NRAAS Overwatch and MasterController (plus integration) to help reduce lag, crashes, and have workarounds for otherwise game-breaking bugs. NRAAS Register is also helpful to reduce lag via extended population controls. Overwatch is [b]mandatory[/b] to avoid any town eventually crawling to an unloadable halt, no matter how many different save files you make or how awesome your gaming machine is (this is due to a bug that spawns ridiculous numbers of cars in NPC Sim inventories).

- Disable memories immediately, and be sure to re-disable them when the game inevitably resets all its settings as if you've never played before (it likes to do that every once in a while). The memory scrapbook concept is a cute idea but very poorly implemented, as it will create huge save files and additional lag from all the memories being recorded by every Sim in the game.

- Get the fixed version of the Isla Paradiso world if you want to play in it at all (the fairly-unplayable version comes with the Island Paradise expansion). NRAAS Register becomes much more useful for this world specifically, because you can turn off immigration, wild animals, tourists, and other things that make even the fixed world laggy. Overwatch will also disable NPC Sims from adopting pets, which is a good idea because kittens and puppies lag the game out badly due to being unable to go up and down steps.

- Don't get a vacation home in the World Adventures expansion countries until you are absolutely sure you are done with opportunities related to that country. Buying a vacation home makes it almost impossible to get opportunities afterwards, especially in France.

- Either don't buy a home plot or alternate house in the To The Future expansion, or be prepared to randomly lose the lot and everything on if you change the future setting (which includes normal, distopia, and utopia settings). If you edit the future town to include buildings like a grocery store or school, these changes can also be randomly undone.

- Research expansions ahead of time for content and purpose, then add the ones you want to your wishlist and keep an eye out for Steam sales. Usually the big summer sale will at least chop off part of the obnoxious pricetags. Even the base game bundled with the Pets expansion can be steeply discounted if you're lucky and haven't picked up the game yet.

- Make multiple save files for games you care about. I use 8 different saves sequentially numbered for every world that isn't just a random test of something, and I overwrite the oldest save with each new save. That way if one save becomes corrupted, I have 7 to fall back on, with varying degrees of playing time lost. Even with mods, some saves will corrupt, especially if the game crashed while saving.

- Save OFTEN. The game likes to crash, bug out, or become unplayable any time it feels like, regardless of mods.

- ???

You can allow your imagination to run wild with the characters you create, and like I said before you can make an Ellen Page and Beverly Crusher then marry them. That's an A in my book. 

My biggest complaint about this game is the way DLC is implemented, with each DLC pack being $20, and to have a complete version of the game will cost you nearly $400. The way EA carves up their games and sells them to the consumer bit by exspensive bit, and the in game purchases like clothing truly show how they want to squeeze money from the consumer.

This game is fun for the whole family. If you have played any of the other sims games then you know what to expect, make a sim (person) give them a job, find them a girlfriend/boyfriend and start a family. The sims 3 really changed alot with the other sims for example the city is now an open world city so not more one lot houses now the city is your lot. There is so many new things involved with the sims 3 that you cant describe it, you need to just jump in the game and find it.

[h1] just stunning [/h1]

You may also notice that the graphics got a smooth upgrade. Sims now look more like real people than worn out dolls. Also your needs such as hunger got an update as well so you dont have to eat and use the bathroom every 5 minuets which gives you more time to explore the city or maybe call up a friend and hang out. There are way more sims in the city than there was in the sims 2 cities which leads to a more realistic tone in the game.

[h1] rewards everywhere [/h1]

As the game is fun you will find that the longer you play the more rewards you can get for example you pay have spent all night at a night club and found some girl to talk to and then later got married to her just to find out she is very famous. Even looking into a telescope at night can be rewarding as you can find new planets and stars and name them and get paid for find them. The game can get a little boring for a while doing the same thing over and over again but anyone who is a die hard fan will love the sims 3.

[h1] verdict [/h1]

The sims 3 is a game where you can do anything and i have not seen anything like it.

-So much custom content to get from the interwebs!
-Replayable! So much!

Cons:
-It's pretty difficult to remove unwanted expansions if you 'aren't'/'don't live with' a computer guru.
-A lot of the expansions add a lot of content, which equals a fair bit of lag and game freezes that leave you fantically clicking the mouse and banging the keyboard, hoping that the sim you hand crafted don't die from lag.
-Open world=Sims constently moving=Sims constently getting stuck=LAG! Liberal use of 'resetsim *' to reset all the sims in the neighborhood back to their homes is required!

5,10001544,english,"This game is ridiculously huge to begin with, but for some strange reason it doesn't seem to have enough of the essential content to create a good story with the sims. I mean, in some ways it's a lot like Sims 2 (which I have loved for so many years), but in other ways, its frustratingly different. For example, in Sims 2, I felt satisfied with the game that I bought -- even though I hadn't bought any expansion packs yet. The game was able to stand on its own and impress me without having any extra content. With Sims 3, I feel this horrible dissatisfaction with the content, dispite the superior graphics and the exciting new *live* neighborhood. Oftentimes I can ignore the feeling, but some times it is dishearteningly glaring. 
There is always this subconsious push to run back to steam and grab up more DLC so that the game can achieve some kind of tolerable level of ""rightness"" -- almost as though EA was trying to do this on purpose. It seems awful, but I am starting to believe that they just broke the game up into pieces, called it DLC, and tried to sell it to people piecemeal!
An additional problem, and a rather gamebreaking one for me, is the sheer size of this game. Once you build it up to a reasonable level with ""Pets"" ""Ambitions"" and ""Nightlife"", things start to go seriously wrong. Bugs and glitches that once were just annoyances become major problems, lag that was pretty tolerable before is now making you mad, and loading times that were originally only a lengthy 5 minutes are now running into the range of 20 minutes -- and this is on the lowest settings possible! I have also begun to experience issues with the game essentially *growing* the more I play it. It automatically starts to get fatter and more sluggish every time. Not to mention the crazy amount of inconvienient game crashes!
All in all, I suppose coming so late to the game, I should have heeded the bad reviews and steered clear of it, but as you all know, sometimes, in pursuit of a dream, a gamer is tempted to try something that they know probably sucks. 

 I would only recommend this game to someone with a ton of patience and a 5 star computer system :P",1399071520,1427518949,False,5,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False,76561198098110516,39,1,22736,0,19888,1438917199

If you haven't played any of the Sims before then The Sims 3 is probably an okay place to start.
Create a character and start on a limited budget, over time help your Sim become Rich, Famous, Hated, Loved, Poor and Lonely anything you want!

Breakdown:
Graphics - 8/10 - An improvement on the Sims 2, but can still be a little choppy.
Gameplay - 8/10 - Everything the last games had with added aspiration bonuses among a few other additions
Customisation - 9/10 - Make your Sim, build you house. Plenty of items to choose from, the rest is down to you!
Longevity - 8/10 - I didn't find this as addicting as the first Sims, however you can still lose hours on this if you get into it.
Worth the Money? - Yes. However if you are new to The Sims, i'd wait for a sale.

I'm sure anyone visiting this store page and looking into this game already knows what Sims is all about, so I'll keep it short and sweet.  The Sims is a life simulator basically.  You take control of a household of people and live a virtual life basically.  You make them use the restroom, sleep, eat, go to work/school, play games, watch TV, interact with others and so on.  There is also a fairly average home building/modifying feature in The Sims that allows you to create your own house, or add on to an existing one.  You can work at your leisure, picking the wallpaper/paint, flooring, exterior siding, roofing, grass type, placement of interior and exterior lighting and furniture and so on.

This game is uniquely addictive and fun, with plenty to satiate your simulation needs, however.  Keep in mind that this is made by EA, and as such, comes with a lot of baggage.  Yes, there is a lot of DLC that adds some neat little features and whatnot, but [u][b] no[/b][/u] you do not want to buy it.  The DLC is ridiculously overpriced and never goes on sale.

This expansion adds new traits new loifetime wishes tons of objects and interactions four types of pets with endless pure breeds and mutts, it also add a new freaking world. EA has said that making animations is one of the hardest parts of making the sims, they had to make animations for 4 types of pets. Heck EA has tons of trouble with AI if you had played a game made by them but the pet AI is better than the sims AI.

Now, the stuff packs is a whole different story... They should be cheaper I can agree, they just items, nothing to much and someof the stuff packs are ridiculous, a katy perry one? Really?

Overall, I'm a fan of Steam, and I buy most of my games through it now just out of convenience, and a bit of consumer loyalty dashed in. However, The Sims 3 is one game that I reccomend NOT buying through Steam, for many reasons.

Overall the game is good, and I do reccomend it, especally now that it's no longer being added to make it easy to keep track of what you do and don't have for it. But buying through Steam will come with some headaches. Read the ENTIRE review for a STRESS FREE path to fun with this game on Origin, otherwise you may run into issues!

This is one of a very small selection of games that is much better purchased and installed through the Origin platform. Support will be much quicker and prompt to assist you than Steam will be able to, and by having it on Origin, it allows EA support to be able to assist you more easily because they cant look into anything on Steam. In my journey through installing the Sims 3 I was able to get assistance from EA support within 5 to 15 minutes, steam can take 20 days.

Second, having them regestered and installed on Origin provides you with lots of extra bonus content in-game, not a lot for each DLC individually, but it all adds up, and allows for even more free items on thesims3.com. If you have already bought sims 3 on Steam, or part of it, thankfully it's easy to use THE SAME keys you already bought and use them on Origin, they work, I can confirm it. (You might need to fiddle with removing ""-""'s, but the key is the same.)

BUT STOP! This part is important, if you want to migrate your Sims 3 purchase to Origin, then read carefully, or you will have a lot of headache. Do NOT regester your steam keys straight into origin itself, instead go onto thesims3.com, make an account there and regester the key there instead, and it will automatically put your game into Origin for you.

This is important because thesims3.com is where your access to a LOT of content is, and because that website came before origin, both of them only talk in one direction. Thesims3.com can tell Origin you have the game, but Origin can't tell thesims3.com anything. Yes, it's dumb, and yes it should be fixxed, but at this point it's unlikely to change.
But having both see that you have the game regestered has benefits, so regester on the website, play on Origin.

The game runs well... ON LOW. But the game is really fun. And SOME of the DLC adds some things that will be cool.

Somehow within the time of two weeks I mastered my job, becoming the best female investigator in the town, and became a superstar. Paparazzi started lining up outside my house, taking my picture and asking for my autograph. About the time that I got around to one of my easiest cases, I was hired to find some black mail on someone for a friend of mine. Rummaged through their mail and their trash cans, and couldn't find anything, I accepted it and started to head back to my client, giving them the results. When I got to her house, she was locked away in the cellar doing something or another and her baby, which for some reason was a vampire, was just sitting there in the forty-two degree weather. I picked it up and started to feed the darling child, waiting for her mother. After about a couple of hours or so she didn't come back so I decided to take the baby. I changed her name to Arya and then turned to a demigod that started following me around ever since I moved into this town, and then had her transform the baby into a human, add her to my family, and then make her look more me. Went home and decided to cut my losses on the case, happy to have a new baby. When I got home I decided it was time for a change, and divorced my wife shortly before an earthquake shook my house and this weird portal thing showed up in my back yard. This strange guy game out and explained to me he was a time traveler named Emit and that his time machine just broke. So I abandoned my ex, and carried my new baby around with me as I started to collect power cells lying outside my house that this guy needed to fix his time machine. After it was up and running, the guy traveled back to his home town and I stepped into the portal, following him to the future with my baby. 

After getting set up and realized I had no valid money here, I turned to my demigod friend again and then bought a mansion before I started to set up my empire designing robots. I started to get really good at it, and as time continued it became very hard to do this and take care of my daughter at the same time, so I did what any sensible person who stood atop an empire of robots would do. I made a robot, a very special one, and then persionalized it for my dear sweet child of mine. I designed it after an old video game, and named it Legion before I gave it various personality chips, including a modified nanybot chip. After various tune ups I realized that unfortunately Legion was an outdated model, something I had to acknowledge as the empress atop a robot empire. I went through and made my greatest breakthrough, designing an updated robot that I named Legion Mk II, and shortly afterwards I gave him sentience. I also gave him the ability to feel different moods and such, and then gave him the capability to love. I sold all my other housebots because I decided they were outdated and no longer needed. 

At this point I went back in time with my baby, and Legion Mk I and Mk II. I decided to keep the Mk I for old times sake. As I got back home I talked to Emit and told him I wanted to do some good for the world. At this point I remembered my ex, who was still living in my house in the present. I took Arya with me on my quest to turn the future into a Utopia before we went back to the future and I continued to improve my empire, satisfied that the world Arya lived in was now the best it could be, and that she was safe with Legion I and II whenever I was busy. I decided to do some exploring and discovered a crashed alien ship, it was pretty cool but at this point I was really home sick. I went back to the present with Legion I and II and Arya, and then decided to move back to my home town. 

It was at this point that I decided to head off to University, leaving Arya behind with Legion Mk I and Mk II, my ex left behind in my old town. Not long after I got settled in, I met a plant person. I was a little confused, but didn't really care. I wanted to get my education as soon as possible and get back to my dear sweet child of mine, and I ended up missing her very soon.

moving on, i paid it anyway like a bored sucker !!!!............

i had noticed prior to my purchase that EA have been ripping alot of thier customers off in recent years, so i have EA in the back of my mind as a personal money draining enemy who knows every trick in the book to appeal to my deepest needs to make me get my wallet out .....

anyway, im soon playing away on sims three and one of the first things i notice is that there is some sort of alternate currency wich seems like you can only purchase with real money , to make this worse , this currency was bound to certain items only, items that cannot otherwise be purchased in the game, leaving the player undoubtedly wanting more through lack of what is there already,  whats worse is EA rubbing it in our noses by actually having all the items on display as if you can touch, pay and place right away,............

so ive seen sims go from a plentiful game to a game thats lacking just enough to give enough insentive for people to buy this currency or even worse pay the death penalty for thier expansion packs.

The Sims 3 was around a long time. Building on the Wishes mechanic of the second game, this one has Lifetime Rewards, where you can gain points for keeping moodlets high and fufilling their various desires.
These points can be cashed in at any point.

Personally, I recommend getting the Supernatural and Late Night expansion packs if you like cities, and like an easier way to be immortal but still allow aging. Being a vampire is pretty fun.
Late Night adds a small city to play in, which admittedly feels a bit... empty. You'll want to play custom towns off the Sims3modding website.

Beyond that... Sims 3 is a mostly open world, non-instanced Sims game. It has problems, sure, it's buggy, it can do a lot of things at once meaning when you save your game it takes forever, you will find horses hanging around a single empty lot if you have pets.

64,14150459,english,"While the base game isn't much, the true power comes from the expansions. All expansions are made to work in synergy with the other and create more content exponentially linked to the number of expansions you have.

So the base game + supernatural + ambitions means the ambitions system now works for supernatural careers like alchemist and unlocks ""synergy content."" Without ambitions, the system wont be there for supernatural.

As your game grows, the synergy content grows as well. When you own all the major expansions (not the stuff packs), you get an absolutely massive amount of synergy content.

So far here are the expansions:

Ambitions - adds interactive jobs, new jobs centering around craft skills. Adds scrap metal robots that become obsolete when you get into the future. Adds scrap yard, fire station, and other job based commecial lots.

pets - adds pets. Nothing special. Not much synergy content. Requires NRAAS mods or the wild life bogs down your game. Adds pet park commercial lots.

into the future - this is VERY unbalanced and practically cheating. You can create overpowered sim-bots that can max every skill, then teach your kids those skills or craft an infinite amount of high end items. They can even hold max level jobs meaning a single sim bot turns the sims into easy mode permenantly since sim bots dont age. Adds futuristic commercial lots like a future lounge, a fancy bar run by robots.

University - this adds social groups, ""drugs"", alcohol, multiple commercial lots like coffee shops, comic book stores, and bowling alleys. Adds plant sims. Adds science skill, and science objects like the science station. In here, you can clone practically anything and everyone. You also The science objects here are overpowered. You can even buy a brain enhancer to respec your entire personality whenever you want, even random strangers. This expansion also adds social networking, where you run a website and gain followers based on what you do. For instance, talking to a ghost and blogging about it is good content. This applies for other expansions as well, where you can boast about a good performance in show time or a cleared dungeon in world adventures. A good blogger can also get famous in late night.

Seasons - This adds seasons that tie into other expansions. Island Paradise resorts are effected by what season it is. No one will want to go to a resort in the snowy winter. Adds aliens, and alien technology like the weather controller and UFO car that you can use to terrorize the city.

Supernatural - adds supernatural creatures,  huge addition to  crafting ingredients, lunar cycle, and magic. The lunar cycle means that 1 night means there is a full moon, which means all sorts of supernatural creatures come out like zombies. This sounds cool, but it turns into an annoyance. The zombies become loud, annoying hobos on your porch after a while. Adds supernural lots like the vampire lounge (fancy bar), and the werewolf bar.

late night - adds fame, which ties into all other expansions. Adds even more powers to vampires. Adds nightlife commercial lots that tie into the commercial lots of all the other expansions.

Island paradise - adds all sorts of water activities, boats, house boats, and the ability to run a resort or hotel. Adds mermaid sims. NOTICE: YOU NEED NRAAS BUG FIXES TO USE THE ISLAND PARADISE NEIGHBORHOOD WITHOUT ISSUE.

Generations - adds a whole bunch of rewards based on what you do in your sim's life. Adds a bunch of inspiration rewards for living a good life, often in overpowered items. Adds another science object, the chemistry set that is  just as overpowered as the other items from university.

world adventures - you travel the world, complete dungeons, and if you have late night you can get famous doing it. Adds objects from Egypt, France, and China. It adds TONS of rare and expensive collectibles including rebuilt sarcophigi, statues, and dive wells. A good haul of artifacts can make you a very rich, or the museum very profitable if you own it. Adds mummy sims.

show time - ties into late night. adds performance careers. Adds genies. adds a whole bunch of items that should have been in late night like the DJ booth.

It all depends on what you want from your sims.

CONS:

HUGE LOAD TIMES WHEN YOU LOAD ANY NEIGHBORHOOD.

Pro's:
  Good graphics
  Higher attention to detail in design compared to The Sims 2
  Jobs and Careers are actually a real place on the map
  Good Modding community
  And many more that I can't list

Con's:
  All households are active no matter what Sim you're currently on.
  No blank towns to build on your own in vanilla
  Game becomes dull without $200+ of DLC content
  Occasional bugs and glitches

However, thats about as far as I can get

This game crashes, like, all the time, and until I find a solution, the FARTHEST I've been able to get is to the Personality traits on my Created Sim. I haven't even gotten into the house building aspect of it. I downloaded this game hoping for a much better version then the 2002 Sims 1 version that came on the CD and had like, 5 sim heads and different outfits you could be. You couldn't even change any facial features on that, the graphics are pretty awful, and yet I'm tempted to go back to it.

I admit, this game looks great, and I really want to play it, but unti this crashing bug is fixed? Don't. And yeah, Sims 4 has all this crap fixed, but I spent 20 bucks on this game, and if they want me spending MORE money, I'm getting my money back.

19,13819055,english,"I can't really recommend this game to low-income players, but I can't give it a bad rating either, as it is QUITE fun once you get into it. Sims 3 is probably the best life sim I've ever seen/played. If you like life sims, than you really should get this game. If the idea of helping a person, or persons, through daily life sounds tedious, then it's not the game for you. The basic game comes with two towns you can mess around with, one of which is a free download. You get to build your player's lot up any way you'd like within the limits of the games included inventory.

You help a character you create, and motivate to make big (and small) desicions regarding their entire life, from schooling, to Careers, to Hobbies, to whether they brush their teeth or not after eating garlic dishes. The interactions within the world can get crazy intricate... Or you could make it your business to create a Sim with the right motivations, and just let them do what they wish. This usually doesn't end well, but many have tried it.

I will caution you about the mircro/macro-transactions that Sims offers it's players. If you are not satisfied with the content provided, you can get more, but it almost always costs extra real money for your video-game objects. If you want additional towns, for example, you'll need to be willing to part with another 20-30 dollars to purchase it. You can also buy some pretty cool furniture sets with real money too anywhere from a few cents, to $25 for some of the truly premium stuff. While this is fine for folks with money, this can be problematic for younger players, or people with limited income. Once you've bought the furniture, you CAN use it in any future saves; so at least you don't have to pay through your teeth multiple times for individual things.

If you get this game, try to be determined to stick with the limited content you start with, or you will find that you've forked out over a hundred dollars in no time. Otherwise have fun with it.

For that reason, I'm not going to bother purchasing The Sims 4, and will instead enjoy the great little time-sink with the grossly-overpriced DLC I already have.

As far as this great little time-sink goes, I'll cover the bad things first: Glitches of all kinds are apparent, from screen tearing to improper model loading to Sims getting stuck on invisible bumps in the carpet. It doesn't look like The Sims Cubed is going to be getting anymore support, either, since EA has decided to publish The Sims 4. Gameplay gets repetitive; even though you get to customize your Sim's appearance, gender, etc, and personality traits and ambitions, these things just don't feel like they have enough of an impact on the game itself. Most personality traits and Life Ambitions merely give you an extra option some radial menu somewhere, but do not actually impact how your Sim behaves or forms relationships with other Sims. Skills are way too easy to learn - you can master any given skill in about twenty minutes real-time if you push your Sim to interact with the right objects or people often enough. This makes your Sim even more bland, as there is no challenge for them anymore. And I wasn't lying at the top: the DLC is grossly overpriced for what each pack adds to the game.

On the other hand, the best thing to say about The Sims Cubed is that it's fun. That's the whole premise of The Sims franchise - to have fun playing god in a world of almost-human-beings. It's voyeuristic. It's vicarious. It's reality TV where you decide what the characters are going to do every day. Each expansion pack adds enough new content to the game to make sure that there's always something new to do. I wouldn't recommend buying The Sims Cubed unless you're also going to spend some money on a few expansion packs, like World Travels, Pets, or Seasons.

This all happened quickly. But then, I was struck with Sims madness. I purposely sacrificed my sims to the lord of all, Cthulu, via electronic appliances. I never had a thing for drowning people in the pool, so that was off the table. I downloaded a mod that adds shootable guns, and 'poof'.

I had no mods until I installed NRAAS ErrorTrap and Overwatch mods just to make the gameplay smoother. It's sad that you need mods to do what the developer should have.

However, putting the lags and bugs aside, it's a great simulation/sandbox game and the dynamics work well. The AI occasionally resorts to Radiant AI kind of confusion, but that's why you're there to guide them little fools ;)

On a personal side note, I wish the Sims were less ""perfect"". I mean the way everyone looks pretty (i.e. flawless skin, smooth features etc.). Sure, you can adjust the sliders to give ridiculous proportions and there are mods for adding scars and whatnot, but I don't like the obvious bias nor how it affects realism --and even if you deliberately try to make a Sim that's as ugly as possible, they're still pretty -or look like something from a kids' game.

66,13582000,english,"Let me start out by saying I love this game, but I can't recommend it.

When I first bought The Sims 3, I played around with it for a few hours before realizing there was really nothing much to do, nothing much to buy, nothing really interesting to put in your house.  I've been playing The Sims since 1999 and this was the most boring Sims game I've ever played. 

Then I found out why.  The base game is not a complete game.  It's the bait.  And the DLCs are the hook.  In a sickeningly brazen cash-grab that shows absolutely no respect for gamers or Sims fans, EA put out a skeleton of a game, made people pay full price for it, then released the rest of the game through waves of overpriced DLC.  Now some of that DLC is really good and adds a lot of interesting features to the game.  That's great!  What's NOT great is that a lot of this should have been included in the original game.  More clothing options, more house decor options, job options, skills... 

Now I'm not saying things like the option to attend the University or visit the future should have been included in the base game; those are perfect DLC additions.  What I AM saying is that there needed to be more to the base game.  

EA released a bare-bones sims game, knowing that they could take more money from people if they released the rest of the game via DLC.  There are now 24 Sims 3 DLCs available on EA.com, each with a cost of $19.99.  That's a total of $479.76 in DLC.  Of those 24, thirteen are just ""stuff"", adding nothing substantial to the game, just more stuff.  

But it gets worse.  The game is full of micro-transations to buy MORE stuff.  For example, as you browse through outfits for your sims, or furniture for your sims' house, you'll notice pieces of clothing or furniture that you have to pay extra to access.  Really?  Almost $500 of DLC isn't enough, EA?  You have to add micro-transactions?  I never thought a video game would make me feel insulted, but EA managed to pull it off.

The shame in all of this is that The Sims 3 really is a FUN game.  Unfortunately I had to buy nine DLCs (all on sale for $7.99 because $19.99 is WAAAY overpriced, all with substantion gameplay additions, none of those stupid ""Stuff"" packs) before I could have fun with this game.  

Enjoy my money now EA, because this is the last Sims game I'll be buying.  You took a fun little game and turned it into a w-h-o-r-e.",1419481918,1419482166,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198044813591,1175,17,96792,25,13564,1601248923

I would paint random images throughout the day on my easel, stopping only to sate my appetite, or occasionally wash my bodily odour away. I didn't talk to anyone. I didn't need anyone. I just needed this job. I was going to be the best. And then that day came. I had reached the pinnacle of my profession. Finally I could stop worrying about my career and enjoy the finer things in life. But being at the top is perhaps the loneliness place you can be. I still had no friends. No lover. No relations of my own. I tried going out to community lots but by this time I was old and the youngsters found me creepy and odd. I once again found myself spending the days alone in my home, trying to be the best at everything. I'll show them! I don't need anybody! I've come this far on my own! But, whereas time had once been my greatest ally, it had now become my sole enemy. Yes, I was the best at all things. But I had no one to share it with. I sat alone in the place I had once called home, surrounded by all of my beautiful creations, and I felt even more miserable than at the start of it all.

First off, WAY too much EA advertising with those coins or whatever they want you to get so you can unlock other things.  

Modding isn't as easy as it was.  Luckily the community stepped up and made the process a bit more smooth.

They also abandoned the meters and replaced it with perks or status updates?  Basically you eat something and for so many hours you are full.  Then the icon is replaced with a starving icon that lasts for another set amount of time.  

The active sim family is also weird.  You can't play as one family and then switch (or maybe I'm just an idiot) as easily as in Sims 2.  Also, why do sims look better in the creator screen than they do ingame?

What I did like is the ability to make patterns and change the color of clothes and furniture.  The blueprint mode in the builder is also very nice.

23,13224637,english,"I'm writing this as the Sims 4 is out, but this one is still worth your while or if you are considering getting into the SIms, just read the review for the story so far.

SIms allows you to create and guide the lives of a Sim single, or family through the course of their daily life. You can build homes for them, decorate, manage their daily activities like work and play and develop skills that help them in their life.

The Sims for the most part are autonomous meaning that they will act in the interests of their own self preservation if left alone (and they have the sufficient skills to take care of themselves). Guiding them during the game play slowly equates to developing good habits they need to survive in life although there are some of the real life missing elements like trolls and troll groups, the challenges there provide a good foundation for learning much need life skills and balance of the basic elements in life. It also encourages creativity in your own real life (for instance it might get you thinking that a night out to dinner and a movie every once in while is imperative to your health at some important social level).

All in all it encourages healthy lifestyle decisions without constraining one to ""conformity"" and rewards them.

One of the best and most fun aspects of the Sims line of games is designing your Sim. During this process you can choose the physical, mental and emotional characteristics of your Sims even giving them a background story. This can really flesh them out and once again what a wonderful tool for character exploration.

In Sims 4, they've really added some new features to the Sims you can create which allow for intelligent emotional lives as well. Sims 3 still holds its ground if you're on a limited budget and want to try a game from the Sims franchinse.

There's an online store as well that you can make purchases for your Sims and from time to time they offer free seasonal items for the holidays that you can use to decorate your Sims dwellings for that time of year.

One of the nice things about Sims is that if your looking for a change in pace from the action genre, this one would be a good start as its pacing is anything but tense and stressful bar trying to wake your Sim up in time to get ready for their day. Still challenging and magnetic gameplay that will keep you coming back. 

When you return to your action game, it will have a bit of zest put into it by the change in pace. You might even consider that the baddies you're blasting away have simulated families somewhere who are depending on that baddie to get rid of you and make it home safely. You might end up developing a bit of a complex and conscience about it. Read Philip K. Dick's ""Do Androids Dream Of Electric Sheep?"" aka Bladerunner and you'll get what I mean.

These Sims are pretty darn convincing in ways, but don't put them through the Voight-Kampf or Turing test.

You might spoil the illusion.

Highly recommended.

Because the game is unpatched, gameplay consists of twenty minutes of loading screens followed by four or five minutes of the Sim creator, then either a hang or a crash to desktop. And yes, the loading times and game-ending hangs/crashes occur every time.

Here's how a basic game goes:

Start up the Sims 3. Spen about 15 minutes syncing for all the DLC I don't own. The spend roughly an hour trying to get logged in to origin. Register a new email, re-register with origin, spend another ten minutes trying to figure out why that account won't work either.

Once I've done this for a while and feel confident enough, I move forward to the second part of the game. I ignore all those warnings that I'm missing out by playing in offline ,mode, because I don't think it will effect the later game much. This involves laying out the very basics of a house, then immediately crashing to the desktop.

All in all, this procces can only really be streached out to four or five hours of quality play time, tops. I'm told there are thngs like careers and characters and a whole, whole pile of really good, expensive DLC at the very end of the game, but it doesn't really seem like you need to bother with them to complete the game or experience everything it has to offer.

 Another thing that bothers me is when you open the game, the loading screen is basically an advertisement of how your missing out on the full Sims 3 ""experience"". This also happens a few times while in the game, typical EA I say, but my opinion on EA dosn't matter if you dont like it.

1,12757671,english,"Sims 3, for all it's faults and troubles is probably the best Sims game to date.

The open world provides a sense of immersion not achieved by earlier games.  This is a feature that was missing in previous games.

There are a wide variety of expansion packs to provide additional functionality for just about anyone.

You can pretty much play the game however you want, you can make your sim an upstanding citizen, a socialite, an excentric recluse, a crook or anything inbetween.  You can have your sims befriend everyone and be known for being nice, use them to express your darkest desires to ruin all your neighbor's lives, or even ruin their own lives if you so chose. 

That is not to say the game doesn't have it's problems.   It is probably the buggiest game ever released by EA, and that includes Sim Copter and Streats of Sim City.   It is using an archaic branch of Mono which makes the Mono releases chosen by Unity3D look new, and has a severely garbage collector that leaves unnecessary cruft everywhere and instead vacates other objects from memory as soon as you leave the lot they are on.   It seems either the core programmers didn't know how to mark something as a cached asset, or just didn't bother.   Despite the size of the game, there is no attempt to use either a disk heap, or a secondary virtual memory segment to store cached assets, and until recently it didn't even support over 2GB of game memory space.


Tech support is nearly non-existant, but fortunately the game has finally stopped being update to support expansion packs, which would commonly break the game completely for older expansion packs, so there are fewer issues.

To put it simply, the game itself I give a wonderfully positive rating as a near perfect game for it's category.  It is everything a Sims game should be.  However, the backend is flawed at best, and often downright broken, while tech support is downright non-existant.   Frankly, I think EA could care less about technical support or keeping their older games functioning on newer technology, and I think recent reports of having the worst customer support in the video game industry are not only accurate, but an understatement.

Still, if you can put up with these faults, The Sims 3 is certainly worth your time and frustrations.",1414993525,1414993525,True,26,2,0.67723923921585083,7,True,False,False,76561198067460853,374,45,81205,0,29003,1591705594

50,12450819,english,"심즈 4가 나온 지 1개월 째가 되었지만 지금 상태로는 심즈 3의 판매량이 더욱 많다. 왜냐면 EA는 하도 병신이라 나중에 DLC만 더 사라고 심즈 3에 나온 기능들을 꽤나 많이 뼀기 때문. 이는 비슷한 처지인(?) 프로토타입 2와도 같다.
아무튼, 심즈 3가 왜 대작인지, 2와 비교하면서 설명하자면 많으므로 5가지로 설명이 가능하다.
(일단, 두 게임 모두 확장팩이 없는 기준으로 평가한다.)
1.확 달라진 심 커스터마이징
2가 딱딱한 바비인형 내지는 각선미 있는 심들이 있었다면 심즈 3는 좀 더 동글동글한 이미지로 바뀌었다. 특히 심즈 2에서는 별자리로 성격을 정했던 반면 심즈 3에서는 아예 성격을 집어넣을 수 있게 되었다. 게다가 목소리도 고저음으로 바꿀 수 있다는 것도 큰 특징. 그리고 표정 변화도 좀더 소프트(...)하게 바꾸었다.
2.게임성
심즈 1, 2의 경우는 월드가 굉장히 폐쇄적인 느낌이었다면 심즈 3는 완전히 오픈월드화 되었다. 특히 로딩 없이 자기 발로 다른 사람 집에 갈수 있는 것도 특징. 또 무드렛이라는 새 기능이 추가되고 욕구 관리도 나름 쉬워졌다.

물론 확장팩과 아이템팩이 드럽게 많다는 것이 단점이긴 하지만, 심즈는 꼭. 반드시 확장팩 3~4개는 사 놓고 플레이하는 게 가장 재미있다.

58,12398627,english,"I moved my Sims games over to Origin a long time ago. It's where they belong. I have no opinion on EA as a developer/publisher.

TS3, as it is called by it's players who identify themselves as Simmers, is aptly the third offering in the series. It offers total customization on evertything, which in hindsight stands as a development milestone that has no equal. It is an open world sandbox, where you can either try to do little goals presented by the game to have a little direction in your play, or totally go and do your own thing.

Wanna build a dinasty that stands the test of time over many generations? Go do it.
Wanna play fashion-designer and have avant-gardistic Sims populate your game world? Go do it.
Wanna mod your game into something totally different than what it was when you bought it? Go do it.
Right down to:
Wanna be a playah and impregnate every woman in town? Well... Go do it.

TS3 is many things. It's instantly playable, it's pleasingly colorful, it's quirkily humorous, it has some sweet tunes and you get unlimited customization and unlimited ways to play the Sims. Now that TS4 is out, it becomes painfully obvious how chockful of awesome ideas TS3 is and how amazingly optionfilled the player-agency in TS3 is.

So, what went wrong? Well, Maxis was busy coding SimCity and left development in the hands of an unproven studio that brazenly rebranded themselves into 'The Sims Studio' to hide the fact that they were called EA-of-Canada originally.  With each new idea they implemented, they broke something and they even managed to break stuff that was broken to begin with. They patched and patched to little avail and to this day TS3 stands as one of the most innovative sandbox games ever, but more broken than the most broken Bethesda title in existence.

Still, in the current Sims-franchise landscape, TS3 is the one game to have. As a Simmer since 2000 owning everything that has 'The Sims' in the title, I can confidently say this. It expands on ideas introduced in TS2, it doesn't have bedtime-tale graphics and it allows the player to create their own stories and experience much better than TS4 allows.

Free from any consideration involving EA, TS3 is a good game and if you can keep it running long enough to make some self-generated progress, TS3 becomes one of the more enjoyable experiences you as a gamer can have. Open mind and all that goodness.

I therefore recommend trying this title, but don't buy it on here. Keep an eye on Origin Sales and buy the game there. Unless your Internet-full-of-yourself-ego bars you from doing that.

Sims 3 gives you the ability to take control of a sim in a virtual world. There is no laid out path for you in the game- will your character be a teacher, scientist, rockstar, criminal, the choice is yours. Along the way you can get married, have kids, and this gives you the ability to control the lives of more sims. This is a fun game and well worth the money for a vanilla purchase. 

On a side note, what annoys me slightly is EA's blatant money grabbing tactics. Firstly there are 11 full expansions to the game, and each one costs almost as much as the base game. So that's another £190+.....then the rest of the dlc which is more money......and sims points to buy more furniture which is also more money. This all adds up to a pretty penny indeed! Paying £30 or £40 is what I consider a fair price for some decent expansion material, but EA is blatantly trying to shaft the consumer. Needless to say I will not be buying any expansion material whatsoever.

When the Sims 2 out in 2004, a massive improvement to the first one. I loved it to death and spent hours of playing it (Still playing it with the Ultimate Collection!), from abducting sims for the cute aliens, growing my family tree, helping my sims succeed throughout their life with a Summa Cuum Laude in the University Expansion, to raising their skills before their death, and so much more! When The Sims 3 came out, that was a different story, I didn't like it at first, no matter how much I tried to like it with all the expansions I bought, I couldn't. Right before the failure of a sequel known as The Sims 4 came out, I decided to give The Sims 3 one more chance, and finally, I got hooked!

Sims 3, like the Sims 2, is a massive improvement to the previous 2, regardless of the ridiculous microtransaction. The game is meant to simulate... Well, life! They even added a open-world aspect to the game! Oh, skills now varies from what you learn, it's not just a general thing like Creativity for arts and music, it's now skills like Guitar, Drums, Piano, Painting, so much more! Even exploring the neighborhood collecting items and finding interesting things for your skills. In some expansions, there is a new Life State I taken a liking to, such as Imaginary friends, a great way to build my family tree since you could make a Imaginary friend of the opposite gender of the owner. Even Aliens make a return in Seasons, and oh~ my~, they're even cuter than Sims 2 with that synthesize voice!

I didn't buy any of the other dlc as much as I wanted because I didn't want to go broke. I just assumed as time went on the game and the dlc would lessen in value as most games do.

What shocks me is that the dlc is just as much as it was the day it came out for purchase. Don't get me wrong, I love this game and think what I payed for the game itself was resonable. But here we have content for the game, which can not be used without the base game that now is worth the same amount as the base game itself?

I have near enough no money to my name, but with the help of some sort of demi-God I'm suddenly drowning in cash. I buy a beautiful new home and join the local bistro to kick start my career. After just my first week I have plenty of acquaintances and decide to throw a party to deepen my relationships and make some life long friends. The party is going smoothly, and I even get close to a girl and give her the old one-two in my way too big for just me bed. She stays the night and the next day I propose. There's no going slow in this town. Bad news; turns out she's my boss, I gained a step daughter, and she's also pregnant. She soon hits the elderly stages and I end up having to sleep with what looks like a dried up ballsack. I'm still young and have a granny for a wife and a baby who definitely isn't short of being ""special"". Not to mention my step daughter hates me. Is my life cliché? I wouldn't let it end like this. I throw party after party, befriend a highschool girl, and once she hits the ripe age of 18 I snag my first kiss with her; all under the watchful eyes of my wife. Needless to say, we're divorced now, and for some reason the little slut who caused it is no longer interested. That's okay. Time goes by and I bed a tubby tess in my ex-wifes bed, before throwing rejection in her face. My new target is the maid. She has too much to drink and I take her to bed in, you guessed it, my ex-wifes bed. My ex-step daughter walks in on us so I teach her a few choice words on her way out. I decide to marry the maid and have another child with her. A week later I have a little black baby girl, and my first daughter is a teenager now. Although I sleep with my wife and ex-wife in the same room, things are going good. Or so I thought. My new maid wife turns elderly and I've only just hit 30. My life takes a weird turn next, as the ex-step daughter who once hated me is now coming onto me hard. I say fuck it, and bed her. My maid wife catches me and we get divorced, so naturally I marry the step daughter while she's in her prime, and of course we need another baby. My first wife is now my mother-in-law, and my daughter is also my sister-in-law. Not that she cares. No matter how many wives I go through, my two daughters are still my best friends.

87,11934606,english,"Now where do I start. First of all, please ignore the little time I played Sims 3 on Steam. Reason being, I have a copy of Sims 3 (plus all the DLCs, including Ketty Perry Sweet Treats Stuff Pack) on Origin. I played countless hours on the Origin client. I bought the Steam version of Sims 3 because my goal is to own every game and DlCs on Steam. However, when I bought this on Steam, the Ketty Perry Sweet Treats Stuff Pack was already gone.

Having said this, playing Sims 3 is an enjoyable and yet frustrating experience. There are so many things to do with your Sim and this game has a high replayable value. There are countless things to explore and experiment. This game will stretch your creativity skills to the maximum.

However, there is a dark side to this game. If one plays without mods such as the Nraas mods, you will notice that there are many bugs in the game in which the developers failed to fix. For example, if you travel to other worlds like China and did the ""unique rocks analyze"" and then come back to your world, you will notice a discrepancy in the percentage of rocks your Sim has analyzed. This can be very frustrating if your intention is to create a perfect Sim where all your Sim's stats are being completed. Thus for hardcore Sim gamers, you guys must be prepared for these kinds of major anomalies.

However, for the casual players, (and there are a lot!) I would recommend this game to you. If you just want to have fun and pass time, then this game is for you. As I said this is a very fun game and that is what made the Sims genre a huge success in the history of video gaming. I also feel that women would enjoy this game more than men as there are a lot of opportunities to make your Sims fall in love and create a relationship made in heaven. That is what, most women love and dream about!

In conclusion, if you are looking for a ""perfect"" game, you would not find it here due to many major bugs. However, I would still recommend this game as these bugs can be fixed by installing the Nraas mods.",1409491287,1409491287,True,4,0,0.48185884952545166,0,True,False,False,76561198002608541,6047,205,15,0,15.0,1409490196

93,11915615,english,"The Sims is a ""people simulator"", which puts you in control of a neighborhood, dictating the personal lives of the residents one household at a time.  It is, I believe, the best-selling game series of all time, despite being a niche market.  It is an awkward game to explain from a gaming standpoint, as design Will Wright found when he pitched the series in the 90's.  

The Sims 3 makes a number of changes that in hindsight seem so obvious and address issues in the previous versions.  Some examples:

*Aging is now optional and adjustable.  You have the option of turning sim aging off (like The Sims 1), or having it on (like The SIms 2), and you can change the length of each age.  

*Story progression, also optional.  Now the neighbors who are not actively being played will carry on their lives without your input.  They will age, marry, have children, get jobs, and other things on their own.  

*Moodlets replace the previous method of tying emotional state directly to needs.  Now situations dictate emotions (and needs are just one trigger of moodlets).  This has a lot of great advantages, because it takes the emphasis off gaming the needs stats and onto the character's interactions.

*Personalities expand on the previous aspiration system, with each sim gaining a number of personality traits that determine moodlets, learning, abilities, and many other aspects of their lives.  

*Interactions between all of these systems make interesting results.  You can watch a lifelong feud between a Good personality-sim and an Evil personality-sim unfold, where their mood drops just be being around each other.  

One strange decision, however, is locking the focus on a single household.  Previously, you could freely switch families during a session, but while this is still possible, the game makes it a little awkward.  Sims 3 is designed for you to focus on a single house for most of the game.  

The worst thing about this game is DLC and microtransation creep.  The Sims 2 had a lot of expansions, and experimented with an online store eventually, but The Sims 3 truly went all out.  There are endless expansions, stuff packs, and an online story for buying clothes and objects.  I am not even sure it is possible to own the complete content of The Sims 3.  On the other hand, the variety of extra content allows you to customize the game to your liking.  You don't have to play Supernatural or get Katy Perry stuff if you would rather have Pets and 80's nostalgia.  

Personally, with the addition of some mods (like Overwatch and Story Progression), I consider this the most interesting version of The Sims, especially if you are interested in the neighborhood story.  Just remember DLC creep is optional...",1409361877,1409361877,True,2,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False,76561198032273592,523,119,649,0,623.0,1391201458

I do not recommend it as every time ou play it after about 15-30 mins of playing it, it will just randomnly crash for no apparent reason, also the game cant keep up with its self i scroll the mouse it doesnt do it so i have to wait 5 second for it to catch up.
its complete and utter dog S**TE. not worth the £24.99 i paid, i would get a refund if I could!
plus when it crashes you cvant even close the program because its S***TY LAG is so bad!

so in my opinion, DO NOT BUY!

I have all the major expansions except into the future, and i plan to get that when I have the cash. I dont have much time on this version because I get the stuff on steam and copy it to origins, as i already had content for it on there.

Most everything is great about this game but here are some cons about the base game and the expansions:

Baby sims are annoying, plainly unless you have the generations expansion which alleviates alot of the problems i had with them

Island paradise is massive and has a bug with houseboat movement that messes up ai sims movement, getting them stuck and without activating cheats/mods causes major gameplay slowing problems

Modding capabilities arent build straight into the game, but it's easy to get working admittedly

33,11714810,english,"Sims 3 is a simulation of................ LIFE!!!!!

The game is complex and well designed enough to let the gamers enjoy the possibilities of ""life"" as we know it.

It is vast enough for the gamers to see every corners of life first hand but it isn't detailed enough to show
every little miniscule details.

Depending on how creative ""you"" are, the game can get extremely fun or extremely deadbeat-boring if you arn't.

The game offers some intense customisation
Houses, sims, jobs, family, are some aspects that are fully customizable down to every individual faces.

It is a must try and a worthwhile buy(base game) quality wise.

They have their own version of a contents sharing communitites, the gamers are able to download various player made people, buildings, objects from the internet.

Similar to EA's spore, this is one of their trademark franchise that has not failed them, (for a damn good reason.)

The pros are explained above, the cons are:

-The game greeds money, it really WANTS you to make purchases for ingame items, DLCs etc.

-DLCs make the game more fun, THEY ARE INDEED FUN but imagine how much money you'll have to pay for various DLCs
you want.(if the prices have dropped to primal dollar values then reconsider the statement above)

-The game can get addictive, it can seriously chew up some valueable time.

-After you play the game for a long bit, it can start to lag horribley due to cummulated cache and such, so consider ventilating a bit.

- Sims4(or versions above?) would be out. It would be more versatile than the previous sims3 and possibly more fun.

-It is reccomended you use Origin :(


If you ""love"" and ""somewhat respect"" their game, consider buying it... If you wish to be frugal and do not want to spend every penny for their DLCs then please torrent safely :)

I'd recommend this game to individuals that enjoy being creative as you can dress your family, build your own houses, design your own pets, etc. 

The only dislike that I have is all of the additional add-on's that this game has. You don't have to purchase them, but they do add some great features.

another gripe is how expensive all the DLC / Extras are, which is a bit of an off putter for me on buying them, saying that sims3 as it is, is still a good game worth getting, just remember though extra content will bankrupt you lol.

Good game. Has a few issues in terms of readability, and generic EA bullcrap like Origin, a billion ""Would you like to share this on Facebook?"" pop-ups, and more than enough load time than is necessary. It's like my ass-hole, always loading shit.

As for the content, it's well packed with things to do. However, if you want more than that, get your Mastercard ready and prepare your anus, because you are going to get smacked upside the head with outlandish DLC prices. You want a few new items and an extra way to earn money? 20 dollars, please. Need new clothes? 20 dollars, please. Want all 10 DLC packs? 400 dollars, please.

If The Sims wasn't an EA franchise, it would be way better. Too bad, because this series has  A LOT of potential, and The Sims 2 had record breaking sales.

If you don't know what The Sims plays like already, here's a quick run-down. Create a custom character (or 29) called a Sim, bunch them up as single bachelors or families, and build them a house from scratch. Now control every aspect of their lives; fed or famine, rich or poor, children or freedom. You tell them what to do, they do it.... kind of like you are Fox News.

Playability: 200+ Hours
Technical Performance: You practically need an Alienware computer if you want to load within a reasonable time.
Enjoyment: High
Gameplay Quality: Very High
Non-Game Annoyances: 9001
For the Story?: The story is as good as you can make it.

You only need to buy expansions based on what else you WANT with Sims 3. Want to focus on a more singular lifestyle? Late Night adds a big city and plenty of social interactions for that style and ambitions adds plenty of new jobs that require more attention then most jobs. Want to focus on a family? Get Generations, and University Life to make the most of each stage of life.

Most importantly, perhaps, the game was a satire of consumerist mores, which it managed to parody and embrace in equal measure. As time has gone by, the series has become increasingly loud, obnoxious, manipulative, and (ironically) the embodiment of the consumerism it initially played upon. With each iteration, I've found the game more and more hollow. The last significant entry I can recall was likely The Sims 2 on the PS2, which allowed direct player control of your sim, alongside the traditional list based control scheme. This was never implemented again, and I always thought that was a pity since it completely changed up the flow and tone of the game.

The biggest downfall of The Sims is that it's failed to mature with it's initial player base; the teens who once played these games are now hitting thirty, at the very least, and the game in no way reflects the reality of life, or the character of real, living and breathing locales. Everything feels like a forced smile, masking a deeper cynicism that I find, frankly, repugnant and unwelcome in my gaming life. Even if you choose to play the game dark, the aesthetic and soundtrack choices betray a deliberate attempt to keep everything upbeat; even death is treated with levity, and birth is a necessity rather than a philosophical choice. The Sims will never really be more than it currently is, and footage of the fourth major installment unfortunately confirms my belief that the franchise has no desire to do anything new, innovative, or meaningful in it's life cycle. 

This franchise wants your money, and that is all. And it'll be the best fairweather friend you ever had, so long as it has access to your wallet.",1404515395,1404515395,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198105044739,327,3,357,0,357,1395835546

Another decent addition, aspirations are a nice touch and the sounds are really top notch but the microtransactions and 'holding back for more money' feel leaves a bad taste in the mouth. Plus, it can be a little glitchy at time.

Would just about recommend to buy. - 7/10

GRAPHICS

Putting into account when the game came out, the graphics are your standard 'good'. You can get a feel for the cartoony graphics and your Sims look like living beings in the create-a-sim. However, when you get to the real world, things start to come apart a little. There are definitely some rendering issues here and there, particulary when your Sim enters and exits taxis which they take around town now. Rather jaring. Buildings sometimes take a while to jump into focus as well but that might just be my PC. The animation hasn't moved on massively either (bar a few pleasent editions), which is dissapointing. Everything does it's job though and the textures look surfice a nothing really spectacular here or wowing, but it does the job - 7/10.

GAMEPLAY

Alot of your staple sim catagories are here: your create-a-sim, create-a-house, create-a-neighbourhood, etc. In these respects, the rule of thumb is we'll give you more, at the expense of less because we want to slap a microtransaction/DLCs ontop to bleed your money. The create-a-sim (where this rule applies the greatest) features a great deal more colour options, with the option to even change the shoulder colours and use ANY texture in the game as part of the costume (can make for some interesting results)... but at the expense of less clothes because we want to charge you for those. Oh and we'll charge you for the breast and chest enhancers to (via it's inclusion in certain DLC). Create-a-neightbourhood? We'll give you the freedom to build any lot you want... on certain spaces (which is a shame really). We'll also charge you for extra maps (which would be fine but the game only includes I believe 2 maps might even be 1) via DLC. Create-a-house, thankfully, isn't as bad. There are microtransactions for extra items, but the game does provide a number of items and item variations although this is not anything particulary groundbreaking. The inclusion of several upper and lower areas for any structure you build is an excellent edition, as well as tools to fill an entire room's wallpaper/floor in a certain way, saving you time.

Real world game play is your standard Sim affair but now with a number of extra parameters to flick on and off like how long you live in 'sim days' which are highly variable and you can even adjust the amount of time your sim spends in each area. There's also a few unique and interesting objects to interact with and you can set people to move in/out in real time, so there's lots of little tweaks to play around with. However, aspirations is the real meat in this game compared to the Sims 2. Filling aspirartions gives your sims boosts to happiness and bonus points to spend on stuff, with a massive boost if you manage to fill their life aspiration (selected at create-a-sim from a limited no. of options). The small micro-managing of what 4 aspirations you want (your sim gets new aspirations at regular times and when you add an aspiration or 'promise' it) adds a nice little dynamic to the game and surprisingly doesn't jar your day-to-day medelling. Some of the aspirations are a little superficial like 'buy a T.V.' but things like kiss such and such or go on an amazing date are always interesting to furfil and give some direction to the game, with the flexibility to ignore if you prefer.

Overall, it's pretty good - same old stuff (nothing too wrong with being puppet master) but the aspirations are a well needed spice. Some more seasoning would have been nice though. - 8/10.

SOUND

The sounds are where this game excels for me. The new build-a-home music tracks are delightfully calming yet inspiring melodies that take their time for you, just like the time it takes to build some of the monstrous projects that can occur. The usual pops and clicks are present and pleasent with the added quior like AHHHHHHHH whenever an aspiration is completed, which is a joviel touch. Even the new sim radio tunes are on the right side of silly. Sometimes, it does all get a bit samey and annoying - perhaps some more variation in tunes between the neighbourhood, create-a-sim and create-a-house thing wouldn't have gone astray, but mostly good news here. - 9/10.

FEELZ

Ah, The Sims. There's alot to like about the Sims franchise in general. The concept of creating this person that you can manipulate at will imbeds the player with a great sense of power. It is something that has been strong amogest all the Sims games. This powerful feeling still lingures, although some of the magic is starting to fade away. Not only is this the 3rd game in a row like this but also what feels like the 1,000,000th edition to this game. It's suffers from a classic (and somewhat severe) case of 'franchise fatigue' as I like to call it whereby the company tries to bleed every last penny out an initially successful game rather than come up with a new idea by tweaking and perfecting. Doesn't mean the game is bad as per se but it feels like it could be so much more and probably would be if the company wasn't to busy trying to hold back on ideas. Here we see DLC varation in it's most hideous form and, worse still microtransactions, which are pretty much the gaming equivilant of a sin in paid games. This is a proper game, I expect proper standards right from when I put the money on the table and it's a great shame when the company holds back. 

Basically, it really does feel like you are being ripped off big time but what you do get fed by the EA machine is pleasent enough to taste... even if it is a little familiar. - 7/10.

ADDITIONAL:

- The initial load time is horrid, especially with all the DLCs. Hell, they even patched it with a mini-game it's that bad. It's as bad as Dues Ex Machina.

- The game glitches out more than it should but nothing that won't stop gameplay all together... it's just a bit much, even for an open-world.

Pros:
- Hours of fun, ""replayability"" is high
- Clever programming, Sim interaction is interesting to watch
- The price of the base game is a lot cheaper than it used to be
- Plenty of building tools to keep you creating awesome things
- Extensive character customization

Cons:
- Microtransactions, Simpoints are terribly overpriced
- Game crashes sometimes, mostly due to a memory error
- Sim interaction can sometimes be glitchy and everything will come to a standstill in-game
- Forced to pay real world money for some necessary items
- Expensive DLC packs that make your wallet cry

38,10988373,english,"Pros: There's lots of customization available to you as you create your sims, both in looks and personality, so you can easily and creepily recreate your old uncle Frank and live out his life if you really wanted to... Their AI isn't horrible, and they will self-perserve as best as possible without your input (although they're still horrible at it). There are also a lot more interactions with the world and other sims that help flesh out your little community.

Cons: You need the DLCs. Maybe not all of them, but you need at least one of the larger expansions and a few content packs. The base game is okay, but it's obvious that a lot of things that should have been in the base game, such as modifications and extra options for various careers, were not in specifically so EA could sell it to you later. And as always, the more add-ons you have, the worse the game performs, so there's always this balancing act. 

Pro?Con?: You will wonder where the last 8 hours of your day went... frequently.

Verdict: I can only recommend this game earnestly if you are okay with buying some of the DLC. If not, then you're in for maybe 15 hours or so of enjoyment before you get bored of having the same items, doing the same careeers, and generally following the same path over and over again.",1404172598,1404172598,True,7,0,0.588510334491729736,0,True,False,False,76561198057629728,159,1,8999,0,1364,1597024106

If you already have an Origin account with another game, just furnish your Steam product key to link it. Loading times are much longer than I expected, but everything ran fairly smoothly after that. On my first Sim, I noticed a lot of frequent lags as we were waiting for the Grim Reaper to show up. I'm not sure whether it was some background process on my machine or the game itself, but considering that it didn't start until a few days before Death came knocking, I'm tending to believe it's the game. Actions would lag for a second or so a couple or three times per minute. Really annoying. Well worth the price if you can catch it on sale, but definitely not worth the full price tag, especially considering that Sims4 is due out in a couple of months.

(EDIT)Forgot a couple of things. When you register the game, you'll get 1000 Sim Points (worth about $10), but it will take some hunting to find them. They'll be on your store account page and will need to be redeemed before you can use them.

81,10586839,english,"The Sims 3 is an awesome game that simulates life in fun and rewarding ways. There are a huge number of expansion packs and other DLC that add a great deal to the game. These range from small gameplay elements, to clothing and furniture, to new careers, worlds, and lifestates.

Although interest in this game is waning because The Sims 4 is due out soon, I'm sure fans will continue to play it for a long time to come. If for no other reason, then it will be a long while before TS4 will have anywhere near the amount of content that is now available for TS3 by means of expansion packs, stuff packs, and multitudes of mods.

If you like designing, building, and furnishing homes, then there is a great deal of fun to be had in this game.

If you like creating a character and making all their dreams come true, and achieving all their goals - romance, marriage, children, career, whatever - then you'll have a blast. If you'd rather choose some poor lost soul to torment, visit misery and an early demise upon ... this, too, can be arranged.

Whether you prefer to play as a family-oriented type whose focus is their family, as an evil mastermind who seeks political leadership of the world, as a 'romance' type whose life goal is to woohoo with as many sims as possible, or as a fire-fighting hero with a bent for community service, you can do it. This, and oh so much more.

Do you wish to play as a witch, a genie, a werewolf or vampire, a fairy, a ghost, or an ordinary sim? All these lifestates - and more - are available if you have the right expansion packs.

There are also multitudes of ingame achievements for those into that kind of thing (like me).

The only real negative, imo, is the cost if you want more than just the base game ... and believe me, you do. Which is why I waited for the Steam sales to purchase them.",1403306681,1403929986,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198053066147,68,6,114778,0,66891,1495005071
82,10893334,english,"Oh, the SIMS. The love we dare not speak its name. 

I remember playing the original and thinking that it was a lot like a game I had played way, way back in DOS land. Then Sims 2 came out and competely blew my mind, giving a whole new spin on the idea of the virtual dollhouse. It was a game you could walk away from, come back to, watch passively or interfere with. So imagine my surprise when Sims 3 said that the entire town was going to run simultaneously. I was shocked, outraged, and said I wouldn't play it.

I take everything back. The Sims 3 is a solid upgrade to the Sims 2 (though it crashes just as much, it seems) and the up-and-coming Sims 4 still appear to have everything that made the franchise great amounts of money for EA... and people are still waiting in the wings to give them more. Yes, EA, you've taken my money again and I gave it with a smile, a prayer, and a pony.

14,10639920,english,"There's a lot I want to praise this game for. There's tons of sim customization options here, some very powerful building tools, and some pretty funny situations you can get your sims in. Even the pets have a ton of customization options available to them. In truth, when the mood hits me just right The Sims can feel like an incredibly satisfying game. Why can't I recommend this game then? 

I have probably over 500 hours clocked into this game on Origin. I have almost all the expansions, and a lot of fun memories with this game. In a lot of ways The Sims is like a seperate hobby branching off of your gaming hobby. The problem is that it's a stupidly expensive hobby for a game and, ultimately, feels like a huge waste of time. No matter what houses or community lots I create or fun families I put together, actually playing the game is often a huge head ache thanks to some pretty miserable pathing choices and unrealistic Sim interactions (why can't they just socialize with the people in the room with them while they are all doing different activities?). I often finding most of my time going into creating new lots for the game, but I have yet to ever make it through an entire generation without the game feeling simply too repetative, unimmersive, or just plain buggy as hell. 

There are some fantastic mods that can fix a couple of the issues I've pointed out above, but if you're new to the series bewarned that it is, without a doubt, a huge time sink and a very expensive one at that. Ultimately I think the promises of The Sims 4 has potential to fix many of my peevs with the game, but once again, what an expensive game to get into...

23,10627375,english,"Lets get the negs out of the way first.  1.  It's EA, so official support for it is crap, the tug-o-war for making it available on steam is tiresome, there are bugs in it that have not and will not be fixed, and it's expensive with more DLC/Expansions than any rational person would ever allow into their game.

Now for the positives:
Non-sims players -- this has a gameplay unlike anything else.  Yes, it's a sim, but it's a hybrid of a comedy sim (like surgeon simulator) and a serious sim (like Cities XL or SimCity 4).  There is tons of content in this game--only Skyrim compares to it in sheer scope, and the user-content community is arguably bigger than Skyrim.  Whatever you want your sim to do, chances are there is a way to scratch that itch in the game.  Be what you've always dreamed of being, or what you've never dared to.  
It's fun, it's quirky.  You can drop 20 minutes on it and be fine, or play it in 6 hour stretches.  It has all the good makings of a casual game, but plenty of options in it for more serious gamers.  It's not age-specific, or gender specific.  My daughters and I play it together frequently and enjoy it, and even my wife plays it.  It's kinda odd to say it like this, but it's the Disney of games--fun for families and all ages (and fortunately I haven't had to had the WooHoo talk with my 4 year old yet as a result of her playing)
Veteren sims players -- this isn't anything like The Sims 1 and 2.  You are not bound to lots, it's no longer about sending your sim out to their job in a good mood.  The city you live in is seamless and vibrant.  Everyone in the city is being simulated and living their life in the background while you play.  There are careers that require interaction that are fun, and there are ample ways to make money without even having a career.  The game doesn't end when you're fabulously wealthy either.  Every skill has its own journal with difficult tasks and opportunities that add an interesting new element to the game play.",1403375519,1403375519,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561197991603176,670,32,72325,0,66641,1565836315

Its also a game my girlfriend and myself can play at the same time, i make the money and do all the hard part and she spends it on customizing parts of the house and garden or buys the next sized house for us to do up haha.

86,10396213,english,"Twilight begins with an unnamed narrator (whom we later find out is Bella) giving a brief account about how she is about to die at the hands of a hunter. She is dying in the place of someone she loves, and the narrator does not regret any of the choices that brought her to this point. The past few months have been extraordinary, and she can’t complain.

Zip! Now we’re following the life of Isabella “Bella” Swan, our seventeen-year-old narrator. Bella is moving to Forks, Washington, to live with her dad. We later learn that she volunteered to do this so that she wouldn’t hold her mother back from spending more time with her mother’s new husband. Forks is isolated, cold, dreary, and wet, and Bella’s relationship with her dad is distant, since she was raised by her mother in Phoenix. Bella's new life is dull until she gets a glimpse of the Cullen family – five gorgeous, mesmerizing siblings who attend her high school. She learns they do not socialize with anyone but each other. One of the boys in particular, Edward, pays her close attention and seems to regard her with alarming hostility when she's forced to sit next to him in Biology class. The next day, he is absent from school.

Bella continues to adapt to her new life in Forks. She gets a lot more attention from boys than she was used to in Phoenix. She makes several friends quickly. A few days later, Edward finally is back in school. Now he’s friendly to Bella. His mere presence excites her. That afternoon in the school parking lot, a boy’s truck almost hits Bella after skidding on some black ice, but Edward uses his body as a shield in order to save her. Wait, how’d he do that?! Bella is totally baffled by this, but Edward refuses to explain his inhuman strength. She begins to have dreams about Edward, but at school, he gives her the cold shoulder. His behavior is very confusing, indeed.

Bella gets asked to the upcoming school dance by not one, but three boys, all of whom she rejects. The next day, Edward gets Bella to talk to him during lunch – for the first time he’s spending lunch apart from his siblings. Knowing that she's trying to make sense of his strength and how he saved her, Edward asks for her “theories” on him. Next, it’s let’s-figure-out-your-blood-type day in Biology class, and Edward’s skipping class. Bella becomes faint at the mere thought of blood, and gets taken to the nurse’s office (Edward appears outside and intercepts her from Mike, one of the guys who has a crush on Bella). Edward insists that he take her home.

That weekend, during a trip to a beach at La Push Indian reservation, Bella meets Jacob Black, who tells her about “the cold ones” (vampires). Word around the reservation is that the Cullens are vampires. When Bella gets home, she does some internet research and things start falling into place. Bella decides that she’s too in love with Edward to resist him, even if he is a vampire.

Soon after, Bella takes a trip to Port Angeles with a few friends, where she gets lost looking for a bookstore. Some thugs almost attack her in a dark alley, but Edward appears in his shiny Volvo and saves her. They have dinner together, and he drives her home. He reveals that yes, he is a vampire. Edward doesn’t want to be a monster, though, and actually only drinks the blood of animals. Bella knows now that he does thirst for her blood, yet she still is in love with him. Edward repeatedly warns Bella that she should be afraid of him and stay away, if she’s smart.

Edward and Bella take a mini-field trip together and spend the afternoon in a nearby secluded meadow, where Edward shows Bella that his skin sparkles in the sun (which is why vampires only come out at night or on cloudy days, which are common in Forks). They are completely in love. They kiss for the first time. Bella learns more about Edward’s family and their past. Edward struggles with abiding his morals (not tempting himself by getting close to a human) versus what he desires – to be near Bella. 

Edward spends the night in Bella's bedroom, watching over her as she sleeps (without her dad knowing, of course). Bella visits Edward’s house, meets his family, and learns more about their “kind” – vampires who don’t feast on humans. They go back to her house where Jacob and his father Billy Black show up to see her dad (Billy and Charlie are friends). Being a Quileute elder from the La Push reservation, Billy knows about the Cullens' secret and is worried for Bella's safety. He warns her to stay away from the Cullens. After the Blacks leave, Edward returns in his brother's jeep to pick up Bella. They’re going to play baseball. It's a Cullen family bonding ritual, evidently.

While the Cullens are playing their crazy version of baseball (they're all incredibly strong and fast), three other vampires show up. One named James takes a liking to Bella (in the “I want to eat you” kind of way). Edward and his family get Bella away from James long enough to make a plan. They know that James is trying to track Bella, so Alice and Jasper (Edward's adoptive siblings) whisk her away to a hiding place in Phoenix, but James lures Bella to him by telling her that he has captured her mom. He’s about to kill Bella when the Cullen clan shows up. The only problem is that James has already bitten Bella. If Edward doesn't suck the venom-infected blood out of her, she'll become a vampire. Though it's difficult for Edward to control his urge to suck all of Bella's blood, he manages to cure Bella without killing her. The Cullens kill James and get Bella to a hospital, where she starts to recover from her many injuries. 

Overall Bella’s OK, though banged up. She and Edward are more in love than ever. However, they argue because Bella wants him to bite her and make her into a vampire so that they can live together forever; Edward refuses. Regardless of their different species, they are devoted to one another completely.

In the Epilogue, Edward surprises Bella by taking her to the prom – she's horrified because she's uncoordinated and worried about dancing in public. Jacob shows up at the dance and delivers a message – Billy wants Bella to dump Edward. He also wants her to know that they “will be watching” (Epilogue.118). Anyway, Edward and Bella go outside to have some time alone – it’s twilight outside. Again, Bella asks Edward to make her into a vampire, and he refuses. Edward says to Bella, “I will stay with you – isn’t that enough?” and she replies, “Enough for now” (Epilogue.204).

You can design Sims, and make their lives glamourus or make their life as sucky as yours.  Or you can be a mass muderer and just kill every Sim you meet. :D  But anyways . . . the Sims 3 is a really great game.  The best feature by far in the game, though, has to be all the possiblilities.  I know this is a huge marketing thing for the game, but it's so true.  You can have a Sim with a green thumb, flirty, and a bookworm who's rich and has a massive house, or you can make an evil, athletic Sim with commitment issues, who's broke and is a criminal.  You can literally do almost anything.  And with all the expansion packs (none of which I have BTW, I'm broke, like I said, life sucks), you can do even more.  Oh, and if your one of those people who think the Sims is boring (I mean, whi wants to order Sims around, it's hard enough to have to get outta my office chair to grab a pop) you just have to try it to know it's not.  I didn't even know what it was about before I played it, and when I did <3 !!!!  There are only a few complaints I have with the game, for one, the Sim creator is a little laggy, (not sure if it's the game of the computer, actually), for two, it takes a loooooooong time to load (once again, not sure if it's the game or the computer), thirdly, I wish controling Sims actions at jobs was part of the game, and not an exansion pack, and lastly, and the biggest complaint . . . THE SIMS 4!!!!!!!!!  It's coming out soon, and it's the sole reason I wouldn't suggest this game.  I've even watched a few videos on it, and it looks like all my complaints (other than the job thing) are being fixed (unless it's my computer, in that case :( ...) it's also a lot more detailed in the Sim creator part.  I would deffinatally recommend this game, it's a great addition to any game collection.  :D

The jobs and career tracks are severely limited, and if you want more careers, you need to pay $40 for the DLC. If you want more than the ugly clothing, $20 DLC. If you want pets, $20 DLC. If you want new towns, they can cost from $20 to $40-50 - and don't come with new careers anyway. If you want new towns and new careers, be prepared to pay $60-$100 extra. I wasn't prepared, nor will I be.
I could get shitloads of games for the amount of money that EA wants for this fractured, broken thing that laggs even the fastest of computers.
Not worth it and I wouldn't recomend. Sooner or later you'll get bored with just the base, want more and end up just as frustrated as the rest of us.",1398486322,1398486322,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198064188235,35,2,17057,0,10627,1599339885

After they have mastered skills, you can let them go for a more ""video break"" day off - I like to let them do what they want all day, here and there, and they remember to feed the fish! Plus, you get to see what they choose to eat, watch, play, etc...even when they want to go to sleep! I like the mini-movies in STO episodes too; so maybe it's me.

I did some hardware work on my computer and am having to install the game again; took a while to figure out what the problem was too! I've missed it...it can be very relaxing after playing battle games. I like to let it play at normal speed while they are at work sometimes - to watch the rest of the map move around. It's the only game I've ever played where you can do that. Usually, you are restricted to your character.

Side note, great for reinforcing ""planning"" ...if you don't plan, train, work, etc - you just die! It's not a bad game to reinforce responsibility; so it's oddly educational... I started thinking in steps again; like I did during my career climb in real life. I must also mention that your reputation matters; people talk in this game! Do something in public - everyone soon knows. I think it is a great gauge for social skills too...if you are rude, people don't cooperate. But that sounds less fun than it is!!! Sorry for that.

Bottom line: it offers variety. Fast forward thru everything or watch it play out...follow them up close or from a distance... make them lazy or a perfectionist - which does effect their moods! Always remember that you cannot make them lazy then force them to work out all the time; their mood will go south!

I soon found myself running out of friends, so I moved them up to the surface and fencing them in with watchtowers surrounding the fence, mostly as means of intimidating people who up to this point had probably gone mad to the point of a loss of all forms of verbal communication. 
I soon began to question myself over whether or not these actions had translated into my own person life. I had people laughing at my jokes, but starving to death, drowining in pools surrounded by inescapable walls, and soon was placing bets on the lives of those at my lot. 
So I filled the lot with ovens, causing an alarmingly high fire hazard, before what is now referred to in my journals as ""The Great Blaze."" resulting in an utter loss of human lfie, before moving to a new house.

28,9776164,english,"The Sims 2 is my favorite Sims version, hands down. I have sunk in a lot of hours on that clunker on how much IMPROVEMENT it had over the Original Sims and it's console counterparts. It introduces Aging, towns, the Supernatural, 3D archetecture, Floors, and just...so much stuff that it is hard to comphrend how many things it has done.
Sims 3, however...isn't that. It kinda...uhm...isn't really as fun.

Sims 3 looks and runs a LOT better than Sims 2, don't get me wrong. The visual design works in it's favor of making characters look realistic as well as adding a town that doesn't require a long-crack loading screen. But when I bought Sims 3 and started playing it, It felt empty rather than full. 

Not once did I actually play the In-Game families, when in Sims 2 I took a big love of the single mom and her dedicated son, the three dudes and the little alien baby (...Just got that reference) And the Goth Family just being cool again. But with Sims 3, I cannot recollect a single memorable sim that just made me think: ""Yeah, that WAS a fun family to play with"". But...I GUESS you can play as a custom sim? You know, the one with only a dozen or two default hairstyles?

And let's get it out of the way. The Sims is just a dollhouse simulator for adults and kids, and we just like building our little 'family' to play around with. But with Sims 3, it feels more like a Lego simulator, where you have to buy all the hairparts and 
the brick parts and the clothes parts and the blah blah parts, and all of them are just so god dang expensive! 

Even without the price tag, each DLC actually kind of RUINS the main vanilla flavor of the Sims 3 base game. It use to be where ghosts and the unknown were strange scary things, where the threat of death can come at a moments notice and surviving through to old age means you are a cool dude. Now, there are werewolves running around my town with a full moon every few nights, a dozen deer just running around yukking it up, and FESTIVAL EVENTS ARE COMING UP even though you bought the DLC to just get the hairstyles! It just muddles the main point of where I just want to let my sim live a normal life, not to become a immortal werewolf fairy vampire who has the big bucks and is married to Chuck the plumber.

I would love a Sims game where you can actually customize the length of the hair, the fabric and length of the clothing, the dreams and desires of a Sim where the actions can't be overridden, I just want a Sim game where it just takes place in a house, and you raise a sim from being a baby sim into being a dead ghost sim. Just...please.

Would I reccomend this game: NO
The graphics and visual design are an improvement over Sims 2, but the Sims 3 feels downright stale and claustrophobic compared to the open sense of discovery with it's predecessors. 
Suggestions to Game Devs: Try to focus on making a game where the character's personality actually defines how they dress and how they interact with others.

16,9441896,english,"Good, but damned expensive.  Especially considering:
∙ The game is relatively ancient.
∙ They're getting set to release a new version of the game.
∙ As soon as this version was released, they literally turned off support for the last version of the game.

I play the game like an RPG.  Subsequently, I end up working to keep my character ""young,"" even as the world ages around her.

The game allows for an immense amount of freedom, and has very interesting content.

Unfortunately, for a game that costs as much as this one does, they seem to have some pretty big major oversights:
∙ They have a micro-transaction system that isn't micro and requires buying points.
∙ Their in-game store does not work with the Steam Wallet.
∙ Some of the expensive content in their store could well - and probably should - be offered on Steam as DLC instead of from their store.
∙ The game should have Steam Workshop integration.
∙ They have a free toolset that will not work with the Steam version - unless  you're willing to edit your registry and perform a wide variety of other advanced tasks in order to trick it.
∙ The game has some pretty basic bugs, and have always had those bugs, and requires mods just to keep the game playable.

Please note most of the problems I've noted just wouldn't be ""problems"" if the game wasn't still so expensive.  For example:
∙ Simply releasing a version of the game with all the content available for it included in the purchase price, even at a cost of around forty dollars, would render my complaints null.

24,9417040,english,"Alright, let's get the bad out of the way first:

- Yes, there's a lot of DLC for this game. The total cost is almost $500 to get all the content available on Steam. Even if you don't buy any of the Stuff Packs, which only contain decorative items, you're still spending like $340. There's even more in the online Sims 3 store, most of which is just recolors or redecorations of existing items, but there are at least a dozen premium items that add new functionality to the game...and they cost more than $100 total too!

- The game is VERY buggy and slow. Any time you have to change maps (Create a Sim, Change Outfits, any expansion lot, etc), you have to go through a loading process that can take a while too. Compounding the problem is the ""Hidden Objects"" Loading Screen game that EA uses to advertise Sims 3 expansions and stuff packs. Once you get in the game, you have to deal with memory leak issues, which means that the game will get slower and slower the longer you play. The problem isn't too bad if you have just the base game, but each additional DLC you add on, the slower it gets. As for the bugs, the list gets too long to mention here. The major ones that I have experienced are that some of the icons don't always load and the Sims will have severe pathfinding issues from time to time. Don't get me started on the minor issues though...

- Make sure you have PLENTY of space. The game itself takes about 32 GB of the hard drive you install it on, which could be rather important if you choose to install Sims 3 on a SSD, which would help with the long loading times I mentioned earlier. In addition to that, the saves and any custom content you download from Sims 3 Store can also add to the bulk. Saves + custom content generally installs itself in your Documents folder, which means anyone who has a small SSD for their OS will have to be careful, since they can take 10+ GB of space as well (my saves + custom content is about 9.7 GB).

Alright, so those are the major bad points I can think of. Do the good points outweigh the bad? Well lets see:

- The game is fairly addictive for me at least. Even though this game is officially a simulation, I treat this game more like a RPG, as you get to customize your characters (Sims), help them train their skills, get better at their jobs, go on adventures (expansion packs required for this part though), and various other things. Even though the game premise (simulating real life) doesn't sound like a particularly exciting thing to do, it actually is quite fun. Your Sims has six basic needs in game: Hunger, Fun, Bladder, Hygiene, Social, and Energy. Trying to satisfy all of those needs while simultaneously trying to get the Sims to get better at various things is a challenge that requires planning and a lot of in-game/real world time. Besides, as you improve your Sims and they get more money, they can buy more stuff...and who doesn't like (pretending) to buy more stuff?

- There's a fairly high degree of customization available in the game. Within the game itself, the number of items available *might* be fewer than in the past, but each item can now have variations, many of which you can customize yourself. In addition, even if you don't get any DLC, there's plenty of free customized content available to download online, and, if you are talented/feeling adventurous, you could always design your own.

Conclusion:

I really wish Steam had a recommendation system ranging from 1-5 stars instead of a simple Yes/No recommendation because getting the game is ultimately a tricky decision. You will definitely have to put up with a lot of various frustrations in the process of playing the game, and patience is certainly required. In addition, even though you can perfectly play the game without any of the DLC, I'm pretty sure that anyone who buys the game without any DLC is constantly going to be either tempted by all the additional features of the expansions or just simply bombarded by the blatant advertisement for the packs that EA sprinkles throughout the game. 

Still, if you are willing to deal with these faults and temptations, the game is certainly very fun to play. As I mentioned earlier, the game is certainly a good simulation game, and it does include good RPG elements as well. If you've played Sims 1 and 2 before, you already know more or less what to expect here, and (excluding bugs) the game is certainly better in every way. 

In summary, if there was a 5 star rating system, I'd probably give this game a 3.5. Great game, but certainly flawed in numerous ways.",1394515952,1394515952,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561197982222515,4465,9,4174,0,3837,1575298891

Theres only one thing that bugs me, if you just make one sim, start from the bottom and work your way up, there is never enough time. Your sim ages to fast and dies far to quickly. In 4 hours play time my sim went from being a young adult to pensioner and I hadnt even moved out of the first house i purchased. I hope there is a feature in the next game where ageing can be slowed down. Like really slowed down. Apart from that, still awesome :)

37,9390973,english,"I am male and i have played The Sims 3 a tonne. I have also played The Sims 2 a tonne. I gave this game a thumbs up but lets get started with the criticisms. The game mechanics are often clunky. Interactions between two sims require the two sims to be perfectly lined up and in sync in order for the interaction to be executed. This is frustrating when you are waiting for like ten seconds for two sims to interact. In the Sims 2, sims were capable of liking each other a different amount, but in this they always like each other the same. I don't know why they downgraded that aspect. If i made the game i would make the AI a lot better. I always have this beef with games. They never make the AI in games good enough. Good AI creates depth and makes the game a lot more replayable. It doesn't seem to bother people. Let's go through the pluses of the game. The Sims is a very unique concept and no game goes into such depth with social interactions. The game simulates a social society.

41,9369400,english,"My review of this game is easily mixed, the game is very fun to play and enjoyable, but much more so with the downloadable content, or only a fraction of it.  Most of it is about half as expensive as the game itself where other content is even more expensive than that, there's plenty of useless add ons that only add a few cosmetic changes and nothing else.  More or less it's devided into two seprate groups.  Actual content and ""Stuff"" packs, the actual content is viable if it weren't more expensive, where as the ""Stuff"" packs only add a couple new stuff, ussually stuff that won't affect gameplay in the slightest outside of just being able to buy a couple extra stuff for twenty dollars.  

Essentially the only reason I got this game due to the price was because of a 75% sale that was going on, doing research on every little pack just in case I missed something, I've narrowed down some essentials to get if you purchase this game, but I'd only do so when it's on a 75% sale due to the fact all the DLC is over 250 US$ not including the game itself.
Needs:
Seasons: Adds a couple new traits, a lot of new winter coats plus normal everyday clothes ussually themed with seasons, as well as adds dynamic weather and a threat of dying from weather or getting miserable sun burn.
Pets: Adds a bunch of pets to the game, from cats, dogs, and horses which you can control to birds turtles and other non-controlable characters.  You'll spend a little less time speeding through your day when your sim is taken up at work or asleep this way.
Generations: Adds quite a few new traits and a new theme, scrapbook, which stores your memories, the pictures are taken a bit wonky half the time but it also lets you pick your wish no matter what which is always a plus.

The rest is based on oppinion such as a couple I haven't gotten, supernatual comes to mind on this one.

You should avoid at all costs unless you feel 100% sure it'll add a lot to your experiance is all the stuff packs.  Mostly servering souly for role play aspects (Which the modding community glady contributes as well for free) your packs come with generally a couple new things for males and a handful for females (very lopsided men are less important than females in this game it seems) these packs server only to take your money, in fact my suspicion is that the reasoning behind using your codes on the sims 3 website you get with your games is souly because EA Games is so terrified people will find out it's a bad deal and just hack the stuff into the game, which wouldn't surprise me given their more or less monopolistic aproach.

Verdict is the game is a avoid at all costs as you'll want to get a bunch of map packs, it's saving grace is that the stuff I found contributed to a great game is spending 60 US$ durring a 75% sale going on, but that's about 240 US$ out of a sale just to have a good game and that's only buying less than half the downloadable content.  Don't waste your money, wait for a sale or have been born very rich to not care, but this game so isn't worth the expense out of sale and DO NOT get this game if you don't have high end hardwear, this game will give issues to some better designed computers in its own.",1394169412,1394169412,False,3,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198076845088,166,22,6047,0,1689,1529462336
42,9367821,english,"Hmm. I am dissapointed and um... angry actually. This is one of the most dissapointing games I have ever played. Not because of gameplay, that part is great... when and if it happens. This is the most buggy thing I have ever played. I read the online reviews which warned me, but I have a great gaming computer with lots of resources and processing power, what could go wrong? My real issue (as far as I can tell) comes from the paradise island add on which consistently stalls and has a huge bug... I tried setting everything down way low but it was still stalling all the time. I would just go elsewhere (like university) and all would be fine, so I mostly played there. But i went on an 'adventure' and when i 'returned home' i got dumped on a tiny island with no ability to move physically at all and I mean at all,  no home no money no access to the other panels for phone or anything else. I have repeatedly gone back to my save and tried again but its the same thing and I can't go anywhere else... the worst part is that when the 'adventure' times out it just takes me there again and I can do no more. When you invest a fair amount of time building a character, which is what sims is all about, and then it gets destroyed by a glitch it really is annoying, and for a game that is this incredibly expensive it's inexcusable. If you still decide to pour your money down this money grubbing hole, don't get paradise island and really look at the forum for issues others are having before considering any other add-ons.  And hey Maxis, when you make a game this badly perhaps you want to take the time to fix it before putting out another rendition.

43,9367291,english,"What a wonderful game!   It's really fun to play and it's like no other game made ever.   You could easily waste away hours on such a entertaining game.

Why do I not recommend it then you ask?   Easy.   Nothing ever works right.   The developers are more worried about getting the next DLC released so they can get more cash.   They really don't care if all the features in the game or the DLC don't work.  Oh?   You sent our sim to university and then it just vanished making the game unplayable?   Who cares because we already have your money!  Fun stuff.

It's really a shame that we, as consumers, put up with garbage like this.   If a game isn't complete it should not be released as a complete game. Then telling people the new DLC (which cost more money) will fix the problems. Then that DLC causes problems that you have to buy the next DLC to fix.   See what I am getting at?  This game is fun but the people who made it are more worried about coming up with ways to squeeze more money out of you than they are making an enjoyable gaming experience.

When you look at the number of players in the community and the number of DLCs for this game it doesn't take Adam Smith to figure out this title is raking in the cash.  You would think with that kind of money flowing the developers could at least spend a real effort getting rid of the bugs.   After two or three years games should not have bugs that make it totally unplayable.

Ask yourself.   Do I really want to experience the frustration of spending money on something that infuriates me before I get through the registration process?  Am I going to spend money on a game and time creating a sim just to have them vanish when I try to use the extra content?

Exploring towns that are full of collectibles  with characters that respond differently to situations turned out to be really fun.

It was running OK for a while when I had just installed Night Life...I only noticed some slowdown here and there.  However, I picked up three expansion packs during the Steam Winter sale.  In doing so, my game became unplayable.  My previous towns were all suddenly gone and any game that I created thereafter always became corrupt.  It's rather frustrating and I wish I could get my money back at this point.  Forums don't seem to be of much help either.  I just had my computer built in Spring 2013 with WIndows 8, so my computer is not the issue.

In the end, I DO recommend the base game to loyal fans.  However, just be warned that the expansion packs may completely ruin your ability to play, regardless of how new your computer is.

You play a sim/family, get jobs, earn money, buy stuff, sims die, KIds if you have any, do the same shit again..

31,9163018,english,"The DLC is fucking annoying (there's always something you have to buy with real money being shoved in your face) and the online stuff can be a bit tedious, but it's still the same old sims with some added bonuses.

This time there's a far more open and refined town system, with one open world which sims can move around in at any time. Sims can now own cars or bikes and head to the shops, the local pool, work, etc. without relying on taxis or carpools. Want to visit your sim's ingame friend or love interest? Hop in the car and head over there right away! Your sim miss the bus to school? No worry, hop on that bike and still get there on time! This new method gives sims more time to do stuff as there's less waiting around and makes the surrounding world seem more like a living, breathing entity than ever before in the series. When playing the sims 2, I always felt like my sims were cut off and confined to their own little bubble, but this game changes all that for the better.

This new system also means there are no more loading times whenever your sims leave their home lot (provided you stay in your current town, that is). Of course the tradeoff is that loading times when starting the game and entering your world seem longer than the previous games. If you're planning to play for extended periods of time, it's not a real issue and may actually have saved you time. However it does make playing for shorter bursts less viable.

Another major bonus in this game? There's an option in the base game to make sure everyone ages up at the same time (It's on by default but can be turned off at any time). This means your sims won't reach elder status while their friends are still children like some freakish simmified version of Jack. This makes working on friendships and first loves for child and teen sims worthwhile for a change. Add to that the improved romance/relationship/socialisation/personality systems, it's a really good deal during any sales.

Just DON'T bankrupt yourself with all the DLC/Expansions. Sure, there are some decent ones like Ambitions, but some of them (like Diesel Stuff) are just there to feed EA's money addiction. I'm sure cynics such as myself might wonder why some of these expansions weren't implemented into the base game, seeing as similar (and sometimes almost exactly the same) expansions were availible for the previous game. I guess it's just a sign of the times.

Instead of giving EA even more dosh that they don't deserve, check out one of the many community content sites for free stuff such as clothes. Sure, a lot of it looks like it was designed by the person who wrote My Immortal, but there are still some decent (free!) clothes and hair items to expand the moderately sized amount availible ingame. There are more you can buy ingame with sim points, but they cost you real money! That being said, you do get a small amount of points for free when you get the game. Make sure to spend them wisely.

In summary, if I'd have bought the game when it first came out, I'd likely not be recommending this game and be warning you of it being a ripoff. But I didn't buy it then. Instead I bought it several years after it came out and got it for cheap in a sale. For the price I got it, it's a really good game and I made a few smart choices with the expansions to get the most for my money. It's got some issues here and there, but I'd definitely recommend it to anyone who enjoyed the previous games and has a decently powered PC.",1392690430,1392690430,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561197988972788,368,5,4649,0,2802,1576776521

Sims 3 will use any and all means neccesary to make you pay more money for stuff that should've been in the game in the first place. You buy the 'locked' stuff with points. These points can only be purchased with real money and there is no way to earn them.

89,8958582,english,"Sims 3 Is an insult not just a shitty game

There are two main points to why Sims 3 is a terrible game. Despite the graphical advancements and optimization that make Sims 3 a much smoother game than previous titles, Sims 3 fails to deliver an actually game experience that is rewarding. This and atrocious advertising by EA/Maxis make the game a flop. Here are the reasons broken down.
 
1) In game advertising. This was such a new low in all my time of playing video games. At every turn, the game is selling you something more. IN THE GAME!!! And if its not useless then its obviously removed from the final product. Selling 20 DLC is one thing (that I object to FYI) but selling you furniture in the game building menu, loading screens that were for DLC, and then asking you to post your screen shots on Facebook... wow that is just putrid. Your playing of the Sims 3 is not a game, but an extended infomercial. 

2) I simply found Sims 3 to be a series of mini-games rolled into one. Career advancement, needs, lifetime aspirations, friendships, it was all just so boring to check off one task after another to satisfy each 'aspect' of the game. None of these things made a difference with each other. 

Dont go to the bathroom and ♥♥♥♥ yourself? no worries, this has no affect with the sim you're talking to. Cheat on your sim significant other? who cares, you'll still get a promotion at work. Achieve the lifetime aspiration? not a bid deal, since you'll get one more pointless talk bubble with another sim that wont mean anything. 

Its just frustrating to see that the game has so many aspects that play like mini-games since they have no bearing on anything else. You'd think a close sim dying would remove options for your playing sim since a traumatic death would scare/encourage certain developments. Nope

Also failure in the game means nothing. Got rejected from WooHoo? Got fired? Got a sim cheating on you? this will not hinder or alter the game for your sim’s life. How can this be a game mechanic for success?

If you are of the perspective that in game sales aren’t a big deal, well then this failure of gameplay can’t be ignored. What a sad story this franchise has had, going from on eof the most popular games out there (16 million units sold for Sims 1) to a laughing stock example of DLC cash cows.

I'm sure this review is irrelevant now, seeing the Sims 4 being pushed heavily, yes you called it, in the Sims 3 game right now. I waited for Sims 3 to hit rock bottom retail price since I only really wanted the housing design aspect. But having enjoyed Sims 1 and Sims 2 for the game itself, I am disheartenly justified in waiting so long to get this game at 80% off.

On the game itself:
-Yes, it can get very micromanage-y, but that's what the game is: a life simulator with architecture and interior design thrown in. It's been this way since the development of the first game, when playtesters enjoyed the Sims more than the actual building aspect. 
-There are a mutlitude of bugs, but most can be fixed with patches or mods. 
-The lag can get monstrous at times. These spikes tend to last about 10 seconds for me.

On modding:
-There is a very active modding community that releases a lot of well made content.
-If you are running the game with a lot of user-created content, expect to get more lag than usual.
-Be prepared to sift through all the nude mods and band t-shirts.

On the DLC:
-You can have a lot of fun with just the base game.
-I agree that the content is overpriced, which is why I tend to only buy them during a sale.
-The major DLC packs (Pets, Seasons, Etc.) bring hours of new content, options, and possibilities. Most include bug fixes. While their normal prices are still high, they're not as outrageous as people claim.
-The stuff packs are overpriced no matter how you look at it, in my opinion. I recommend staying away from those.

Gameplay has not changed hardly at all since the original Sims in terms of day-to-day activities; eating, social, fun level, etc. With all of The Sims 3 DLC you could have literally hundreds of hours of fun. My only real complaint is that there is a vast amount of technical problems (I run this on Windows 8 so that might be the problem) quite a bit of framerate issues, slowdown and at least for me it takes almost 30-45 seconds to save your town/sim. If you can overlook the technical problems, this game truly is worth playing; all the DLC sweetens the pot to an already big game.

Items available for purchase are at the beginning of all menus, rather than at the end, something I considered an aggressive design flaw, and turned me of any potential purchase.

That said, this game has strong sandbox play and is a significant improvement on previous versions. It is very easy to sink a few enjoyable hours into house, character, or neighbourhood design. Actual live mode gameplay is a little dull after a while, and improved through expansion packs - I recommend Supernatural, University, and Pets.

74,8484533,english,"I'm a huge fan of the The Sims franchise, so it comes as no surprise that I enjoy this game. However, maybe this review is useful to someone already familiar with the series.

There are several aspects about this iteration of the series that I dislike and which make me continue to view The Sims 2 as my favorite. I absolutely abhor having to see paid content in-game without having any interest whatsoever in ever buying it. I already spent more than $100 dollars on the base game and DLC. Why would I be charged for more and what justifies charging for it? Server maintenance, updates, and the cost of a Community Team (does The Sims even have one?) should be more than covered by that. So, besides the major issues of microtransactions being forced down one's throat, it also appears that getting free community content is much more of a hassle.  For starters, there is no Body Shop that allows you to easily create Sims and package them. There is no denying that the new Create a Sim tools are much more evolved and allow for much more customization, especially the ability to modify a Sim's body type, and the addition of true personality traits and combinations are great. However, there doesn't appear to be an easy way to share and obtain community content outside of EA's platform. I could list various other things that bother me about the game (e.g. Why are younger Sims so ugly? Why add rabbit holes?), but I think the attempts at money-making and sharing limitations are the main downsides to me.

On the bright side, the graphics are beautiful and the exploration options endless, especially with the DLC (which, I am sorry to say, one still has to get for a more complete game experience).",1388596253,1388596541,True,4,0,0.571567416191101074,0,True,False,False,76561198067684498,60,6,13984,0,5274.0,1596987973

The dog had already been told to guard the house several times - which let's face it, you wouldn't have to do with a real dog, especially a breed like this, we're not talking chihauha here!  The dog should be programmed to automatically guard, and the burglar should be afraid of it.  Also, your dog runs away if you only feed it for a couple of days or so, and don't hug it, or play with it, or walk it, treat it, brush it ....

In other ways, the game is eerily realistic.  By the time my Sim gets up, showers, brushes her teeth, makes some breakfast, feeds the dog, plays with the dog, hugs/treats/or brushes the dog, takes out the trash, and recycles the newspaper, it's time to go to work.  And my sim only has a part-time job!!  Then she has to come home, make dinner, do the whole dog thing again, maybe find a bit of time to read a skill book, and go to bed.   Way, way, way too much like real life.  Except that I have a full-time job in real life.  Why on earth would I want to play a game that was as filled with mundane tasks and routine as my own life?  People play games to escape from that!  

I know, you can change the time speed.  But shouldn't the devs have already set it up as a default that the routine things don't take so long to do, so you don't have to constantly play with the time settings?  and shouldn't they have set it up so your sim knows what to do after you've done the same routine at roughly the same time on the same days, and your sim just goes and does it superfast, leaving you more time to go off and do other things in the game?  am I supposed to set this up, making routine lists and feeding them to my sim?   If I leave my sim alone to do things, she does stupid, pointless things like reading and re-reading Where's Bella, over and over again.  

Maybe I just don't know how to play this game, I know it's a popular game, and maybe there's a way around these problems that my 20  hours or so of playing hasn't been enough for me to find.

Sims 3 expands on a lot of the features from the previous installments, including adding some new features and then Electronic Arts to my surprise removed some features in this edition.  One of the features they removed that was in the Sims 2, was the ability to create new lots.  In the Sims 3 you are basically stuck with the pre-installed lots and then of course like the previous installments you have to buy all the expansions. 

Buying the expansions is not what bothers me. What bothers me is not being able to make my own neighborhoods and customize them to my personal tastes like I could in the second game.  I still wish I had it.  I only have the original content version so that is what my review is based on and not any of the expansions.  So I am not aware if they have changed that rule about you being able to create your own personal neighborhoods in now since later expansions have come out.

45,4613202,english,"TL;DR
I would not buy this game if I hadn't already.  But I would advise people playing it.  Make of that what you will.  Simply because of the creators who actually put their heart into aspects of this game and because of modders who really make it shine; this is a fun game to play and worth the time.  It is NOT worth ANY money.


""But why?""  You might ask.  The extremely long rant to follow are *some* (not all, I am just tired of writing) my reasons:

This is a love hate thing with the Sims 3.  I was so addicted to Sims 2 I lost whole days sitting in front of my computer planning out their day to day routines and hoping that they actually did well.  (I know a lot of simmers just want the absolutely worst outcomes and love either killing and/or torturing their poor Sims) 

But this game changed that a little.  I still don't have a bunch of murder, sex or terror mods that make their lives truly miserable, but I don't care near as much for the characters I make or choose to play, I don't have much of a connection to them and sometimes I just stop caring and walk away leaving them to do their own thing until I just save and exit.  Sims 3 lost a lot of charm Sims 2 had and honestly, I blame this entirely on EA's way of thinking which seriously tanked in the customer help department about the same time.  It also began to be called the worst company every year and so on and so on.  The game is pushed more and more for microtransations and not much else now.  Especially with the upcoming Sims 4.  

Microtransactions are a good thing, do not get me wrong please.  These are very small purchases someone can make with real money online to pay for all different types of digital goodies to use in game.  For most things this is a term MMORPGs use and they sell cosmetic things.  Outfits, pets, mounts, hair, etc. etc.  

With games like Team Fortress 2 this has not only kept the game alive, but brought forth an entirely new type of community where artists and creators come together to make outstanding creations which the community can then vote on and the original creators can make real money from their serious effort and hard work; hand in hand with the original game's creators to make something entirely new.  This idea has even started to be embraced by MMORPGs such as EQ2 which now has their own type of workshop where players can now create things for that game.  It goes on and on and on how awesome microtransactions can be for a game, bring it back to life and keep it ticking with new content and eye candy for everyone.   It's even been how some companies now fund the next expansion, start new servers or how they are able to further polish their games.

Sims 3 though went and tore this concept apart (as far as I am concerned) and with Sim Points introduced a new low in this field.  Sim points are nothing new, the way they are handled in Sims 3 though is.  If you want to buy a certain type of object that has new animations and/or has an actual use in the game that would change it at all; then you cannot just buy that item but actually have to spend more money than you would just buying a stuff pack alone.  These things are usually leaning towards harassing the player even in their game to buy the items.  Everything with Sims 3 is an add to buy something else in Sims 3 and it never stops even when the player is playing.  You can turn these options off but let's look at the key point for EA: Sell items to little girls playing.  Mostly these little girls do not understand the value of a dollar, do not understand what EA is about or how little they could care.  I'm not saying a lot of companis are bleeding hearts but it's more than obvious that EA takes the cake when it comes to giving their customers the finger.  

On top of all of this, there are the bug and game stopping glitches.  I want to state first of all, ALL GAMES WILL HAVE BUGS AND GLITCHES ALL OF THE TIME ON ANY CONSOLE OR PC NO MATTER WHAT.  Even Mario still has glitches!  It doesn't matter, games cannot be 100% polished at all times, it is not possible.  But game breaking glitches that either force the player to stop playing, do not allow the player to continue to play or break the game entirely, ruin the save or even break itself; are out of the question!  Especially for such a large company!  Every time a Stuff or Expansion pac has come out, there is always a game breaking glitch that does one or more of these things.  

Late Night is a great example.  Mysteriously players suddenly had a horrible time trying to please or even sometimes control their Sims.  Sims would be unhappy no matter what the players did.  They would stay bright red day and night, become incresibly ticked off at all times, divorce one another without the player being able to stop it, kids would be taken away.  No one knew what was happening or how to stop it.  As it turns out, it was the beds.  For some unknown reason beds weren't working correctly in games.  They would cause the characters to become more and more upset until someone finally made a mod fixing this glitch.  The game breaking glitch was fixed well *after* Christmas, months after the game came out and the glitch was made aware by players on the forums of Sims 3.  Simply because the game wasn't tested enough nor were the customers heard. 

Game breaking glitches and huge annoyances adding to lag and unplayable situations are still in the game today even though Sims 4 has been announced and you can even pre-order it though they only have a handful of screenshots and a video that they have also stated will change.  

They make it so obvious that everything is only about money that they forgot the simple truth.  This is a game for kids and adults alike.  This is a learning machine for everyone and a fun experience to boot.  I would suggest playing the game.  With the right mods (Google NRAA Sims 3) this game is really fun.  It is very time consuming and if you are willing to face a serious challenge, (unless you don't want that you can always mod it too!) at least with your time, than I would suggest this.  It is a LOT easier than Sims 2, make of that what you will (if you played).  You do not need to know anything at all about Sims 2 to play this either which is another plus.  Although the cow plant is brought back and I adored that as well.  Yes it still eats Simmies.  Sims 2 was a huge challenge money and happiness wise, this is more of a ""how much time are you willing to sit and grab achievements online, skill up, etc."" type of thing.",1309746677,1387920271,False,0,0,0.476190477609634399,1,True,False,False,76561198039805069,194,87,42224,0,42224.0,1351839600

2,7942100,english,"I love this game.

I'm biased, the original Sims was the first normal PC game I'd ever owned and I loved it.

Now that that's out of the way, I never played 2 but everything I wanted from the original is here, you can walk outside of your lot and explore the neighborhood and you can age or go to another neighborhood for college.. You can even make friends with service workers because they're all Sims that exist in the town. It's amazing! If your Sim is a criminal you might see him rob another Sim if you aren't playing as him too!

All the inter-connections they've made are just a lot of fun. You can even eliminate having to micro-manage their needs almost entirely if you so wish to maximize time on progression.

I really can't list all that you can do because there is so much.

So quickly... Lots of job choices including work-at-home, expanded families and trees, option to have aging or not, ability to either micromanage all Sims in a town or let them follow their own will, and you can build basements! Not to mention all the other 'towns' your Sims can go to as vacations, trips, or education.

I do have some negatives about the game though. First, initially loading time is really long, understandable but still they could optimize it instead of the current 2-5 minutes it takes before you even get to play. Second, HUGE push towards their content marketplace. Users can still make their own content but the game pushes their own pay-for content more and it's not cheap (new towns can cost around 20 USD and items are usually 3-5 USD and more for sets of items) so be prepared to spend a lot of you want extra bits and pieces.

Finally, this is The Sims, even with the first series expect a lot of expansions. Thankfully, this game and all its expansions go on sale at least once a quarter so if you exercise patience you can get them all for 40-60% off which will save a tremendous amount of money.

So, don't let that deter you, it might cost a lot to get everything but you can still play fine with the base game and ruling over the lives of little digital people is always entertaining.

One final note, save often because the game can and will crash during long sessions.",1386356714,1386356770,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198002517437,916,43,6129,0,3051.0,1499963972

My main criticisms of this game are first: it's a resource hog, so it can be very difficult to run on an older computer or one that's been weighed down with a lot of other active applicatoins.  Two: it has a lot, lot, lot of outstanding bugs.  Many of those can be dealt with through the use of third-party mods and scrupulous computer maintenance, but really, I do wish the game developers took bug fixes more seriously.  Despite all that, I come back to Sims 3 time and time again and I have a lot of fun every time I do.

This is a bad and good thing; it made me laugh and tell my friends about the ridiculousness of events when such glitches occurred that it did make me want to play. But it could cause problems large enough that you needed to use cheats.
One bug – my father character from 2nd  generations(grandson if you want it technical) after coming back from france(actually I don’t know when it happened I just noticed it after they came back) became unrelated to the rest of the family and I could do romantic things with my twin sister.
Because of this bug my family tree was destroyed, so I decided to restart with the same family that I had begun with. For some reason my daughter(ANNA) from “world B” of first generation was no longer related to the family I created her with, in fact she was related to World A DAD(BOB from world A) and not her should be dad of the same world (BOB of World B)     ( ANNA from world A was related to her WORLD A Parents)
Tried using awesome mod to fix the family line
Performance issues – The longer your sims family went it started to lag h, over cluttering npcs, bugged vehicles. Although this might of happened because of my own cluttering up of my own hard drive or because of both

There were some things that they did that sims 2 didn’t, specifically censoring. I found out during a glitch why they censored something in the sims 3 and not sims 2, because of poor programming, or placement of animation. I find censoring to be far more distracting, and catches my eye easier than if you hadn’t, making what you were trying to censor more noticeable

As an amateur programmer and ethics, I am not to glad of the expansion packs that they rehashed from the sims 2 (for the most part some of the newer idea ones are awesome.) For me expansion are there to add new concepts and fix the game.( fixing the game is questionable at best) Any sequel to the game should have those elements, or have some bits of those elements in the base game already. 
Sims 3 : PETS    = SIMS 4 – should already have some pets in the main game

Other wise It be like if I got you a toy, and the next year I bought you the same toy but I just repainted it. Although knowing EA I’m sure they are going to sell you that blue version.

Each expansion adds hours of awesome stuff to lose yourself in, whether it be tons of new jobs with Ambitions or new types of characters with Supernatural, each one adds it's own little something.

While the game is incredibly addicting, it also has lots of bugs. Some bugs have been around since the start, like the game crashing (happens mostly when you haven't saved for several hours and you just finished building your dream home), others only turn up when you start installing expansions or custom content, like the strechy babies and the hand-bowl (not actually sure where this comes from).

All in all, the Sims 3 is a great addition to the Sims franchise and obviously follows it's predecessors with a huge amount of overpriced DLC/Expansion Packs. What were you expecting, though? It's developed by EA. The game is constantly being updated and patched by the developers, but unfortunately continues to have many glitches. The actual base game is very dull and if you want to have fun for more than 5-10 hours you should purchase expansions. The fact that you need expansions to continue having fun with the game is kind of a big no no, though. I do like the game along with my bundle of expansions but have recently grown tired of it after playing it non-stop for awhile.
The verdict is if you're interested in the game then go ahead in buy it. Just don't buy it blindly, know what you're getting into (Watch youtube videos, read reviews, etc.)

Well, It's like the Sims 1, only 1000x more immersive.

There are now hundreds if not thousands of possibilities when it comes to making Houses. I love the house designing aspect of the game, interior design, garden landscaping. This game just all round is awesome, I love it.
(Sorry. SIM-ULATOR ... *cough*Game*cough*)

As usual, there are a ton of expansions, but unfortunately they are damn expensive.
Some cost more than the base game itself. So when it comes to the extras, I recommend waiting for Steam Sales to come around.

I personally own, Sims 3 (base), Sims Pets, Sims Mastersuit and Sims Outdoor Living. Basically ... Nice furniture and animals are fun.
