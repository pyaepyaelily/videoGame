1. The injury system is an absolute joke. In real life, a full team of 20 players do not have 5 injuries a week on average. Now fair enough if you had a serious injury maybe once or twice a season, but I have players snapping ankles and being out for months at a time on a weekly basis. A feature of the game that should be considered a challenge to get over in reality completely kills the enjoyment of an already challenging game.

2. The morale system is completely broken. Your team can be on a 5 game unbeaten run top of the table with morale running high, to have an unlucky 1-0 defeat and your teams morale will completely plummet as if they've just lost the entire season. 

3. The goal scoring part of the engine is an unrealistic mess. In this game your million dollar striker will lose a one on one 99% of the time, your wingers will cut in the box and instead of making an easy pass into the center for a tap in, they'll just blast it into the keepers hands. You will have 20 shots and 10 on target, and your opponent will have just 2 on target, and you'll still find yourself being beat 2-0. No matter what you change, whether it's tactic, distribution or player, your match will be completely determined by RNG.

I feel as though the developers worked hard to make this engine, because don't get me wrong it looks good, but it just doesn't work.

87,61380972,english,"I ended up giving this game the unfavorable thumbs down. Does that mean that it is a bad game? No. Not at all. 

For what I was promised beforehand, however,  this game did not live up to its expectations for me personally. This needs some more context. I will try to keep this short and to the point. 

The game itself is pretty good. When compared to the older touch-versions, the upgrades might not seem that big, but still enough to justify a new release. The changes between the ordinary FM releases are greater, as it offers more complexity and nuances than the touch version of the game has. It is actually for this reason that I prefer the touch version over the original version. For me, the micro-management is an annoyance that distracts from the fun that is to be had in the essence of the game. My time is limited, and I like that time spent to action-packed as it offers the most fulfilling FM experience in my opinion. 

A lot has been simplified in the touch version of the game, but not enough for my taste. Maintaining a sustainable team, economically speaking, seems completely unviable. No matter how good I do, I can not keep up with the players demand. 
To give a specific example, here is what happened in my last game: 
Ederson, goalkeeper(Manchester City), wages:  £103 740, with a contract that ends 2024. He becomes unhappy with his current contract. He wants a new contract to 2025(on year extra) and demands that his wages is increased to £260 350..! Of course he wants £6 483 748 loyalty bonus and insane match bonuses as well. The highest paid player on my team is paid £199 900... I can not afford his demands, although I try to increase his wages significantly. He wants to leave the club because I can not offer him what he thinks he is worth. I decided to comply, mostly to see what would happen. A long story short, he ended up in a lesser club with lower wages than he originally had in the first place..! 
Sadly, this was not a fluke as more players kept demanding more money than I could offer, and was unhappy. Despite me winning the premier league and champions league each season. 

I do hope I have offered some food for thought and that it is something that will be addressed by the developers at some point. It might not be a dealbreaker for everyone, but I think others will resonate with this as well.

I have submitted a bug report, but am not optimistic about the chances of it being resolved. Every edition of the series from FM17 onwards has had a token glitch, which is completely ignored by SI, then miraculously resolved in the following instalment, which you have to spend another £20 to acquire. I am starting to think it might be a marketing ploy, or just sheer laziness on the part of the Touch development team.

In any case, I will not be purchasing further iterations of FM Touch until this cycle of utterly inane glitches is finished.
