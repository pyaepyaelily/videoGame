It was a clever move to focus it on certain race series instead of adding all cars in existence. Not as if that was a problem - but it has been done already in the predecessor Asetto Corsa. So considering this franchise it is sort of refreshing. It was done before in many games of course (think of GTR series or Sports Car GT from the ancient times) but very few games have such a cleverly designed online competition and rule system.

A friend said how much fun he was having with ACC, price was reasonable, so I grabbed it.  We're still friends ;)  

Seems like it is possible to configure pretty much anything as needed, controls, visuals, view, realism, etc.  Feel is fantastic, I have tried some amount of single player career, tried all the tracks and cars quickly, and did a couple of online races too.  (Yes, a couple of guys that probably pushed clutch instead of brake at corners, but also many people interested in racing properly).  Some great adrenalin rushes :) 

I've noticed that it has something which keeps me engaged, the visuals, the info, the feel all make me want to squeeze a few 10ths off the lap time, try different things at different corners, where you can immediately get an idea from the feedback if it was good or not ... then start to string them all together in one lap - is actually quite addictive.  Enjoyment level with this game is very high and I hope it continues as I plan to use this one to improve my race skills, finally attempt to do own car setups, and take part in some real racing! :D

Now, I believe, performance has very much improved and the game became playable on higher settings.
Still, the game is not so well optimized for VR compared to other titles and looking around or sometimes just driving can feel quite 'jitterish', it's not a huge problem but definitely affects the experience.

All in all, super great game, very realistic and works very well with a wheel.
Price tag of a one-time fee of 40 bucks is quite great compared to iRacing (which will charge you 10-15 per month) and this game simulates GT3 cars way better than iRacing (in my opinion).

There's some DLC but it's not required to have a good and full experience.

Great vehicle customization, even though I have only scratched the surface. It sounds incredible and you would swear you are actually in the car once you put you VR headset on. Once I got my VR setting right, it looks pretty damn good.
       Like I said, it will be an absolute pain to set up in VR. Be patient, Look up all the youtube videos and guides you can, and once you get something that looks great and that your system can run, you will not regret purchasing.

The rain races are really cool, the track get some water pots and you can feel the feedback when hit one. As the car create a trial in wet track, it make difference. The rain its not just visual, it affects the track aswell.

Night races are pretty, give you another perspective from the track.

The GT4 dlc give a boost in mixed races making the race more dinamic, lots of overtake, and GT3 drivers now will have to adapt their strategy over taken slower cars.

26/05/2020 edit

Standard of racing aint what it was. Dont know if its lockdown bringing in all the new people but public server racing is just frustrating. Either way, i think the rating system needs work as its far too easy to get SA. I've seen people saying they've got to 90+ in a week of playing. not a week of play time. just playing it for a week. if thats the case then no wonder the MP is as bad as it is. Where High SA servers used to be a relatively safe noob free haven its just now a mess. SA80 is the new SA20.

Dont bother. Get iRacing if you want clean multiplayer racing. as much as i hate to do this, I'm changing my recommendation to a no. Damn shame as the developers have done a cracking job with the game. Literally cant fault the developers - except maybe a lack of education on racing etiquette and GT ruling. 

State of MP has gone off a cliff. Barely any servers, barely any players. If you do make it into a server, start last or risk being involved with half the field when they all kill eachother at T1 and leave. If theres a crash in front of you and you back off you'll be killed by billy big balls trying to go through without lifting. you'll be side swiped by some fragile ego wetty who cant handle being overtaken. you'll be spun off by the car behind when you're stuck behind another car because they make a slight mistake and are slow through a corner and theres no safe overtaking opportunities. Every race is a survival race.

Dont bother with GT4. as fun as they are, nobody uses them. the mixed class servers will consist of 1 person in a GT4 and the rest will be people who cant drive GT3s. When people did use GT4s and there was a good mixed field you were at the mercy of the GT3s - those same GT3s who dont know the GT rules or driving etiquette or how to safely drive around a corner.",1580721312,1599678016,False,1,0,0.525862038135528564,0,True,False,False,76561198122407723,157,5,26579,0,26579,1599676927

I'm using a t300rs and i crank up the FFB to 100% because i like the feeling. Dont worry, i have a huge fan attached to it to cool it down..

The sounds in the game are awesome around Dirt rally 2.0 level (3rd person chase sounds a bit off tho). and the immersion level is top notch.

However i feel the cars are easier to control and yet attractive to master than AC.. not sure if its because of the traction control and ABS availability. However still very fun too drive and not too easy.

55,75594830,english,"I've only played for so long and completely sold on this sim. I've run Project Cars 1, 2, iRacing, Raceroom and a few others in the past and would always hit a wall. Be it, compatibility, FFB, frame rate, whatever. They all get them. And the only thing other reviews seem to get right is the optimization for VR. I don't crash, but I can't do it at 30fps so I'll have to live with the standard.

The controls are very well thought of, similar to what RR has, but a bit easier to setup. The FFB is very simplified, which reminds me of PC2, but it is dialed in to get you what you need for reading the car. I can see that being a solid solution for the devs, since they would have less to worry about when it comes to fans making ini tweaks. Controller I haven't tested, but I don't really think that makes sense to use since this was easily meant to be a sim. And there are many other sources that will state that driving a sim with a controller has no merit...or something.

The visuals are a lot more than what I would have expected. Unfortunately, it is a rather tall order on the hardware...I think. Currently my pc only utilizes 5%, GPU peaks with a power draw of 60W and 6GB when it should be 220W. I still hit 60fps without too much trouble and I'm pretty sure there's potential to be had. It's true that people have trouble sitting at the menu, but I only recently turned of ""Fullscreen Optimization"" that Windows loves to sneak in there. Easy to forget, but very important.

AI, I haven't gotten around to with much time, but they seem very smooth. There's no obvious point of deliberately running off course or smacking into each other as a catch up logic, which most racing games seem to resort to these days. It was very refreshing to compete with these guys and given the part where I have no time to look through forums for more ""dedicated"" servers, this is very promising. Of all the games I've played, these could well be the best when it comes to situational awareness and competence. If there is a catch-up, I sure can't see it, but somehow 505 seemed to crack the secret code on how to make that perfect pace with you. It's very niche.

The physics themselves feel pretty...complete. I only drove a couple cars for a few hrs, but never picked up on anything that would just feel...off. Everything makes sense and feels logical along with the tunes. The tips next to the parts you see don't go into detail, which I also prefer. Too often you see a game where multiple people have built, but all have their own understanding of what those tunes are supposed to do. Effectively deceiving you and proving that not the whole developer team was really working together.

The sound, I can't give a solid analogy since I haven't been to a race track in forever. I wouldn't know what sounds realistic any better than what you find on Youtube, but it's definitely solid work. I get a hint that it was designed to be accurate, not just ""immersive"". Although, there's only one note to be made and that's the backfire from the exhaust. I don't suppose it happens as often as this and not quite so loud, but it doesn't take away from the rest of the experience so much that's it's a distraction. Just a tad repetitive.

Almost forgot lmao: Idk why everyone keeps complaining about the driver animation. I've only just bought this, but read many reviews before hand. There is NOTHING wrong with the wheel calibration. Secondly, there is a calibration in the menu for steering range. Again, nothing wrong with it detecting my Fanatec neither, so stop complaining and get a real rig before you (^&*# about a game that's meant for one!

The state of this game is just abysmal, it is in no way comparable to it's predecessor, Assetto Corsa. In reality the quality of simulation you receive is much closer to being on par with that of Project Cars 2, which is a console game, and not a simulator at all. 

How the fuck a studio can take such a monumental step backwards in game design is beyond me. 

Evidently Kunos forgot that the primary gradients of a Racing Simulator are the RACING, the FFB and PHYSICS, not the fucking graphics. 

The serverlist and matchmaking is a total shitshow. No Sorting, No Control. They promised an improvement over AC but in practice it's far worse. How does Kunos even manage to fuck that up? Their work was literally cut out for them?

What an absolute waste of potential. The only objective this game accomplished was to split the playerbase of AC. Resulting in not 1, but 2 dead online gaming experiences.

Being in an university, with very few resources to spare,I cannot really afford a wheel at this point but my enthusiasm towards the motorsports made me purchase this title. Right off the bat, let me clear one doubt, the game is indeed playable with a gamepad and with some tweaking it gets even better. To compare it, I'd say it plays very much like the F1 games on a gamepad if you set up your controller appropriately by investing some time. 

However, using a gamepad while being in the cockpit cam is absolutely distracting because you can see the driver turning the steering wheel awfully fast as you take the corners. It gets distracting, so I'd recommend using the hood cam or the dash cam.

[b][WEATHER][/b]
This is probably one of the best bits about this game. The weather system is absolutely bonkers! Weather effects seem really good but you do need a decent computer if you are planning to make them look even better through the settings. 

The game features a dynamic day/night cycle. Nothing is better than watching the sun set and the lights coming on as you lap Spa trying to perfect every corner.

[b][SOUND][/b]
It is really immersive. You can hear the chassis bend, the wipers hitting hard against the metal beneath when cutting the corners hard, you can hear the rubber hitting the metal, you can hear the engine undergoing mechanical strain as you floor it. It is beyond words, something every motorsport enthusiast should experience by himself/herself.


So far, this game is pretty much everything that I ever wanted from a racing simulator. Do I wish that there were cars apart from the GT3/4 series ? Road cars, open wheel cars ? Obviously I do but I think that limiting the content really helps them focus on things apart from just a big roster of cars. Things like immersion, sounds, physics, and so many other things which are 99% of the time overlooked by other developers. 

I really hope that they will keep updating and adding new content to the base game, apart from the DLC.

Haven't had this much fun with GT cars on any game ever. The netcode/collision physics when racing online definitely need some work though. So, it isn't perfect but it's so much fun when you get to your limit and drive on the edge!

UPDATE: So it's been a few months now and I really can't stress how much I've been enjoying the challenge of driving all the cars to the limit. I've put in over 300 hours now and have completed multiple league races and online endurance races and I've been blown away by how competitive and friendly most of the community has been so far. 

Even if all you do is pick up this game to do some casual league racing, I'd absolutely recommend it. A stable online server with a reasonable (30-40) drivers is always a blast and have lead to many memorable moments. However, there are still some major bugs with big grid, endurance races (like invisible cars lol) but the developers say they have identified that issue and are working on a fix for the next update.

14,73127812,english,"Hey, new sim racers please read before playing on multiplayer...

I've seen some drivers doing a 0.2-second gap between a car in front of them, down a straight, and think that it is perfectly fine to continue to stop at their normal braking point they used the lap before... 

Conclusion: IT'S NOT!

Why?

Because doing a 0.2-second gap from the car in front down a straight, lets say Blanchimont, Spa at ~255km/h, both cars are travelling around 70 meters per second. 

That 0.2s gap at 70 meters per second is a 14-meter gap nose to nose from the cars

14-meter = 3 car lengths (average car length in-game is about [b]4.7-meter[/b])


[i](kmh x 5) / 18 = speed in meters per second
(255 x 5) / 18 = 70.8 m/s

m/s x gap in seconds = gap in meter
70.8 x 0.2 = 14.16 meters[/i]


So, If you were to brake at 0.2-second gap on your normal braking point into a tight corner such as a bus stop chicken (chicane) or a hairpin down to ~80 Km/h.

At that ~80Km/h, both cars will slow to ~22.2 m/s... Your distance from nose to nose will now be about [b]4.44 meters[/b]... (a number less than that average car length mentioned earlier)


If you were driving behind a guy in a Bentley with his [b]5-meter[/b] car length... your nose will now be [b]22 inches deep[/b] in Mr Bentley's backside! ([i]That's 56cm![/i])


Mr Bentley surely will not appreciate you penetrating him like that, and taking a sniff... As both of you's will now spill your SA everywhere due to those [b]22[/b] inches of action!


This wouldn't happen if you backed off just before braking to a much safer ~0.3s gap ([i]6.6m nose to nose, with 1.6m social distancing between the cars at braking[/i])
or even better is to brake earlier, and then modulate the brakes to keep close to him after the braking zone, and into the turn in.

[b]Brake modulation[/b] = Brake early, then let off very slightly to come closer to the car in front again, and brake again to slow the car down to appropriate speed for the corner.


Remember,
[list]
[*] - Don't penetrate, tap or grind people unless they consent to it.
[*] - If you're unsure about the gap and/or car distances at certain speeds, back off.
[*] - If you do know the gap, always brake earlier in situations when you're close to the car ahead.
[/list]

It’s much better to focus on the corner exit and get alongside your competitor before the next corner
Only ever brake normally (in this case 'later') if you are side by side and your car has an overlap, and you are on the correct side of the track.

Do not listen to people who say braking late is the way to overtake, there is no such thing as [i]""braking late""[/i], it's ether [b]Braking on your optimal braking point[/b] or [b]Braking earlier[/b].

Because [i]""Braking late""[/i] = you doing an [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZL3MtMLMW8g]EXTREME-ULTRA-SUPER-LATE-BRAKING![/url] and going off [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wycf3sbxPNk]into a ditch in front of some old grandmas house[/url] or [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8Vrtpr4CWI]The Lord of No Consent: Return of the Penetration.[/url]

Now about ACC muliplayer, I think the server should stamp out drivers coming up behind you and take you out of the race with a side tap from behind, when they do this the driver getting side tapped is out of the race and and he/she looses a safety point when it's not even their fault, so if a driver comes up from behind and taps the front car out of the race there should be an automatic DISCQUALIFICATION and if they get more then 3 they should get banned for a certain amount of time, that's the only way you are going to stop this from happening.

87,59678899,english,"[h1]Summary[/h1]
ACC is focused on being an advanced  GT3 driving simulation, but forgets to be an innovative and enjoyable game.  Unlike the broad scope and ambition of the original AC, in ACC we get a narrow simulator that feels like the product of tunnel vision and an official licence deal.

You might like this if you love GT3 cars and/or race in organized events or leagues. Otherwise I suggest you pick this up on sale to experience its simulation quality, but not expect it to be a game you will frequently play.

Doesn't match the scope and playability of the original AC.


[h1]Positive[/h1]
[b]Driving feel[/b] is good and gives a believable feeling of GT3 cars, handling and road or kerb surfaces.

[b]Rating system[/b] tries to innovate and provide a set of metrics that go beyond the typical skill and safety ratings into consistency, car control, etc.

[b]AI[/b] - does a pretty good job providing you opposition in the single player races.  Seems to overtake with a bit more confidence than original AC and not cause too much chaos.

[b]Day/night and weather[/b] are supported.  Night races look good.  The rain is visually very nice but hard work to actually race in, so I seldom choose it whatever the game.

[h1]Negative[/h1]
[b]Licensed to content[/b] - in the base game we only get the official SRO GT3 cars and the dozen or so tracks.  GT4 and 4 additional tracks now available in DLC.   Limited choices because the game is tied to an official series.  Forget driving Nordschleife with this.

[b]25% completion[/b] - the single player portion just provides the basic single races, a bare bones championship and career modes.  Progress in single player is a percentage and some random ""rewards"" with no context. Low effort spent here.

[b]The force is weak in this one[/b] - even with gain at 100% the wheel force feedback seems weak and vague.  Not as tactile as in AC.  Didn't notice this at first but I think the immersive graphics and sounds distract you from noticing from the mediocre FFB until you isolate it.

[b]""Classic"" multiplayer experience[/b] - you get the sense there were some ambitions for multiplayer, but in the end it's a public lobby system and a quick join.  No innovation or shaping the multiplayer experience: iRacing and GT Sport have shown how you can positively impact multiplayer.  Here the rating system is fairly toothless in public lobbies.    What's the point of the refined physics engine if the player is going to be taken out on turn one most races?

[b]Sweaty GPU[/b] - ACC needs a powerful GPU to hold 60fps on monitors.   VR is so bad you have to downscale it way way down then it looks works than the original AC or most other titles in VR.  Not surprised the console ACC runs at 30fps, not because of the physics but  the graphics are too taxing.

[b]No more modness[/b] - compared to AC the mods and the apps in AC were a big part of its longevity.  Gone in this iteration, so a step backwards.",1576095551,1597438997,False,1,0,0.501018285751342773,0,True,False,False,76561197967658028,175,24,4160,61,1620,1601501288

I played about 25 hours on a 4k TV at 60 FPS and it was amazing. I recently upgraded to a Rift S and I am HUGELY disappointed. I tried VR with a Rift CV1 when the game was in early access and it was terrible then. I should have checked to see if it was fixed or not before pulling the trigger on a Rift S because it is no different now than it was in EA. I have been watching multiple videos on Youtube and checking the forums and Reddit and messing with the settings but I've only been able to improve it maybe 20%. It's extremely blurry beyond 50 feet or so and there is ghosting everywhere. After playing AC1 for hundreds of hours in VR I'm amazed the same studio can release such a poorly implemented feature, when the first game had one of the best VR implementations. New engine or not I know they could have done better. So if you only play in VR, I would wait for a fix or play something else.

20,73915527,english,"ACC is probably one of the most detailed and best simulators currently available to the public on the commercial marked. Kunos Simulazioni, is going to immense lengths to simulate some of the worlds greatest supercars, to a detail which is impeccable. Not just that, but they're also simulating marble build up, and if it rains, it also simulates how well the track will drain water. The weather system is actually so detailed that marble build up will determine how well a track will drain!

ACC works well with the Unreal Engine they're running on, however there are some small graphical oddities, when for example changing dash pages. All in all, the lighting is very believable, and gives a very immersive experience. 

It's worth noting that the former Blancpain series (now called GT World Challenge), is an endruance based championship, so the track count without the Intercontinental GT DLC is rather low. This is usually because races in the real series can range from 2 hours to as much as 24 hour events. Considering there are several regional GT championships, and the ""iGT"" DLC I would love to see an implementation of GT series in Asia and America with those tracks and car liveries, to accomodate for the less hard core simmers that don't want to spend several hours to race just one race. 

For the tire model, I'll say very little. It's not iRacing. And that's a good thing.

All in all, the game is very good, it's a nice package for hard core simmers and beginners, but the reason I'm giving it a negative review is because I'm missing some implementations and some readjustments that'll lift the experience even higher.

To begin, there are no safety cars or full course yellows. These events are highly important in real life, and can seriously affect the outcome of a race. 

There are currently no way that I know of that I can do quick multiclass races with the new GT4 DLC. I've seen it done on Online, but haven't found a way to do it locally yet.

AI's are to good to predict tough weather conditions. The weather system in this game makes it possible to quite literally flood a track, to the point that you're well past what race control IRL would deem unsafe conditions. However, AI's will perfectly predict how much standing water there will be, and where it is. 

AI's need to take a racing course - they literally will never respect double waved yellow, or yellow zones and won't hesitate on flying through an incident.

Starting procedures should be manual. Or at least give us the option to regulate pace ourselves.

Other than that, TL;DR: buy the game for a fully specced sim, but know that it lacks ""clever"" AI and SC/FCY scenarios",1596807885,1596807885,False,8,0,0.499123632907867432,3,True,False,False,76561198040196506,113,7,2824,0,2824,1596762517

This game is *way* more racing, and much less about the intricate details and twitchyness of F1. If you're looking for great simulation, action, very adaptable AI (much better than AC original, F1 2019 and the various other games I've played).

The part that surprised me the most was how involved and well-worked-out the player rating system is. Do yourself a favour - google ACC rating, read the wiki page. It gives feedback on driving in Single-Player career mode, single player races, and multiplayer races. Everything you drive counts - as a result, the stats are actually a refection of your abilities. Multiplayer servers can set limits - allowing great racing online without the inevitable ""noob"" that smashes up your front/rear wing in F1 games due to erratic/early breaking, or lack thereof... :/

There are some DLC packs released over time - the GT4 pack is great, with the Ginetta G55 being a favorite car for me (there's a mod for the original AC, which is fun too.. but the handling of GT cars in this game is much more refined, together with the ""Car Control"" rating it really helps learn to drive better). There is a planned British Car pack for Winter 2020 I believe.. for PC anyway, which is the platform I'm running on.

When it comes to Gameplay, no other sim can Match this, but sadly, gameplay isnt the only thing i want from a sim.
For me, the most important thing are competetive Races.
Like most other Sims, you have a Server Browser with fairly well populated servers good for some banging and crashing, which isnt different to other sims. But then ACC promises good competetive races on the Competetion servers. there are a few problems however. In order to be able to race on these, you have to go through a grind of getting track medals (drive 4 laps without leaving the track or beeing too slow) which really starts to get disgusting once you have to got to misano or paul ricard. then you have to improve your safety rating which takes ages and to be fair thats a good thing but is frustrating nonetheless. and when you finally got all the requirements, the developers shits you in the face by only having a few races a day. When you do finally see that counter go to 0, the lobby might be full or you just loose connection a minute into the race. sometimes the counter just goes back to 8 hours. Point is, these servers are shit.
for me, driving in normal sessions just isnt fun because of all the crashing, and the fact that the CP servers are so unreliable basically makes the game unplayable for me as the AI isnt good enough to make singleplayer enjoyable.

so, my advice is: if you are new to sim racing, you'll have a lot of fun with this game.

Also love that the rating system for this game doesn't just measure your online performance but every single time you hit the track. The benefits of that for me is that I have learned how to better race around other cars whether it is online or offline against the AI.

I use a G27, if for some reason the wheel isn't recognized by the game go to properties>general and disable Steam input per game settings.

My Wheel settings are (they'd probably work fine for g29 and g920 too)

Gain 100%
Minimum Force 12% 
Dynamic Damping 48% (you can test around 30 to 50)
Road Effects 18% (don't go too much beyond 20)

Alright, the game is intent to be played with a wheel, if you have it, you know the drill. But if you are stubborn and really want to play this marvelous product on a pad the best settings I've found for my PS4 pad are

Deadzone 0
Speed senstivity 59
steer filter 97
steer speed 30
steer gamma 4.0
steer assisst enabled

But they aren't a rule, play around these values and try to discover the one that plays best for you

Se você jogou o Assetto Corsa, você sabe que essa parada é boa, mas é aquilo, funciona muito melhor num volante do que num gamepad.


Eu uso um G27, se por algum motivo o volante não for reconhecido pelo jogo, vá para Propriedades> Geral e desabilite ""usar as configurações de entrada do steam""

Pro volante uso as configurações (que devem ficar boas no g29 e g920)

Ganho 100%
Força mínima 12%
Amortecimento Dinâmico 48% (mas teste valores entre 30 e 50 ao seu gosto)
Efeito da pista 18% (não vá além de 20% pra não gerar muito ruído)

Certo, se você quer jogar essa parada e tem um volante, pois bem, cê sabe o que fazer e nem deveria estar perdendo tempo aqui, porque o jogo te direciona maravilhosamente bem pra esse lado. Mas se você é teimoso (ou assim como eu tem preguiça de ficar montando seu G27/29/algum outro volante) e vai querer brincar no controle bom, as melhores configurações que eu encontrei que funcionam bem no gamepad do PS4 são

Zona Inoperante 0
Sensibilidade de Velocidade 59
Filtro de Condução 97
Velocidade de condução 30
Gama de Condução 4.0
Auxílio de Condução Ativado

If you love sim racing and GT3/GT4, this game is for you. It is the best and most complete GT3/GT4 game.



Assetto Corsa Competizione is probably the best simulation racing games I have played. The physics are among the best I've ever felt. I have a Thrustmaster TX wheel with T3PA Pro Pedals and the FFB feels very refined. The crash physics on this game are much better than the original AC. This game looks incredible as well, thanks to UE. However, this game does have 2 drawback in my opinion; content and career mode.

The content that is in the game is very high quality, but there just isn't much yet. I imagine this has to do with the newness of them using Unreal Engine, and they are limited since its a Blancpain game. Career mode just feels incomplete.

They already have the asia series cars, which makes me speculate that they will add the asia series tracks. I am hoping they add the asia and american tracks. I am also hoping they add GT4.

Even the smallest of setup change can modify the behaviour of the car so be prepared to have a hard time discovering the secrets of every car. 

Track surface grip variability and dynamic weather, with day, rain and night, make it hard to predict your best hotlap time.

PROS
-Handling is unmatched. Seriously, no other game delivers the raw realism, in my experience so far, that this game does through these GT3/GT4 cars
-DLC is something you'll buy because you crave even more of the content, NOT because it feels like you need it to experience the ""full game""
-Audio is absolutely perfect; sounds are accurate and gorgeous in every detail
-Game looks absolutely fantastic
-VR support (can't personally use it much though due to my motion sickness, and I like my ultrawide more most of the time anyways)
-Gives a MASSIVE amount of control over every little aspect of the gameplay (weather, time, race/practice/quali times, if a pit stop should be required, MANY assist choices, etc)
-AI is good and behaves fairly realistically (not perfect, but they can be challenging for a variety of skill levels and behave in a way that makes sense)
-Cars and tracks are ridiculously detailed. Extremely accurate to real life and beautiful to look at
-The livery editor is really cool buuuuut I don't tend to use it because I end up gawking at the car(s) for a minute or two and then wanting to drive instead of actually create a livery

CONS
-The game should really let you change difficulty settings mid championship/career. It sounds like a small aspect, but you might ""guess"" what difficulty you can handle and then later wish the game could be harder. Thankfully, you can actually just open the files with the settings in Documents/Assetto Corsa Competizione/Config (with the file ChampState for championships, and saveSettings for the career), but since this works it shows they COULD make it possible in-game
-Game is a bit hard to run. It's understandable why; there's immense amount of physics processing and the graphics are gorgeous, but it does mean people with lower-end PCs might want to try something easier to run
-Game is NOT forgiving and assumes you know a lot about these races already. I've been unable to finish races a few times for things I was unaware of before (the heck are ""stints""? why didn't the game teach me about how I can adjust TC/ABS/etc? I was supposed to make a setup before the race so I wouldn't run out of fuel?). I wish the game could give a better introduction to more of these aspects that inexperienced (or just people who don't know GT3/GT4) can have a better idea on what's going on
-VR performance (FPS-wise) isn't too great

Bottom line/TLDR: It's obviously the best GT3/GT4 sim to date by far, and easily one of the best (maybe the best, according to some) racing sims around. The game is gorgeous, sounds great, and is INCREDIBLY realistic. At the same time though, it is a bit unforgiving for new players. The game continues to be updated, so I see a bright future for the title. Easy recommendation to a serious sim racer!",1594945990,1594945990,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198174387343,68,24,4006,97,2057,1601771069
95,72813327,english,"I didn't think that we would ever see the ""perfect racing sim"" in a long time. This isn't it, but ACC has definitely taken some great strides.

Positives:
[list]
[*]The physics and the tires behave very realistically, meaning that the cars feel great and extremely natural to drive.
[*]Each car feels extremely unique. When I switch between cars, I have to adapt my driving style as a would in real life because each car is truly different than all the others, thus, it is strongly beneficial to find a ""main"" car.
[*]In both real life GT3 and ACC, the cars use driver aids. Unlike other sims like iRacing, you actually feel punished for an overreliance on these driver aids. For example, if you have ABS and TC turned all the way up, you will struggle under braking and acceleration respectively.
[*]Not on the driving side, the UI is extremely intuitive to use, and it was easy to set up my T150 wheel and T3PA Pro pedals and map buttons to settings comfortable for me to use.
[/list]

Negatives:
[list]
[*]Okay, straight to the point. Career mode is lacking in depth. All it feels like is a glorified season mode where you are put into a top level GT3 car after the first 30 minutes of driving.
[*]This game is not at all optimized for VR (I am a VR user). Although I did eventually find settings suitable for my liking, it honestly took over 2 hours to find those. None of the preset VR settings work very well, unlike the original AC which was almost perfect for me with the default settings.
[/list]

Verdict:
If you are looking for the ultimate racing sim, but not willing to break the bank with iRacing or RF2, this is for you.

On top of that, the way the cars feel is top notch. I like it better than IRacing and it feels somewhat similar to AC (naturally), but I'd say even better. This game is now a Racing sim, whereas I've viewed AC. as more of a driving simulator you can do some racing with. 

And lastly, the GT4 cars are frickin sweet! Very glad they released all 11 of them at once, instead of drip feeding them to us. I've had some fantastic races today in those cars. all of which I'd say were more fun and closer matched than GT3 races. 

Thank you Kunos. I waited a long time to buy this game, waiting for it to bake in the oven a little more, hoping it be as fantastic as AC.  I think I bought in at just the right time!

I personally not interested in AI as i exclusivelly drive online or practice offline for online sessions. Bugs are ironed out imo, i havent received a crash or just a bug since 1.2 version came out i think.

Edit 1: Alright, I've played the game a little more now and I'll add/keep adding some updates. I still like the game a lot. For GT3 this is arguably the best sim out there right now. Little advice: Play the game on either good speakers or a headset. You can literally hear everything, even the smallest stone flying off your wheel. 

I came to notice that, although the AI is good, it's by far not perfect or the best. As a fairly bad player I'm not yet playing online because I don't want to ruin other's races, so I depend on the AI quite heavily. Most of the time the AI is good (Strength 93, Aggressiveness 85), but especially on corners like Eau Rouge and the following Raidillon the AI lacks the feeling and ""racecraft"" a little and proceeds to smash into your side, sending you flying. Annoying as it can ruin your race as it did mine after 30 min of driving and overtaking. I guess it depends on the track however.

46,50968244,english,"UPDATE July 15 2020: 

Development after my initial review has evolved to a state on which now it's one of the best, if not the best, simracing game right now.  All game breaking bugs were solved, a lot of improvements were made in all the game aspects, so I fully recommend it now.

If you like driving GT3 cars, this sim is for you. Now, you have the official 2018 and 2019 GT3 cars and tracks, plus the new GT4 roster, also in official form.

The only negative point is VR, as you need a very powerful system, not only GPU but CPU too, and it remains blurry compared with other simracing titles. Despite Kuno's efforts, IMO this is the worst VR implementation from all the sim titles. It's playable tough, but you need to accept some compromises to get good performance on it.

Initial review as of launch day, May 2019: 
Well, what can I say? This sim is on early access despite the 1.0 launch.

- In early access, VR never was very good, but Kunos made good progress to the point v0.7 was very decent, but this 1.0 release is several steps backwards: Blurry, inconsistent performance, crashed to desktop every ten minutes. Unplayable :-((

- A lot of crashes to desktop middle race.

- No save game in Career mode in between sessions.

Despite these very annoying flaws, the driving experience is really very good, but it's impossible for me to enjoy this sim in VR because the constants crashes to desktop.

If you are in the fence to buy this sim, I advise to wait until the bugs are solved.

I was planning to get this while it was discounted, but what made me more curious was a recent Digital Foundry video which mentioned the specs needed to get 60fps. As you will soon see, I'm under no illusions about my PC's ability to run this game because I have a fairly weak PC for my sims.

Now the fun part! I play my racing sims on an Alienware Alpha which doubles as an HTPC. It's the base model and I haven't upgraded it further than an SSD. I got it soon after they launched and it's played everything I can throw at it very well. Obviously, more recent games have required settings tweaks, but one advantage I have is my TV is an old plasma which is 1024p and I can get away with running games at 720p if 1080p is too much for it. And with racing sims it's the physics more than the graphics that appeals to me anyway.

The first test was a practice session using whatever graphics settings the game had as default. They looked quite high and sure enough, I got about 30fps at Brands Hatch in good weather with only me on track at 720p. But it did look beautiful. After a few laps I decided to try for 60fps and I switched the settings to low and moved the resolution scale up to 100% (low has it at 70%) and voila, 70fps+. I thought I'd cracked it! Next came the real test.

Quick race, Spa Francorchamps, 32 cars, starting last in stormy weather. The game was stuck on the loading screen and I had to restart my PC! When I tried again I reduced the resolution scale to the minimum of 50% and reduced the opponents to 9. This loaded quickly and I get 35 - 50fps depending on where I am on track, how many cars are visible, etc.

So, while I'm perfectly happy to stick to practice mode in this until it's time to replace the Alpha, it does appear that the time to replace it is drawing near or has even arrived. Which is a shame because I have a sim rig build in the back of my mind and the Alpha is the perfect size and shape for hiding under the seat.

My real gaming PC is a more powerful Ryzen 2600 and GTX 1660 Ti which should fare better, but playing on the wheel at a desk in my gaming chair is less comfortable, hence why I play sims on my HTPC. I may install it to see how it runs out of curiosity. Overall, I'm OK with the performance as I wasn't expecting much from the Alpha in this game!

Update:
Seems to run better with all settings on their lowest with resolution scale 100% and in 1080p.",1593985712,1594467654,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561197970645889,896,12,101,0,45,1594141129

The force feedback and phsyics are definitely a step up from Assetto Corsa and the graphics and textures are as well.  The replays are absolutely stunning and I hardly complete a race without watching the replay.  

The best part of this game is the sound.  The sound of the cars is AMAZING!!!  I recently bought an amp and new open ended earphones and I honestly play this game for the sound as its is like nothing else.  The car sounds literally bounce off walls and the environment around you like no other game I've ever played.  I smile every time I go past the walls with my AMG and the extra growl you hear as the exhaust notes bounces off the walls.

I like Automobilista 2 and if they get their licenses, it will make it harder for me to choose as their force feedback is more detailed and it may have better physics (although the brakes are not to my liking).  It also looks very good and the lighting effects may be slightly better but the car detail and overall viewing of Competizione is absolutely fantastic...and again, nothing matches the sound.

[b]Navigating this game off the race track is more difficult than the driving. And it squanders it's multiplayer potential.[/b]

The good: 

1) authentic on-road driving experience. 

2) The sound and graphics blew me away and it’s very immersive.

The bad:

1) For non-sim racers, ACC is not intuitive and lacks explanations for a lot of it’s car and racing features. The game assumes you’re an experienced sim-racer and this can be frustrating for new drivers. There’s only bits and pieces in external Guides/YouTube etc. and no central source of information that fully explains ACC. It desperately needs a pdf or links to instructional videos within the game. 

2) the multiplayer design feels rudimentary at best - mainly just 20 minute public races and there’s no ladder or similar. MP feels like its tagged on and minimal. The limited multiplayer design is puzzling given simmers mainly race online - the MP infrastructure should be at the heart of the game like it is with Iracing.

As an example, the server list doesn’t even have a sort feature to isolate pings/driver numbers or tracks. How could that be overlooked? There is a Championship server that works (sometimes) at a few set times, but some regions can’t access it. So you have to hunt around outside of the game to find a league if you want to race properly. 

It’s a pity because if they polished the MP aspect of ACC it could be extremely popular despite it's overall lack of instructional information. But there’s too much you have to learn to get the most out of it and the MP reward when you finally get online and compete is too hit and miss. 

Overall in it’s current form ACC is a mixed bag so at this stage I have to give it the thumbs down.",1594263238,1594279728,False,1,0,0.47072070837020874,0,True,False,False,76561198051437079,18,7,1262,0,521,1595403781

Note: Tested with TS-PC Racer + T3PA Pro pedals.

Pros:
+ Best physics I came across in a PC game. The handling is great, you can feel those G forces through your neck.
+ GT3 cars. All the same class, but every car is so different. You will love that Porsche on Zandvoort and hate it on the straights of Mount Panorama.
+ GT3 cars are forgiving, but if you overcook it, you will hit the wall. Safe != fast. You will need to push to beat the best guys (and you will not manage to do that most probably).
+ You will understand how to set up a car from this game. Check Aris.Drives YTB channel to learn it.
+ Tracks are super accurate (laser scanned) and really addictive. Over time you will like them all.
+ The best graphics and sound across circuit racing games.
+ Box animation looks great from the car.
+ Best wet driving I felt in-game. Thank god for that TC and ABS. Btw you don't see shit while driving in a storm.
+ GT4s are on the way. In-game content is being added frequently.
+ This game is really addictive.

Cons:
- This game is really addictive.
- You will see how bad driver you are.
- Aliens will drive you crazy.
- You will need to learn how to set up your car to stay on track.
- Some parts of UI are not great.
- If you switch cars frequently, you will never learn how to drive them fast. But that's a good thing, right? :)
- Glitches/bugs occur from time to time. That's why your car is not Italian, right?
- Graphics&CPU demands are high.
- Hard to get good FPS with mid PC.

I guess I can say I like this game a lot :).

So in VR, I do not recommend this game at the 1.4.4 release form. It is a hazy mess and there is no way you will be able to have any sort of great settings regardless of how many YouTube videos you watch. I upgraded my Rift to the Rift S and it was WAY less hazy, but i'm type A and I still get frustrated with the quality in VR.

For the record, I have modded the original Assetto Corsa to have dynamic weather, lights, and upgraded textures and run that at 200% super sampling will ALL settings on ultra. I thought, what the heck, get compentizione because I want more quality online racing. Problem is the visuals in VR, I have EVERYTHING set to LOW with even resolution quality to 80% and super sampling to 100%... I just did a race with 29 cars and it was unbelievable trying to predict where they were because of the delay in ghosting. I got third. Started 25th. 

Online experience was great honestly, people ram because they suck, not because they want to. Well, maybe some people have a chip on their shoulder lol. 

The audio is great. You can hear the metal chassis in the 488, the scream of the engine, brake squeals and backfires as you downshift to your latest Shakane. 

If it were my birthday, I would wish for VR optimization for Compentizione. Gladly I will change my review when that happens. Until then, if you are a VR freak like myself, wait until they optimize it. If you have triple screens (I do also), a quality racing setup, and a high-end computer, then no questions asked, get this game.

It does everything almost perfectly, rfactor 2 might have better physics (though it's debatable), iracing might have better multiplayer, the original AC has more diverse content.
But if you're looking for a pure GT3 (and GT4 coming) sim you just can't get better than this. 


PROS: 
-Handling: is outstanding I don't think any other sim can give you the ""feel"" the cars in ACC give you, the car feel like they have weight and that you truly have to manage that weight transfer.
-Graphics: best looking sim on the market, period. We'll talk about performance in the cons though.
-Sound: OH MY GOD, this is the single best sim for sound, with headphones you can hear EVERYTHING, the suspension bottoming out, the wind, the gearbox slamming into gear, the engine notes are all spot on, you can HEAR bumps on the track like you do IRL and so much more, the best sound engine in ANY sim.
-Active online racing: Unlike other sims (cough cough rF2) the community is vibrant and you'll pretty much always find a race, even if you can't commit to a league you can always have a fun race with the decent safety rating system.
-UI: The user interface is a strong point of this sim, except for the server browser that takes some time to get used to. 
-Value: for all it gives you ACC is pretty cheap, DLCs aren't too expensive and give you great content for a small price, the ICGT pack for example gives you 4 tracks for a little over 10£ or 15 euros you get 4 great tracks, something you'd have to drop over 40£ on iRacing for example.
 

CONS:
-Performance: This isn't really a fault of ACC but it's just a product of it being a modern sim on UE4. Even though the graphics are outstanding it comes at the cost of performance, this isn't a sim you can run on a toaster like iRacing.
-Content: if you're not a GT3 fan this sim simply doesn't have the content you want.

58,72089680,english,"ACC is one of the most enjoyable sim racing games I've played in recent memory. It's a must have for anyone who is into GT3 or a similar style of racing. The game isn't as expansive as the likes of games like Project CARS or Forza, but it is definitely a case of quality over quantity, and shows what a team can do when their efforts are much more focused.

I'm no pro when it comes to sim racing, and I've usually been more of an arcade racer, but from my personal experience the physics and handling are great in my opinion, especially on my Logitech G920. I have tried using a controller and it was okay, but I'd definitely recommend a wheel for this. The audio is exceptional, and is one of the best I've heard in a racing game; every car sounds unique, and the attention to detail is unreal. The graphics are great; rain on the windshield is close to the likes of DRIVECLUB, with the rain moving depending on where you're turning and how fast you're going. Racing in heavy rain is an experience all of it's own; only being able to see a few metres ahead, relying only on the rain light on the rear of the car in front, it can be scary at times, especially in VR. Moving onto VR, The physics, graphics and especially the audio, come together to create one of the most immersive VR experience I've ever had. Using the game's ""VR High"" setting, on my RTX 2080, i7 8700k build, runs just fine. The AI is okay in most scenarios, and actually goes for overtakes a lot of the time. The AI drive much better in the dry than the rain, and I'll touch on that in a moment. I've had a few problems with the AI; one being that they won't hesitate to spin you out a lot of the time, so be careful if they're on your inside line during a corner. The second thing is that in heavy rain conditions, there are instances were they can be randomly slow for no reason, especially on the start sequence, causing the grid to be split in half a lot of the time; for example there could be a 5 car length gap between 6th and 7th before the race has even started; I'm not sure if it is caused with setting them on a lower difficulty or not, but just something to note anyway. I haven't tried multiplayer, so I cannot comment on that.

One feature I don't see touched upon much, is the ability to create your own team, and actually race in career and single races. You choose a team name, numbers, a car, car colours, car livery designs, sponsors, and drivers. Other than the new F1 2020 game, you don't see this very often and is a great addition worth mentioning.

I've also purchased the Intercontinental GT Pack DLC and the tracks are a great addition to an already great track selection, my favourite being Suzuka.

Overall, I can't get enough of this game right now, and I'm thoroughly addicted.

86,71910895,english,"Assetto Corsa Competizione, a niche simracing that unlike other games, only focus the GT3 (and GT4 in upcoming DLC). The only thing that hampers me from playing more so far is some technical issues regarding it, but i'm keeping the game and would like to play it more in the future. Coming from the sideways world of rallying, i still having a hard time playing circuit based simracing but i like this game. By the time of this review, this game is still on development, especially with them just releasing the console version, and now also working on GT4 DLC. Expect more content and fixes in the near future.

Pros:
+ RACING MIKU
Yes i actually initially buy the game just for this reason. 10/10 would #fightGSR :)

+ Great Physics
I love the physics. Having played project cars which very frustrating to attack the kerb, this game feels better. It also feels different with project cars' physics on GT3, but this one feels better in every aspect. Kunos Simulazioni deserves a kudos.

+ Very Detailed Simracing Experience
You can adjust almost everything that is adjustable in the real world i guess. And to be fair i'm quite overwhelmed with it, but thank god there is already a preset inside. Spending time at youtube would give you a better setups and better understanding.

+ Subtle but somehow if you look closer you can feel difference between each cars
Yes they belong in the same performance group of GT3, but each cars has their own handling characteristic and i felt like you need to approach each cars with different approach and good tuning to get the best out of each cars. The overall performance difference is hard to tell but some cars are better and worse at some characteristics than other.

+ There is only a GT3 (save for upcoming GT4 in DLC)
This is both a pro and con actually. The good side is you can put all your focus not to be distracted with other sometimes overwhelming classes. Not to mention because GT3 is also driven by gentlemen drivers in real life, it's also easier and more welcoming than the likes of faster Prototypes or open-seater car. You can even put ABS and other driving assist to help if you felt it is too hard to drive. The bad is, well that means the selection of cars is not that broad and only specific to that performance group.

+ Feels amazing to drive with a wheel
Yes i love the force feedback so much. It is really awesome to drive with a wheel. They really nailed the setup.

+ Rewards good driving both online and offline
This is a good game trains you to be a good driver with a good manner. Tells you to flat out and win without causing damages to other competitor. There is a clear rating that you can see. It's also friendly in online racing. And the online driver swap is good :)

+ Good graphics and weather model
It looks awesome and amazing. Although i still prefer Project Cars on this topic. Good work on the laser-scanned track as well. 

+ Appropriately priced so far
For the content, i'd say it's appropriately priced. Although i want it a little bit more cheaper, but considering this is quite new and development needs money, it's good enough. Unlike iracing which you have to subscribe, i prefer this pay upfront model and get everything. Simple no more in game purchase, just what you buy on steam and that's it.

+ Official and Esports
This game is an official product of GT World Challenge (Formerly known as Blancpain GT Series) and Intercontinental GTC. It features all the drivers and liveries from both series. And also being the SRO Esports game, which Louis Deletraz (F2 driver) won the pro series. So I'd say there is a healthy competitive scene supported by official racing series.


Cons:
- Resource intensive asf
Yes this game is heavy on my PC, especially on the CPU, although my GPU is struggling as well. Mine is a two year old Dell 7567 laptop with GTX 1050Ti and barely stable at low settings in high car counts scenario. Maybe i need to do some maintenance for the thermal side on my laptop to make it more stable, but having a good combination of PC and CPU really helps.

- Steep learning curve
This is somewhat expected from every simracing, not just this game actually. Thank god there is some training inside the game to help us newcomers. It's the kind of game that seems easy to learn but hard to master. Persistence, Patience and consistency pays off in this circuit based simracing. Especially the patience part which sometimes i still stumbled upon due to a more flat out nature in rallying and still forgot when is the braking points, because usually in rally games there is someone who tells me when to brake. If this already feels too hard for you, maybe circuit simracing is not the one you want, so better spend your money on other simracing or even going to a more arcade-feel game.

- Not really that gamepad friendly
As much as they tried, but it still feels too complicated to drive on a gamepad. But they tried their best, and hopefully with them releasing console version, they would refine the gamepad control. It is better than the original assetto corsa tho, which is a lot harder to play with gamepad, so it's already a step forward. IMO, Gran Turismo is still the gold standard for gamepad simracing.

- More content pls?
I'm afraid there would be a lot of DLC in the future due to the GT3 nature which can be raced in most circuit and there are a lot of circuits that is not yet included in this game. Nurburgring Nordschleife which runs with the German VLN series is one example. Also would be great if they add IMSA and Super GT cars and circuit because both of this series also uses GT3 as the base (GTD for IMSA and GT300 for Super GT). Just hopefully they don't ruin this game with too much DLC and greedy business practice.

- Easier Tuning option
The tuning could sometimes be overwhelming although there is a preset already. It would be a lot more helpful if they can add feature like a race engineer help like in project cars.",1593730669,1593730669,True,1,0,0.522471904754638672,0,True,False,False,76561198180612853,90,20,531,27,503,1601567520

95,71873301,english,"VR WARNING

I don't have enough room to face my setup towards my screen, so I can only play in VR.....and it's easily the worst VR game of any kind that I've ever tried.

I have a 2080ti and a 9700k, and I can only get decent frame rate through the Rift S if I turn the video settings WAY down. The problem with that is that not only does it look like absolute garbage, but the image is so blurry that its the only VR game I've ever played that gives me headaches. To Top that off, it also blurs my vision in real life for a few hours after about an hour of play.

Let me repeat that....

IT ACTUALLY BLURS MY VISION IN REAL LIFE, BECAUSE MY EYES ARE STRUGGLING SO MUCH TO TRY TO MAKE OUT WHAT I'M SUPPOSED TO BE SEEING.

You can combat this by turning the ""VR pixel density"" up, but you'll have to turn everything else down to it's lowest settings to make up for the performance hit. Even after doing that, not only is it still an unplayable frame rate, but IT STILL DOESN'T LOOK GOOD......also, before I forget, doing that also adds a few graphical glitches, like wet tracks turn blindingly white. So bright that I see spots like I was looking at the sun.

I don't understand how Assetto Corsa can look so great and run even better. This actually looks and runs so much worse. You'd think they'd have learned a thing or two from making the first one, but no. In their pursuit of making this ""look better"" they've not only managed to make it run like hot garbage, but they've also somehow managed to make it look worse???

If you're not planning on playing in VR, then the other problem is just a lack of content. There aren't many cars, and there's even less tracks. I didn't count how many, but it's not many at all (even including the DLC). I'm sure they'll add more in upcoming ""DLC"" which just adds insult to injury. I haven't seen this little content in a racing game since the PS1 days. They should be ashamed of themselves for already putting out paid ""DLC"". They need to fix the horrendous performance first and foremost, then they really should add free cars and tracks in the future, since there's so little in it to begin with.

To give them credit where credit is due, the cars handle phenomenally well. They feel very realistic, and sound like it too. It's just a shame that it actually gives me health problems from trying to play it.

Headaches and blurred vision is unacceptable. Stop whining for more money with your paid ""DLC"" and make it a playable game first.

The soft is a bit rough around the edges, though. Sometimes you can't connect to ACC servers, the maximum replay time is 1h15 (although you can assign a keybind or shortcut so you can record your race in two parts) and the optimization isn't great, which means you need to have a pretty decent computer to run the game on sweet settings. That being said, you get a lot off options to tinker with in the graphics department, and when it's set up as such, ACC is hands down the best looking sim in the market. On monitor at the very least... If you're a VR user, I recommend holding out before buying. Performance is pretty poor, or so I've read, so wait for any major improvement on that side or you'll regret buying ACC.
There are a lot of ressources and guides online to help newcomers finetune their experience.

Now, onto the gameplay. ACC aims to be as realistic as possible, meaning the tracks are accurate compared to their real life counterpart with the help of laser scan technology. The tracks are simply beautiful to drive on, and a few details actively reinforce the immersion. I wouldn't recommend new buyers to go straight into a race. Find your wheel/gamepad settings, familiarize yourself with the car and track, and go at a reasonable pace. Start to push in small increments.
The car setup will be the most important aspect, so tinkering and patience is greatly rewarded. That being said, the default setups are pretty competitive and most of the time require small adjustments to fit your driving style.

I will actually consider investing in a rig with top notch direct drive all the bells and whistles simply because its finally f***ing fun again.  I thank ACC.  

AC review:  I put lots of time and energy into AC and i don't recommend anyone do the same in 2020 (time better spent on ACC).  AC misses the mark on multiple points (good out of the box multiplayer) but i wont get into that, focusing instead on the drive.  AC is simply not fun to drive!

So I edited this from not recommended to recommended. Not that there's no issues with the game, but KUDOS to KUNOS for really stepping up and fixing a lot of bugs. The content is limited still, but the quality is the best. The community around it (and niche things like Coach Dave Academy) is really helpful. 

Multiplayer keeps being an issue, but to be honest, every game with public lobbies has this: bad players, connection issues etc... So join a league or play with friends you trust, as the rating system was a good idea - but didn't really help much in improving the gameplay per se...

But I changed my mind completely: this thing is even playable on a controller, you feel the weight of the cars, you feel the energy, the raw agressive power. The balancing act. No other sim replicates GT3s like this.

OLD REVIEW: 
So, here are the good things: it looks great, it's great when it works, the handling is awesome, it has great ideas and sets the bar for next racing sims. The content is limited, but that's not something to worry about if you are all about simracing GT3 cars.

BUT at the moment of writing sadly (2019/06/12) this game is full of bugs. The official forums of the game don't really react to bug reports and this is sadly something I can't live with. The most recent patch 1.0.2 even broke me for 4 days now already of playing the game. I can't launch it, and there are plently more people posting about this on the forum - yet no response from KUNOS.

TL; DR: Assetto Corsa Competizione is a focused down sequel of the Assetto Corsa, aiming to replicate the various GT3 championships run irl by the SRO. It provides the best GT3 driving in terms of physics and feel, but due to its SRO licensing, it will never have the variety of cars and tracks that Assetto Corsa, RFactor2 and Iracing offer. It is a highly demanding title, and a racing wheel & pedals is definitely recommended to get the most out of this game.

[b] The upsides [/b]
- The Cars: Cars from the 2018 and 2019 have been very carefully replicated, with high quality sounds and textures. As seen from any screenshot in game, all the cars look fantastic and are very similar to the real life counterparts

- The Tracks: There are about 10 tracks to select from in game, with more available as DLC. Kunos uses laserscanned data from each track to replicate it in game, so they are extremely accurate.

- The Driving: Assetto Corsa already had a great physics engine, but Kunos has out done themselves with ACC. ACC has the best handling of any driving sim on the market in my opinion

- The Environment: Endurance is a big part of GT3 racing, and ACC does an amazing job in replicating a constantly changing game environment. We finally have wet weather and a day-night transition, two things that were missing from the original AC game.

[b] The downsides [/b]
- Multiplayer:  Multiplayer is hit and miss. The public servers can be a lot of fun, but due to a slightly dysfunctional ""safety rating"" system, can be a pain at times. You also need to be careful of dirty drivers, especially in lobbies with 75 SR or lower.

- High PC req's: This game is very demanding, and I've had serious performance issues on a mid ranged PC. I've heard that VR and triple screens are still quite unplayable, even though there is in game support.

- SRO licensing: Because of the SRO licensing, we will only ever get cars and tracks that participate in SRO events. This means no prototypes, no GTE's and worst of all, no nordschliefe. If you want a wider diversity of cars, Assetto Corsa, RFactor2 and Iracing are all better options

I've also got a G29 and use it with Forza Motorsport 7, Project Cars 2, the original AC, and now this one. Though the VR in this game is probably the least polished compared with PC2 and even the original AC, the mechanics feels so 'right' that I'll gladly take the graphic infidelity hit. The cars lurch and lean very convincingly and the braking mechanics feel solid. The game - so far - still feels a bit incomplete in some ways, but it keeps drawing me in. It's also less forgiving than the other games, but that only makes me want to put in the time to master it.

What I'd love improved upon is the HUD in VR.

Its of absurd quality considering what assetto corsa without mods was, and is also still getting updates and love.
Now that they went to consoles i hope the next bigger thing will be either the said GT4's or a big endurance pack.
Because that is my only critique point, yes it might be weird with out Imsa or multiclass etc, but i still feel like some of the most popular Endurance tracks like the Nordschleife and Le-mans are missing.

47,71558624,english,"Being a huge fan of GT3 and racing in general. I think i should review this product now. At the time of writing i have 113 hours play so i think i can make a well balanced review. I've also been watching the GT World Challenge foremely Blancpain GT since 2014. 
I bought this during very early access. Maybe 2 tracks and cars. Since then the game has progressed massively to something that is ready for a console release. 

PROS:

Great force feedback (TM T300)   

Amazing feel on the brakes. (Fanatec Loadcell)

If you like GT3 all the cars are here.

Sounds awesome. The reverb of the exhaust when passing near a wall is very well done.

Tracks are top notch. Laser scanned as would be expected these days.

Loads of options when making a race. for example; mandatory pitstop, time acceleration, true to life qualifying format etc.
Graphics are some of the best around. Day to night transitions are really impressive.


THE FUTURE:
GT4 cars are coming which will add a huge amount to the game. Not just content wise. British GT will work well here as the GT3's and GT4's race together in this championship. 
This will include more tracks such as Oulton Park, Snetterton and Donnington Park (going by the 2020 Calendar).


CONS: (No game is perfect and i see no point of reviewing it without some constructive criticism)

AI; no AI is perfect by the way. The races can end up like a long train. One group will take off. The the rest of the pack get stuck behind the Mclaren. Then further back another group will be stuck behind a NSX. The problem here is GT3 cars are all balanced under SRO's BOP. Meaning the deciding factor is driver skill. AM, PRO, GOLD, PLATINUM. The developers need to take this and run with it. You need different cars to have different levels of driver in them. This adds another dimension after a driver swap aswell. Maybe a car that was driving off from you in the first stint is more on your level in the second stint. 

Pitstops. No matter what you do the other cars will pit stop 5 seconds faster than you. Completely taking away from a battle you might of been having before your stop. 

Customising the Mandatory pit stops would be a good addition. Minimum fuel you have to take, driver change, tyres etc. This will come into play when they release the British GT pack as the instead of having success ballast they make cars stop for longer in the pits depending on their championship position. 

AI events need to be abit more random. Someone getting stuck in the gravel yellow flag for a few laps. Red flags in qualifying happen nearly everything race weekend in the real world. These needs to be worked on in my opinion. would give the races and the race weekend abit more of a real world feel.

The game is huge, and is graphicly very impressive. Because of this the minimum specs are too high in my opinion. I had to upgrade to a GTX 1080ti so i could play comfortably. not everyone can afford a £500 Graphics card. Its unfair to push these people out.


CONCLUSION:

This is a 9/10 in my opinion. There are cons but these are more things that can be fixed and worked on over time and don't break the game in anyway. Or make it unplayable. If you have a wheel and pedals the you probably already have this game. But if you are new to sims and have just bought a wheels and pedal set i would say this is one of the best game to start off with.

Excellent if you are a sim racer geek who can spend your entire life (or most of it) playing.
Not so, if you are an occasional gamer as you need to spend more time playing than with Assetto Corsa to master the game and really get into the races, etc. The fact that in weekend mode, pit stops are compulsory also require more time to play.
The ""ideal line"" being kind of 3D which kind of blocks your forward view and is dynamic (i.e. turn red or green dynamically), I prefer the ideal line in AC. It's off anyway as I did not like it but that means that to really get going you also cannot really race without doing the practice sessions and qualifications otherwise you get hammered in the race.

- Less than 50 people are racing during prime hours online. 

- Spin out once no matter the speed and your tires turn to glass

- They removed setup option in Special events

- Online races is basically a toned down Forza 7 

- first turn pile up

- Physics when bumping is exaggerated and cause easy crashing

- your game will crash at least once an hour for no reason

- you cant connect to half the servers

- Track grip is all over the place on a per server basis and will require a low grip and a high grip setup. There can be up to a 4 second gap on the same track. This is not even addressing the wet setups.

- Vr performance is atrocious a lot of gpu performance is needed for 45fps.

- No real time telemetry to fine tune setup

9,70710175,english,"It's the most enjoyable racing simulation I've played. Due to an improved tyre model, the car is far more predictable than in Assetto Corsa. No more struggles to come back on track after hitting the grass, like in AC or Project Cars 2, or spinning just because you dared to use curbs like in a real race. AC made me interested in GT3, ACC made me an addict!

The positives...
 - Physical simulation is much improved compared to AC. I'm not a pro driver or sim racer, so this is just how I find it.
 - Graphics and sound are good. The menu system is decent, massively improved over Assetto Corsa, though still not as good as other games.
 - Dynamic weather can add spice to a race, and it's visually great.
 - Laser-scanned tracks are very detailed and it's easy to find reference points.
 - The price for both game and DLCs is reasonable, especially compared to the competition (i.e. Automobilista 2 and iRacing are unbelievably expensive).
 - The scoring system, though initially annoying, is actually making me a better driver.
 - Default setups are excellent.

For the negatives...
 - It's really annoying to lose SA (security rating) when someone hits you from behind or when you have stopped after a spin. There is no concept of ""race accident"", and the blame is always on both drivers. When tyres are hot and the AI is following closely, often the choice is between breaking early and being hit from behind or going off track.
 - AI is just not good enough. At the start either they keep in strict double file till the first corner or they turn into you for no reason (Lamborghinis are especially dangerous). At high skill levels, the AI starts being aggressive even without increasing aggressiveness. It's nearly impossible not being hit and lose SA.
 - It's shocking that they didn't even provide a UI for starting the server. Kudos to Martin Vindis for creating ""ACC Dedicated Server GUI"".
 - The online community needs to grow. There are only 89 players online at the time of writing this review. Have been playing only for 40 hours, and don't have access to competition servers yet, so can't comment on that.
 - Like many games on Steam, it still suffers from quite a few obvious bugs (e.g. in a hot lap, brakes are cold if you go out of the garage without pressing the setup menu; in a race, tyres and brakes start getting cold as soon as you are done with settings, not when the time is up for everyone).
 - Radio comms are sometimes very annoying and unnecessary. When you are pushing on a hot lap, miss the apex and go too wide on a turn, ""Try to stay on track"" is not something you want to hear! Or ""Well done, mate! This is your fastest lap of the race."" on the first lap.

15,70817980,english,"For a long time fan of the gt3 series, ACC gives the enjoyment for driving the cars. Each car has its own characteristics that differ entirely to one another. Another aspect that I enjoy is feeling the weight of the car through the corners. The setting that you make to the car is essential as it defines the car on how you drive. But sometimes, it is not you that define the car but otherwise. The perfect example is the AMG GT3. As after 50 hour ive played, satisfaction and knowledge of GT3 cars that ive driven is phenomenal and  flop. It is due to that I force the car to do as I command and not listening to the car first.
Gameplay wise, it is as similar to other racing titles but different in terms of camera movement of the cars. Multiplayer balance is not an issue as it is more of a free for all for P1 as you get better, the better result youll get. The only downside is information of our own performances during displayed.

It works really well on my triple screen setup. And I enjoy racing it like that.

However, I purchased this game for VR, and it is shockingly bad for that.
I run GTX2060 Super, I7 6700k with an Oculus Rift S. And on Low settings was the only time I got consistent frame rates. But the Low settings are so bad its not worth playing.

If you want to buy this game, its only good for Monitor setups, unless you have a stupidly fast system

Edit: At the time of writing this review, I was at about 6 hours of Playtime. 
I stand by the fact that this game runs best on 3 screens, and looks great. However I have since found a youtube video that helped me setup the game for VR. Whiles it not perfect, it is actually playable now.

A. It doesn't let you select one out of the 8 
B. Puts me in a lobby at Brands Hatch when I set it so shouldn't be at it. 

Same goes for lobby size. I have it set to 24 and I have had lobbies of 60 drivers. Despite those things I do think its a good game. They do have a good rating system that shows you how good are and what you can improve on.

However, the competitive servers are absolutely garbage. First of all there's only 3 races a day. The schedule changes daily and every other day is a random track.

The servers had been down for an entire week when I was trying to race. Daily just launching the game seeing they're down and closing. Then I finally get to do a random race, there's only 11 OTHER DRIVERS in my lobby which is not skill balanced at all. 2 leave because they don't like the track, leaving 10 of us which are separated by a total of over 5 seconds in qualifying.

So I first got it during the recent free weekend to try it out all was well and enjoyed the believable physics. after two days of long playtime, I purchased it. It was shortly after purchased I then started to have continued issues with either the servers not connecting at all, so I would be unable to join any online race at all, but more annoying is that my driver profile ratings/states have not been able to load or update at all for the past few days even when I am able to join online events.  This is extremely frustrating as to improve your driver ratings to join more competitive and CLEANER races the driver profiles need to be updating, But if they are not (In my case past 4 days now) and you are able to join online events, then anything you gain or lose in that event does not get recorded. which leaves me stuck where I am unable to improve my ratings at all, both online or online. 
It is extremely worrying that if the servers are having these issues long after release, how are they going to manage when the console players start coming in as well?

As I have said it is extremely frustrating that these issues are present for something that seems so little, but they holt any kind of progression. 
And with ACC being focused on competitive based racing I would expect the above issues to be nowhere near as common. 

All that said I ACC if fantastic if you are a fan of GT3 racing. The AI is AI though it is not on the level of AMS, Raceroom, or rFactor2 (when they work) it will, however, make you want to keep improving your lap times and overall pace to keep up at the higher skill level. 
Graphics are some of the best in sim-racing with the weather and lighting and how dynamic the track reacts (Just make sure you have the powerplant to run it)

+ VR re-center view worked after finding it.
+ The tracks included were the ones you know from the other games: Monza, Spa, Barchelona, Estoril, ... I think only A1-ring (Redbull) was missing. 

- The car engine soundds
- The tracks are too narrow. Or the cars too big for the tracks.
- Driving help should show the breaking point a bit too early. Now it displays it bit too late, so if you haven't learn the track, the car won't stop, and your laptime is invalidated.
- The VR graphics were blurry.
- There are no any formula-style cars.

Maybe it's too early, maybe they'll get it better.

I don't want to be too cheesy in my judgement but this is absolutely the BEST sim I have ever tried EVER. Simulation wise, graphics wise, performance wise (on a 980 Nvidia 71 fps at 1920*1080 everything on ultra, 62 FPS in 2560*1440) . The sound is AMAZING, you can actually hear everything in the car and FINALLY you can hear all the armonics from the engine. It sounds like you have a lamborghini in your room, and I live 5 mins from a Lamborghini GT3  team HQ so I hear them quite often. 
I don't want to express too much detail on the simulation accuracy because it's not necessary at this point, anyone that ever tried a car on track and had the lucky shot to drive a supercar on track will understand once he tries this what level of simulation this title provides. I'm speechless. Absolutely amazing work.
Now we just need to wait and see how the Multiplayer platoform will be and how the community will grow. I hope good things will happen.


I forgot Force Feedback...well to me ( g27) it's set automatically by the game along with all calibrations etc and it's fucking perfect. The feeling is out of this world considering my wheel isn't top notch I can't wait to try the full version on a more professional wheel.
---------------

After Release:

The game is still bug ridden, good improvements from EA but still unfinished. 
Performance wise is good as long as you don't want to try it in VR.
Only after 3 hours of heavy tweaking and understanding I managed to have a good experience.
And wasn't just a matter of detail, I actually had to fool the game and the Oculu service in order to get a 80% performance improvement which screams bugs. That will improve I hope but a regular user doesn't have the knowledge or the will to do that.

Performance has to improve as default, helmet cam needs to have culling options in order to remove the clipping.
Matchmaking doesn't reflect what matchmaking is, I guess it has been cut down post release and justified as ""You didn't understand what we meant for Matchmaking"".
It's basically just a filter based on your skill that the game sets for you then you join servers with no restrictions anyways so matchmaking is useless and not used properly as a word, putting a lot of confusion in the heads of customers.

AC wasn't in this state at launch, I guess the original programmer/s isn't working at Kunos anymore and you can smell it from a mile away.

Still a solid sim, but lack the experienced or genius hand that AC had, and it's obvious.

-------------------------------------
1.4 Review:

Game is increasingly getting better, DLC price and content is excellent, bugs are getting fixed, VR is way better now (despite the Helmet model in vr, still clipping and twitching and bad, I wish it was that goos as in PC2). 
If it had a platform like iRacing for multiplayer it would be great but it doesn't, I guess it does requires a subscription of some sort to actually pay and keep the service up. But on the other side, the content and its quality presented with ACC is light years ahead of iRacing which suffers from its own elitism to justify insane prices for cars and tracks (along with monthly subscriptions).
iRacing can , therefore, kiss my a$$ and long live Kunos.",1536777938,1590719515,True,4,0,0.548872172832489014,0,True,False,True,76561197972101505,338,55,3777,0,183,1598579040

If you can get over that and appreciate the raw dedication that has gone into creating Competizione, just wow.. the sounds are great. The models especially are really well done, the cockpits are just epic in night racing. 
The camera positions with the easy adjustability is very nice, this game is not comparable with AC due to the use of different game engines, so don't even try to compare it. It leaves it out to dry so to speak!

54,69745061,english,"The good:
[list]
[*]The game looks amazing and sounds even better.
[*]Car handling is very believable and very challenging. Difficult at first but incredibly rewarding once you start getting it right.
[*]Just lapping by yourself can get you sucked in, wanting to do just one more lap to try and improve your lap time before you close the game.
[/list]

The bad:
[list]
[*]Multiplayer still hasn't left early access, even though the game is allegedly finished and at version 1.4.
[*]The server list often just plain out doesn't work – something on the backend just stops working and you can't see any servers until it's fixed. Since there is no other way to connect to a game, that means no multiplayer for you for several hours. This happens several times a week. Other times, you may get to a list of games, but when you click the button to join one of them, the game will crash.
[*]When the server list does work, it's very basic. There is no ability to sort servers by ping, or by number of players, or by safety rating requirement. Under advanced settings, one can set sorting preferences, but that has no apparent effect on the server list. Also in the advanced settings screen, there is an entire tab with permanently greyed out options labelled “coming soon” – a year after the game's official release.
[*]On the rare occasion that the server list does work and you plough through the unsorted server list to join a game, you can finally race with others. You might think that since this is a racing game, there'd be some sort of championship or something else to reward you for good race results, but there isn't. There are various stats you can gain (or lose) during races, such as safety rating for racing cleanly and not crashing into others, but your finishing position doesn't really matter. There are official competition servers run by Kunos which are also mostly broken, but all you get for competing on these is “competition rating”.
[*]There are no public driver profiles, so you can't just access someone's stats from the web or from the game itself. All you can access is your own stats. Best you can do is take a screenshot of your stats and post them on the forum.
[*]Developers are uncommunicative. Whilst they do have an official forum, they rarely let the community know whether any of the constant issues are being worked on, what caused them, whether there are any workarounds, or anything else helpful at all.
[*]Developers are careless and uncaring. They just released an update with a bug where cars will receive damage as soon as they are spawned on the starting grid. Somehow, in all their testing, they didn't notice that. But, worse, this release went out on a Friday – and the developers don't work on weekends, no sir. That means an entire weekend of completely broken MP. Recently, there has also been a separate issue where if a server operator made a mistake in one of the server configuration files, the server would crash in the middle of a race. One of the developers commented on the issue that because it's caused by a misconfiguration, it's a user error and not a bug.
[/list]

In summary:
[list]
[*]The game is very fun in singleplayer – lapping by yourself, trying to set the best time you can. Just in this game mode alone, there is enough content in there to last you a decade. You can also race against AI opponents, if you enjoy racing AIs.
[*]Competitive multiplayer is a disaster. The game should still be considered early access because of the multiplayer alone, and priced accordingly.

Great racing in Multiplayer (competition server).

The guys know how to stay safe. Sure, sometimes their will be some contact, but its ok. People mostly are fair, because you need a high rating to join the competition server.

67,69618971,english,"While i would love to rate this as a YES there are just too many issues with this game. While it prides itself on being an accurate sim there are many parts of the game which should be there as fundamental basics.

- Server browser is terrible, you can't filter on servers you can actually join, or filter on anything. In fact this is probably the worse server browser in gaming history - honestly....

- Car physics are good and detailed but tyres just don't feel right and there are many areas where it is overly complex and there is little feedback or guidance to tell you where to spend time looking at the setup. You can use Motec but there is no clear guide, and basic information like downforce, ride height aren't available so figuring out where you are going wrong is hard to nearly impossible

- The game favours good drivers, the safety system which limits what servers you can join is based on performance against opponents which means you can get dragged down playing online through other players. Seems they want you to just grind out against the computer or as another user said in the forums ""drop to the back and try to over take slower cars"" not really a good advert for racing....

 - there are still glitches, in all i'd say this is a small firm trying to build a very complex driving sim and they have struggle to complete the game overall. Mulitplayer starts can bug out causing damage to cars before the race even begins. 

There is plenty to like about ACC but it lacks polish and accessibility to more general racers that just want to jump on for an hour and have some racing.",1590171344,1590171344,False,1,0,0.501845002174377441,0,True,False,False,76561197984779831,253,26,11721,0,10701,1599574813

- UI is poorly designed
- Multiplayer has little to no moderation for ramming, cheating, etc. (these are not common issues at all, but the fact remains that public server racing is nearly lawless).
- Requires a better CPU than you may expect. 

Pros: 
- Everything else

This game is the be-all-end-all for GT3 racing. Nothing comes close in my experience. Setups, tracks, cars, racing, it's all absolutely phenomenal. League racing and the weekly Competition Server (aka CP) races are infinitely enjoyable. Every car is incredibly satisfying to drive. Kunos are still in active development for the foreseeable future as well, so it's only going to get better. If they can sort out the UI and introduce some multiplayer moderation, I will have zero complaints about the game.

As for hardware, this game is very, very CPU intensive. My PC is pretty solid by modern standards but my CPU occasionally struggles to keep up with all of the dynamic assets/physics. Graphics are reasonably well optimized but it's certainly not easy to render. I'd estimate that most modern GPUs can handle the graphics.

I did some digging on the net and found some fixes, but it still doesn't fix it 100%. I guess my system is just not up to the task... I have no clue how anyone plays this with anything other than the recommended system specs as a bare minimum. I can only think its the graphics card though. Could also be PSU related.

It's such a pity because I really love this game. Practice is a blast. 

I had issues with the framerate during the early access stage, but i figured it was early access so what can you do? but it actually ran better then!

I guess I'll keep digging to see if I can find any more fixes and get it to run better, but until then, don't even bother if you don't have the recommended specs as a minimum. If I get it to run better, I will update the review and put my findings / fixes in so other people might stand a chance.

Edit: I should add, I'm not using VR. It seems the majority of the people with graphics issues in the reviews are running VR.

Edit 2: I came back after trying a completely fresh install as suggested in the comments. No difference. I was hopeful because it seemed fine for the first quarter of the first lap I did and it went straight back to the stuttering, again with all graphics settings on their lowest.

- better car handle

- settings options are improve 
- preload car setups are not so slow

- AI is still dumb
- HUD is still one without much option for control

Obviously you can enforce some kind of pg 13 rule and a report system for the rating requirments but please someone who sees make this help make this happen!

Open up a section for the community to continue to grow through this platform, Car people across the land dream of being able to self enter a vehicle into the racing scene but up until recent times, car games in multiplayer have been more of an arcade experience than a competitive one.

this coupled with the safety requirements will make this or any game that does this incredible as it will open the doors for many e series race teams to appear and grow with in their platform, not only that it would make the video editor section of this simulator so much more useful to make quality content from with in the platform.

63,55540950,english,"Updated review
============
I've updated my rating for this game after numerous patches from Kunos.

The game has improved leaps and bounds from it's poor performance at launch.

It still requires a powerful PC to run well but if you have a machine capable of running it then this has become the gold standard for GT racing in my opinion. I upgraded the rig below to: R5 3600X, 570X mobo, 16GB, same everything else. I can run the VR High preset on my Oculus Rift CV1 at 90FPS.

I subscribe to iRacing (more fool me) and play all of the other sims (RF2, AC). For GT3 cars there simply isn't anything that comes close to capturing the essence of GT racing like ACC. The cars are all unique, feel great and are superb fun to drive at the limit. The force feedback is OK, not great but captures everything you need reasonably well. The car sounds are incredible, best in class imo. The tracks are laser scanned.

Fair play to Kunos for turning it around. I hope the game continues to develop as successfully.


Original Review below for transparency:
***************************

Nice idea ruined by poor performance of the Unreal Engine.

I bought this for the VR support. I run an i7, 2080, 16GB RAM, Intel 750 NVME & Rift. I cannot get a playable framerate in VR. Even running on Lowest settings, looking absolutely dreadful, it won't run above 45fps consistently. The different weather types and associated effects reduce performance even more.

I could look past the dreadful UI and broken menu's and keybinds if the game ran smoothly and looked nice but they didn't even manage that.

If you don't want VR this might be an average single player racing game. Don't expect much activity in multiplayer either, noone is playing.

I pre-ordered on announcement of this game, I love Assetto Corsa. I really wanted this to work. 

It doesn't, avoid it.",1570729163,1588878051,True,0,0,0.620673537254333496,0,True,False,False,76561197972300452,252,5,7532,0,4111,1599589445
64,68744566,english,"To put it short, this game is FANTASTIC for GT3 racing. First off, this game has been compared very frequently to iRacing, but I believe that its not a fair comparison as its more so comparing apples to oranges. ACC is currently purely focused on GT3 racing and emulating that while iRacing is suited for many different kinds of championships. The multiplayer is great in this game, the races themselves are fun and there are a lot of open lobbys to join during the day and night. What I would like to see in terms of multiplayer being added is a sort of amateur/pro-am/pro competition type servers. This would mean that the amateur competition servers do still have a standard of required driver rating to join but would be a step to getting your feet wet into the competitive races. Another hiccup that I find with this game is that the frequency of these competitive server races is that these are not frequent enough. Moving on from the multiplayer aspect, the physics and tire models are very ironed out and feel extremely realistic, in particular when the brakes are cold or the tires you can feel yourself getting more grip over the course of the lap. Intertwined with this is also the track evolution where you will find yourself being able to take different lines over the course of a race as the track gets more rubbered in. The detail in the tracks being laser scanned and the scenery in combination with the graphics makes this game a truly immersive experience and makes you yearn for cutting those tenths off your laptime and improving. The Career mode itself feels a bit lacklustered not having much depth except for the typical championship race weekend style gameplay but I can not think of how this could be changed seeing as in the essence of it, it is a racing game after all. Good selection of cars and the sound is probably the closest you will come to the sound of a real GT3 car! if you dont believe me compare the sounds of a car in game versus the in real life counterpart. 
I would 100% recommend this game to anyone who has a racing rig and enjoys driving GT3 cars. The forcefeedback feels complete and I can feel when I am overdriving the car or am about to understeer/oversteer. If you are using a Thrustmaster wheel, the FFB settings on default were at 333hz which felt a bit lacking depth and moreso being too rough to get out the fine details, after setting it to 111hz it felt like I was able to really feel every bump and surface of the road individually.",1588872808,1588872808,True,39,0,0.782044947147369385,0,True,False,False,76561198278741149,62,3,4759,0,3158,1589643822

Yes if you
-like near real life racing simulations
-want to push your potential to a maximum
-want fair online racing
-love GT3 cars
-want to invest a lot of time in getting better

No if you
-just want to drive around circuits
-want a huge variety of tracks and cars
-want some kind of epic career mode experience

Some weakpoints of this game are the following:
-you cant customize your HUD like you could on Assetto Corsa
-very little content: Yes this game is built around GT3 cars and that is fine but there are a lot of tracks missing like the Nordschleife, LeMans Circuit, Circuit of the Americas....
Also while the game is a lot about endurance racing, I would like some LMP1 and LMP2 cars as well.
-Basically no explanations for a lot of setup options, which makes it really hard for beginners to get used to it
-You cant just open a lobby and drive with friends. You have to get some 3rd party server software to run a virtual server on your computer.

Basically the game is like its predecessor, but with a big lack in content. The only upside to this game is the Quick Play feature, where you can jump into a random lobby and race against others. In addition to that there is a pretty competitive ranked mode available.

Conclusion: If you want a competitive GT3 simulation environment, then go ahead and buy it. If you just want to drive around and/or experience more tracks and cars, then you are better off with Assetto Corsa or Project Cars.",1588680055,1588680055,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198000357172,101,6,813,0,586,1593354836

PLEASE IMPLEMENT THE GLOBAL LEADERBOARD!

16,68318840,english,"ACC v.1.3.11

To anyone who's a real simracer this title is a must-have among others like rF2, AMS or the original AC. This game has SRO license so it basically has content/racing series that are governed by the SRO. It has a limited car roster due to that, but the cars included are exceptionally well recreated and very fun to drive + it actually simulates a full blown series which is not that common nowadays. GT3 cars are already in the game, GT4 cars are coming this summer (2020). Game is in good shape already (may 2020) and the devs are really pushing improvements and new content at a rapid pace and take the community feedback into consideration, which is nice to see.

All the tracks in the game are laser scanned and their presentation is absolutely top-notch (better than iRacing or rF2).

Presentation/UX wise it's no Gran Turismo Sport, but in general it is very workable and usable. The graphics are spectacular, but to unlock the full potential u really need a beefy PC, however on a RX570 8GB and a i5 3470 playing online races with 50 cars on track 1080p mid/low settings gives me 55-95fps. It's just that u really have to be willing to sacrifice some effects and graphic intensive options like volumetric fog etc.

Sounds like engine noise or track side audio are class leading.

Tyre model can be matched only maybe by rF2 although my understanding is ACC has better physics simulation in general (aero, chassis flex). This game has dynamic weather which works very well and doesn't feel exagarated or cartoony (looking at u PC2). Running long MP races in random weather is a blast, cause it introduces uncertainty in strategy. The tyres both slick and wets react to the weather conditions accordingly. In general the impressions while driving are exilarating and very immersive.

MP races are fun too - open lobbys have the usual di*khead behaviour problem (but thats as*holes for ya), but there are also Competition races which are on a time schedule and are more serious/clean. There's plenty of league races as well and those are the most fun (u get to know the people around u and after a while u can gage ur own progress by comparing ur results with the others).

- Physic is excellent, even with contact in online racing now. Before the update online contact was meh.

Cons: honestly I can't think of many
- Can be demanding on PC spec. Had a PC with GTX960 and i5-4460, frame rate in single player with 10+ AI was bad. Now I upgraded to a PC with RTX2060 and i5-9400F, things are running smoothly.

It's Blancpain GT only. Also it has DLC content, which would be OK if base game had more content, but a huge NO in this case.

Graphics: 3/10 — it sux badly on my 720p beamer, it's soapy, blurry, despite everything is maxed out. Only cool thing about graphics is how sunlight playing on dash. Camera views is eehhh, I didn't liked any. PC2 has good camera views. Yes, this is simulator, but I don't feel cars, I don't feel speed. It's boring. Force feedback is 6/10: not informative, but not interfering with car. UI is ugly.

Graphics could be better but is satisfactory. But overall , it's incomplete. There are only 15 cars. There are only 11 tracks.  The online experience is abysmal. If you are looking for a good online experience, this is not the game for you. 

With all the hype surrounding this game I expected wayyyy more than what is provided. Under no circumanstance would I recommend this game at $55 with DLC. $20 maybe. MAYBE.

Surely there are a few things which any of the aforementioned games make better - like online modes in iracing or variety of cars/tracks in RRE/PC2 but the core - the actual feeling that you are driving a race car - is unrivaled in my opinion. Even as a below average driver I can feel why the car behaves the way it does, even what the tyres are doing (simulated flat spots, graining and more) In iracing for example I could never really get the hang of it, it feels like they make the driving and control of the carst difficult on purpose.

Sounds and graphics are beautiful.

In addition to that the Developers are very passionated and open about the game. Really recommend Aris' streams, I learned not only about all the simulations going on in the game but things about race car setups and their behaviour in general.
Devs are actively driving/streaming in events like the 12h race today.

TL/DR : I 100% recommend ACC for anyone who wishes to drive the most advanced GT3 (and Gt4 soon!) cars in the world, as close to reality as possible. 

## What I like : 
-The graphics are sublime.
-The weather effects, especially in the wet, it looks and feels so right.
-The physics and attention to detail in the simulation is quite astonishing : the suspension behaviour, tyre model and the feel of the car when flexing and bouncing is just great. Overall this game has the best physics of any racing sim I have ever played. 
-The look of the cars, the look of the circuits, the scenery (Mount Panorama looks AMAZING), it all looks extremely good.

## What I don't like :
Honestly there isn't much I don't like about the game, or at least that I dislike enough to make a big deal out of it. Of course the game can get several improvements especially in the ''ease of use'' and general quality of life improvements : 
-Letting co-drivers change the set-up and pit stop strategy while the other co-driver is in the car. 
-Add vote to kick in MP (I believe it's coming soon)
-Maybe have some more ''user friendly'' UI when selecting custom set ups and so, sometimes I get confused as to which set up is loaded in the car but maybe it's me. 

## What I love : 
The community. The guys over at Kunos are absolute legends, they love racing more than anything and you can feel this in the game. Aristotelis and the entire Kunos team make a superb job keeping the game up to date, bringing new features we never knew we needed to the game, and just being great with the community. The update posts on the forum, the videos, the events etc it all makes you feel like you're part of a great community. 

Thank you Kunos Simulazioni.

51,59248258,english,"Update April 2020: From a VR perspective... after months of tweaking/game updates managed to get 90 fps with the latest release but at the expense of visual clarity/fidelity especially with other cars on track.... unfortunately it is still not on par with ac, rfactor2, automobilista 2 & iracing for a crisp, continuous 90fps stutter free experience. 
It is apparent that this game is limited by current graphics card tech. Reckon it will shine in VR with the next generation graphics cards... the rtx 30xx series. 

However... all this is pointless until they fix the limp/ poor excuse of ffb...
In real racing, the seat butt/entire body feels the g-forces generated and provide sensory information a driver reacts to... In sim racing, there is no seat of the pants/g-forces that provide sensory input all this has to be delivered through the wheel. rfactor 2 is the gold standard when it comes to this closely followed by Assetto Corsa and iRacing.


Update Feb 2020: slightly better vr performance but still terrible compared to assetto corsa or rfactor2
The ffb is a joke... feels like driving a loaf of bread.:

VR performance is awful with RTX 2080ti & i79700K..... there are far better VR racing experiences out there.
Still harbor hope that  Kunos will fix.
ffb is terrible

- Career mode

- Few cars
- Few tracks
- Poor multiplayer
- Custom MODS not available like the older AC
- DLC's available

NOT TESTED:
- VR

is ACC a SIM or SIMCADE  game?
ACC is a SIM game, If you just want to pick up your xbox controller and play a more casual game, go for Forza Horizon or Grand Turismo Sport!

CONCLUSION ( ---> MY OPINION <<<--) :
As a SIM game. ACC is a good and cheap option, better than the Project Cars 2 and the previous AC. The gameplay using my Logitech G920 wheel was very good indeed, but it has a poor multiplayer and a very limited content. If you can afford a very expensive game and want a lot of tracks, cars and a better multiplayer experience, go for iRacing.

Sim racers know that I-racing and R Factor 2 are probably two of the best sims around and I believe ACC is right up there with them now. Competizione is a massive evolution from Assetto Corsa. The driving physics are I-Racing quality, the cars feel responsive and predictable giving you confidence to push. In other sims like Project Cars, Automobilista and especially in F1 2019, the cars feel light and twitchy but the cars in ACC just feel planted and more under control. You can feel were the limits of grip are and you can easily feel when the car wants to let go and you can if needs be recover a slide effectively. The driving feels great, the simulation experience is second to none in ACC. The graphics are impressive, the best visuals I have seen in a sim since GT Sport and F1 2019. The developers have made a stunning looking game with the Unreal Engine. The car engine sounds and external sounds are awesome, you hear every rumble strip, bump, exhaust pop, internal creek and groan, playing this game with headphones on is a brilliant experience. I was impressed with the collection of tracks on show which include must haves like Monza, Spa and Silverstone but also tracks like Zandvoort, Misano and Paul Ricard which are rarely seen in racing sims.

All other gameplay features are spot on but the game isn't without fault. The career is dull and not very long, you just do practice, qualifying and race at each track with no cutscenes or storyline. A little disappointing but multiplayer and custom races is what ACC is all about so a lacklustre career mode isn't a big issue. Don't go in expecting a Gran Turismo single player experience except I-racing but with more polish. You only have one category of cars to race, Blancpain GT championship cars. Every car is brilliant to drive and look at plus each car feels distinct enough to keep the driving experience feeling fresh. Every car and driver are officially licensed so you are getting the definitive Blancpain GT championship experience. The multiplayer lobby menu is a bit confusing at first and finding a race can be tricky but you do get the hang of it eventually. The game UI isn't great but does the job. I have experienced a couple of game crashes while in menu screens, the game just wouldn't respond even though the game was still visible. A quick game restart and everything worked fine again.

ACC is a must buy for any gamer who likes sim racing. I-racing is the gold standard and ACC is just as good in my opinion. It looks and plays brilliantly and even though it doesn't have loads of cars and tracks like in I-racing it does have a great amount of quality content for the price of a few cars in I-racing.",1559278131,1586146389,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198127291795,221,27,4340,0,1322,1590261813

How in the world can you do all of that hard work, and then drop the ball on the small stuff? It eludes me, so enlighten me please.

1. Car setups. Why is there no in-game info that we can use for education and reference when setting up a car? Why is it left for us to hunt on the internet finding forums that may or may not answer our questions? Brake Pad numbers, fuel map numbers, tire info starting at 3.00??, all numbers with no reference for me to go off of. Didn't know what pads or maps did what for the Porsche until I stumbled across it online. How can you dev. such a game and leave out critical info?

2. Competition Servers. Let's just focus on the low hanging fruit, like a schedule........ Once again how is it not in the game, how is it left for us to turn back to old forums to find out when there might be a competition server that we can plan on entering. I mean this is softball stuff here, How can you dev. such a game and leave out critical info?

The fix for both of these is so simple, just add text! That's it! You've created this title, you have the information at hand, why hold it so close? Why make a community search for the info that you readily have? 

Seriously, after all of the hard work put into dev'ing this, adding text info is a layup, its a gimmie. It's a couple hour job tops. I feel like a teacher, and one of my students just spent countless hours on an assignment and then turned it in and forgot to put their name on the paper. How could you do so much work, and then miss the mark because of something so trivial? Baffled. Bewildered. Confused. 

I'd like to think that these issues will be resolved before it hits consoles. Or do you expect the console world to spend hours searching for info to play the game. Because they won't.

Multiplayer seems good. I've had some great races online without too much hassle although there could be more penalty for bad driving.
I also think that the tighter focus on just GT3 cars means that you are more likely to find a full multiplayer race. Project CARS always seemed to be a million servers with different classes with just one person in each.

Bad points:
In career mode the race parameters aren't clear. It doesn't tell you that you're going to be doing a pit stop and what to do in the pit stop. If there was any sort of manual this would be acceptable but there doesn't seem to be anything I can find.
The rating system also isn't obvious. The competition server is initially not available until your rating is high enough but the ratings shown on screen don't seem to tie up. Again a decent manual would help with this.

In fact, I can't wrap my head around simracing influencers who support this title.  It just doesn't add up.  The game looks fuzzy on screen even with hours and days of research and tweaking, so please don't message me about how to try and fix it, as only games I own and play are simracing and racing games, so I've done this once or twice.  And it's the same with VR, physics, racing in the rain, and force feedback.  If you don't believe me, just jump into any other sim and then use this one, and then try being honest with yourself.  I can honestly say I wasted my money on this one, and I'm not too thrilled about it.  But now that I have it I'll probably play it to remind myself of why other sims are better.  Here is to hoping GT4's have some feel to them.
 
I should add that I bought this game based on Kunos' resume.  Assetto Corsa was and still is the best racing sim ever.  But that is largely due to being able to moddify it.

4,65296153,english,"I want to try to make this a semi-serious review, so here goes.

First of all, force feedback is good. It's not as strong as in iRacing, but it's definitely detailed. You can feel when the car is losing it, as well as know almost immediately how much more/less you can turn in. It also responds extremely well to road/curb/off-road details, so you know right away when you've breached the line between the gravel and the road.

The game doesn't forgive serious mistakes, as it should be. If you go off, you're losing heaps of time, period. The flip side to this is that it makes it easy for anyone with a decent wheel and pedal setup to learn the handling model quickly, as well as learn how to drive certain tracks. Which, speaking of, the handling model is lovely. It's easy to control the car, easy to tell where the limit is and when you've overstepped it.

Right from the start - pick any track and any car, and you're greeted with a setup menu that gives you three baselines to work with - Safe, Aggressive, and Wet. It's very easy to get going with the safe setup; while it's not very competitive, it's decent enough to learn the track. The aggressive setup is much quicker; that being said, it's also much more difficult to run consistently without making mistakes. And the wet setup, obviously, is to be driven in the wet. I appreciate how simple it is for someone who's just started playing the game to hop in and drive, as well as offering enough complexity for someone who knows what they're doing to be able to fine tune the car to their driving style.

I might not be able to give the most detailed opinion, as I'm only starting to seriously dive into sim-racing (I've played more F1 than anything), but I can assure anyone just getting into it that Assetto Corsa Competizione is a great place to start. I highly recommend it if you're just now beginning to learn the ropes of the genre.",1584573725,1584573725,True,2,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False,76561198081402444,51,3,4252,0,276,1596575809

Edit at 03.03.2020
The game went some way from an Early Access Game for 40€ to a small game for 55€. The recent UI updates were very needed. Still the Search Lobby Screen is very very basic. The rolling starts were nonsense before and works ok now. The way this game drivers changed a lot over time.  Some things like kerb behavior were improved, on the other hand, the driving became quite dull. Behavior on throttle was really intuitive within medium side slip angles before, now it’s more of an on/off behavior. Drifing is not within the capabilities of this tire engine, in real life GT3 and Gt4 cars can drift perfectly well you like to. The FFB can get numb in certain driving situations st the limit which is just unpleasant and makes no sense as it's a unpleasent rear axis effect. 
The optics of the game is rather poor for me. Not that things look ugly, that’s not the case but this game gives me the biggest problems to read the distance signs. If I’m not able to read it properly, the visuals are not great.  

Bottom line, it's okay but still feels like a small product and does not offer much for 55 €",1559154199,1583204170,False,5,0,0.477593392133712769,0,True,False,False,76561197960529895,102,4,10494,0,91,1594130685

66,50143324,english,"[update at release] Steam reviewers are the biggest bunch of whining babies.  They love to tank a game's reviews just because of one little ""insult"" they can't forgive.  This time, everybody is mad because they expected something which Kunos [b]never[/b] claimed the sim would have.  Would scheduled races be nice?  Sure.  Is it worthless without them?  Nope.  The rating and matchmaking systems will become more effective as people spend more time with the sim.  Your experience with Early Access multiplayer means very little.  Even if you think it should have had scheduled races, the value that's included for the price of purchase is far beyond what any other sim offers. [/update] 

[h1]This purchase is a no-brainer for any sim racer.  Full stop.[/h1]  Whether that applies to you depends on your definition of ""sim racer,"" and whether you include yourself in that group.  

I could go on and on about all of the reasons why I think ACC is and will be the best racing sim ever.  If you have specific questions I can answer in the comments.  But mostly I want to recommend reading the blogs about the driver rating systems: (PART 1 https://www.assettocorsa.net/forum/index.php?threads/the-acc-rating-system-part-i-we-want-to-help-you-improve.50766/ )  (Part 2 https://www.assettocorsa.net/forum/index.php?threads/the-acc-rating-system-part-ii-long-version.51975/ )

Basically, those blogs offer brilliant solutions for every major complaint I've ever had (or heard) about iRacing.  

The tracks are laser-scanned, the cars and physics are on par with iRacing (if not better), and the driver ratings are genius.  

To make a brief comparison of the physics, iRacing makes the car feel very light and forgiving compared to ACC.  With ACC, you feel the weight of the car, and the effect it has on your traction.  The end result is that I have to be much more precise with my inputs, and much more conscious of all the factors that influence traction.  A few people complain that it ""doesn't feel realistic,"" but they're actually complaining that it isn't as easy as other sims they've played.  

With iRacing, I am able to get away with things that probably should have caused me to lose control.  And overall it's too easy to go fast, especially in cold temps.  It's surprising for myself to say that because I thought iRacing was BRUTAL when I first started about 3 years ago.  But I've learned many things since then, and ACC simply feels more true to life.  Comparing lap times at Nurburgring GP - in iRacing I can do 1:50-51 pretty easily in a GT3 car, maybe even 1:49 with quali fuel.  In ACC, I think the best I've done is 1:55, maybe 1:54 in ideal conditions.  I don't have the real life GT3 experience to compare with, but that seems about right to me.  I probably shouldn't be able to do lap times within 1-2 seconds of IRL professionals (though I'd love to believe I'm just that good).   

So again, for any sim racer this is a no-brainer.  For gamers with gamepads, I'm not sure I would recommend.  And that's not meant to be an insult, I just want to be clear that this is not at all like a Forza or Gran Turismo.

Why? Most people drive with respect and try to uphold the important foundation of racing, that its a no-contact sport. And in this game its easy to see why, noone benefits from contact, both parties get a penalty or their safety rating and most probably take crippling damage and/or spin out and are out of contest for the race. 
This game teaches you to act like an actual race driver, the thrill comes from finishing the race and overtaking people cleanly, close racing where you try your outmost to not hit anyone. 

On top of that you have a penalty system that actually tries to simulate real life and it does it quite well. No comparison to the likes of Gran Tourismo Sport where the slightest touches or going offtrack give you several seconds penalty. Here you get warnings for exceeding track limits or Drive-Through penalties when you screw up the rolling start (just like in real life racing). It feels a lot more natural and fair.

Its also better than I-Racing in my books since you dont have to fork out laughable amounts of money to play all the content of the sim, essentially playing a f2p title where you buy content licenses... 
ACC is a sim at heart, but its also a game, and as such it is accessible enough to get into it if you have basic understanding or experience of simulated racing.

Every car feels unique to drive. You can really tell the difference with different cars. Balance of cars are modelled really nice in this sim. You have to use trail braking and other ""real life"" racing techniques to get the most out of the car. 
Sounds of the game are also one of the best out there in racing sims. 

Immersion is great in VR. But the performance in VR is not so good. That is the biggest minus of the game. Its gotten a lot better with updates, But its still not perfect. 
I have quite good system with Ryzen 9 3900x, RTX2070, 16GB ddr4 with Valve Index. And i have to play a lot with settings to make the game run good enough in VR. 

Overall the sim is one of the best out there right now. But if you want to play it in VR, you need really high end PC to run the game properly. I hope Kunos can optimize the game further in the future.

You need a rather new pc in order to play it with reasonable performance, but if you do, its the prettiest racing sim out there.
And not only the prettiest, with its night and day transitions or wet weather effects - it is also the most realistic sim in the market.
Since I started playing ACC, I havent gone back to AC or iR, which I was maining before.
It is THAT good. 

If you like GT3 racing, this is the sim for you. 

Pro's:
- incredibly immersive (sounds, looks)
- best physics of any sim (real GT3 drivers approved the handling of their cars)
- rather inexpensive (DLC with 4 tracks for only 15 bucks, thats pretty great value)
- Competition races are actually competitive, so you get scheduled races with great driving standards and racers around your pace guaranteed!
- great accuracy of the tracks
- best off track penalty system of the market 
(you have 3 off tracks before you get a drive through penalty, but only when you actually gain time by going off track.)

Con's:
- only GT3 cars and two cup cars (911 GT3 Cup, Huracan ST) 
- poor performance optimisation, so VR users might suffer as well as users with older pc specs. This game requires reasonably new and potent pc parts in order to perform well.",1582131708,1582131708,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198102963564,17,1,13680,0,11327,1600559448

I am astounded at how little control you have once you start to slide and at what slow speeds a lambo starts to slide.  I am by no means a pro driver, but I do track a 911 and have a good idea when you are pushing it around a turn and these cars are like my car  on a wet track or worse.  Part of it is the lack of sense of speed, but there is no way you should have this little grip.  I record what speeds it happens and in what kind of turn then try it with my car.  There is no way my track tires (track, but not slicks) and Porsche 997 C4 should be able to stick much better than a lambo.  Not once in game have I been able to let off the throttle and give a little counter steer once I sense a loose back end to bring the car back, yet in real life I have yet to spin with this strategy.

From an audio standpoint it is head over heels better then AC, the sounds of the cars and racing is reminds me of standing track side at the Long Beach Grand Prix. AC had mediocre sounds well behind a few other racing sims and ACC catches those passing some up on its way to the top. 

Performance wise the game is a better heavier to run then AC which has hurt the game when it comes to VR and is likely the reason why ray tracing seems to have been dropped. Vehicles are graphically on par with AC though everything else is a step up from AC.

Driving the cars really makes everything come to life as the cars feel like they have more weight to them then they did in AC. The combination of audio and graphics just hits the right spots for me, and the ai is worlds better currently then it was with AC. Where as in AC the racing against ai was clean if you pretty much had a single make race or single class race there were still problems of sometimes being crashed into ai. Through in a bunch of different vehicles and things really fall apart, in ACC maybe because everything is a GT3 it was easier to program the ai. I can race against the ai and actually have them give me space in corners, there use to be a problem where having ai a good deal slower then you caused crashes though that issue seems to be gone now. 

If you love modern GT3 race cars then I would say 100% buy this game though take note that if VR is a make or break feature then maybe pass on this title. I don't see that changing as unreal engine is unreal engine and I don't see huge changes in performance for the game, either wait for newer and more powerful GPUs to run VR or pass.

The new update in February of this year has made one of the best games almost perfect besides some menu navigation issues. This is now, hands down, the best racing simulator ever. This is not an easy game, in fact the difficulty is what makes the game great. The smallest changes to environment or car makes you spend hours chasing that 2 tenths. You can feel every element of the road and car unlike any other simulator. You find yourself trading sharp turn in for grip on an exit that has a bump. Every corner in the game had its own strategies and you need to learn how to race them for passing, for exit speed, for trap time, outside and inside lines, all are different and all require a different technique. Each car has its own quirks and advantages and disadvantages. I HIGHLY recommend not combing through the internet looking for good setups, but rather learning the car and your driving style from scratch.  You need this to adapt to a changing car throughout the race, particularly when setting up a pitstop to change characteristics of the car. I watched Aris.drives on youtube who is a developer for the game and you will learn all you need to know.

The competition in this game is very polite and while there will be missed braking points in traffic, the racing is usually very good and finding a race is no problem. 

I Didn't think I'd like GT3 racing and it's always been a series I never even played since formula racing was faster but when you get your car into that groove and keep finding ways to eek out a tenth on a corner, the game is highly addictive. At the end of the day, realism is what will draw me to a game. When you run a second and a half slower because you used up your tires cooking all the corners like a hero... THAT'S what I'm after.

 Really there are too many things to list that I like about this game but I will list some cons;
1) I am not aware of disqualifications until after the race in single player
2) The setup menu requires the ""back"" button rather than a ""confirm"" button which is confusing
3) the setup menu in car is a little clunky and hard to navigate when in a race. (This may be a learning curve issue)
4) I'm not crazy about getting a warning when someone hits me when they make a mistake. I understand when blocking is involved but it could use a little work to not ding me when I'm as far over as possible but can't get out of the way

It can have a terrible first impression, but it really grows.

Certainly a BRUTE, when it comes to software polishing. This is a game that I've hustled the most to get it going nicely in performance.

But........damn! The physics are spot on for what you can feel on real life GT3 races onboard broadcast and the sounds are magnificent in comparison to the digital overload of Assetto Corsa. People say it is the best GT3 sim on the market, you can see that brilliance in the game here and there.

All tracks seems to be laser scanned. Which is glorious. Maybe even the cars are laser scanned. The level of detail is in line with Assetto Corsa.

The UE4 engine is where the weaknesses starts to appear in this. Make sure you have some graphics not on the lowest or the game will look really bad... but in other hand, this is the most graphically advanced racing sim out there. What has marketed Project Cars games, ACC does better, but no photomode afaik. :c (F7 key does wonders though. Use middle mouse to show camera controls :))

This is not for the impatient and if you plan to play with a pad, you need to have a long sit through and tweak it out the different steering values. If you're going with a wheel, you will find an ocean of wheel support and pedals and configurations as the sim was made for.

This is not for the IMPATIENT (AGAIN!!!)... because you need to learn (if you haven't already with AC) to drive safely and respecting your competitors!

It is an endurance focused simulation and not a 3 lap stint blazing all four wheels and drifting every corner. Learn to drive. Smooth it out your aggression. Have a wonderful race with other people who also loves motorsports.

5,59671438,english,"ACC could be a very good simulation but it is just a pretty good GAME.

When they fix FFB, let me know and MAYBE I'll change my mind but so far, this game fails at the most important point : you don't feel the car.

And don't even try to explain that it is due to my settings or my hardware, there is close to no setting to play with and I have surely the top of every hardware you can find when dealing with simracing, not to mention I play real sims, like rFactor 2, Automobilista and iRacing for instance.

For people who want to DRIVE and not to PLAY, ACC is not what you are looking for.


EDIT : added comments allowed, didn't even know there was an option to disable them (that is on by default, cool).

I read comments and reviews about ACC and I'm really surprised...some people are telling so stupid things it is not even funny :

- to all that dare to say ACC is ""the best sim ever"" (yeah, there are some) : I hope you are joking...try rFactor 2 for example and come back to modify your comment as soon as you can...

- ACC is better than A, B or C : it is just your opinion, educated or not. There are some aspects in which ACC excells (graphics, sounds are coming to my mind) but they are not the best out there and really, those aspects aren't crucial for a simulation (don't get me wrong, they are important for immersion but not the most important). Other aspects are not good enough or even a complete failure (FFB, physics, AI, tyre model)

- Dealing with FFB, once again, it lacks way too much information, you can't feel the car, which is BY FAR the most important problem of ACC.

- AI : the worst I've seen, period. Even the brand new AI in iRacing is way better.

- Tyre Model : seriously, 5 points of contact to check what should happen ? rFactor 2 have something like 30x30 (900) contact points...rFactor 2 is by very far the best tyre model of all simulations, plain and simple.

- Physics : they are OK but not great, cars have strange behaviour under certain circumstances but not a game killer, I admit. Some other games are way worse.

- Online : must be a joke, there is no real online mode, like with rFactor 2 (for the moment). iRacing is the only one with real online mode, no wonder why it is the best simulation for competitive simracing...actually, it is the only one.

I won't affirm rFactor 2, iRacing or Automobilista are better than ACC, I just encourage everybody to check by themselves. Sure ACC have its strong points and even an interest but it is not the best sim you can find, clearly not. Stating the opposite is proof you didn't try other sims.


[EDIT] Last bunch of updates made me reconsider my review, not really for what was added but because it just broke my previous settings, which forces me to recreate all setups (I mean mostly FFB ones) and it appears that because I was playing since first stage of alpha, I kept some configurations that were causing issues. Now, when set up correctly, I feel much better the car, slides, limits, etc...and yes, the game is now enjoyable, quite good actually.

From all the simulators I have tried, Competizione offers the best driving experience when using a steering wheel. The driving physics and force feedback are the best in class.

Currently, the game needs many quality of life improvements such as improved client stability, netcode, and matchmaking. Although the selection of cars and tracks is fairly limited, it offers a focused repertoire of high quality cars and tracks.

I recommend this game for steering wheel users looking for a hardcore and challenging experience. For those looking for a polished experience, I recommend waiting for a few updates. For those looking for an iRacing replacement without subscription fees, this could be it.

This new update and DLC has changed a lot for me. I really like it now and it might even rival Iracing GT3's. Dont get me wrong. It still runs like shit but at least the FFB is better now.


Old review:

I want to like this game but I just can't...

-It took them a year to introduce triple monitor support which is a must in any competitive racing game.
-the online racing is still chaos because anyone can join your race lobbies, A system like Iracing's would do wonders.
-performance is just plain bad: I run a GTX1080ti and a oc'd 8700k and on the lowest settings 7860x1440 I only get 60-70 FPS compare this to Iracing (albeit  much less eyecandy) with medium to high settings from 100-150 FPS with 50 cars on track all rendered.
-FFB on a direct drive wheel is poor.

other than that the sound design is very good, the tracks and cars look nice and the career mode is fun to play.
Maybe in a couple of updates I can give this a thumbs up!",1577017072,1581100479,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198065786781,208,19,620,0,205,1589474681

After finding out that Mount Panorama Bathurst was coming to ACC I thought I would jump back in for another go. Turns out the new tracks, Bathurst in particular are pretty good and the game seems to have come a long way even from its initial release. 

There are some things remaining that aren't right such as graphical glitches where the wheel rotation doesn't match the actual road speed, the rear view mirrors don't display correctly and the overall world detail could be better. Also the fact that its still not DX12 or even Ray Tracing as initially promised are further disappointments.. 
And where is the mirror adjustment? This couldn't be that hard to implement as it was done so in AC from private developers.. 

The vehicle physics are now feeling better as it would have taken time to tune the Unreal engine properly for car racing and I commend the devs efforts. Its definitely not up to iRacing or rFactor2 levels of realism but its good enough for the moment. I guess the advantage Kunos have is that the game is based around a single type of racing (being GT3) so there doesn't need to be that range of flexibility from the game engine. Do I still think they shouldn't have gone with the Unreal engine? yes I do but I do understand the other advantages of using it with its advanced features which the AC engine lacked or would have been difficult or time consuming to develop in to. 

So at this time I am enjoying using this game and hopefully more bugs are ironed out and more features added.

Old review below..

Given that the title is still in early stages of development I have to say I think its a bit of a step in the wrong direction or even backwards to be perfectly honest.. Yes it took a number of years and continued updates to bring Assetto Corsa up to the high standard that it is but the current state of ACC seems like they have started completely from scratch or this is their first ever racing title..
Until the game is much further into its development, I'm not yet convinced that moving to the Unreal engine was the ideal move. I feel that in order for Kunos to add time progression and weather effects that they took a major short cut using Unreal than further developing/evolving their existing game engine from AC. I guess we can only wait and see how things pan out closer to release. Of course I am hoping that it does work out well.

Thoughts upon final release..

Well to begin with I don't use VR and the fact there is no Track IR support at all or in the foreseeable future means this is a no play for me and I will be uninstalling it.
Next the handling.. the cars feel very wooden and lifeless and the tires feel stiff as if there is no flex in the carcass. 
The setup options are vague and difficult to understand in order to properly make effective changes. 
The menu system is just awful and feels like its been pulled straight from a gaming console.

On the positive side of things the cars sound good, the graphics are ok but no DX12 support is quite disappointing especially for such a late release title. And the fact there is no triple screen support so we still limited to a narrow field of view unless you buy an expensive super wide screen.

The game is still buggy and crashes intermittently. It desperately needs VR improved, TrackIR and triple screen support. And the ability to disable the driver rating system.

Do I recommend this game? Absolutely not. Go drive in AC, rFactor2 or iRacing which the latter two are vastly superior on multiple levels.",1544051374,1581038437,True,0,0,0.439254403114318848,0,True,False,True,76561197992989471,50,6,2037,0,75,1595570683

50,61261810,english,"Very noticeable improvement but these DLC content has to stop and should be included in the base game. The game doesn't have enough content to begin with. Too many games are now purposely witholding content or developing it way past their deadline ultimately using this as an excuse to charge for DLC or ""bonus"" packs which should have been included in the base game.

Sorry, but the latest content packs should be included in the base game as the game in itself is seriously lacking. Come on, seriously, you think the average gamer will not notice this? This type of greedy marketing ploy can do more harm than good as it leaves those who do NOT purchase the so called ""extra"" content be missing out on the full experience the title has to offer.

The game should be continuously supported / upgraded with in game credits. This is fair and gives incentive for the player to continue to play this game for months and years to come.

Seriously just analyze and look at the amount of content that is released now compared to games from before? If you purchase a game, the buyer would expect a more or less complete product as games are not cheap to purchase these days. 

I wouldn't consider cars and tracks a real ""add-on"". Just look at titles like GT Sport, they constantly provide updates and new content every month keeping things fresh (new tracks, new cars, fixes, new features) and they don't CHARGE for DLC like this.

The curbs aren't as bad as they were before, but still bad enough for me to avoid certain tracks. The input lag is still two to three times that of R3E and AMS. Unreal Engine sucks hard. You have to have a relatively fast computer to get 60 FPS with medium/low settings. Then the game doesn't look a lot better than the aforementioned ones which don't require as much computing power. AMS will run on a potato!

Other than on curbs, the cars handle in the ballpark of how they should. The DLC price is very low. If you've already purchased the game, it's still worth getting it, even with the problems.

I'm using a WMR device and I have two HUD/menu options. 1: Have it follow your head movements and perenially be unable to see the corners. 2: Have it stationary, but way too low. Like below the floors low. Moving it doesn't work; it just won't move that far. And you can't use the mouse on the menus in VR.

Another issue is that if you exit the game, it stays running in Steam, even though I can find no process active for it. This is the only game I experience this on. The only way to ""stop"" it is to restart Steam.

These issues means I've not spent much time doing any driving in ACC; it's mostly been getting frustrated at the terrible VR implementation and trying settings out.

I know it's early access, I know things aren't finished. But the VR experience hasn't changed or improved since it was introduced and is broken to the point of making the game unplayable. 

Edit: I have since found that if I uninstall and then re-install ACC, VR works. But only once, and now with the latest hotfix, it won't load at all after that initial once until I uninstall and re-install.

Edit of the edit: The VR still sucks. It's not as bad as it was, but it's still not great. However, the rest of the game has come alive since coming out of early access.

Yes, the career mode is (still) lacking compared to other titles, but you will learn a lot.
Each car and track configuration will give you a new challenge.
No, there aren't as many cars since the focus is the GT series.

But if you enjoy racing games you need to try it.
You want to race multiplayer? Great. Don't need to buy anything else, no extra track, no extra car, don't need to worry if you know how to drive that class of car. And that is a good thing.
You can focus on that car, learn it and get your best time completely wrecked by someone better than you...and then get wrecked by people until you get a better rating yourself.

Oh yes, the multiplayer is fun at lower racing level, but once you go up it's a whole new game.
Just remember that like 100% of racing games, your first races will have a lot of idiots ramming you and spinning all over the place. But that changes once your rating improves, which requires you to finish the darn race, last place or not. I mean, it's a simulator, so don't just rage quit.

The sound has massively been improved since the original Assetto Corsa and is a treat to the ears, the physics and FBB make each car a delight to drive and how the cars feel when the dynamic weather decides to fill the track with rain will put a smile on your face for sure!

To me driving is super fun once you get the hang of it. You wont in the first 15 minutes but after an hour on a track this game is just an extraordinary amount of fun. Assetto Corsa Competitzione is focused on one thing and one thing only and to say it does this really really well is an understatement. it does it phenomenally.  
One drawback of this game is that you need a wheel to properly enjoy it so its not cheap to get the wheel in the first place but once you do have that i think for what this game offers its extremely fairly priced. 
A second drawback is the online system its if you look for it im certain you can find good clean racing but you cant just jump in on any random evening and expect to see good racing on public lobbies.(thats any racing game tbh) There is a safety rating system but most servers have it set quite high so if you do get into one of those servers you will basically just find aliens.

43,62837207,english,"I have a Rift CV1, R9 3950X, RTX 2070, and a 1080p monitor.

I'm not sure what people are talking about with the VR implementation being bad. I have this game near max settings and it runs great. I think every now and then the framerate drops slightly, but I honestly can barely even notice it unless I'm looking for it. 

The only immediate issues are two things:

- There appears to be an odd ghosting/reverb visual effect on other cars when you're going around corner. You can also kind of see it if you're watching cars in a replay.
- I haven't tried it with OBS, but using Discord Live Streaming, 1080p60 is kinda impossible as it causes stutters in game, but I chalk this up to just having an RTX 2070, or maybe Discord uses one CPU thread and it's clashing? I'm not sure, but 720p60 worked well.

Other than that, it is a great game. The immersion in terms of race logic, callouts, visuals, etc. from the original Assetto Corsa is insane, and the dynamic weather is really cool. The only regret I have is not having a valve index to have more clarity, but so far, I can see pretty much all the dash items like fuel and what not, so it's not a big issue.

I was inspired to get this game because of Jimmy Broadbent and SuperGT. I am looking forward to learning more about managing tires and fuel, pitstop strategies, as well as race logic/etiquette.

-------------------------------------------
Edit:

I did do some tweaking to get this to play well with OBS, and it turns out I was actually hitting probably about 60-80 FPS the whole time. After lowering most of the settings to medium/high it now stays pinned at 90 FPS.

Oh boy, it is so smooth. It still looks pretty great too. Obviously there is some small details and clarity lost (since I did lower the anti-aliasing and render resolution slightly), but it still retains most of the detail and the depth of field is there.

I'll have to go into the rain with multiple cars and really test it.

-------------------------------------------
Edit 2: 

So I finally got around to working with some settings that still look good, but don't compromise too much performance. These settings I currently use with Oculus Mirror so I can also record my game with the overlays and not have it look like crap, so I'll include those settings too.

Right now, the only dropped frames I am getting are at night on the first 3 turns of Nürburgring, regardless of rain. I think this might be due to my shadows being on high (since I want the better interior shadows), but I may sacrifice that if needed. 

Also, the frame drops are only with Oculus Mirror open. I haven't tested with it closed in a race, but the usage without the mirror open in the Oculus home menu increases the Performance headroom from about 45% to 70-80%.

PC Specs:

- Ryzen 9 3950X @ 4.3 Ghz (ACC assigned to threads 8,10,12,14 with Process Lasso)
- NZXT X52 240mm AIO w/ Arctic Silver 5 Thermal Paste
- Zotac Mini RTX 2070
- 32 GB Corsair Vengeance LPX 3000 Mhz CL15
- ASRock X570M Pro4
- Samsung 840 Evo 500 GB (Boot)
- Crucial P1 1TB (Game)

Equipment:

- Oculus Rift CV1
- Logitech G29

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Enable Asynchronous Spacewarp:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Asynchronous Spacewarp limits the FPS of your game to half of the headset (45 FPS in my case with the CV1, probably 40 FPS with the Rift S). It then interpolates frames to give you a smooth 90 Hz output without needing to actually push 90 FPS.

There is slight ghosting artifacts, but you can't really see them unless you look for them. Also, I'm pretty sure the Mirror is running at 45 FPS, which honestly looks pretty smooth. This enabled me to lower my OBS FPS from 60 FPS to 50 FPS to allow more time to render per frame, reducing the number of dropped frames (if any).

To enable it:

- Navigate to ""C:\Program Files\Oculus\Support\oculus-diagnostics"".
- Open ""OculusDebugTool""
- Once opened, locate ""Asynchronous Spacewarp"" and set it to ""Force 45 FPS, ASW enabled"".
- If you have a Rift S, it might say ""40 FPS"" instead of ""45 FPS"". This is correct since the Rift S has a refresh rate of 80 Hz.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Oculus Mirror Launch Options:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I suggest pinning the Oculus Mirror to the taskbar or to your desktop. Instead of writing a Batch script, you can just set the launch options in the properties.

- Right click on the shortcut (also, right click on the exe if you right clicked the taskbar)
- Click ""Properties""
- For the ""Target"" field, you should see something like ""C:\Program Files\Oculus\Support\oculus-diagnostics\OculusMirror.exe""
- Replace it with the text between the arrows: >""C:\Program Files\Oculus\Support\oculus-diagnostics\OculusMirror.exe""  --Size 1480 1080 --FovTanAngleMultiplier 1.2 1.2 --RightEyeOnly --DisableFovStencil<
- Once you're done, press ""Apply"" and then ""OK"". Now opening the Mirror should net you a pretty clean and wide FOV without too much performance loss (compared to the 25% extra pixel density of 1920x1080).

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ACC Video Settings:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

First of all, the game is launched in Oculus VR mode, not in Steam VR mode. I attemped with Steam VR and it causes stuttering when you try to use their Smoothing (Async. Space Warp equivalent in Oculus Diagnostics).

61,50953876,english,"Edit After 1.2.3
Have given up on VR for this title - I still do not recommend it if your primary use is VR.  

However I have changed the rating to recommended for non VR users as the product is quality - sound, visuals, FFB etc.. etc.. are really good on a monitor.




EDIT After 1.1
Im sure its great on monitor but still for VR this is sub par compared to the competition.  Mainly extremely fuzzy looking at usable performance levels.    For it to look in the same ballpark as the others with AI it runs really badly.   Thats with a 2080ti.

Not recommended for VR players at all.   Monitor only - recommended though.


At Release:
Not recommended at release for VR players. 

Poor performance, visuals not comparable to other VR sims such as iracing, rf2, pc2 & AC.

Navigation / hud in VR is not up to the standards of other sims.

Not able to use Fanatec funky switch as I want (ie as I can in PC2/Iracing)

I will likely give this a thumbs up once these issues are addressed as it is its not playable in VR for me.",1559213067,1580561504,True,0,0,0.592033326625823975,0,True,False,False,76561197969347190,128,11,11997,185,1419,1602021086
62,62788826,english,"Firstly I'm more of casual gamer who enjoys a race with the AI using a gamepad and I have to say this title has given me a lot of enjoyment so far.

The tracks and cars look very nice indeed........the graphics are very nice and I haven't noticed any annoying pop up.
I have all the graphic options on the highest available 'epic' etc. This is a quite demanding on a PC but I can start a 30 car grid at approx 70fps with mirrors on and approx 90fps with mirrors off.

One thing I've never enjoyed doing when starting a season is the qualification and it's nice to see that there's the option to either choose grid position or set it as random. So competing in a season I use random. For a quick race I usually put myself down towards the back of the grid.......rarely win but have some good racing with the AI in the middle of the pack.

As I say I use a gamepad (assists turned off) and for me it feels good so much better than PC2. I do feel that the rumble could be a little better, maybe the same as in AC but that's just my opinion as is this review. 

One thing I am experiencing is some slight stutter particularly in the corners and I have read that other people are having the same so hopefully with an update this can be sorted.

The game's focus on gt3 cars makes for some great multiplayer racing.  FFB and handling physics seem very realistic to me, and ACC overall is an authentic but unpolished sim.

The career mode w/ Blancpain GT Series is nice to have, but it is extremely barebones and has some frustrating limitations. One big issue is that race length and difficulty cannot be changed after starting a career. The multiplayer is the main attraction with this game imo.

People generally try to race pretty clean on the MP servers, though getting wrecked occasionally is still an occupational hazard in sim racing, unfortunately. I especially like the competition servers which have a minimum safety rating requirement and run 1 hour long endurance races. Sadly, some bugs have hindered my enjoyment of multiplayer, most notably relating to the penalty system. I've had a few races ruined by bogus penalties. Hopefully the developers will continue to fix bugs and make this game feel a little more ""finished"", because the racing here is super fun.

Edit:

The bad:
- Career is a huge disappointment. You first start doing 3 practice sessions(30~40min) which the game treats as a ""tutorial""(that doesn't teach anything), you cannot skip these and it's where you chose your car and settings(event duration, assists etc). After that, if you want to change AI difficulty, switch on/off tyre wear, race duration, change your car of choice(even if you didn't do a single race yet), well tough luck, you have to run the whole ""tutorial"" again. These happen again mid career for no reason at all, as they serve no purpose. There's also only 2 seasons for some reason....
- AI improved but it's still not good enough, they provide some entertainment but gets boring really fast, they don't fight between them which kills immersion;
- Multiplayer is the old lobbies from late 90's. You can set some preferences which will alter the order of said list, but that's it(though I'm not sure if that works to be honest). There's a quick join button that will automatically send you to any of the current lobbies, random track, random duration, it's a mess. There's also Competition servers, which you need high safety rating to join(SA), so if you are new to the game you will have to farm these playing against the AI or joining low SA lobbies. There's no rewards other than CP points, as there is no ranks or any structure, just racing for the sake of racing. CP lobbies are on a certain schedule.
- Nothing to explain what each option does at the setup screen, only a few settings have some text.
- There's car damage but nothing significant visual.
- You can adjust time speed but not tyre wear or fuel consumption for some odd reason.

The good:
-Graphics are good but very, very demanding. PC2 looks just as good and runs better.
-Dynamic weather is great.
-Sound is 10/10.
-Tracks are also amazing are all laser scanned and amazing;
-Car physics is also great, each car is very different from the others
-FFB is ok, I don't see it as bad as some people say, but also don't think it's amazing.

From a game called ""Competizione"" focused on just one series, you would expect a very decent structured multiplayer and nice singleplayer career, none is present unfortunately. It seems Kunos is good at making a simulator but not a game. We will see how they improve the game, but since it's not early access anymore, it's a thumbs down for now.

AC Competizione is now better than AC. New tires physic and chassis flex are part of the latest update. This addition makes everything better (physic wise). Don't forget that this software simulates GT3 cars and these beasts are difficult to handle but FFB gives you enough informations to fully understand what is going on.
AI is better also, no dive bombing, you can battle with them and their reactions are quite good.
Waiting for the next DLC that will give us four iconic new tracks and it will be an instant buy.


First review at ACC launch :

It was a difficult launch with a lot of crash in multiplayer and some issues with UE4 (which crash also the game v 1.0.0)

But 2 days after launch, yes only 2 days, a patch came out in beta access and now this patch is live and crash are a thing of the past (1.0.1 current version).
This is something that you don't see in every game when things goes wrong. Kudos to Kunos :)

Anyways, If we talk about the core of this game -> driving a GT3 car, then it's top notch. Visual, sound, handling, everything is very very nicely done. Wasn't very confident during Early Access because I was not able to feel the car but in the final release, the wheel gives me all the feedback needed to understand what the car is doing.

These cars are a pleasure to drive and to push them on the limit with the knowledge that you are on the edge.

And I will let you discover the night, the rain, the AI by yourself. :)",1559589245,1579640058,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False,76561198003683970,129,6,24128,2091,2413,1602099102

16,47084267,english,"Best one game yet on steam - nominated it for game of the year!

Multiplayer should come clean in the end! Otherwise this is a letdown and only rewards are fantastic race and climb of your rating system!

The bad:
{ } Ranking system still buggy, BUT is getting better!
{ } Penalty system is still meh... But there is some at least...
{ } Because of penalty system, there is no clean racing on low safety rating servers, but Kunos really is doing allot to minimize ramming
{ } Rolling starts at online lobbies are sometimes a mess as of still
{ } Penalty system AI is not optimized so rammer gets disqualified and gets Safety Rating penalty
{ } In situation: Rammer and racer being rammed, both get Safety Rating Penalty - not fair at all
{ } If you still care about single player or AI crap - go to the Forza store page :D

Good things are:
{ } You can really have clean race IF you race on 60+ Safety Rating server
{ } They listen to community!
{ } No other game compares to physics
{ } This Game Is Freaking Just So Beautiful
{ } Sounds are great
{ } Set Safety Rating and Ranking Levels, so only those who are fair racers can join.
{ } Physics - I like the fact that car starts to spin slowly for a moment and then it get's into quick spin 180° if you don't get a control over it in time, just as it is in real GT3 racing - this fact was told while I was watching Blancpain race.
{ } Tire model and tire model physics seems pretty correct, and there is also this ""Tire Flex"" thing.
{ } Force feedback is really great, I can feel every bit of change in track surface and force changes
{ } All you racers with Logitech Driving Force GT - good news this game is super optimized for this wheel - in other words - it runs perfect with LDFGT wheel.


Would love to see.
{ } More rewards - give us points - give us Kunos made championships, daily races, something, give us something to feel bit more rewarded once
{ } Adding current season of Blancpain 2019 car lineup and track lineup! KEEP ON ADDING TO THE GAME!
{ } Improved penalty system with ""in-race penalty system with seconds"" when you cut the corner or bump someone.


Game is for:
{ } Would love to say that it's for everybody, but it is for closed audience, who can race, who want to race, and who want to race competitive, fair and clean. 
{ } You have to be able to accept the fact that, if you end race from 5th to 10th out of 24 racers. If you can't do that - get out of this page and hop back on your PC2, Forza or FartNite.

Tips for wanna- buyers:
{ } Should've bought it when it was on lower cost, now as greatness rises, you'll have to pay double :P
{ } Get a FFB wheel

Well.... seeing how this is early access I won’t say to many things.  There is a something I would like to touch on that I Hope is different soon.  Seems that when the back end lets go there is no control, yes you can save it but that’s not what I’m talking about something is off.  This game I feel is and can be enjoyable.  While racing riding the line is important and control even if you go over.  I have never driven a gt in person but to the cars I have driven I think I have enough to go off of with the end of the car letting lose.  The cars at this point almost force me to ride in front of the line never fully on the edge I demand.  Not as enjoyable.

That being said when AI hits you they seem to keep pushing lol I’m sure that will get worked out but on top of the no control while sideways it feels off again.

Vr well it’s early currently I have to turn things down and optimizing this would be great, I only race VR when at all possible so this is a need.  I would love if it looked prettier on the head set.

Some other things but all and all I could see this being very fun and gratifying.  

Weather, night, dynamic, setting up my own endurance times and conditions, amazing competition online user or dev created serious with massive online coverage of the seasons.  While being pretty and top notch physics.  This is what will keep me in the game and what I hope to find,  yes I wish it was prototypes as well but a solid GT game in the end will be my go to GT game.

I’m happy with the game and expect to see it get better.




1/19/20  Update  7.25/10 Currently

I have a few more hours under the belt.  I have went over to iRacing for a while, not to mention I have a DD1 and Load Cell Pedals now (v3)  I still highly recommend this game for the same things as before with some changes (see below).  It slowly keeps getting better and better, I personally think the feel in the wheel and pedal are amazing (the best even), especially when I can stand on the ABS I can't do that in iRacing, the feel is really good in other areas, except curbs and collisions.  I am not to worried about the collisions, but the curbs could be heavier. I hope that gets a major rework.

Car Changes-
The cars don' let loose like before, and when they do you can save them.  I did a Porsche Cup race at Spa for an hour with 20 other memebers last week, and unintentionally I kept power sliding on that last and first turn, but I was catching it and riding it out with some wheel and pedal control. That to me felt a whole lot more like I feel in my real car.  The GT3 non cup cars, doesn't fully do that, but it is still catchable unlike what happened when the game just came out  or in other sims I use GT3 Cars in.

VR- You have to fix it more
I only play this game in VR.  I keep graphics high and that is a bit of an issue with a 1080ti  I am thinking about a 2080ti or waiting to whatever is better just so I can play this game how I want.  At times it is smooth, like in single player.  Then there are some online games I crash just from the frame drops.  I want to play online in the rain at night huge grids.  That just isn't a thing with the settings I have.  Personally I would rather sit though the issues than turn them down and miss out on how pretty this game is.  

Video and Streaming-
On a similar note, I woulld like the ability to record my VR in flawless detail and high frame rate.  I have not yet figured out how to record VR and it be viewable at this point.  The frame rate is very low while the quality looking pretty bad. I have only seen ONE person record  VR with acceptable quality.  He does have a 2080ti but I suspect he has some kind of magic as well.

This is going to need to be fixed especially if you want to be taken as a serious racing game, we gotta compete and present our peeps with footage.  I only like to watch and record ""Drivers eye views"" and that only accompleshed well in VR.  Yes I am that weird guy that goes to youtube and watches dashcams and of the like for hours at tracks I love.  Its not weird for me to search for 24 hour race dash cams.  3 hours seems to be the best average I can find.

RTX-
No more Raytracing. Thats is unfortunate... that it was brought up in the first place. Things change, quality frames suffer, I get it.  Still sad.

ONLINE-
Umm well, the small sessions are fun, but to enjoy it the way I want to (like iRacing) it would have to change something entirely. That keeps this from being my fav go to game for everything except unique cars outside of GT (I will come back round to that in a min).  That being said, Joining a league and competing is the way to go.  I can't wait for the long races and weather changes, against some really talented players (first leage series in ACC is 2 weeks away for me)  Bring in those real endurance races, and those numbers of people, the professional drivers I have a chance to smash on.  

Future-
New tracks are coming.  This also maybe opens up to the future GT4, TCR, Touring Car.  All types of other tracks.  Getting all that in once place who needs skippys and F1... WEC merge would be nice though, maybe toss some IMSA in there, but thats out of Blanacapain and a bit of a stretch, however ALL of Blancapain.  GT4,TC, world, Europe, Americas.    Just putting GT4 Americas in there, you have some of the best tracks too.  Some multi class racing would be good not even sure if this series has multiclass.  

Some fan fav tracks like The Green Hell?  I mean thats not asking to much for release this year 2020 and polish it out perfectly in 2021.  And where is the intercontinental with Indianapolis in there?  Maybe release later, because that would be easy, to say they have 2 years of the series just by adding one track later.  I would rather have a 2020 GT challenge Americas to get those VIR, Sonoma, Long Beach, and Canadian tracks... and if you did Indy you would have one track already done for the Americas.  I am just ranting now.

Yes its coming along, get in some League racing.  Keep bounding the pavment.  This might be that game you want to alwasy go back to soon.  I can't say enough about feel for this game.  They could def keep pushing this game for the future and if they do I will keep tossing money at them till I get all my GT and 24 hour races, and that merger with WEC lol.

Wouldn't mind paying a subscription a la iRacing in order to have a more robust and rewarding system. 
VR is fine but not great - Unreal engine method of anti-aliasing adds a lot of blur and thus one loses even more detail than usual when looking at distance objects. Hopefully there is something in the pipeline in order to address this.

For Screen user a clear thumbs up at least if you have the opportunity to play with a higer resolution. On 1080p ist not very sharp and the AA does not really help.
For VR user it's a mixed bag, the graphics engine is not optimzed for VR so I would say play with a lot of compromises or use something else.

[05/2019] ACC 1.0 release and now finally a lot of content added. Championship, career, new graphic options. If would play with a screen I think this could be a complete package. 
But for me as I'm playing in VR (Oculus Rift), the step from 0.7.2 to 1.0 made the game for me very blurry and the AA seems not to work anymore. I can barely see the information on the dashboard/motec display also the track and the signs, lines, fences are very blurryand kind of jaggy.

69,61695911,english,"Going into this game, I was excited - having watched Jimmy Broadbent and a number of other YTers reviews of the game it looked promising. Sadly though, that all goes away once you start playing the game. 

First lets start with the good:
- It's a very pretty game to look at, the graphics are good, cars look fantastic, tracks look like the real things
- The actual driving itself is superb. Not quite on the same level as iRacing, but very very close I'd say
- It has Manthey Racing in it...

And now let's move onto the bad:
- The UI in the menu's is pretty poor. When you first start the game, it can be very easy to press 'quit session' after the end of a practice, thinking you'll move onto the next when you won't. (Countless others have had the same issue, before someone steps in and tries to say this is only a problem I've had, just go look on the AC forums)

- The AI can be pretty poor. The game is based around this safety racing etc. yet they'll divebomb, doorslam, and rear end you to get passed you, and YOU will lose the ratings....

- The ""livery editor"" is SUPER basic.... Literally all you can do is change the colour of your car. No option for sponsors etc. Even NASCAR Heat 4 has more options.

and now onto the worst part of all:
- The Career mode is pointless... You start off doing a race school, which is good for those new to sim racing, but there's no option to skip it.... Not an issue if it's your first playthrough, but after my save was deleted randomly, I had to do the same school again, and it's pointless as it then lets you just choose a difficulty. 
- The game also lies to you here, and says it's all about safety rating and consistency - it's not. It's 3 Hotlap sessions and nothing else. It also says if you perform well, you'll get offers from big teams - this is another lie. I set it to Pro,  came first in all 3 sessions, no cuts, no incidents, and still no teams offered me a thing.
- The Livery Editor in Career is even worse than singleplayer, you can't edit a thing....
- There's no points in career mode. You do the first races, and then notice there's no leaderboard or standings... So you're just doing a series of single races in a car that looks basic as hell with no livery, sponsors or anything on it.

I understand the game is in early access still (or atleast I hope it is, or else what the hell is this pile of garbage they've released?!) but why release features that are incomplete? I'd have rather waited another 2-3 months for a better in-game paint system, and a more indepth career - maybe starting off at the race school, then going into GT4's and then the GT3's.

Multiplayer is finally what it should've been since April, took a while but I'm glad they made it happen. The only half-baked feature is VR. With an average of 48fps in multiplayer(depending on the server) and muddy view into the distance, it leaves a lot to be desired. I use GTX 1080ti settings at low/medium, with view distance on high.

The force feedback feels really good, every part of the wheel and pedals feel to work really well. The UI is clean and easy to control with steering wheel (Except for a few parts where you need the mouse&keyboard, mostly to fill in names).

I bought my first wheel because of Dirt Rally and tried some other Tarmac Sims but never sticked with them. Online servers were usually an awfull experience and racing against AI, which never does mistakes gets boring fast. Often i also felt a little bit overhelmed by the amount of cars and tracks and never managed to stick with one car or learn tracks.
This game is really good on all these aspects. Their rating system works really well and gives you good feedback where you can improve. The limited amount of tracks enables me to actually learn them and race  on tracks i know how to ride. I also can stick with one car and dont have to switch all the time because the online servers or careermode ride a different car class.
For now my online experience have been really good, i never had people crashing into me or others on purpose. Even as a noob i already had really good close races with other drives. Obviously were taking about fighting about the last or second to last place.

So to summuarize whats good in the game:
-Graphics are awesome
-Best sound in all Sims i have played
-Really good rating system

My review focuses on comparing ACC to iRacing, as I think some ""sim"" oriented folks could be interested in this aspect.

[b] My final opinion is that overall Assetto Corsa Competizione (ACC) is a great sim. [/b]

In general ACC feels really like a sim and not like a ""forza motosport"" game. 
This for me is a BIG plus and the overall reason why this review is positive and I would definitely recommend ACC.

Pros:
- Great FFB and physics 
    -- I have a direct drive wheel and I think FFB is in par or possibly even better than iRacing, with great details and smooth feeling
       These are things I can literally feel and not some effects claimed by the developers.
       I will try to explain them as best as I can.

       a. Flat spotting

       If you disable ABS and lock the tires after the lockup you will start immediately to feel your steering wheel shaking and trembling at each tire revolution based of the severity of the flat spot. Depending on the severity you need to change tires as it is pretty much impossible to continue.
       Moreover the shaking is directional (with the shaking pulling the steering wheel more toward one side than the other in case you locked one side and not the other).

       b. Graining

       if you start pushing the tires before they are hot, after a while you feel some ""micro-vibrations"" on the steering wheel, almost like there is sand in the inner gears of the steering wheel (I have no better way of describing this effect, it is a subtle effect but I definitely feel it)


       c. Uninflated tires
 
       When driving with uniflated tires the steering wheel feels ""squishy"" and responsiveness is delayed, almost like you are ""floating"" on the track.

       d. Tire punctures

       Depending on the the damage on the tires you can get punctures. The steering wheel becomes really hard and shakes violently, you really have to crawl back to the pits and change tires.

       e. Hydroplaning

       When you drive in the rain, and you hit a puddle of water you immediately feel the steering wheel very ""floaty and soft"", upon the point where after the puddle you get eventually back some traction and immediately feel it sharp and strong again.

       f. Curbs

      When you go over a curb you feel the right frequency of vibrations on the steering wheel based on the type of curb. Some are flat (not vibration), some have wide 'ripples' (low freq vibrations), narrow 'ripples' (high freq vibrations). On high curbs you really feel a like you hit a large pothole on the road on a real car.

   -- each car and track it feels significantly different and rich of information

- Outstanding graphic
    -- far superior than iRacing hands down (the unreal engine is light years ahead of the iRacing gfx engine)
-- Not strictly related to ACC but still a plus, I have 4 traducers on the 4 corners of my rig and simhub works out of the box with ACC

Cons:

- multi-player
   -- significantly improved with latest versions, but still not even close to iRacing
- still few bugs with respect to save games, lap time recording

This one is purely for GT3 racing but apart from its ok physics, the realism from crashes or damages to the car are so below the bar set by other titles such as F1 2019 or Project Cars 2.

That being said, this game allows users to select X amount of tires for limited tire sets as well as different break pads that eventually wear down based on race length. This allows for a more ""immersive"" experience, but as far as the damage displayed on the vehicle is shown, it needs more work. For example you can hit a kerb or a car and suddenly lose steering and you wouldn't know why until you do a side view and realize that a wheel has disconnected and its stuck inside the chassis.

As for the user interface, although the car setup may seem more detailed, the overall menus, and interfaces are so non user friendly and somewhat a nuisance to navigate through.

Handling and physics are right up there with the best, graphics are the best I've seen, audio is superb, FFB is acceptable but needs tweaking depending on what car your in.

The single player is pointless with no progression. If you don't race online there are better games.

 I have been racing online now for 20 plus years.  I have a seat and great wheel.  I race GT cars and Nascar and others. All different games and sims. But  the realism an feel that goes with this so far is amazing. I know this sim has a long way to go before it's finished but I will be in here for the long term and have high hopes for the finished product. Yes they better finish this because it has so much potential. Looks amazing now on my 2080ti and I9 chip at 4K. Yes the FFB is still needing some work an feeling the bumps and road better but is still close now. They must add more tracks such as Daytona Road and Mid Ohio and Laguna Seca for sure. Lovein it tho as of rite now.

More : Yes there is more now that I have spent more time in the sim. The realism is off the charts for racing against the AI. This is a must for all of you searching for some great close racing where the AI does not just give the racing line to you. The Ai will undercut and over take and pass clean almost every time. They have made the AI so good that you can improve your racing  score just racing them. The harder you make them the faster you improve your score as long as you pass clean and run clean laps and do not hit them. The AI is kickin with 100% aggression.

74,48426392,english,"Update: 26/12/19

I have nothing but good things to say about the latest update, the driving model and physics especially have matured into one of the best racers available, the FFB has improvements as well, and now I am experiencing among the best in the business with my TS-PC,  the extra fixes in the AI and the additional fixes in the game have solved many of the teething problems we experience in the early days of this title.

Things started out a little rocky along the road of development for this title, as you would expect for an early access title.

Pre 1.2 update.

My last review based on an very early access version was not that positive, however, I am very glad to come back and update / edit my review now the game has been officially released and many improvements have been made.

This title is now my go to racing fix, the FFB and Physics are now providing me confidence in the driving model and much enjoyment, if you have previously played this and struggled with the modern GT3 cars might I suggest you did what I have done, start out with a slightly more old school machine, like the Jaguar.

The Jaguar lets you drive a little harder, lets you get away with the small mistakes with a slightly more forgiving attitude, making it an utter joy to lap with whilst learning how to set up the car and learning about this game and its vices and virtues, so far this car has given me very little vices and plenty of smiles and hours of enjoyment, and most importantly confidence in the title to keep playing and keep digging away at the layers of gameplay locked within.

There is many small things which I am sure will improve, some of the menu's for example need fleshing out and finishing properly etc, and a few bits here and there need tidying, but overall the title is a must have purchase if you are a fan of GT racing, or indeed just a modern complete package racing title, I would more recommend this title for the more  advanced player, tho I am sure a more novice player could still enjoy it with some of driving aids turned up a little more aggressively, the real cars use traction control and ABS so big deal if you are new and need to use some higher settings !!

I don't have a rocket-ship of a computer... i7 4790K, 16GB, 1660ti, but it runs AC and Dirt Rally great. i use ftpVR to monitor. Using Samsung Odyssey +. Drivers are up to date. i have most of my graphic setting mostly at low/medium, a couple at high. i didn't try messing with them much because this requires more than just a tweak here and there, it needs open heart surgery.

GPU is lit up like a fire truck at 100%. FPS is around 30, worse at the start of a race. My reprojection is over 50%. No mouse in menu. Menu is 'jittery', i don't know what word to use, but it doesn't feel right. I tried editing the engine.ini as someone said, it didn't help at all. 

Do not buy if VR (Odyssey anyway) is important to you. Your mileage may vary.


Edit 1:  I changed review to thumbs up. I had put ACC aside for 2 weeks thinking i would try again in another couple of months, but I gave it a shot again. What a difference!! VR is so much better now, mouse support, playable FPS, much better  menu stability now. To me it felt much more like a 1.2 version, not a 1.02 :-). Heavy rain still slowed down FPS considerably, but I blame the aging of my i7 4790, DDR 3, and only a 1660ti upgrade (which i really like btw).

Well done Kudos.

Similar to the original AC, if you turn TC off and gas it too quickly, you can easily spin out, whereas in iRacing it's comparatively harder to spin out.

Engine noises are pretty good. Visuals are good enough for an immersive VR experience.

Tip: If playing in VR, use the settings from simracing604's video to eliminate stuttering and maintain constant 90 fps.

I can finally recommend this game. the recent update V1.2 is what the game should have been to begin with.
this game makes you feel like a racecar driver. the sound, the graphics, the physics are amazing. the force feedback is a bit weak compared to other titles (rfactor2 for example) but you still get a good feeling of what the car is doing. 
and finally there's a form of online matchmaking available. it's still in its early stages, but i'm sure Kunos will improve it further. 

*ORIGINAL REVIEW AS of June 2019*
TL;DR: Great GT3 simulator wrapped up in a crappy game experience.

I'd like to give this a thumbs up, because the core gameplay is amazing. but the overall experience is just very bare-bones as of v1.05 / end of June 2019. i'm hopeful that Kunos or maybe the community will fix this game, but as of right now i can not recommend is as a full-price game. this game could have used another couple of weeks / months in early access. if you really like GT3 racing i suggest you wait until it is on sale for maybe 20 or 30 bucks.",1561834877,1577006979,True,0,0,0.511844933032989502,0,True,False,False,76561198077353771,88,14,11068,148,1735,1601673569

25,58476889,english,"(Update 1.2.1)
I highly recommend this game, but I give it negative score to bring developer attention to some issues (hopefully). Below few main thoughts after spending more than 100 hours in gameplay:
- Graphics, weather, night and day cycle are awesome, but you need top notch PC
- Sound is simply amazing
- Cars and tracks are superb
- Thrilling GT3 driving experience
- Force feedback and physics are good, but they have some issues, e.g. car behaves a little bit strange when you try to spin it.
- [strike]AI it's actually quite good and fun to race against, but if you set all to 100% at Monza they will crash into each other a lot  (they can even fly at first corner)[/strike]
- AI (S=90% A=100%) is slow at SPA in last chicane, they will crash and box ruining whole race
- Stay on the grass (Monza) for a few seconds and AI (S=90% A=100%) is so scared to drive around you that they will all retire
- And more about AI... Did you test this guys? I had those issues in the first two races!
- Career is a joke - it should be like F1 game - then I would say it's 10/10 (with issues of course like all games)
- Single player is not that great and we need improvements, for instance: it would be nice to have possibility to drive custom 2 hours race with 1 hour stint (now only possible with 30 minutes stints, so you have minimum 3 pits)

This is the best GT3 racing game at the moment. It's a shame career mode is so limited - wasted opportunity to create something legendary.

29,59421429,english,"This is all-around the best sim available, if racing GT3 cars is your main criteria. Just be warned that as the official Blancpain GT game it's very thin on content. But I believe that focusing only on GT3 cars and official tracks has allowed Kunos to fine-tune the experience. This is about quality, not quantity. The attention to detail of the cars, tracks, traction control and ABS systems, car setups, etc... is simply stunning. Dynamic time, weather and track conditions is the icing on the cake.

The physics are excellent. The dynamic model and tire model are excellent. FFB on the G29 is good (not great). Sounds are excellent.

Unreal Engine means some extra overhead. This review is on a i7 laptop with 16GB of RAM and an RTX 2060. It looks great in pancake mode and I get good performance and graphics at 1440p @ 60fps. Using the PSVR headset performance is, well, acceptable, but this is an extremely demanding piece of software. I have to force Motion Smoothing (45fps) in Steam VR to get acceptable performance and it is clearly more blurry than rFactor 2, RaceRoom or DiRT Rally 2.0 in VR.

The lack of iRacing/GT Sport online matchmaking is a disappointment, but Kunos has implemented a great driver rating system. If this game ever gets the player counts it deserves then it could be a great multiplayer sim.

Career mode is a joke, but you can set up real Blancpain seasons and tailor to your liking. Even 24hs at Spa with a huge grid is possible.

-laser scanned tracks, although not plentiful, are stellar quality
-weather simulation is fantastic; ""wet lines"" would be good to add to that

-sound design is phenomenal from brakes squealing (which is strangely absent in every other racing game), to the buzz of the gearbox compression unit. Every car has its own character
-ai is great, multiplayer racing is also very good, albeit sometimes scarce because of the number of active players. Netcode can be a bit choppy on higher pings.

I only play the game in single player, and the AI is pretty good, they still bump me and spin me out sometimes, but to me that is normal racing. The AI will fight and defend depend on aggressivness.
AI will move out of the way under blue flag which is great.

Campaign is none existence.
Championship is highly limited, for example if you want to play 2019 championship, almost half the cars are locked and not selectable, I understand they want to keep it true to the series, but there needs to be an option to customize it.

75,59432335,english,"I have been sim racing for approximately 10 years. I have fairly high end equipment (triple monitors, samsung odyssey, Fanatec CSW 2.0 with Porsche 911 rim and Carbon Fiber F1 rim, CSP Inverted V3, Manual/Sequential Shifter, Ubunto, Bass Shakers, Sim Commander,  and the Obutto Revolution cockpit) and try to get as realistic feelings as possible.

I started off sim racing with Forza, iRacing, PC2, Raceroom, Assetto Corsa, F1 2019, rFactor 2, and now Assetto Corsa Competizion. Prior to ACC, rFactor 2 was easily my favorite due to the tire model, physics, and some of the tracks such as Sebring and Nurburgring. I held off on purchasing ACC because I had read that others did not like the FFB, lack of triple monitor support, and feeling unfinished. I finally took th plunge because I happened upon a sim video where someone was racing it and it looked so good.

I am extremely happy that I bought this sim. I purchased it unknowingly after a major patch, and I can say with certainty that the above concerns have been resolved. I absolutely love this sim. I like it so much that I upgraded my CPU from an i5-4670k to and i7-4790k so I could get smoother racing. While the FFB is completely different feeling than the other sims, it is different in a fantastic way. I went back to rFactor 2 the other day to compare, since it was my favorite FFB that I had spent hours dialing in, and it didn't compare. Some YouTubers have stated that they don't feel as if they get enough communication from ACC FFB but for me that is the opposite. Not only do I get the feeling of what is going on, more importantly I get to feel the wheels constantly connected to the road. I can't describe it, it is different, but to me it is much better. 

The sounds are either on par or almost on par with Raceroom sounds. They sound fantastic. I don't know which one sounds better. There are some vehicles in Raceroom that I prefer, and I really like the backfire of the BMW DTM in Raceroom, but the sounds in ACC are incredible as well. You can hear the car settling back in after going over a curb, you can hear the cold brakes squeal, the suspension hitting, it's wonderful.

The AI is my favorite. Whoever programmed them did a phenomenal job. It's easy to feel like you are racing against real people except they are safer than many real people. They will still hit you but if they do it is probably your fault somehow. 

The graphics are the best out of all the sims to me. Originally I had an i5-4670k and I had to keep many of the settings at medium, but upgrading to the i7-4790k allowed me to crank most things up to Ultra and maintain 60 FPS on a triple monitor setup. 

I can't recommend this sim enough for those who are into sim racing and have the hardware to run it well. It is a joy to drive, it is challenging, and I love it.",1575736748,1575736830,True,1,0,0.5,0,True,False,False,76561198276774512,100,10,7293,78,2322,1601510690

For offline racers, mid-event saving works quickly and well, allowing full endurance events to be run over several realtime days (and doubling up as a poor man's ""flashback"" tool if you need that), and the AI provides a solid challenge with the nature of endurance racing - less immediate need for passing and cars frequently being in different parts of their tyre/fuel life - covering somewhat for all racing AI's difficulty with overtaking.

The UI isn't perfect, partly because the complicated nature of engine maps, brake balance, traction control, ABS et al. requires _a lot_ of buttons, but also because things like pit stop settings are not intuitively placed (they're in the car setup menu), and then once you get into the race the later pit stop presets may forget the tyre and fuel settings you chose.

The focus on just one racing series is either a weakness or a strength depending on your tolerance for GT3 cars, but overall ACC is a game much improved by its 1.1 patch, offering customisable challenge in classic locations made to look beautiful by excellent graphics and dynamic environments.

2,59023200,english,"Buy it! I held off on this game because of the polarizing reviews the game initially received upon launch. I'll answer a few questions that I wish I would have known the answer to months ago. 

Force Feedback - I have a Thrustmaster TMX and a Fanatec , both feel fantastic. Compared to the first AC, PC2, or other sims, I would say it's more refined. You'll have less control over the input, but it's refined enough to not matter. I didn't even have to change anything other than the minimum values and steering lock.  

Set Up - This is pretty big because everybody who messes with sims knows set ups are a headache. You expect to be messing around with settings for an hour or so before you can even start enjoying the game, and it can prevent you from jumping in to new games. This is not true for ACC. I had this game up and running within minutes. I don't know how they managed to make it that easy, but it is. This was the easiest setup I've ever had with a sim. 

Everything else is pretty obvious. The game looks outstanding. The audio is setting a new standard for racing sims in my opinion. The menu's and UI seem pretty intuitive.

28,44724030,english,"I think I've played this game enough, more than the most (~24 hours at this moment) to leave a honest review or at least better than the ones with only 2 or 3 hours. Only one car and only one track, it was expected and announced, wasn't it? That's not a good reason to leave a negative review. You have early access to the game so you can speak about problems or report them and help the development of the final product. Also, you pay right now only 25€, which is almost half the price of the final game, which will be free for the people who bought the early access. 

The first thing that I've seen is that the FFB works great without any adjustments but at the same time I had a very big problem with the brakes. (I use a G29). I had to push with both feet on the brake pedal to actually stop the car. (The brake pedal on the G29 is harder to push). That can be easily fixed in settings playing with something called 'Brake Gamma', it took me a few hours to get the perfect result but I've got it perfectly at this point. Maybe the Wheel Profiles will get some reworks in the future patches or Early Acceses.

The physics are believable, good enough, but somehow they feel a bit different than the first AC. I can't explain it, but you will have to expect something different. Maybe they are still working on it but if I remember well in the early days of the first AC there were also lots of problems and finally they have done 'the best' sim. I hope they will do the same thing with ACC. Anyway, even at this point it is a lot better than Project Cars 2 but still a bit behind the first AC. But naja, AC is 5 years old and this one is still in the first week of early access.

And something that I don't really like about it is that we are going to have only GT3 cars. Well, lots of people will ignore that and will enjoy it as it is but that was something I do really love about the first AC. All classes, lots of cars, many types of cars and so on... the driving mode was always changing with every class. But if you like the GT3 cars and you usually play only with them, that will be no problem. I will still have to buy other games (F1) for other classes or just go back to the first AC since PCs are disappointing.

Also, say Goodbye to mods. That's the worst thing about switching to ACC. I mean, the mods or even the workshop from Steam is what brings LOTS OF EXTRA HOURS OF GAMEPLAY! And also modding means communities, people working together to achieve something, that's the heart of the game and also of the players. Modding is the best thing that can happen to a game. 'You can mod trash into a diamant'. So, bye Nissan 180SX, VAZ 2106, Honda NSX, Sileighty  F1s and many other cars... and also Goodbye to Transfagarasan, Lake Louise, Touge, Akina, Isle of Man and to any other tracks or cities and to anything related to modding.

I've said negative things but I still recommend the game because I am aware that it is the FIRST WEEK of early acces and they are still doing better than Project Cars when we speak about physics.

Update (@v1.0.5 public beta): The game has released in a content-complete state, but not yet a feature complete state. Certain things are still being worked on by the 25-person team. For the driving alone, I'd recommend it - but the 'game'-part is still lacking. You need to make it fun for yourself, which you can do by joining one of the many existing communities and/or keeping track of your stats yourself.

Update (@v0.6.5): Really taking shape now, but a lot of stuff left to fill in. Multiplayer is stable now, but missing loads of features. The racing itself is still so good, combined with some well driving guys online this game is awesome.

Update (@v0.5.2): Game has some new content, which is fine, I guess. The Jag is a real challenge to drive through mid-high speed corners of which the new track (Zolder) has many. Apparently, Kunos have hit a snag with the multiplayer so that is still non-functional. Yet, I'm still having fun with the AI, with the hotlapping, and more. I just wish Kunos would allow us to record our hotlaps already. The function and UI is already there, they are just keeping it for the full release. It would have been a good gesture for starting over on the multiplayer part. Still positive about the game, but I hope they retain other people's interest.

Update (@v0.4.0): Game is stable AF right now. Haven't played release 3 a lot because I don't like the track and car they released and the online play was moot, but this release (Hungaroring + Ferrari + basic online races) is big ffing improvement. The game is really shaping up nicely. Also - try playing this with quality headphones on, you can hear the individual sounds (wind, tires, brakes, everything) doing their work. Breathtaking stuff.

Update (@v0.3.4): Game is less stable, especially in 'multiplayer', which is just hotlapping with other cars trying to ram you. Still, very promising but needs a lot of content.

At release (@v0.1.0/v0.1.1): game is very bare bones. 1 track, 1 car. Practice mode, hot lap mode, hot stint mode (8 min or 35 min) and sprint race (~20 min). Still, hell of a lot of fun if you like racing sims.

Options could be improved upon, the way the UI interface doesn't show confirmations to your input is irritating at times (namely during set-up). Loads of little kinks and gripes like that, but it's Early Access so I hope Kunos will listen to the community and doesn't leave this kind of stuff up to modders this time.

If you like hotlapping the Nürburgring, then this game in its current state is for you. ACC has so ff-ng much potential and I am looking forward to the rest of the content.

Honestly the answer to almost every problem that other popular sim/arcade racer has. No competing game has anywhere near this level of attention to detail. Makes all other games look/feel/sound mediocre.

The only drawback is the multiplayer system in this game which is the same as the previous game. Needing to set up your own dedicated server means you can't just pick up this game and jump in like you can with Gran Turismo and Forza. If they had a more user-friendly online multiplayer, I think people would come running to play this instead of those games.

As a singleplayer and one who races with family, the driving experiences, handling, graphics, and tracks are challenging and fun. They have made improvements over time and hopefully more to come. However, as we know, developers will focus on content to generate revenue versus improving gameplay/simulation mechanics (RF2, cough, cough). ACC may head in this direction.

Pros - balanced racing experiences, cars handle differently, excellent modeling and track details, good sounds, physics and tires appear accurate (not a pro myself to judge), challenging to match the community to speed and lap times

Race drivers require their cars to enable them to win, as easily and consistently as possible - and the engineers do their best to meet their needs.

Next gen physics. They have really taken this up a notch. It's a joy to drive.
Next gen graphics. Looks simply stunning. 
Incredible, immersive sounds.
Rating system. Seriously can't praise this enough, it will improve your driving.
As close-to-life FFB as any game has ever produced.
Full weather system.
Full day-to-night system.
Very accessible MP for casual racing, as well as something more serious if you run the 'competition' servers.
Full, official, licence of the European GT3 2018 and 2019 seasons.
DLC incoming of the ICGT season content.
Frequent developer updates.
Now with native triple-screen support.

*There is still no support at all for gamepad users, the game is totally oriented to steering wheels.
*Special events in game are aparently bug, at least for me. (they some times do what they shoudn't, I mean like erasing your lap time for no reason)
*AI seems a little slow, even at 100%, I think there should be more customisable options for the AI controlled cars.

*I've not 5.1 or something like for the audio, but I decently have a logitech plus bass gear, and I can say the game generaly sounds amazing; there is a lot going on while driving.
*Graphics are stunning! (amazingly awesome, specially the AA, and blur system bc they do not demand a lot like other sim racing games as I see).

Pros
+Beatiful game
+Great Sounding game
+immersion Factor is amazing
+Great tracks and Car's

-Con's
feels incomplete. That career, in particular, feels like a disappointment when placed alongside something like Codemasters' F1 games here, there's no sense of purpose to practice sessions, and a fussiness in how it goes about putting you through a race weekend that makes it feel far from satisfying.
game still seems unfinished, poorly
-Missing advertised features like an actual career mode (it was promised as the real GT3 experience but is just empty practice sessions). 

-VR is a mess, no TrackIR support... 
-Convincing online performance with annoying interference
At the moment, however, the question arises whether one should even venture on the online slopes, where up to 30 drivers fight for victory. Although the rides are surprisingly fluid and largely lag-free even at high ping levels, the picture freezes for about a second as soon as a participant leaves or joins the lobby. This is not only unbelievably annoying, but in the worst case can even make you lose control of your vehicle due to these pesky disturbances.

-Keyboard controls are broken. 
-UI is bugged and some of the button's icons aren't even updated. 
-FOV: you have to change it for every car you drive. 
-The rating system tells you how to drive properly. Funnily enough if you do as it says, you'll be slower than if you drive as fast as 
  you can but you'll receive a lower value. 
-There is no visible damage model; plow full speed into a concrete wall and your car isn’t going to drive very well, but it will still look brand new.

Night racing and dynamic weather add a bit of spice to it and the multiplayer ranking system is quite an interesting take, further splitting your skill into various categories and locking out the hardcore servers to those who can prove themselves. Don't worry though, you don't have to play in the low skill servers, just play enough against bots and your safety rating will advance. All without the risk of being torpedoed off the first corner by somebody that doesn't realise that A. it isn't mario kart and B. your brakes take time to warm up, so will be a bit rubbish into the first corner.

Downsides are that this requires a pretty high end rig to get the best out of it, and even with an RTX 2080 Ti and a i9 9900K the VR simply doesn't work very well - an issue that is well known admittedly.

So, if you're a flatty driving simmer then get it - it's a bargain at the price.

It is by far the most realistic simulator i have experienced to date, with decent feedback when out on track coming from the wheel and game sounds. If i had VR, i would really assume that i was in an actual racecar.

There is only 2 negative points at the time of this response. 1 - The damage model is not 100% complete, when you unfortunately damage the car, the response and inability to do things after the damage is accurate however the car model does not display the said damage, so to any other driver, the car looks like its still in 1 piece *insert face palm here*. 
2 - The variety of tracks and cars available currently, there are many other games that are pretty close with a larger variety of tracks and cars to choose from.

In conclusion, Yes I would recommend this game to all my friends who are avid sim racers as there is an experience here that you would struggle to find anywhere else.

In short, I now feel like I can actually RACE.

6,56794262,english,"Pros:
- Driving the cars feels fantastic with toy steering wheels and pedals. It's the only sim that still feels fun even with traction control and anti-lock brake systems on because they don't feel like magic assists. Take note those are in the real world GT3 cars too.
- For me it's one of the best looking driving games to date.
- It's based on a real-world racing series (Blancpain GT Series) so it doesn't have a huge amount of cars and tracks as other racing games and sims but each and every car and track in ACC are superb. This is not like Project Cars with some vehicles not receiving equal amounts of love from the developers.

Cons and Bugs (currently at v1.1.2):
- Restarting a race makes the game forget your correct pit stall. Saving then reloading the game fixes it.
- Pit stop strategies are forgotten when reloading a game. This makes ""long"" endurance races bothersome after reloading.
- Career mode is just a bunch of practice sessions and races that don't even track your points in the competition. It only tracks your ""career points"" or something. It's still fun if you fool yourself enough though because the driving makes up for it… a lot. It's definitely light-years away from Codemasters F1 games' career mode.
- Career mode races' allotted times for practice and qualifying are too short when career race duration is set to short. Of course short is short but in Spa you only have enough time to get one timed lap in the 5 minutes allotted time for qualifying since you have your outlap, then your 5 minutes will be up before you finish your timed lap.
- Absolute lack of training wheels. For seasoned sim-racers this is fine but an arcade-racing enthusiast with no sim-experience is gonna hate this game. It absolutely doesn't care how dumb you are that it will let you start an endurance race with fuel that won't even last a stint. It won't warn you, nothing.
- No ""practice programmes"" that are actually useful for car setup and strategy. Like going out on ""practice stints"" and know the optimal amount of fuel for every engine mode, etc. But on a career mode set to short you won't have enough time to do this, hahaha.
- No clear indication of what the race day format would be. At least on the career mode you have no idea how long driver stint is, how long the race would be, etc.. Right now the only way to know is get to the race part, start it and see the info, restart the race then go adjust your race strategy on Setup.
- I have to use a calculator or a third party web site to know how much fuel to use on races. Since all races are time based and not based on a specific number of laps just relying on the setup page in-game is simply… undoable. It only shows the estimated amount of fuel it needs for a lap. Being able to tell how many laps and how long you could stay out with the amount of fuel would be really helpful.
- Still on fuel there should be a way for us to have a target fuel amount in the tank for a stint instead of calculating the amount of fuel to put on the fly while driving. I bet on the real world race teams do this for the driver. This game asks too much for the driver to think of and do, like click ""Fuel +"" 20 or more times every after pit stop after reloading a game (since it forgets your race strategy after reloading a saved game).
- I'm not sure how it works on multiplayer but on single player modes even if GT3 races involve driver swaps the game doesn't have the capability to let AI drive your car. Other sims let the AI take over your car like RRE after the checkered flag and even Project Cars lets the AI drive if you're just sightseeing or perhaps benchmarking. Even its shortened version of Spa 24-Hours is still 4 hours (and you have to pit every 10ish minutes, hahaha). I doubt even the real world drivers have stints as long as 4 hours but in this game it's all you. Good thing it lets you save your game…
- Game forgets to compare the delta on your fastest lap after reloading a game. Only setting a new personal best lap time will kick the delta right.
- Basically the game still has lots of issues when reloading saved games. This is kinda important considering half of the content of the game is endurance racing. Heck, even the sprint races at 100% duration aren't actually short.
- Terrible UX on some parts. On the car setup screen there's only one button for both Save and Load. Clicking that goes to the Save screen. If you need to load a setup you have to click on the ""Load tab"" on the upper left of the Save screen. I've overwritten so many saved car setups by mistake because of this. The Connect button of multiplayer server list is also way off of the other buttons. I'm so glad this inconsistent UX isn't on critical systems.
- It's based on a real world racing series so the cars and tracks are limited. By the numbers it really doesn't look good.
- Most boring podium celebration screen. Whenever I see it I just giggle at how cringe-inducing it is. I also think it doesn't change no matter what track you are on. 

Overall:
I actually love this game and would recommend it to fans of the genre. When I was buying my new racing game at first it was between this and F1 2019. I bought F1 2019 first and I regretted it. The Codies' game might have more fun modes and has a lot more polish but it just doesn't have the feeling of driving a race car. On a toy steering wheel the F1 cars feel much harder to drive than any open-wheel car I've driven on simulators like Assetto Corsa or RaceRoom Racing Experience.

Assetto Corsa Competizione's driving is simply sublime. Even with all of its shortcomings driving its cars is so addictive. Its cars aren't necessarily hard to drive. In fact I find the driving here more instinctive than on Assetto Corsa 1. Even with the issues revolving around save files, saved games, reloads, etc. I just keep loading it up. It's the closest thing I could get to driving a sexy race car, love it.

Now that it has, I was able to play it more and it became (for me) one of the best sims that I've experienced, at least the best modern GT3 sim out there. Period. Kunos did a great job and is continuously enhancing the title. If you're into GT3, buy it. You won't regret at all.

Old review: I don't write reviews, but this time I felt I should: for racers using TrackIR, beware! This game doesn't support it (as I learned too late). As far as I now know, no games based on Unreal4 engine support it, so it is very unlikely that it will support it one day. Tried really hard to like this game (26 hours so far) but it is impossible once you're so used to TrackIR. The video settings doesn't help too, putting some helmet shading in front of you when you try to adjust fov/distance to mimic real position based on your monitor... what a waste. I fully regret this buy.
Putting my hard time trying to drive the cars without proper situation awareness, I can tell that in the sound department this game has it right. On the graphics side, yes, it's pretty but seems to be too heavy for what it presents. On the physics side, hard to tell: cars seems too icey sometimes, other they feel ok... hard to tell if I'm doing it wrong because as I said earlier, it's hard for me to drive properly without situation awareness, etc.

Now we are at 1.1.2 version with 2018 and 2019 Blancpain GT Series content at the base price, Intercontinental GT Pack with four traks in preparation, official e-sport events (SRO E-Sport GT Series, McLaren Shadow Project) and countless patches and improvemets implemented. Current state and the future are bright! ACC is getting just better and better with every update.

The feel of the cars and the traks is addictive. The sounds - there are so many! The cars feels so alive (front engine, rear engine, mid-engine, tyres, brakes, aerodynamics; detailed force-feedback), the track feels alive (driving into the night, into the rain, into the Sun, dirt, damage), the AI drivers feels alive. There are so many details. This is pure pleasure. And the whole driver's statistics system might teach you something (car control, safety, consistency and so on). The game runs smooth (i5-9600K, 16 GB RAM, RTX 2070, one screen at 2560x1440px@144Hz here).

But! Be aware of some things. It needs powerful PC, if you want to run it at the 100% (you can put 49 AI cars at the Spa-Francorchamps grid, Unreal 4 engine might be heavy on graphic cards, VR users should revise their expectations, etc).

There is no mod support (forget the first Assetto Corsa with thousand of cars and tracks, for good and bad). There are career and championship modes, but both still needs to be improved, single player experience leaves a lot to be desired (AI needs some refinement too). Multiplayer base is a growing one (more leagues, single events, official competition races), it can be hard to find populated servers just to race at any time.

50,56310504,english,"159 hours and counting!  Since the Autumn weather has arrived in the UK I've been back on my sim rig and piling into this title.  Just the sheer satisfaction that I get pushing these cars (everyone is distinct in its character) around the track makes this game for me.  Yes I'd like better VR performance and crisper visuals but in the heat of battle, the AI are generally speaking more than decent, none of the that matters.

Force feedback - excellent on my Fanatec CSW v2
VR performance - I run a mix of medium/high settings on a i7 4930K | GTX 1080 using a Rift CV1 and am pretty much locked at 45 FPS using ASW 2.0 under all conditions.
AI - can run up to 39 AI on Spa with my rig (max is 49)
Sound - top draw

The career mode is a bit of a wash and rather ambiguous.  A missed opportunity to explaining all the rules around the series, particularly pit stops and driver stint times.  I've played through up the Spa 24 hours in the endurance season but bailed when I saw it was only going to give me 15 AI to race against for 12 hours (the game features optional time acceleration).  Thankfully the game has an excellent mid race save feature which makes doing endurance races against the AI a doodle, especially as they are good at observing blue flags, so I setup my own.  This allows you to run a few hours at a time, or whatever you have time for.  If you want to realistically create the 2018 or '19 Blancpain GT series (sprint or endurance) you will need to use the championship mode.

The longer races are where the game really comes into its own.  The way the tyres and changing fuel load come in play over the one hour stints you'll be doing is excellent.  Once your safety rating is high enough you can take what you have learned online into the official competition server.  These currently host 1 hour races with no pit stops.  For something less formal there is a quick join multi player option which will link you into publically hosted servers based on preferences you can set in the options.  

My biggest gripe at this stage is the AI pace in the wet which I have found to be stronger than their dry pace which makes races in changing conditions more challanging than they should be, and when the rain arrives its already challanging enough!  They can also be prone to dive bombing you in the breaking zones so pay attention to your mirrors.

54,56269658,english,"In short ACC is an awesome simulation!

That of course comes with some compromises. It may not be suted for casual driving as you need at least some time to get your head around all the aspects of the simulation. Also it is quite usefull to know the Blancpain GT format and at least some basic regulations or you might get frustrated. These informations unfortanetly are not all available in the game, they can be found on the forum though. Perhaps the biggest compromise you have to make is the restriction to one car class. So at least for now, if you do not like GT3 cars, then this is not for you.

If you like GT3 cars however, you are in for a treat. The focus on one single class allows for a much more detailed simulation. Many details could be tuned to the specifics of GT3 cars. There's the simulation of Traction Control and ABS for example, which is really advanced. Also the aerodynamics play a huge role and are much improved compared to Assetto Corsa (1). The Force Feedback in my opinion is much improved as well and gives a great control over the car. There is no artificial effects, just pure physics involved. Therefore only forces transmitted to the steering rack can be felt in the wheel, exactly like in a real car. This does not mean that you have no feel for the rear though as loosing grip on the rear also affects the front tyres.

The aspects of those advancements in physics really come to life in longer races. Tyre management becomes a huge factor. With the feedback trough the wheel and by adjusting TC and ABS accordingly it can be dealt with very well. Then the dynamic weather system can bring another aspect to racing. Especially in light rain, different tactics can work and the challenge of staying out on slicks can pay off in the end.

Racing against the AI is challenging as the AI behaves really plausible. Unlike many other games it will overtake you back when possible and you can have wheel to wheel racing over multiple laps. However, sometimes it will hit you at the rear, especially on corner entry, which can be a bit annoying. It brings an additional challenge trying to anticipate their movement and avoiding those contacts. This challenge can be rewarded with an increase in Safety Rating. Unfortanetly it can also be frustrating as every contact, even if its clearly not your fault, will cost Safety Rating.

The Rating System over all is a huge plus in my opinion. I find the ratings for consistency and car control especially usefull as they can help you in developing your driving style and ultimately in becoming a faster more consistent driver.

So all in all for everyone interested in a racing simulation this can bring a lot of fun. Racing offline or online (with the right people) gives a lot of immersion. You really feel like a racing driver. A big plus is that the default setups are really well built and as a starting point, appart from tyre pressures, need no tweaking. Especially with the aggressive presets it is possible to achieve very competitive lap times.

As with every simulation there are some shortcomings. The AI is really good but could be tweaked a little to avoid contacts. Admittedly ACC needs a powerfull PC. I personally never had any problem with performance, neither with an i5 (4690K) and GTX 970 - which certainly is no slouch but also not really high end - nor with an i7 (6700K) and GTX 1070. But I also only run one full HD monitor. The weather system could also be tweaked so rain and especially thunderstorms are a bit less likely to happen, right now it sometimes seems that it wants to show what is possibly as often as it can. I also think that for new users the UI should give more hints and e.g. the regulations should clearly be displayed in game. The good thing about Kunos is that they are constantly improving, so in half a year ACC will be even better than it is now. They are not the guys who leave a product unfinished.

Multiplayer is solid, but could do with a little restructure of the current ""Competition"" races, they should be run at set times, like every hour, and more variety of races, 30 minute and 1 hour races, maybe with pit windows as well etc. Currently the server opens, no way of seeing how many people signed up so you get a lot of people joining during practice, and leaving straight after when you see only 5 people inside. Also because the race start times are completely random, if you jump on you could have to wait up to an hour for the next race to start, if it was set times, would be much improved.

61,56191345,english,"You have to appreciate this game is limited in cars and tracks by the racing series it is based on. If you want more choice of cars and tracks then buy the original Assetto Corsa game which has several DLCs and community mods.

For me, having moved from AC to ACC I believe the car handling and physics to be superior in ACC. The tracks are more accurately detailed, it has a better tyre model for realism and after the v1.1 patch (with 2019 tracks/cars) it is a better overall game - especially the UI. The recent v1.12 patch brought new liveries for the cars which is a nice update as there is more variety on track.

One more thing I've noticed is that there is a good variety of cars on track in MP - there is no one ""go to car"" to dominate all others and on their default setups they are very similar in performance with some cars being better suited to slower twisty tracks and others to the high speed ones (without some serious setup tweaking).

My only gripe with ACC is that the VR GUI isnt as customisable as its predecessor AC - although the data provided in ACC is very good. 

By far one of this games biggest strengths is its sound, great in car and even better in replays, but as I said earlier the physics and the way car feels is a big improvement over AC.",1572638278,1572638278,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561197969575853,114,3,16271,0,12177,1595626873

That's include properly perform pit stop. Do yourself a favour and search online of 'HOW TO PIT IN ACC' and you can see a lot of confusing players. Notice that in Blancpain GT there are straight regulations of when to pit and what needs to be done (tyre change, driver swap, refuel depends on the length of the race). And every time when I fail something in the pit i will face a DQ. After some research online I thought I start to understand it and tonight it was my 'third' attempt trying to complete my 'first' race in career mode. It was a spring race. The pit menu came up and indicate I need to perform one thing on the menu. I choose tyre change and left all unchecked. Turn off the engine for my pit crew to start then another small menu pop up saying that my pit request was invalid. And after playing with the menu again I realised that I was actually required to perform one task PLUS a driver change while all the ai cars was gone and I went to the last position. Another attempt wasted. Is it too difficult for Kunos to include a briefing before the race, something simple like a written text on the loading screen so players won't waste their time guessing what needs to be done if they want their game to be SO AUTHENTIC and behold with all the straight regulations? Not to mention their god awful pit menu which will only pop up only when entering the pit. Even the old Simbin Race07 did this better which you can bring up the pit menu anytime you want on the track. And while in the pit others ai cars also stop in my box so I had no idea if those pit crew were working on my cars or not. If you want it to be authentic Kunos do it right.

76,45208556,english,"It's very early days so far and I'll be updating this review as things progress and more time is spent within the game...

I jumped on board at release 2, because No Vr No Buy Haha
After a frustrating hour trying to work out how to launch the game in VR, then how to navigate the menus in VR followed then by another 30 minutes trying to find a solution to not being able to select a gear I eventually got on track and it was good!!

Overall in my brief play time so far I can see a lot of potential but the VR control system needs to change, navigating using a wheel instead of mouse and keyboard is insane!
The dashboards in car, in VR for the most part are unreadable.

It's got a long way to go to be finished product, but the current cars feel and sound good, and the AI is already an improvement on AC.
Overall I'd recommend getting it right now even if you don't plan on playing it till launch, because you save money!!

[EDIT] 
So thought I'd update this review now it's getting closer to release. The VR experience still hasn't improved or at least not to the quality it was in AC.
You can now use a keyboard to navigate and enter things etc.
But simple things like setting up your controls, you're best doing on a screen because you still don't have the use of a mouse in VR.
The frame rate appears to be great on a solo play 90fps easy on the settings I'm running, add some AI and that number drops well below 60fps.
Not as yet tried multi-player, if the multi-player can hold 90fps that will do it for me. 

But the fact they still haven't fixed simply things like the user interface for VR users has me right now saying I wouldn't recommend this title.

[EDIT 2]

So it's now the day after release or to put it another way leaving Early Access.
I still wouldn't recommend it VR performance hasn't changed, still have no access to a mouse in VR meaning the new Career mode, I can't get past creating a team because it won't let me move from one box to the other to enter text.

I really think Kunos have screwed up big time on this game, everybody had such high hopes and it's turned out to be a complete mess, which is a shame because you really can see the potential here. But I don't think this will improve to a level it should have been released at for at least another year.

[EDIT 3]

Kunos are still putting out updates and things are improving slowly, but VR is still not even close to the quality it should be.
If you are running AI you are lucky to get 45fps, which means single player/career is out of the option.
You'll get 80/90fps around most tracks in dry weather if you are running solo.
Multi-player isn't as bad as single player with AI, you do struggle to get 45fps at the start of the race but by the end of the first lap you can be up in 80s again.

There's so many games with the Unreal Engine that run perfectly in VR, but Kunos are struggling with it for some reason.

Update 1.1 brings the 2019 cars along with the 1 new track from the 2019 IRL season - as well as a host of QOL features.

Game feels more optimized once again, and with the possibility to have larger grids, definitely getting towards what a lot of people were expecting from launch. Massively proud with how far this sim has come & I cannot wait to keep driving with the current content that we have & looking forward to the new tracks that are on the horizon!

Edit: Updated review as of 1.01.

NB: if you haven't tried already, using the beta 1.01 version removes game-crashing (for me, I definitely recommend until next week).

As I said in my previous review, it is still WIP even though it has officially been released, but there are a lot of great points to consider before you downvote.

Performance (at least on VR) has massively increased over previous builds, and this makes the whole experience massively enjoyable. Graphics haven't changed too much for me but I was perfectly happy with the results that I saw. The sounds are top notch on the newly released cars & ultimately industry leading at this point. The MP is amazing, being able to have 1hr ranked races is superb & something that will for sure be tweaked going forwards. The rating system is different to most 'ELO' based systems in its calculation (whilst you do still end up with 1 combined rating), but the attention to detail on this is amazing.

The price is probably a bit rich, but having being an early adopter, I feel that I have already gotten more than my moneys worth with this title. I would recommend using a wheel with this game as it was clearly intended for this - and luckily the rating system should clear out any keyboard players who lack control of their cars.

I run VR (oculus rift)/RTX 2080 & performance is great too, except for a few sudden stutters that I hope will be resolved in the next release or so.

95,54581529,english,"If you like racing in general and are able to have fun just doing that, than I can wholeheartedly recommend this driving simulator. The fact that I have played that many hours (at least for me) is partly due to my natural urge to ""push myself"" and as such this title is very, very rewarding.

The developers decided to concentrate on 1 specific series: Blancpain GT3, forcing you to focus on a particular series cumulating in currently 10 (laser scanned) tracks and 18 cars from different manufacturers.

That, in turn, encourages you to actually learn the specifics of each track as well as the different car characteristics in greater detail than you ""normally"" would.

As weird as it seems, it becomes almost automatically a never-ending learning cycle in trying to improve your own performance.
The ever-changing weather and track conditions due to the implementation of dynamic weather, does not allow you to rest on your laurels as it were. If you ever saw the real Blancpain GT series than you know that weather plays a big factor in every race.

Without going into great detail, it suffice to say that the individual cars are meticulously modeled and the underlying physics are top notch. You know when you push too hard or why you spun out. In the beginning its kind of daunting, but with the assistance of the build-in car control widget (amongst other widgets), you have a good indicator where you can/should improve your own performance at each individual section of the track.

There is an implemented rating system divided into 8 distinct ratings:
SA- safety rating
PC- Your outright pace measured against global leader boards of in game challenges 
RC- Your race craft
CC- Your car control
CN- Your consistency
TR- Your individual track competence
CP-Your Competition Server rating
TO- Your overall combined rating (ELO based)

At this moment, it is my understanding that RC rating is yet to be fully implemented, all others are operational. 

The SA rating determines which public MP servers you can attend, the higher the better obviously. It is not that hard to obtain a reasonable SA level through SP to start, although your miles may vary 😊. Lower ranked servers can be very enjoyable too btw.

To maintain or increase your SA rating requires sensible and consistent driving/ racing whether in SP or MP mode. GT3 races are usually closely fought battles, so don't get discouraged by the occasional ""hit"". Your SA is measured against your total mileage in-game, encouraging you to keep going, even when you can't win the race anymore. It can be infuriating at times, but that's racing for ya.

You're a bit of a car ""nut""? You'll be pleased to know that the title has telemetry build-in output which can be imported into MoTeC I2 Pro software, free of charge, enabling you to endlessly tweak the cars' setup. Let me stress that this is absolutely not a pre-requisite to be competitive, but it surely adds to the immersion if you're so inclined.

The title has managed to establish, in relatively short time, a dedicated following with some streamers committed to the title, which is great to get familiar with gameplay, online racing etiquette, car setups, other participants and just general topics amongst a group of people who share at least 1 passion.

Whilst joining a public multiplayer session is great fun, there are also a multitude of leagues available who have initiated a dedicated series to this title. (some have to put you on a waiting list..)

Not into Multiplayer sessions? The title offers a Single player championship mode and career mode as well as periodically updated challenges, quick race, practice, hotlap, hot stint, superpole, custom race and enduro modes, including adjustable AI. (adjustable in both strength and aggressiveness)

SRO, being the Blancpain GT series rights holder, organizes also an in-game special esports event based challenge where you can participate against the very best and where the winners will be ultimately rewarded with a track day in a GT3 Lambo.

Is it perfect? By no means, the title is still being actively developed, but if you have some time, a fairly capable PC and above all a healthy dose of common sense, then it will not disappoint.

On the topic of developers: they seem to be a bunch of car enthusiasts who dedicated themselves introducing to us a new sim title based on a (for them) new engine (UE4) coming with its own unique set of challenges. I, for one, applaud them for taking the risk of doing so and pushing the boundaries, rather than building a new title on its previously very successful AC engine. It also means that the title is still being developed to iron out some issues and fine tune the title. 

However, in its current rendition of Version 1.07, it reached a level of optimization, quality and maturity which prompted me to finally submit a review of this title.

You also can still look forward to a free update later this year where you will receive the cars and liveries of the current 2019 Blancpain GT series as well as 1 new track; Zandvoort. (the current version includes the 2018 series cars and tracks).

Even though it is not required, I must add that signing up to their forum is recommended, it certainly helps to find information about the title, cars, tracks, setups, leagues, get support or in case you want to discuss certain features. The in-game documentation is currently quite sparse.

FWIW, it is in my opinion recommended to invest in a steering wheel & pedals, if you got the means and the place. If not, no big issue because (gamepad) controllers, mouse & keyboards are supported.

Oh, did I mention that Crew Chief now also fully supports the game?



26/10/2019 update:

Version 1.1.1 released!

Huge update from Kunos:

- 6 new cars & 1 circuit: Zandvoort
- 2019 season added
- Optimization of the sim
- Build-in triple monitor support (use with NV surround recommended)
- RC rating fully implemented
- Implementation of year dependent surface grip of individual tracks
- Now MP races can accommodate up to 65 participants depending on track
- Inclusion of animated pit crew
- Mclaren 720 S GT3 included as a bonus car.
- Participation in the McLaren shadow project as a special challenge
- More data available through shared memory
- FFB improvement, especially when you'll find yourself off track
- Refined aerodynamics, especially notable when you're in a ""draft"".
- and much more, just check the official change log from Kunos.

Overall, the sim offers a more polished experience and keeps on maturing nicely.

This is definitely a must have for any sim racer or gt3 series fan. It's quite incredible for what it offers and the passion from the developers pretty much all but guarantees a continuous improvement of this gem. This sim is here to stay, no doubt.

Kunos has also announced the development of a DLC: the ICGT

Intercontinental GT additional tracks: (besides SPA, which is already included :-)
- Bathurst
- Laguna Seca
- Suzuka
- Kyalami

To be released early next year presumably.

- great level of detail in simulation
- laser scanned tracks
- most detailed car interiors and exteriors you will find in a racing sim

- great sound and acoustics in general
- extreme attention to detail in physics simulation
- plenty of setup changes can be made, Motec integration for the experts out there
- many active online racing communities who organize high quality leagues for ACC

- Car setup includes now explanation, but not as detailed as in AC1 for each and every attitude (i.e. camber , dampers etc...)
- Performace is OK, definitely increased for wet / night conditions. Even higher FPS with rain conditions than in dry conditions. 
- Excellent physics
- Excellent car & track graphics, with some exceptions. (i.e. glass building at Monza, which looks without any detail)
- Excellent sounds

v 1.0 Full game release is still buggy

Crashing game to desktop during Multiplayer Sessions. 

No sorting available for server list (example: sort number of players)

Matchmaking menu should be on same screen as server list.

Matchmaking filter not working correct. Results not matches the criterias.

Player rating criterias do not have effect for matchmaking except track medal ( which is ridicolous, because you only need to do 4 clean laps each track to earn the maximum available  track medals) , and Safety Rating.

The worst thing in ACC is the suddenly lost of rating points. If you are working hard to get a good safety- or track rating and then a few hours later the rating is completely lost, this is definetely not worth a ""V1.0 full game release"". 

Advanced Key Bindings are not shown up in the option menu.  Even by cycling F2 not all key bindings are shown up.

HUD customization not available.

Car setup , without any help, Compared to AC, every setting is supported by a helpful description.

Performance needs to be improved. Stuttering in MP sessions on Silverstone, sometimes other tracks  as well.

Totally reccomend if you liked Assetto Corsa, or like me grew up with GTR2 - if you're more towards arcade racing games (NFS  etc.)  well you have to expect, that the cars are not always gentle, tyres don't have always loads of grip and you can loose a race in two seconds (even though the electronics, like in the real GT3 cars help a lot). 
As I'm playing the game since early access I have to say Kunos made a huge improvement and with the 1.1 version it's worth all the money. There's also the Bathurst + Suzuka + Kyalami + Laguna Seca DLC coming, so enough fun is definitely guaranteed.
The pluses: Wonderful night/rain feeling, graphics, the physics are perfect as usual by Kunos and AI is a lot of fun in my opinion. The best is however that every car is completely different, you have to adapt yourself and your driving style. 
Minuses: Well Assetto Corsa was a bit different :-) No, I love vintage cars, road circuits, prototypes, also loved Hillclimb tracks + Nordschleife so I'm missing this kind of content, but as a Blancpain GT game, it's clear it cannot be included.

Being a huge fan of the Blancpain Series myself I had to play this game and my expectations were high coming from racing on a “simple” console for years with a controller. Bought a PC, bought a steering wheel and transformed my living room into my personal race car. What can I say after testing it for a while now: ACC didn’t let me down at all. Several aspects make this game a gem in any Steam-library:

- FFB is probably “softer” than in most other comparable games atm but in the mean time it feels great. You’re able to catch a sliding car, you feel the curbs... good job Kunos!

- The car models look, sound and feel awesome. As I am at various race tracks during the year I can confirm that Kunos paid really attention to little details here. Finally a race game where you could tell which car your driving solely by how it feels and sounds.

- Same goes for the tracks. Drive it and you know what I mean. Find a good car-track combination and you can just sit there and drive happily for hours even with no opponents around.

- The weather conditions are credible. Too many racing games where as soon as the rain comes the fun goes. Not here: find a good setup and driving in the rain becomes a great experience. Adding night time and you will feel challenged to keep the lap times up with all the standing water and reflections on the track. Love it!

- Free Updates: underestimated but seriously this makes the game so great - the devs listen to the community. Never have I seen it that addressed problems were solved in the next update. Plus you are given new free content like the whole 2019 season along with it. Kunos rocks!

- The community: finally a game where you don’t find the occasional idiots anymore. Maybe it has to do with the rating system but I haven’t had a single race online where someone just played bowling in T1 after the start. Overall the level of driving is very competitive yet you feel at home immediately. I found myself a nice private league in the mean time which is great.

- The rating system is making a better driver out of you if you pay attention to it. Whether it’s consistency, car control or overall pace: watch your stats develop and learn from mistakes. Another awesome feature.

-Performance problems during day / night transitions (and I'm running in 1080p with a GTX 1070) . 
-Limited track selection (but will improve over time). 
-Small online community. This is the wild card with this game. The community could grow, but that depends on how dedicated kunos is in the long run. Based on kunos' support for the previous assetto corsa, I'm not too worried. 
-Needs honest integration into the blancpain gt series. There should be race alerts, highlights, links to content and rules etc. This is a huge missed opportunity for the game. I purchased acc because I was already familiar with the blancpain gt series, but there's no reason why it can't work the other way around. The game should be heavily promoting blancpain.

- The transition between sessions gets bugged sometimes. 
- Unable to drag and adjust  HUD elements
- The minimap is small and the opponents appear blurry or semi transparent
- Few good looking liveries
- Lack of  feel of speed (visual effects)
- Setup Adjustments don't make a significant difference
- Lack of a more advance setup options (Project CARS 2 is the best setup system)
- Very few good tracks (only 4 are good tracks/circuits)
- There is not a tool to get a good Weather Forecast (You may get a dry session in Practice and Qualifying, but it gets annoying to have bad luck with rain on Race day) In real life, racers know the probability of rain the day before.

1. I wish one could skip the training section at the start of a Career if ones already done it.
2. Talking of Career when I choose the race details length etc and choose to start before the last corner instead of doing the full warm up lap. It does not save the settings I choose. I chose Practice to be 2x60 yet it reset back to 2x10 and  also I dont seam to keep my qualifying places either. And worst of all when the race starts it is set to full warmup lap even though I had chosen not to.  And of course if I reset and start again I have to go though the Training all over again. 
3. If there is a fast foward option to speed up a session I cant find it and even if you qualify on pole but choose to skip the session it puts you to back of the field.
4. The driver ai is good at 100% but if you slow it down to say 90% ( im not that great a driver ) the cars basicly stop in some corners or slow down drasticly in some high speed corners yet at some others they ram you up from the rear and I get a penalty point for that!

I was initially underwhelmed by the release version but now for your GT3  fix this is equal to any and maybe with the further promised optimisation and bug work it will become better than most.

There is no real career (just a placeholder) and no championship. Instead, there are game breaking bugs, which ruin your race.

The driver and cars update for the 2019 season was announced for summer 2019, which is also still the case in the game description on the store page. But in reality it will come in October when the season is ending, so that the new driver lists will be out of date right away.

Speaking about the store page... There are still phrases such as ""experience the real atmosphere of the GT3 championship"". No, you can't. No championship, no driver swap, no anything.
""will be set to promote eSports"" There is no considerable eSports promotion and also no player base to do actual eSports.
""Career, Championship and Free Play modes offer a complete and customizable gaming experience"" Ehm...no.
""also thanks to the tutorials"" Which tutorials?

I could continue about the not fullfilled promises the road map is showing, but I guess you got the picture. Now, there comes the biggest problem of all of that. While this is stuff you could argue, that they just poorly planned their time schedule and add the features at a later day, they just announced a new paid DLC.

When multiplayer and VR came they were disappointing to say he least.Multiplayer was a mess and VR blurry and with poor frame-rates.So historic reviews criticising these elements are probably largely accurate.

Release of version 1.0  carried over many of the EA issues and still felt like a late early access title. However version 1.0.7 brought an update to the tyre model which along with other updates and fixes finally brings the game to a point I'd be happy to recommend it even in VR!

Multiplayer code is solid although the ratings system needs tweaking as it's still allowing bad drivers to ruin races.
VR on my mid range machine (Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-4770K  NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080  ) is good.Best of all the new tyre model finally feels right with excellent feedback rivalling RF2.

60,54412695,english,"WARNING. LONG AZZZ REVIEW
EDIT: Message to the devs: I ____ing love you all for thinking about your players and PRE CONFIGURING controls for popular racing sim set-ups. The creators of BeamNG have a LOT to learn from your game. In fact, Beam has been out for so long that it is 100% clear that they do not care at all about the frustration their configuration options will cause to players that just want to drive. Please teach them a thing or two, so they might their stuff together and I can enjoy my automation creations (only reason I bought their damn game!)
For everyone else: This is a stellar title, and I didn't capitalize enough on this within my original review. I see the review focused on some of the negative points, and those are MOSTLY in comparison to my experience with the original. If you like racing games and have a wheel and pedals, play the damn game and try it already! The audio-visuals of this game are absolutely breathtaking and give me goosebumps. I complain about only playing on practice mode, and that is because this IS a difficult game. You will find yourself rage quitting and putting your set-up away only to find you'll drag the race sim stand back out in 10 minutes and try again. Something about this game really puts the hook in you and makes you want to practice your skills. Regardless, you should definitely give it a chance.
The good: The visuals, engine sounds, and pedal controls are pretty realistic and satisfying. It was also the first game I played with my g29, and thank god it was plug and play. Games like BeamNG have no automatic presets and require you to fight and curse at your controllers to configure them properly. This is what makes the difference in ""we care about you and want you to enjoy our game. At least, we want your upfront amount of trouble to be as little as possible."" And that is exactly what makes the not-so-great factors about this game more bearable. I understand that this game is supposed to be a simulator for driving GT3 and Superstock cars, but the simulation in terms of handling is a little off when you take realism into account, as thresholds are extremely sensitive and make this a challenging game to play. I've never raced a GT3 or SSt vehicle, fastest thing I ever drove was a street car. So I may have NO idea what I'm talking about by comparing the two machines.
The bad: This game stands in the shadow of the old Assetto Corsa, in terms of handling and drive-ability. When you love it, you really love it. However, when it starts getting annoying, be prepared to maaybe throw stuff. Sometimes this game does not cooperate whatsoever, and I find the lack of things to adjust in terms of realism to be extremely frustrating. You can still have fun playing this game, don't get me wrong. This is awesome for track-only racing sim, especially when you consider the graphics are great without modification, and your hardware should be automatically configured upon startup. I didn't have to make any adjustments with my set-up, at least. However, if you're coming into this with the expectation that it will be just like the original, you will be disappointed. If you're looking for a slightly different experience, this might be it. I do feel a little disappointed for the money I spent on this game*** in hindsight, because if you're like me, you'll find yourself playing more practice mode than campaign. Why? Well... play campaign for yourself and form your own opinions. Maybe for me, it's just not a good fit. I still have enjoyed little bits and pieces of it, however, and I'd advise you to put some play time in and formulate your own judgement.

The car handling is the most realistic I've ever seen/felt. The sound, the effects and the graphics are stunning (except of the missing spray of the drivers car and the ghosting at the back of the cars). Also the tracks are very well done and the AI is basically immersive indeed.
The biggest issue for me is the fact that Kunos obviously had to release a piece of unfinished art!
In the current state 1.0.7 there are still some topics to work on concerning mainly the singleplayer features for me as an offline driver:
- no possibility to share a car and swap with AI, so no realistic feeling of being part of the Blancpain GT Series in a race weekend
- no propper blue flag behaviour of the AI
- no consistent AI pace over all tracks - to slow on some tracks compared to real life/to fast at Brands Hatch -> I am quite on the spot to the real life laptimes on all tracks but my grid position varies from 1st to last on the different tracks
- partly bad AI behaviour/divebombing on some specific corners (e.g. Ford-Kurve on the N'Ring)
- to much definding by the AI apart from the dying laps of a race
- no spray on the drivers car in the rain
- And I really would like to be able to use my own name on the car and to be part of the driver lineup

A dynamic weather and lighting system adds to the feeling of endurance racing, with pit stops adding a tactical element to a race. Tyre and fuel use are critical to being competitive and both have been accurately modelled to add another layer of realism.

70,54572047,english,"How funny some of the negative reviews are. They are so way off the mark its untrue. In fact just look at the time played by some of these reviewers. Some have less than 2 hours playing. How on earth can you master a SIM with 2 hours practice? Thats like picking up a guitar and after 2 hours saying its rubbish because you cant play like Eric Clapton or going to the gym and being upset that 2 hours in you are still not ripped..
I have been playing over 200 hours and still not mastered it.

I Bought this title on day one release of beta last year, followed it through its development to where it is today (1.0.7), so know what i am talking about.

Firstly, about ACC:
This racing title is a SIM (as in simulating real racing), so those poor reviews obviously don't get this.
Lets get this straight, its not Forsa, Project Cars, F1 (pick a year) or any of the other car 'game'.
This is not for those kids who want to win a race on the first corner by barging through the field or who want to reset the sim when it doesn't go your way.
This punishes you for mistakes , but rewards you for racing well/fair. Go too fast into a corner and you WILL lose it.
You need to take your time and race fairly with structure and not just 'pedal to the metal'.

ACC covers the Blanc Pain calander so you wont find any cars or tracks not covered in that series so far (who knows, they might ad extras later though). So its obviously going to be restrictive in that field.

The untruths:
Firstly, VR. I use an Oculus Rift CV1 (and ONLY race in VR) and find this stable, clear (by updating pixel density in the menu) and more immersive than any other race title out there (and i own most of them). It runs surprisingly well too.
FFB is great. People have come to know and expect canned FFB. ACC has stripped it right back and what you feel is what the car and track are doing and what you would feel through a real wheel.
The career is there, but too be honest is a token gesture. Thats because gamers want it, where true SIM racers dont care about it because they want to race against humans and not watch cut scenes that dont mean anything at all.
People say the servers are empty. What a load of rubbish. I can rarely play on an evening and due to shift work may play early in the morning, afternoon, or evening and i am NEVER stuck for a game. Ok, its maybe not as busy as some out there, but the people that do race are generally decent sim racers who want a proper race and not just wreckers (although they are still out there on occasion),

What this SIM is:
Buy it and you will have one of the best racing experiences you can have whilst sat at your PC. Have a 30 minute race and battle it out with like minded people trying to overtake one another without contact and i can guarantee that you will be hyped and sweating and exhausted at the end of it. As i said, its a SIM, so dont buy it if you want a game. Its for the real racers out there.

What you get:
The BEST racing experience money can buy next to an actual track day.
Its also a one off payment and not something that you have to subscribe to.

Look, since this came out i have spent about £3000 on my sim rig, including full motion and a direct drive wheel. I would NOT have done this if the sim wasnt any good.

Those who are on the fence or who have not yet bought it and just reading reviews, then please give it a go, you wont be disappointed. Just dont expect a game.
Having said that, there is still lots of enjoyment to be had for those who love to mess around, hot lapping or just want a quick 10 minute race.

The graphics on this title are the best in the genre, as is the handling and physics including tyre model. The sounds have to be heard to be believed and carry so much weight you can feel the engine rumble.

Simply everything in ACC is better in terms of physics, tyre modelling, weather transitions, graphics, FFB, AI, the different feel of the GT3 cars. 

Kunos have worked really hard since the slightly problematic initial release to bring this title up to scratch and they have delivered. It is definitely more simulation than game and it requires more serious commitment to get the most out of it. The rating system is as challenging as it should be in my opinion and I am sure many of the negative reviews are from drivers who are unable or unwilling to adapt their driving style. If you just want to belt around tracks without much consideration for your own safety then this title is not for you. If you want to learn to drive as if you were responsible for an expensive GT3 car avoiding collisions and learning to be patient like a real GT3 driver then this is the sim for you. 

VR works perfectly well on my i7 6700 + gtx 1070 and I can run against 25 AI no problem.

Oh, but wait, there's more..... no matter how high end your PC specs (i7 9900, 32GB RAM and 2080ti) or how much you mess around with the graphics settings, the VR is so blurry and terrible that it gave me a headache. I cannot stress enough how awful the VR is! It's absolutely terrible with no redeeming qualities. I only race in VR so this is a dealbreaker for me.

Add to that the lack of matchmaking and all other other things we were led to believe and you struggle to believe that this sim was brought to you by the same guys that brought you the amazing Assetto Corsa! 

IMHO it has been released too early and Kunos has been made well aware of what we wanted via FB, Twitter and their own forums but they chose too ignore everyone.

Me? I don't really care about the matchmaking and other stuff. I would've been happy with a game that had half-decent VR and mouse support for menus.

I can't recommend this broken pile of garbage right now because any other sim is far better as it stands.

Edit: So they finally added some mouse support (VR is still pure junk), so I go in to set up a server. Lo and behold, it's the same impossible to use nightmare it was in Assetto Corsa. Just no effort has gone into this at all.

I think they don't realise that it's 2019 and every sim has made the setting up of a room/lobby/server an easy, enjoyable experience. Not ACC! They've made it such an awful experience that it turns you completely off bothering at all with ACC.

Honestly, I want so badly to love this sim but they make it impossible. It's a rushed, undercooked piece of garbage as it stands. I know there's people trying to play it with all the issues, but it really is full of dealbreaking issues.

If you're looking for a good sim, there's far better out there. Give this a miss at least until some of the issues are sorted and there's some way to set up a server that doesn't require a large I.T. team and pure luck to get going, because right now, it's pure junk and nothing more.

Update:

So there's been a few updates released and none of them mention the horrible VR.
I went to the ACC forums and saw that some people had already brought it up.

One in particular thread simply asked if there were any plans to fix the VR since Kunos avoid mentioning it, and of course, Lord Kunos himself jumps in and tells the guy he's trolling... TROLLING!! for asking if the broken game they released is ever going to be fixed!
It looked like they banned him after that.

An enormous amount of people agreed with the issues that were brought up (including the guy that makes Crew Chief) and added more issues to the list, but Lord Kunos literally said that most people agree it's working fine.... despite the vast majority in the very thread he said that, agreeing the game is all sorts of broken!!! Deluded or what?

Kunos clearly bully anyone who brings up any issues they are trying to avoid so there's your answer. Don't dare expect to have a working product or ask for help.

Kunos' official statement:

""We know the game is a broken mess, but we're lying and telling you that it's all fine and working perfectly. If you disagree, we will bully you and have people harass you.""

This is no different to their attitude on Assetto Corsa. I checked the forums and Lord Kunos has the same attitude there; any questions or criticism of AC and you'll get the same result as this poor dude.

To clarify, it's not just the VR that's a mess, there's tons of things wrong with this game.

Thanks goodness AMS has announced their sim. It'll be nice to support someone who cares about their product.

86,44852663,english,"Updated Review at V1.07 - now recommended.

With the v1.07 update and new tyre model I now recommend this game as worth getting.  If you are looking for a great driving experience with exceptional wheel feedback and track feel - especially in wet conditions - this game is now great.  The handling of the cars is pure genius.

The career mode still requires further work but that is said to be on the way.

In even better news VR is now working perfectly, locked to 45fps on the Oculus Rift (9900K, 32gb, 1080Ti).  Night, wet racing is atmospheric and absorbing.  The graphics are superb and the AI behaviour means they race firmly and fairly.

https://youtu.be/2TOa88m0CEA

It took a few updates to get here from launch but now we are seeing what is truly possible with this game.

------- Previous Launch Review ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

Unfortunately, I can't recommend the full release at this time. If anything it's a step backwards for VR which is now blurry at distance.

To be fair the wheel feedback and feel is exceptional when hot lapping and if you only play on a normal screen with a decent 4k PC the experience is good some of the time.

However I have experienced:

- Random FFB loss, in special events and career.

- Massive framerate drops when the online rating system connects.

- The online rating system only working intermittently.

- Leaderboards working, then dropping and being wiped several times.

Career mode is inconsistent. The introduction video makes out that the player is joining a Lambo Young Driver Programme and will have to demonstrate competence at all sorts of realistic race driving. In reality this is just a 3 stage hotlap challenge in the dry, wet and at night. There is no explanation that car setup, fuel and tyre setups are required. There is no 'young driver' programme or training it's just 3 fastest lap shootouts to determine a driver medal and the teams who are likely to sign the player. The career races are interesting but the need for a pitstop to change driver is once again not explained anywhere - the knowledge of what will happen next is just assumed.

Career mode is unbalanced in 'normal' difficulty AI cars produce laps in free practice 2-3 seconds faster than they go on to record in qualifying sessions.  At night and in wet races the AI either perform far too well or terribly, which creates unbalanced racing.

In typical Kunos style there is no on screen explanation as to when an event has ended. End a race and quit and all progress is lost. Unfathomably clicking the Timing Screen reveals a Next Event option. Nowhere is this explained or mentioned. 

Again being totally fair handed the racing with the AI in career mode is excellent but the player has to do a lot of trial and error to get that to work. Career feels like a rushed add on at this point.

Unless GT3 racing is your passion (in which case you probably already own this game) I suggest you wait 3-6 months until the game plays more smoothly and the career mode has been give some polish. Avoid for now if for VR. I you just play on a normal screen with a decent 4k ready PC and value wheel feedback above all then yes it's just about worth giving a go at the moment.

If ever a game needed a 'not yet' rating on Steam this is it.

Previous Early Access comments from v0.2 build:

Updated review for release 2. Now * cautiously * recommended for the hardcore sim racer who is prepared to be patient with the ongoing development.

Version 2 is a big improvement:

+ VR is now enabled and once you figure out how to get it working and your wheel configured to operate the UI menu it is already an excellent VR experience at this early stage. It should go without saying you'll want a decent VR PC to run this game.

+ Steering feel is vastly improved with some great feel and feedback through the wheel. V1 was F1 2018 steering feel, V2 has added back in the track feel and feedback.

+ The drying track hotstint shows the potential this game has, the way the grip increases throughout the session.

A promising start but if you're expecting anything like a polished finished product best to wait for more updates.

I'm a huge Blancpain fan and the idea of a licensed game by Kunos was amazing and half of the game is amazing. It looks great, sounds incredible, all the cars are surprisingly fun and unique to drive for a single class series. But that's where it ends.

I want to keep playing but there's no real reason to. The Career mode is baffling to say the least. You start with a test in a Huracan ST, it assigns you a rank based on your performance and then arbitrarily lets you pick a car for your team for which you get a really disappointing Black/Red livery. There's no championship point's you just get a ""trophy"" for each even until the Sprint Series abruptly ends then its ""Surprise 3 hour endurance race now!""

95,54427092,english,"I went back an forth with a yes/no for recommendation. It has it's positive marks, but there is a lot dragging it down.

POSITIVES:
* The graphics are great...though there are times(like some weird unrealistic haze effect in the game) where I prefer Project Cars 2  graphic engine. Overall, it's very pretty. 

* The weather effects are amazing. The night mode is black out dark and isolating. The rain is very well done and downright scary. I haven't seen that the rain builds up puddles and stuff making you adjust the racing line for fear of hitting one of them and losing control of the vehicle, but I haven't played with the rain mode enough yet to say for sure.

* The AI is pretty good to fight with. 

* Overall enjoying the sounds in the game.

* Though some have said it's unplayable with a gamepad, someone posted some great setting that make it feel great when I tried it...though...this title does scream for a wheel. 

NEGATIVES:
* This is not Assetto Corsa: What I mean by this is they don't do much to differentiate this title. If you haven't been following the development process, you may purchase this game hoping for Assetto Corsa 2. This game is set to very defined segment of racing. There aren't a lot of tracks or cars. This all up to consumers educating themselves as well though, but the developers engagement in media and such has been fairly mild. In other racing titles you keep tripping over new stories, social media posts etc to really make you feel educated and excited about the title. I don't play multiplayer much, but it's all over youtube that the numbers have declines from thousands to hundreds and sometimes under 100 people utilizing multiplayer.They have been apparently been acquired by a big company, so that may be why they are so quiet.
 
* Career Mode:  If you are looking for a career mode, don't bother. What is there is a hastily mashed together mess that loses it's appeal with 5 minutes. There is no real sense of engagement or pull to make you want to keep playing. This mode requires significant retooling to give sense of progression and connection with a team etc. Not suggesting anything like F1 2019, don't need to pretend to sit with agents etc.

* Replays: Working with replays is a bit of a pain. You cursor stays on the screen and the controls pop back up all the time. They also haven't learned from their earlier title in removing the racing line from replays(though it is gone is some views). 

* Content:  It's weak, but this game IS a trick pony being highly focused on one part of motor sport. There is room to grow within the segment though with tracks and such, so hopefully DLC will come. Unlike Assetto Corsa, there won't be any modding as it's apparently hard to do with the Unreal Engine and I believe there is an an agreement with Blancpain to not allow modifications.

* Player Customization: This is a small thing, but the digital displays on the windscreen never show players initials, only the real life drivers initials. Would be nice if this showed your initials. Though, this may be due to legal reasons.

* Overall: This feels rushed out to meet a schedule, maybe Blancpains. I'm hoping there is still a lot of work going on and patches coming out that will make this feel like a full exciting title(career mode...*cough*). I'm thinking they will be coming, but you never know, in the event the title doesn't get fixed from it current state, this is NO from me till you can find in a bargain bin somewhere.

While there is no guarantee, I do believe ACC will be developed hugely throughout couple of years adding more and more content on the go.

Probably the best feature I enjoyed is when it gives you tips on how to improve your driving in quite easy way. It shows details on your current progress and where do you need to improve in order to bring your driving to the best. Obviously, there are things to improve, but I am quite sure that will come along the way.",1563104476,1563106223,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False,76561198091071598,67,8,3998,33,359,1601821390

- FFB is much worse than in original part
- Optimization is teriible: with min settings 1080p (and ofc the picture is awful in that case, blurry and extremely aliased) the game runs worse than original AC maxed out 4k. (I doubt if there is any UE4 optimized game at all, why the hell they needed this crappy engine?)
- UI customization is almost absent
- No triple screen support (and they won't add it. yep, they just don't know how to do it in UE4 (it's been posted by one of Kunos' members on official forums). yep, they've made sim racing game(!!!) using engine than does not support multiple screens rendering, sic!)
- Rain drops looks terrible
- 3.5 players in mp, that is why no matter what safety rate do you have you will still play with rammers because there are just not enough players
- And yes, it still crashes all the time


- The only good thing from the first game that is still present - great physics. Definitely one of the best on the market. 
- Night and rainy races are awesome (but I still prefer dry races, so not a big advantage for me)
- Cars and tracks are great  

I don't recommend this game. It's stiil EA despite of v.1.0+ and I hardly believe things will change. I bought this game at EA start and all  the problems are stiil here.

22,53571675,english,"This is not a bad game, nor a review in which I am going to complain a lot. I actually enjoy playing this! So far, the driving is pretty fun. I enjoy it, but I still enjoy the original AC's driving more. Maybe this is because I don't know how a GT3 car should drive, idk. That's definitely a possibility. But all I know is I have more FUN driving cars in AC (and there is more variety, especially given the insane number of high quality mod cars and tracks for the original).

ACC does have a decent player base for now, and it's easy to get into a relatively competitive race right off the bat (unlike the original AC). I've definitely had fun racing online in this game!

The graphics and sound are very nice - it's definitely a fun game to look at and hear. The transmission and drivetrain noises, in particular, are very immersive - just like watching a 6H of Silverstone onboard livestream :)

The main problem with this game is that it feels unfinished. You can't save during a race weekend, and the career mode is just the championship mode with some practice days thrown in. There are apparently still many bugs (although my personal experience has been relatively clean so far). I would have expected more considering the resources that went into this game.

I've never driven a GT3 car but I've heard rumors that the cars don't totally feel like real GT3s yet. I'm not saying the physics are BAD... just that you should not expect some god-like simulation (like you might expect it by being the official Blancpain game). I have no idea how accurate these claims are, and I will leave it up to you (and to far better real-life drivers than myself) to decide on this point. I would say that this is a much better sim than something like PCars 2 (a game I do still like), but not as good or nuanced as rFactor 2 or the even original AC.

If you LOVE GT3 racing you should probably own this game, as there is definitely good racing to be had! The cars, sounds, circuits, etc. are all reproduced with great detail. I enjoy this aspect of the game very much. Immersion is important to me in a sim racer, and this is why I still enjoy PCars 2 and have bought a VR headset... etc.

*** BUT: if you're just looking for a great driving simulator, and you don't already own the original Assetto Corsa... do yourself a favor and LEAVE THIS PAGE RIGHT NOW and go buy the ORIGINAL ASSETTO! The ultimate edition with all DLC is under $20 right now! And if you want to just try the base game, it's under $7! And then do yourself another favor and google ""content manager"" and ""Sol Mod"" for AC. Even if the sales are over by the time you are reading this, the original AC is 100% worth full price.

*** My final verdict - I'd wait to buy this game at the current price, unless you are a die-hard GT3/GT racing fan - which is why I'm giving it a ""YES - do recommend"" rating. I'm happy that I bought it early in the EA period, when the price was reduced, because it makes me feel like I have gotten my money's worth. This is definitely not a bad game... it just has big shoes to fill. Hopefully this game will improve and it will be worth full price in the future. But as of now, if you don't own and play the original AC, you'd be a bit of a fool for buying ACC over the original. If this game was on sale, I would definitely recommend it to a friend! If there was a rating between ""would recommend"" and ""would not recommend,""  I would have selected that for this game. It just depends on how much you like GT3 cars/Blancpain-style racing and at what price you are buying ACC at.",1562271907,1562272055,True,5,1,0.565231800079345703,0,True,False,False,76561197966163324,444,16,998,0,663,1577670352
23,53566448,english,"Yet again, this is a title over which I have a quandry regarding whether to tick ""yes"" or ""no"". I purchased it during the EA period and found the only feature that I think makes this game stand out very quickly - I really like the way that it gives you feedback during a lap as to where you are doing well and where you aren't. But... Yes. There are many ""buts"".

The fact that this is a commercial tie-in with the Blancpain series (which I really struggle to find coverage of in the UK) really limits the title's scope. It's a small number of tracks, a small number of vehicles and how much scope for expansion this will have compared to competitors is difficult to see, given that lock-in with a very specific series that only races a single class of vehicle.

The modelling and graphics are very nice, it apparently supports ray-tracing on my RTX card (darned if I've seen any yet, but that's another but...), it seems to handle well, to someone who has never driven a real track-spec GT car in his life, but it's also incredibly bland and lifeless to race offline. I'm sure the online community would be more lively, but I struggle to find online races that I want to/can join, so haven't even managed to do so yet. There's been a lot of complaint recently about the safety rating system and the fact that apparently everyone received a huge 'ding' on it not too long ago. I wasn't involved, but that doesn't seem to have been handled very well either.

Overall, yes, I like what I've seen of ACC. I like driving it, I like looking at it, but is it going to become my primary racing sim? No. I don't think it will. Certainly not while it is so limited in content. It's also still quite buggy, but as updates are coming thick and fast at present, whether that will be the case by the time you are reading this is open to debate.

Pros:
1. The cars handle and behave great.
2. The tracks are great. Laser scanned and have tremendous sense of realism. 
3. The day to night transitions, the wet track, it all looks great and you can feel the difference. 

Cons:
1. Physics are kinda odd at times, when an AI car bumps you it sends you spinning and the AI behaves like a tank. 
2. Career mode is a big, BIG disappointment. No real meaning to it, just running races with no kept track of points or progress. You can't even adjust the AI to suit your skill level to create the right challenge. You actually can't even adjust the AI in career to begin with. On Normal Difficulty I would be 3-4 Seconds a lap faster, when restarted career, I was 4-5 seconds slower. Needs adjustibility to tune correctly.
3. Online servers. The competition server only runs one at a time. 1 hour legnth races which is fine, but you have to practice and can not join during qualifying. Which I don't mind, however having a busy schedule it will be hard to find time to run that. Maybe have a few sprint style 20-30 minute races would work best. Especially with people who have busy schedules. Participation has dropped so much recently. So maybe if they do some updates people might come back
4. VR support is horrible. Optimization is needed, However, I won't gripe too much. Because with my monitor I can run epic settings no problems. I can't even run low setting with more than 45 FPS. So VR is not worth it for the time being. 

Bottom line. It is a great sim. It has it's fair share of problems. Which after the Early Access period, most of the problems which should have been fixed before calling it 1.0. Some are still there. They really should have taken more time in EA to fix the most basic of problems. They wanted to have the game out by a certain day and rushed 1.0.

33,51245809,english,"ACC 1.04, Definitely is not a finished product, far from it. It would be a 0.8b, no more.

Firstly, It must be said that the purchase of Kunos Simulazioni by 505 has sadly affected negatively the philosophy of Kunos and therefore the AC saga. Now it is clear that the financial goal has the priority, a release date was set, and even though the game was not finished, it was pushed on to release.
Disappointedly, Kunos never finished AC; no keyboard use during race menus, no racers names nor UI on VR, cars were never finished or rushed out (check Lamborgini Miura or Sexto Elemento, Nissan Skyline, BMW M3, as instances of many more). The only reason for leaving all the purchasers without a finished product was to focus on ACC and sell a new game, which is somehow acceptable, yet someday we deserve a finished product. Though, this is a dishonest policy which has been accepted by the game developers and outrageously in general by software developers: release beta products, use gamers (users) to finance and develop the soft, never finish it, and start a new one which is just an evolution of the previous one. A clear example is Slightly Mad Studious and the infamous Project Cars and Project cars 2, and surprisingly Kunos follow suit.

Secondly, even though ACC has all the cars, tracks, UI VR, multiplayer and the most desired rating system, the game still a beta. So let's check some issues:

A.- Save Career or Championship. The main purpose of the game is to simulate Blancpain GT Series races, championships, a career or just competitions online, therefore it supposes to follow Blancpain GT Series format and rules. Sprint and Endurance races are simulated, yet there is no ""save"" possibility in either Career nor Championship, so how on earth a gamer can do an entire weekend in just one sat in front of the screen? Nobody at Kunos thought about it? I think they did, yet they needed to rush the release, so the game was not finished though it was release without consideration toward the buyers.

B.- Huge crashes, no just a couple of frozen screens , but entire system reboots. It seems that patch 1.04 has stopped those crashes, although they released the game knowing it was not stable, money talks.

C.-  Impossibility to ignite the car during pit stops. Release 1.03 was suppose to fix this issue, yet today, running version 1.04, I was racing in Career mode, Practise 1, Practise 2, Qualifying 1, Qualifying 2, Race 1, and everything to the trash because the car won't start after the mandatory pit stop. Thank you Kunos! NO respect for the hours I spent up to that moment. Therefore now I have to use ""automatic"" ignition.

D.- Rating System. Why have Kunos implemented a Rating System? In theory to help us racers to learn how to drive better, faster and safer. I am 110% supporting it, actually it is one of the features I was looking forward, and I thank Kunos for implementing it because I've learnt a lot about my driving style, be more respectful while racing, etc. Though, the Rating System is always controlling you, even when you are just practising new setups in new cars in new tracks, what I mean is how are we going to learn to setup the car from zero if we know that a mistake can cost us Rating points because the car will be out of balance? We have to practice with different setups in order to learn what they do, how they alter the car's behaviour. Also, what happen if my offspring wants to play? Destroy my Rating for sure. This circumstance has been thought by Kunos, there is a choice in the main menu, ""driver"" although does nothing, you cannot change drivers, nor alter the content, so it is not implemented yet, because it is not a finished game.  An every time the game crashes, freezes, turns my VR blue, etc. the Rating suffers negatively. C'mon Kunos, it's your fault, not mine.

E.- Setup information. Does Kunos want us drivers to improve our driving skills? So why no information whatsoever about what every option in the setup menus does? How are we going to guess what Engine map is better or which ones are for wet or dry? No info, nothing. But of course the info is available via forum and hours to spend looking for it, instead of putting all that info into the game itself. Not a finished product.

F.- VR. Many, far too many issues here. I have a pretty decent rig: i7.8700 2.20GH, Gigabyte Z370 Aorus UltraGaming, 32GB RAM 10Lt (80% free), Optaine acelerated  Game only HD, and a nVidia RTX2080Ti  Gaming OC 11GB and I need to reduce drastically the graphic settings if I want to have a decent FPS, still the stuttering though, turned blue goggles in the middle of a curve, the game keeps on but I see nothing. Furthermore, every time I need to take a leak, when I return I am out of the game, some pop up window tells me that there has been 120secs blablabla, so start back again. Not finished game.

G.- Winning races. Don't win races, it is worst. If by a hard suffered long effort racing you win a race in Career mode, then you'll be stock in a horrifying screen: white sky with several trees hanging on it, no land nor surface nor track, and a crystal clear menu with a lower right caption that states to press Escape. So keep pressing it to see the same horrifying screen over and over and over and over ... If you are quick enough and dexterous you'll be able to see the main Escape menu and choose exit. Not finished game

H.- Multiplayer Online. I haven't even tried. How can I bother other drivers with all the crashes, frozen screens, Ignition failures, blue VR goggles, etc. Does Kunos want me to be hated by my fellow racers?

Finally, I am lucky I was an early beta supporter, because the game still beta and I paid the money of a beta game. But those of you who are thinking about, or worst, you bought the ""final"" release, the money you paid or will pay for ACC v1.0 is not worth it yet, still a beta.

Kunos, please, return to your original philosophy, racers deserve to race joyfully, be respectful with us, finish the game, release a final product, and while you are at it finish AC too, we have been waiting patiently.",1560633855,1562153588,False,95,3,0.822519123554229736,28,True,False,False,76561198128943126,118,5,9963,38,6251,1601662109

You're much better off with the original AC, so much content - mod what you need, and its a bit easier to find better MP racing.  

And it's definitely not optimized for VR.  And I've switched to VR completely for driving sims.  Not sure I would change my review if it were but it'd be a closer call.

48,53021410,english,"A really good game if you are looking for GT racing experience. Graphics, while not the best, have been significantly improved from AC. Car models, especially interior, where, let's face it, you are going to spend the majority of your time, are done very well. Sound design is another area where this game excels, at least for the cars that I have raced, sounds seem to be well placed, and you get enough to know what is going on in the car. Force feedback works well, although, this is something I can only judge for myself, but I have not had any trouble driving in the most challenging of conditions so far, and that is largely due to adequate feedback. Tracks and track details are adequate for a sim, and this is a sim, which is the games distinguishing factor from Forza, Gran Turismo and Project Car titles. Which brings us to physics, which aren't perfect, and the damage model is still missing, but as far as driving physics go they are exactly where you would expect from a dedicated racing simulator maker.

I am continuing to play though the game a bit at a time, I can say that overall I really enjoy the experience, there are certainly things that can be better such as off track and shortcut detection as, from my humble experience marshaling FIA, Blancpain, WEC, IMSA, Indy, Creventic and other series just doesn't quite work the way that the game simulates. Another thing that is not always clear are the tasks you are asked to complete during the testing days. Testing days are awesome, but since it's held on tracks that you may never have driven before, I feel like I should be allowed to practice and learn the track before trying to get the fastest time in a session or putting in consistent laps. F1 series does this well, where you can go out and practice, and when you feel you have learned the track, or warmed up, or adequately got a feeling for the conditions, you can come back into pits and go gather the data that your team is looking for. One more thing, off the top of my head, when you go into the setup menu and choose a setup, it really ought to be more clear that the setup is applied, and what the applied setup is. None of this makes the game unplayable or anything.

The game obviously continues to be developed and evolves, there are some really good signs and I can't wait to see for what will get improved next.

The multiplayer is generally good, the matchmaking works quite well and I would say 60% of races are clean, at least at my skill and safety level (80+).
Competitive servers are even cleaner but the race tends to be a little long at 60mins, i think the ideal length would probably be 45 mins.

Apart from that, the game runs well most of the time, night seems to kill fps though.
One thing that could make the game a little more engaging would be a few scheduled races or leagues by the devs to bring a lot of players to the game at one time so there are fully clean and fast servers full of people.

There should be a report system so that you can report someone for taking people out on purpose or perhaps being particularly rude in the chat.

Given that Kunos will update it to the 2019 championship, theres still some hope but this game just needs some more players.

HOWEVER .. 

The sim continues with the same beauty which Kunos found and developed in Assetto Corsa. 
Beauty as in the effort put into recreating this stunning circuit and the GT3 Huracan.
Now intoducing into the mix the Unreal Engine 4 .....EVERYTHING..... looks absolutely breathtaking ... Its actually hard to describe how good the sim looks now compared to Kunos's last outing ( GO LOOK UP SCREENS --FAPFAP ).

While speaking about the beauty of the sim ...WEATHER ! The ever so glorious implementation of weather... A full 24hr cycle and crisp dry tracks all the way to the heavens opening up in the middle of the night. Thus allowing for a spectacular racing experience and immersion only rivaled for me in Pc2. Along with that the addition of the wet stuff adds a whole new dimention to the already great sim racing giant. Slipping and sliding around the german track.

The sim runs superb at present ( Strix 1080ti - 1440p ) although it is prone to a few frame drops and the odd graphical glitch every now and then. 

Physics wise i feel like the Hurican now has more weight to it when pushing around the track. Almost like the tyres can be felt to flex and give way alittle ( feels soo good ) im using a t500rs so the forcefeed back may be a different experience for others.
Driving in the rain is a real challenge, its not just a case of put wets on and then push away. The track is out to eat you at every bend, As you try to fight the mighty lambo's rear end while slowly applying the throttle out of the corners.

The next update brings VR which for me will be a huge milestone .. along with a new car and track + super pole and other settings.

85,51951495,english,"I was a little bit late with buying the original Assetto Corsa.
That might be a part of the reason why I bought Competitizione on day 1.
Of course I am aware of the quite limited offerings for the first version, but I didn't feel like anything was missing yet.
At that time in 2018, I was still gaming on a pretty bad laptop. Which, surprise surprise, couldn't run Competizione.
Assetto Corsa Competizione has been played by me for over half a year, via Geforce Now. That gamestreaming service that only works half of the time and gets worse with every update.

But anyhow. I got a new pc about a month ago. Which featured an RTX 2060 with an i5 9400f.
This was a huge improvement, After 30 hours of gameplay I was finally able to play ACC with a steering wheel!
Great right? Well, not exactly.
At the time I was still using my old Logitech Wingman. Unfortunatly, it broke the first time trying to play ACC.
This may sound like I am blaming ACC for breaking my wheel, wich of course isn't the case. It still was a funny coincidence if I look back.
One amazon purchase later and I had a new wheel. A thrustmaster T80. Really happy with it, but not turning this into a review for a wheel.

Assetto Corsa Competizione instantly recongnized my wheel and calibrated it for me. It worked, but my personal prefenrences for saturation are a tad different.
So I set up the weel and started with the Aston-Martin.

First of all, the part that most people will see first, the graphics. Short answer, they are amazing. Long answer they are extremely beautiful. My pc had no problems running ACC and it looked amazing.
If you also take the amazing sound design in account, you have the best looking racing game there is.

The physics didn't take long to get used to. Just like the first Assetto Corsa, it felt really natural getting behind the wheel and turning the assits further and further off every lap you drove a car.
The AI is good most of the time, but it's a shame that when they make a mistake, they always manage to take out the player with them.

Overall, Assetto Corsa is an amazing GT3 simulator worth every penny. The sound design is great and it looks fantastic.

- Don't take the version number seriously At the moment (v 1.0.5) this still feels like early access
- Career mode is just a series of events without story. At the moment I'm ignoring it.
- AI sometimes brakes unnecessarily hard at places you wouldn't expect (i.e blanchimont)
- Safety Rating can't be disabled in Single Player, so if you want to have a blast with the AI you'll need to be extra carefull if you don't want to melt your rating.


Now to the positives:
- Kunos is known to support their products until they have good quality 
- Driving feel and immersion (the sound!) are exceptionally good (compared to iracing and rfactor2)
- Every car feels different and needs different driving approaches
- Graphics is mostly excellent
- Rain simulation is great


I'll recommend it for the phenomenal driving expierence and simulation quality. However expect an early access like quality of the ""game"" part.

98,44710697,english,"[u]Current review is as of September 13, 2018.[/u]

As an avid racer of the original Assetto Corsa, I was optimistic about what this would bring, especially with the Blancpain liscense they have been given. At the moment, with only one car, one track and a couple of modes available, there is not that much to currently talk about. However, so far it has to been an extent the Assetto Corse we all know and I imagine a lot of us love.

The graphics for a sim are amazing and I am so far impressed with the lighting at night especially and the addition of adverse weather is a welcome feature. Although content is limited so far, I'm enjoying the sounds of the Huracan GT3 and the driving itself for the most part. The car feels weighty as is expected, however I feel at the moment that the force feedback is lacking details -- expecting future tweaks on that. Also, in my opinion, I think the car is a bit too grippy in wet conditions and more difficulty could be added. I have not played long enough to comment deeply on the AI, but if you have played the original Assetto Corsa, they are not that much different.

Overall, I am optimistic as to what this can bring in the upcoming months. Obviously, work needs to be done ironing out the details and bugs. I had a case in a recent AI race where one driver begun to slow down (did not look like a mechanical) and stopped in the middle of the circuit and other drivers just parked behind him and did not pass. It is these sort of little annoyances I expect to be fixed in the future.

There will be more to come later, but if you were a fan of the original Assetto Corsa; this is one to keep an eye on.",1536836900,1561779236,True,3,0,0.528571426868438721,0,True,False,False,76561198091758520,102,3,22304,855,430,1601985989

https://i.imgur.com/CCZfjcA.png

I have deleted that review since this game deserves the 1.0 review so this is my review of the release version of the game.

[h1]First off.[/h1]
Do as you wish but would you rather listen to somebody who has less then 2hrs in game or somebody who can tell you by their game time and their experience how the game is :)

[h1]This 1.0 release is deffinetly not the FINAL build of the game.. developers have said they do plan to develop the game further and they have plans to expand on content. will touch on that later..[/h1]

I have been following the game since the day they showed us the trailer and till this day i have been reading forums and every single post litterally :D (i know no life bla bla)

I am big fan of the game for couple of reasons. I LOVE GT3 cars...  This game introduced me to Blancpain GT Series witch i have been following last 4 years. And its a great journey.. Amazing races.. crown jewel of them is SPA 24h  my dream now is to attend one of those :)  

Back on to the game review:

[h1]Content[/h1]
1.0 version of the game brings [b]Official 2018 season[/b] content.. witch means [b]10 tracks and 18 cars[/b](13 manufacturers) 
and already confirmed  [b]FREE UPDATE[/b] later this year of 2019 season witch will bring 1 new track  and 6-7 new cars confirmed by far.

[h1]Tracks[/h1] laserscaned so you can feel every bump while driving.. 
[h1]Cars[/h1] each car has its own personality whole different driving adjustment when you switch from lambo to bentley lets say.. crazy how all cars act so different along with amazing details on them interactive interior where you can see buttons move and animation of driver doing it,rubber dirt,spot on details on liveries from real cars, even LED strips for endurance racing on cars were reproduced spot on  as close to real life counterpart as possible.

[h1] Campaign[/h1] Witch has real life driver coaching you trough the youngster program until you get approved to do full season racing. 

And next to all that bunch of small options to fiddle around and create your own fun  do as you wish no unlocking of content etc.

[h1]SOUNDS[/h1]
Sounds in the game are amazing. No comment.. ear bleeding from how loud some cars are...drooling how good some cars sound..and if you compare them to the real life footage they are spot on.. 

[h1]MULTIPLAYER[/h1]
Multiplayer is a whole new level of the game. Your driving is scored on  advanced rating witch is ruining on servers and by your skills you will be matched with people same skill for better racing experience.

Penalty system witch will not let cheaters go around that easy... (Good luck serving drive trough on SPA :D )

Online QUICK JOIN button, yes now there is quick join button where game will automatically find the best fitting serveer for you. Or if you already have your ratings worked out you can enter CP(competitive) servers where situation is more competitive etc.

or use good old Server Browser and find what you like and want :)


From my personal expirience  MULTIPLAYER has been so  much fun..doing public races doing closed in sessions races...its just hours and hours of fun for me. 

Feeling of adrenaline rush when you are doing qualis and you end up on top places with just 0.1-3xx in between top 10
when you start doing formation lap..and hit green lights and you floor it... when you do longer races and fight for survival fight against the all odds... if you like that this game is definitely for you.. excitement when you have 2-3 corners of side by side driving.. hoohh..


Now if you want to listen what some people expectations were and their wishes did not get granted, (that the reason for so many negative reviews) people expected iRacing type of multiplayer for 25€ game  and developers said they will not have that and people gone mad.. merge that with some youtubers covering that shitstorm and bam people that barely touched the game leaving reviews how game is bad..

[h1]Physics and FFB[/h1]
Now this is touchy topic but its must.. I own a G27 (yes yes i know entry wheel not DD etc.)
I have it set so game feels so good on the wheel so i can feel all the car movement on the wheel little slip of the car i am on it and correcting it.. when i spin i can feel the rubber scraping the tarmac until car comes to a stop. Bumps curbs,you can feel it everything. FFB on G27 for me its perfect.. different wheels may differ but putting some time and setting up wheel is worth it.

[h1]¸Graphics/Weather/24h day and night cycle[/h1]

Graphics is top notch...game looks amazing no doubt about it.. no racing game looks like this and delivers amount of detail ACC does. 
Weather- most wanted feature from AC came to ACC and its RAIN. Developers really nailed it with this one.. Rain and driving on rain is scary AF. And i mean it..fighting a car trough the track even on wet tires(on stronger rain) its crazy and surreal feeling. You can feel the puddles on the FFB you can feel how your wheel is dancing on the track that does not have grip... you can feel  when your tire overheats and does not have grip... and you go off the racing line on wet part of the track to cool the tires down...

and i dont think i have to say anything about 24h cycle except that NIGHT RACING IS AMAZING!!! NIGHT RACING is my favourite :)

  If you are racing fan,if you like GT3 cars (yes GT3 cars only)  this game will give you the best experience for your $$

[h1]Give it a shot...[/h1] try the game but give it proper try... it takes time to learn the game/cars/tracks and to be good at it
I am almost 600hrs in the game..about to go over the time i spent on AC  in 2 years :D

Glad to see multilanguage menu but standard English is nice. 
And why would I care about rating system? 
This game isn't a full product, yet good that is not sold at full price. So much ""yay"".

Game is not e-sports ready, as some might think,  there is a TON of things to tweak on,  like ugly miniatures of cars in selection menu if you turn off AA or not intuitive control in menu. 
Use mouse in menu,  really ^^;

But there is one small good thing here, we have MUSIC IN MENU OUO....a cool one. 

During race you might, for example,  want to turn on/off lights. 
You should press B on x360/x1 gamepad. 
But nothing happens. 
What to do? 

Press BACK for x360 and corresponding to it button for x1 to... 
.
.
.
Show additional menu,  then use D PAD to go down and on position Lights,  press D PAD right button. 
Then NORMAL LIGHTS are on. 
Repeat the same to turn on RAIN LIGHT on/off as well. 
Or hazard lights. 


Weird    ._.

And this is just one example :)

Buy on your own responsibility. 

Or. 

If you like to drive ONLY 18 cars on few OFFICIAL circuits because it's just a OFFICIAL BLANCPAIN GT SERIES game. 

In other case,  go buy NORMAL ASSETTO CORSA,  put in huge amount of cars and tracks, because why not (not that srvers are using modded tracks or cars, yes, some use, but not many players know or want to try it because they are scared, not my buisness *shrug*) to have fun on your own and in your own way  :) . 

And enjoy :)

EDIT after few hours with this game:

I do have serious problem with this game.
Framerates tend to drop to 37 fps (I have gaming laptop which is not weak and NO, I can't afford to buy a pc monster because of lack of space so f* you and your opinion about my life and my space), yet the graphics might be considered as very nice, not top notch but definetely LACKS OPTIMIZATION.
Better keep all settings on Low or Medium.
Lack of benchmark won't help you to adjust the game they way to provent it to turn into baked potato.

My Safety Rating has taken a beating because the AI insists on playing destruction derby. The irony of course is that the way to get your safety rating up is to drive close to AI - which is a suicide mission because they definitely WILL crash into you. The driving physics are good. The weather effects are good. The rain is a little overdone and instead of the car aquaplaining on standing water it seems to happen in the same unusual places where dark marks appear on the ground. But the main thing above all that sucks is the rating system. It's beyond shockingly bad. It needs to be removed until they can get it working. There is the obvious lack of content but you know that when you buy the game so that is no surprise. The game just isnt worth the money and should have been better for launch. Honestly hate to say it but Project Cars is better (except the physics),1561027628,1561027628,False,4,0,0.506437778472900391,0,True,False,False,76561198154945011,105,9,4340,11,1447,1601041511

The Good:

-Same amazing driving physics
-Best Graphics and Sound in Sim Racing
-Good Car selection - Race GT cars

The Bad:

-Not as featured as the original options, settings, graphics, audio, hud etc...
-Lack of tracks. Note: Basically the Same tracks as the original (though, more detailed and enhanced)
-Just the Blancpain series
-Expensive for the content.

Overall.  The game is excellent for what it does, and how it looks, feels and sounds. If you want thrill of your pants racing, pick it up and enjoy.  If you want more driving options, my original impression still stands true, Assetto Corsa the Original is the sim to have.

-Overall best sound design I’ve ever heard. With headphones/VR you can hear the cars fly by. You can even hear them accelerating off into the distance far out of the line of sight. It sounds just like the real track.

-FFB is very communicative, just as the old Assetto was. You can feel the car pushing to the limits of grip through the Force Feedback which is great. 

-The graphics are on par or better than most similar titles.

-Quick match multiplayer makes racing easy

-As a Blancpain and Endurance racing fan, the GT3 focused format is great for me. 

CONS:

-The biggest one for serious sim racers. NO TRIPLE SCREEN SUPPORT. Come on, this is one of the most common setups for the sim community. VR still has its bugs/lack of resolution and there are still many of us that prefer triples. 

nVidia surround can still be used but without the ability to render each screen separately or account for the angle of the side screens your image looks stretched and distorted on the side screens. It makes it hard to look deep into a corner because as the image crosses back over the bezel it is in a different spot, like trying to look into a tank of water and pick something up. 

Other than that this game is great. I’m really hoping they add triple screen support soon.",1560701328,1560701328,True,7,0,0.563511013984680176,0,True,False,False,76561198049066672,30,1,1147,0,166,1592872644

31,50990086,english,"Okay now Kunos really needs to learn how to make a game from the likes of Codemasters because one can easily tell driving in ACC is seriously enjoyable but the UI design is just meh. Car selection, for example, needs to be like Track selection with the full car list on the left and the model on the right, team and driver down in the bottom. And what's the deal with the career mode? I'm pretty sure most of you guys are just left confused after finishing the first career test run on Monza. What do I do now? There's no button to advance to the next session straight away, there's only a quit button. Everyone expects some sort of ""Yay you're done with this now carry on to the next task"" button immediately after finishing the current task. That is just common sense. Even if the game wants you to wait for all other cars to finish their run, at least have a message on screen saying ""please wait for other cars"" and, optionally, an option to skip that part. Not only I did, but Jimmy Broadbent also fell victim to that on his stream. Another example is once you're done with the 3 test sessions on Monza, you're immediately taken to Zolder. You do the standard stuff: a practice run, then qually twice, then race twice. Okay, no problem there. EXCEPT the game expects you to complete all of that in one go without saving after you've finished a session. I completed the practice and two quallies and wanted to take a little break. I opened the menu to check for any save button at all. There is no save button so I just quit. The next time I launched the game, it makes me waste half an hour to do all that again. That's bad game design and has no place in a ""full release"". I know they plan to add this function later, but why would you launch a game before such an important thing is even finished? There are people who like to do long sessions and people who only have an hour to play a day. Fuck them, right? There are many more problems with UI/UX and workflow design that if I had to list all of them out, this rant would be twice as long. I'm no sim racing pro so I won't touch base on the technical side of things. Driving feels good, overall. Runs pretty well at medium high graphical settings on my crappy PC hosting an i5 4570, GTX 1060 6GB and a measly 8GB of RAM, which is surprising.

So I guess I will recommend this title, but I'm going to leave my review at not recommended until Kunos puts some effort in improving the UI and overall game design. You may nail the physics but crappy UI and basic game design will make this high potential racing sim title the second rFactor 2.

Edit for 1.0.2: Oh, looks like we're going somewhere, folks, cuz 1.0.2 brought some fixes for the problem we've been pointing out. Save between sessions, post session timer and notice to wait for others to finish, all that good stuff. Looks like it's playable now. But the save function, to be honest, still sucks. Like, no joke, if i go to Career > Resume, I get put in my current career. But if I go to load saved game in the main menu, it takes me to monza in a Lambo super trofeo sitting in the sand.

33,51171095,english,"The marmite of sim racing games.  Some love it, others hate it, and it's therefore a difficult game to recommend because of it.  However after 200+ hours, I'm still hooked.  I'm using a Logitech G29 wheel, on an Intel i5 with a Nvidia 1070 and it runs fine at 1080p with mid-level settings.

The game is based on the Blancpain GT series, and contains the GT3 cars and tracks from that (currently 10 tracks), so it's a very focused sim racer.

Some people seem to dislike the force feedback on this game, especially people coming from rFactor2 or AC (the first one).  The feedback in this game is very different to those titles and this is one of the reasons that some hate it.  Personally, I like the force feedback in ACC.  I'm not sure if I like it more than other games, it's just different.  Once you get used to the way the cars handle, which does take a bit of time, it just clicks and then everything falls into place.

Visuals are great; the track details, the car models, the weather, time of day, all top notch.  It's also an easy game to get into for first-time sim racers as the default car setups are generally very good and don't really require any tweaking other than setting the fuel to the appropriate level for the session.  Sounds are probably the best in sim racing currently.  There seems to be a lot of people who are having performance issues with this game.  I've not experienced this at all, even on my modest PC setup.  However, I only really play it at 1080p and 60fps, so this could explain it.

It hasn't been long since release, so I haven't yet tried the career mode (it wasn't available during early access), so I'm not sure what this is like.  I have been mainly racing AI, doing hot laps and special events.  I have also done a bit of online racing, which was fine although fairly typical for this sort of thing with first corner madness and unfair penalties.  I think the online will improve as time goes on and Kunos add more to it.  Until then I'll probably stick to mainly racing the AI which, in my opinion, is one of the best experiences currently.  I don't remember any other game making me feel like I'm actually racing, until ACC.  The AI cars race each other, go into the pits when damaged, get it wrong sometimes and cause accidents right in front of you.  All of the time keeping a realistic (and obtainable) pace.  This could be due to the single class of cars which means Kunos have been able to focus on it and get it all working to a very high level.

So in summary, I would recommend this game if you want a game that simulates GT3 racing against the AI, and to a lesser extent, online racing.  If you want an online multiplayer experience similar to GT Sport then this game isn't there yet (and might never get there - time will tell).  There is scope for this as the game constantly monitors your driving and ranks you on different aspects, e.g. safety, racecraft, consistency, handling etc.  It would therefore be possible for Kunos to do a much better online matchmaking/ranking/league system in the future.  We can only hope!  However, I can't complain about the current content.  I've thoroughly enjoyed my 200+ hours with the game, and will probably continue to play this for a long time into the future.",1560250798,1560250798,True,8,0,0.599237918853759766,0,True,False,False,76561198017668623,58,1,21374,28,12896,1601222953
34,51169710,english,"I got into sim racing playing the original Assetto Corsa, and really had tons of fun with it, especially racing in online leagues with friends. Then over the last year or so I ended up moving flat, more work, and other things which resulted in the steering wheel gathering dust in a corner. I did get ACC in early access, but only did a couple of lasts with the first early access version and didn't think too much about it.
But then two weeks ago I decided to give it another try, and I was blown away! Yes, there are still some issues, and things to improve (more about that later), but this the most fun I've had driving a pretend car around a track I've had so far.

On the plus side: first and most importantly the physics are fantastic, detailed, fun, challenging, rewarding. It's a step up from the original AC. The graphics are stunning thanks to the unreal engine, and night and rain really add to the fun. I actually really enjoy the rating system, and the online races tends to be very civilised, maybe not quite to iracing level, but enough to have a lot of fun. I thought I would hate racing on the rain, assuming that it would just be the same but with less grip, but it turns out to be tons of fun with the track evolving constantly. Another small thing: the replay provides a ""save highlights"" feature which generates a best of the race with all the overtakes, crashes, etc., a great idea and well implemented.

Of course the game is not perfect, and many things are still unpolished, but I have a lot of faith in Kunos and their ability to keep updating and improving the game (the original AC was very bare bone when 1.0 was released.
As much as I enjoy the quick join matchmaking in multiplayer it can be difficult to join a server with a friend (even with the weights set to max).
I've seen people complaining about ""kerbs of death"", but I haven't experienced them myself so I can't comment there.
Each car really feels unique, but of course it's GT racing only, so if that's not for you then don't expect AC level of car diversity.
Finally the career mode is a nice introduction, but don't expect Codemaster style careers with cut scenes, stories, etc.

All in all I can't recommend this game enough to anyone who enjoy simracing. It's well worth the price, and you can really tell the passion of the developers for racing.",1560243748,1560243748,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,76561197993394580,207,11,4877,0,1194,1600624398

VR, since 1.02 is improved, though still quite blurry and IMO still no recommended.  AI is good, not great.

The few times I have ventured online have been fun, however the rolling start usually results in a major pileup.  Netcode seems adequate, with very little ghosting of cars.

Career mode is bare bones atm.  The testing sessions are just hot laps, and there is really no progression or story involved in the career, making it seem very similar to running a plain championship.

44,50994887,english,"Initially I gave this a negative review as the support for VR was truly awful, and the game had a host of really annoying issues: worse force feedback than AC, crashes to desktop, couldn't save the career between sessions, and many more.

However in two updates in quick succession since release the devs have fixed so many problems and really almost all my issues have either been fixed or dramatically improved.

VR is back-on with mouse support, proper way to launch VR support, and better anti-aliasing mechanism more suited for VR that isn't filled with headache-inducing flickering.  Performance for the game overall still isn't brilliant, but it now at least looks way better than it did (though I'd argue still not up to AC's standards).

You can now save within the career mode, something that actually makes the career playable for those of us with other things to be doing.  It's still a pretty poor career mode though and I hope for significant improvement in this area.

Force-feedback LUT's are now supported, so I've brought mine over from AC and it definitely feels nicer now.  It's a little softer than AC with certain elements, like the car weight, but there's currently no way to configure that.

The main thing that ACC offers over AC is the rating system.  As I'm getting back into sim racing, I'm a bit rusty, and having a sector-by-sector guide for how well I'm doing, how consistent I'm being, how safe I'm racing, etc. is really useful.  I feel like I'm getting better more quickly because of it.

With the games focus on a specific series and it's tight racing it in some ways feels like a spiritual successor to the original TOCA Touring Cars which is great.  There's a low number of cars and tracks to learn and there's a much greater focus on the actual racing rather than the hot-lapping seen in AC.

Definitely a really good game for what it's specifically focused on doing.  It doesn't replace the original AC in any way, it's definitely not a sequel of any kind, it's more of a ""spin-off"" for lovers of GT3 and tight racing.",1559402453,1560022367,True,0,0,0.52504807710647583,0,True,False,False,76561197970808834,188,9,1324,0,147,1564600022

I find the handling of the cars to be very fun and the rendering of the tracks is very nice. My favorite part is the much improved AI, compared to the early access AI, I find them fairly random and challenging to drive against. 

However, I have encountered issues with the final polish of the game so I understand why people are so upset. 

I've still had to edit the hud and menu json files to get the game to do simple things like permanently get rid of the HUD in VR view and to make the game menus visible. I really thought that would be fixed in the full release. 

There's also no way to map VR center view to a button on my wheel so I have to fiddle with the keyboard with my headset on to reset the view. 

Most bizarrely, the hotlap leaderboards and personal best times doesn't work. I don't know any simracers who don't like creeping up the hotlap leaderboards so the fact that this isn't implemented yet is strange. 

I expect these things to be fixed eventually, although I thought they'd be fixed for the full release so maybe I'm expected too much.

Pros:-
Realistic driving
Easy for beginners to understand 
Easy for experts to tweak
Stunning graphics 
Only GT3 racing - master of 1 discipline and not Jack of all trades

Cons:-
No save options, especially frustrating with random crashes in the pit lane ! ( game freezing not car crashes )

A.i.  where the F do I start with these Clowns!  Your start your FAST lap and they come out of pit lane and refuse to yield to you and ruin your lap!

For some reason when your right behind them and you try to negotiate a corner the A.i. 'Park the bus' .. they stop racing and brake check you!!!! Seriously a racer stops racing !  
Do you see Lewis Hamilton STOP racing !!  Ok Monaco F1 2019 he did it for about 40 laps but you get what I'm saying.

Settings like difficulty can only be set before a championship and not at any point, a shame when Sprint is easy to win but on same difficulty Endurance is impossible!

53,51070455,english,"I want to love this game.  The sounds, graphics, and the FFB all seem top notch.  So many improvements over the original Assetto Corsa.  This is where I have to stop when it comes to good things to say about the game, as it is currently a total mess.  The game was released completely unfinished.  

To start, it's safe to say that ACC is currently a very poorly optimized game (on 7700k and a gtx 1080.)  FPS drops at random places to unacceptable levels regardless of settings, odd rubber banding at times in online sessions (seems to be more of an Unreal 4 engine problem than Kunos, but still its an issue,)  and some wonky looking textures.  

The single player is kind of a joke to me.  Not in depth as you would want it to be in a career mode.  If you were expecting some sort of F1 style, similar to a Codemasters experience you will be completely let down.  On one hand the AI is not terrible, but on the other hand it certainly can't be considered top notch.  Sadly, its no more fun than just setting up a custom offline race.

That brings me to the multiplayer.  You know, the Competizione part...  At the end of the day, it leaves a lot to be desired.  You have ratings for different things including a safety rating, but at the end of the day it doesn't impact which servers you are put into when you press join.  I could live with Kunos seemingly misleading the customer base by talking up their multiplayer system as though it would rival iRacing or SRS, but at the end of the day we have a ratings system that has zero impact on the actual online racing.  I've had some good races but the experience is, overall, relatively poor due to there being little to nothing separating good, clean drivers from poor, insane/trolling ones.

I hate to do this because I absolutely love the original Assetto Corsa game, but until things improve dramatically I would have to recommend holding off on buying this title in its current state.",1559774843,1559775281,False,5,0,0.558359622955322266,0,True,False,False,76561197963337562,239,9,1229,0,724,1590898195

The multiplayer experience is good but if you want to prioritise that you should maybe go for iracing, on the reverse the career is good but if you want to prioritise that maybe Project Cars 2?
The AI is pretty good actually if taken off easy and have their aggression turned up a bit otherwise they suffer from the usual AI faults (not overtaking or defending).
You cant save during an Event (VERY frustrating) BUT its being worked on as an update.
If you really want this type of game then I believe its well worth the money however if your not sure I suggest waiting a while until it comes down in price.

56,44727211,english,"UPDATE - This game came out of early access and absolutely nothing has changed. Its a horrible thing. The trees look like a distortion, the force feedback disappears at times.. ph jeez.


ACC is AC with a lot of Project Cars: Crazy camera angles, overdriven sounds, a horrible user interface (you cant even make adjustments to both sides of the car at the same time) and bland driving physics, which is my first main point:

1. It has been said by Kunos that the driving phisics of AC have been transported into UE4 and ACC. Well, that is a lie. I am sorry if this is offending anyone, but I guess they tried very hard to transport it - and failed heavily. But because the physics were what made AC great, marketing was forced to tell everyone that they succeeded. Its what made be buy a 1 series game, ACC. Well, unfortunately they didnt. I spent several hundred hours in AC and just from the burnout in pits of Nürburgring it was very clear - this is a very different driving physics engine. There is absolutely NO feedback from the car, just like in Project Cars. #

In AC, the player was able to feel the limit when coming close to it. There was feedback in my steering wheel, letting me know that the tyre is at its limit now and I better back it off a bit. That is completely lost. Dont let yourselves be tricked by these italian marketing dudes, the physics of ACC suck big time. Example: Driving in the gravel besides the track does NOT slow you down a bit.  Unbelievable.

Also, this has nothing to do with early access, this is very basic to the game. 

2. The graphics and sounds. Yea, it does look good. And thats what makes it so Project Cars. The camera angle when looking sideways says it all. ""woooooah look at you, in a lambo, going fast! vroom vroom!"" - thats the opposite of what made AC so different from other games. Also this has been widely critizised, as the game was too ""sterile"" and what not. Well, those critics were Need For Speed players, so Kunos should just have ignored that. Instead, they closely listened. Now we have a great looking game that feels like a boys toy, not like a simulation.

3. Controls - The force feedback is just like any other force feedback, maybe a bit worse. Curbs and bumps are non existing in ACCs force feedback, although the car is jumping around, the camera is very shaky and what not. Also, as mentioned before, the general feeling of the car is just oblique. In AC, the player was able to handle a little drift in a GT3 car, for example when you hit the a gas a bit too optimistic on the exit of a corner. You just knew and felt, what the tyres would be able to handle - and what they could not handle anymore. There was some kind of sensitivity in all that vibration and steering forces and when the rear got lose, you just catched it, knowing that wasnt quick - but hella fun. Also, gone in ACC. You have grip - and then you dont and spin. Thats about it.

I will keep playing it, as I paid for it. If any of the upcoming updates improve this product, abusing the ""AC"" badge, I will amend this review.

The AI are completely broken in qualifying. They stay behind whatever car that's in front of them form a train, in a race they are much better, but moved over and took me out twice when I was along side in a braking zone. They also seem to sit under the pit speed limit by a margin. Maybe they don't have pit limiters either? 
The driving for the most part is good, but the sand traps are like hitting a wall. Touch them with one wheel and lose massive amounts of speed, the kerbs are way too harsh, I've seen GT3 cars hit kerbs hard in real life, in ACC? You either spin or lose speed. 
What's the point in letting us create our own team in career but we can't paint the cars? I haven't looked into this, but I haven't seen anything obvious. No driver (helmet, suit) customization either.

Graphics. Wow. Day and night transitions looks awesome. Dynamic weather is well done and the bad weather can be straight out of a horror game or movie. All of the cars and tracks just look spectacular. The difference between ACC and Project Cars 2, which also has good graphics, is that ACC graphics are more photorealistic whereas Project Cars 2 is a bit more cartoony looking.

Sounds. This is perhaps the most enjoyable part of ACC. Not only are the engine sounds really satisfying and close to what I hear during onboard videos, but the atmospheric sounds like rocks hitting under the cars, background interview over the PA while waiting to start a race parked on the grid, to scrapes and gearbox whines and clunks... just awesome.

Physics. This is what keeps me driving these cars. All of the cars handle differently. Not only do rear, mid and front engine cars all handle differently but cars of the same overall style are different. For example, I am loving the new Bentley Continental GT3 and coming from the BMW and AMG it is different and is the one I prefer. The BMW is a little more oversteery and the Bentley is more stable, for my driving anyway.

The sophisticated different rating systems are well executed. In multiplayer races I am finding I am getting matched up with people close to my skills. The more I play and the more my rating stabilises, the more I am tending to be matched accurately with more racers. Well done.

I am happy with the career and championship modes as I see them as just a bonus. I do enjoy the various events as well as it is good to compare with other drivers.

All up, if you are after a next gen racing sim focusing on just one class and therefore delivering depth, go for ACC. If you are after more of an open world or driving sim, look elsewhere.

even more disappointing considering the fact how this game has been received 8 months of development and there is not that much improvement from the first development build

optimization is inconsistent in this game, the matchmaking system isn't really fleshed out as the likes of GT Sport and iRacing, VR support is lackluster and the tag for it has been removed atm, and the force feedback is mundane at times.

the physics are great, however the force feedback itself is unresponsive at times with a lack of settings to configure it to anyone's liking. the subject of force feedback has always been subjective, but there is an issue in this game if your wheel starts to understeer really bad or the tires lock up at low cornering speeds (30-45 mph). rFactor 2, Project CARS 2, and the original AC didn't have understeer this bad. probably because of force feedback.

the career mode originally I thought was gonna be like the codemaster's games especially the fact that they signed a deal with blancpain to make an official game. but instead, it's really barebones with no car development or no thing such as team development.

the bugs and crashes in this game are very frustrating, especially the AC2 fatal error crash in multiplayer.

i also expected that in their exclusivity deal with blancpain gt series for this game, we'd have a nice damage model like the codemasters games but the damage model isn't punishing or visually appealing at all.

Do I think it's worth the full asking price? At the time of writing this I'd say no , it's not good value.
It's only one series (Blancpain) and ten tracks. I was expecting a fully fleshed out career (codemasters style) given the fact that this is not a drive all , drive anywhere game. Sadly that's not the case. What we have is another AC style career where you do some driving to prove your worth and then do a couple of races (rinse and repeat). As project cars 2 offers the same sort of thing but with many cars and many tracks , it seems unlikely that I'm going to sink time into it.

The FFB isn't great , you can feel the back of the car losing traction but then everything gets 'soupy' and it's really difficult to catch a skid. There's no track Ir so I have limited peripheral  vision when racing that leads to frustrating crashes. The cars  handle well and the graphics look great (unless in replay where they look bad)

Congrats Kunos, I hope you will be rewarded for taking the risk of focusing the title on a single serie - which in my opinion is still the best way to simulate actual racing.

After release (2nd June 2019):
Well, as expected, Kunos delivered. I had some very bad FPS issues on my limited computer (it is a gaming laptop with an i5 and a GT970M), but now that the game is released I can enjoy it (in low/mid graphic settings of course) and it fulfills all my expectations as a simulation.
However, I find that the UI is a bit too cumbersome. Also the game still lacks some guidance to help the new player (I just got disqualifed on my first race for ignoring the pit stop, even though I came in, I probably forgot to switch driver !!)
What the game lacks in atmosphere in the UI (I don't know, but the UI screams ""this is a game"" everywhere for me, I would much prefer a very old school UI with real GT pictures in the back as GP2 or GPL), it does more than make up once in game. The spotter, the sound, the graphics and of course the feeling of the car twitching around the corners....

As a Sim addict i bought this game in alpha and took it for a spin now and then. Every month there was a update and i drove a few hours to feel and see what is changed in this game. It was getting better and better and it was already pretty good imo.

Now its full released and i am not disappointed at all ! The game breaths racing from A to Z . It simulates so much detail its again a step up the ladder of best sim games already for me. I dont think the game stands out in one particular part but overall more above average.

Sounds - are truly amazing ! No other sim made me turn up the volume but this is really music in my ears.
Graphics - Well i play in VR and i must say its about the same level as Pcars2 regarding to image quality not bad can be bit better in performance maybe. Mouse support would be most wanted i dont understand why its not in the game.
Physics - Very good. IF driving with a DD wheel you will get so much detail trough your hands its crazy and i like it !
UI-  I like all the parts that are adjustable but how it should be set/done is not really user friendly. Just like in Assetto Corsa its all there but they make it so unnecessary hard sometimes so thats what i would like to see changed.

Still got some bugs that needs to be sorted to bad those didnt show up in alpha / beta so they could fix it before full release. So for now we have a great sim with some bugs that reminds me a bit on Project Cars the only difference is i have more trust in they will fix it compared to pcars.


So for the final statement i rate this game 8.5/10 and i am much excited what the future will bring !

As a long time fan of Kunos (I got allot of stick and labelled a fanboy during Early Access on these very forums), I personally feel the games hit release 1.0 and it is far from the product we would expect Kunos to release as a 1.0 product.

This game is still Beta at best, so much missing and I am sure it will come, I’m just not so sure it should have been released for another 2-3 months at least.

It is also questionable tactics removing certain tags from the shop page post 1.0 when we have had EA and been told all along it would have said ‘Tags’, that sir’s is a bit of a no no and quite underhand.
It also say’s to me personally “Shizzle we are way behind here and aint catching up any time soon to our promises”.

VR AVOID!  I personally can't go back to flat screen sim racing now, and the VR just does not work the shimmering and the crazzy jaggie's I have spent literally HOURS and every fix anyone else has tried.
And my PC spec is miles ahead of recommended.

0,51006082,english,"In the current iteration of the full release I cannot properly recommend this, there is rather severe issues to take note of.  Seems to be a lot of bugs and things left unpolished.  Seems most are having a rather significant issue of being unable to start the cars engine during qualifying in career mode, just get to sit there and get disqualified.  The lights/wipers manual buttons also seem to not work properly in career, I end up being unable to turn my regular headlights on and get stuck with the fog lights on.  

There's no real guidance or purpose presented in career.  It starts off pretty cool, performing tests to see where you stand.  I was looking forward to this game as it's supposed to resemble a real motorsport series, in that sense it can be fairly and closely compared to the Codemaster's F1 games.  The Codemaster's games give you clear direction of what is expected of you on each team, you have proper goals, you progress more intuitively and it's an actual championship.  Something is amiss with ACC's version of its career.  There doesn't seem to be a proper championship taking place, or I can't see how you figure out your progress.  You currently can't save your game between sessions.  There seem to be no actual moving npcs, despite advertising realistic npc movement there isn't even animated pit crews.  Also the accuracy you must have to stop in the pits is a bit ridiculous, doubt the team would refuse to service your car if you are a single millimeter too forward.  

The UI also presents some odd issues.  After you get the steering wheel buttons assigned properly you can navigate most things, though the in game button numbers don't align with my actual steering wheel button numbers so I have no idea what I'm actually pushing.  Could be button '3' on my wheel, but show up as button '9' in game for example.  Also some screens I can't proceed or navigate with my steering wheel at all, sometimes having to pull out my wireless keyboard to do something. 

Overall this is a disappointing state to have officially launched this game in, would never expect a game release with all these issues, and I have come to expect bugs from day one releases.  This is on a new level. 

The actual driving is pretty fun though, the force feedback is pretty engaging, but I can only drive around in circles so long before I need something to actually accomplish that works.  As of now this game is broken to the point I will hold off on playing further until it is patched significantly.  I recommend anyone else do the same.

For what it became after month of development:

Feel: So crisp, detail rich and vivid force feedback, in par with AMS which is intense! Who knows me, knows what I mean. :)
Driven with T150 for month and T300 for a few weeks now. 
No noticable lag, everything feels tight as it should be.

Smell: Somehow I can smell the dampened road, the hot rubber and engine...but maybe its only the new T300. ^^

Tech: Running an RTX 2080 with i5-7600k @ 4,6GHz on a 165Hz G-Sync Panel. FPS set reduced to constant 90 ingame.
FFB Settings:
  ingame: gain+DynDamp. 100%, Min.Force 3%, Road Effects 42%
  driver: 90% overall force, const. 100%, periodic 100%, spring 0, damp 0, autocentering by game
Rotation 600° in both

Community: Lot of online races available, some really fair duells obv. due to the new rating system, which seems to work then!

Cons: Had some CTD since release but they are gone since I updated NVIDIA drivers to 430.86 (June.01)

Conclusion: Hell of a racing simulator which is very satisfying using it. The immersion (yes, even via TFT) is fantastic, it sucks u in and makes u feel comfortable inside your GT3 with all its rumbling, screaming, tchirping, notching and blopping. Everything feels so alive. A key thing which firstly came to my senses in AMS and now its here. 

Thats why I like and recommend this one!

And to be honest, no monthly fee, no micro payment per track or car...just ONE PAYMENT and u get it all. What a bargain!

I play both on a wheel and on a controller and works flawlessly on both (tho I still want them to let us edit the buttons on the controller without having to configure it as a wheel). The ffb on the controller is surprisingly good, didn't expect to have any, at all.

The handling it's also very realistic with the physics having to be applauded, in the end also fun. The amount of times the game has punished me for going over an ""orange-sausage-kerb"" too aggressively tells me just how realistic it is and how impactful the physics are.
It has probably the best weather physics too, few games have punished you like this game does if you push it too far and the aquaplaning is great, along side Project CARS 2 it has simulated them very well.

The graphics are superb, which should be no surprise considering it's running on UE4 but they've done a great job polishing it out. Tho the texture pop-ins while choosing the car can be annoying and ugly.

The sound is second to none, only RaceRoom comes close. The sound of the dirt and rubber going into the pods, the sound of kerbs, the different engines and downshifts...etc. They got everything right.

This that need to be fixed are: 
- Sometimes the rolling start can bug out and leave other cars way behind; 
- Cars slow down massively making them ""ghost out"" during the entrance to the pits after the victory lap; 
- AI cars don't seem to get affected by cold tires/breaks during the first lap while the player has to manage theirs leaving us with an disadvantage.

Nonetheless it far exceeded my expectations and truly gives us a chance to partake in one of the best racing categories today (which are free to watch on Youtube).

Driving in the rain is especially immersive, and in general the driving on track is enjoyable. I personally love the Blancpain series, and having such a full on experience of this is fantastic, but I do worry if it will get a bit samey.

What's not so good - Career mode is extremely lackluster. I know it might be unfair to compare ACC to F1 2018, but the career mode just isn't immersive. I'll elaborate later about why I was so disappointed about the career. The UI is a little clunky, but it's workable. It's very difficult to run without turning the settings down considerably. Online has been very ropey and the penalty system is almost useless. Force feedback is quite vague and doesn't really communicate what the tyres are doing which is a huuuge disappointment especially after the quality of the force feedback in the old Assetto Corsa. Apparently VR isnt much good either but I don't use VR so I can't say for myself.

In the end, ACC is a very very good game. In my opinion, this is the best representation of GT3 in sim racing. However, I feel it was released too early. I've had multiple game crashes and I just feel it could use a few more months of testing and polish before it's ready.


I mentioned earlier that I will going into more detail about my disappointment at the career mode. Unfortunately, I feel this is the absolute weak point of the game. Unlike the F1 games, there is no paddock experience that really immerses you in the life of a racing driver. No team communication, no media, nothing. For me, this makes a season feel like a series of quick races more than anything else. However, the worst part is how the endurance thing works. At the start, you choose your race length preferance. Because I chose medium, every endurance race on the calendar is skipped. This means no Silverstone, Monza, Spa, Paul Ricard or Barcelona, which are all 3 or 6 hour races irl. I have no idea why I couldnt just do short races there.
The structure of the race is also weird. Theres 2 full qualifying and 2 races, and each race you have to do a drive change, even if it's only a 20 minute race, which can get very tiresome. All in all career mode (at least on medium) result in only doing half the tracks in very weird races. I'd just look at the calendar online and make a collection of quick races",1559328775,1559328775,False,5,0,0.55348438024520874,0,True,False,False,76561198121706581,56,9,3640,0,1515,1599922422

I'm not complaining. I love the game. I paid Early Access but feel I got so much more for the initial price. For me personally it is really worth it! Not many tracks but that's okay.

""quality of simulation""
This ACC sim-racing game is a joke, even a GTR2 - FIA GT Racing Game (2006) doing better job then this. Because this have a Blancpain GT tittle on it, I want to know what is this all about, but in the game not a single word talk about the race itself, even the rules.

Quality. Its not about graphic or how good the game engine is.
For sim racing grade game, at least it have to education people about what Blancpain GT is.
In this ACC I could not find any info about the cars, glossary or theory about this race, and most important thing the RULES.
Even I have 800+ hrs with ProjectCars 2, I still fail the first pitstop in ACC because there no mention you must change tires.

Simulation. Ok, that mean you need to setup your car right?
When I look at the dampers in car setup page, bump and rebound, what is the numbers mean? I know these number must be how Stiff or Soft, Fast or Slow.
But in ACC its empty, no KG no NM no CM no MM no Force NO MEANING, how do I simulation and setup the car? by guess what I'm doing?

In game UI control, I just don't understand why we can't setup / bind pitstop menu buttons to keyboard,it take 6 keys on the wheel!

45,44890996,english,"First of all: I loved playing this game in Early Access. But there are some things in the Release-Version that i want to point out, that really annoy me (my first Review was actually positive).

[b]1. Matchmaking:[/b]
Well... It was said that they'll be something called ""Matchmaking"", but the creators obviously had something different in mind.

[b]2. Career:[/b]
You're not able to adjust any Setting (apart from some settings that are really not that important) once you've chosen your Difficulty. That is really annoying, because:
You're not able to skip the Intro to the Career (seeing that guy readin off a teleprompter gives me headaches). AND you have to play the ""Tutorial"" (3 10Min Practice Sessions) every freaking time.
Also: We used to have a nice way to choose the difficulty of your opponents for Skill and Aggressiveness. In a range from 0-100. In the career mode, you only have the ability to choose between ""Easy"", ""Normal"" and ""Hard"", which leaves me with:
- playing on hard I'll be lucky to finish the race/qualifying in 14 or 15 place (out of 16)
- playing on normal I'll have a 10s lead after the first lap
This is really annoying when you want to have a fair battle for good places without being completely left behind...
And the last thing:
You're not able to save between sessions (FP, Q1, Q2, R1, R2) which is really annoying, first of all, because having a long race-length you'll most likely will not be able to play everything in one sitting, and because of:

[b]3. Crashes[/b]
I've played this game close to 50h in EA with no single crash, which is really amazing for an EA game at that scale! 
But after 3 hours in the Release-Version, I got something about 6 crashes so far. Combined with the fact that you cant save between Sessions in Career Mode is just frustrating.

I don't know why these decisions were made, but thats not the optimal way imho. This whole Release-Thing just feels rushed and is not able to meet the quality of the EA-Version.",1537702563,1559316889,False,0,0,0.519841313362121582,0,True,False,False,76561198050256277,251,35,3687,0,821,1575749914

VR is next to realism one of the most important features in the game for many sim people who bought this game and supported it from day 1 in early access. Unfortunately it's unplayable. It's indeed so bad, that the devs have taken the ""VR"" tag away from the Steam store page. Tons of complains and nothing has been communicated by the devs yet on when which bugs will be ironed out or missing features added.

What really bothers me, is to see that also ""smaller"" dev teams start to use the same disgusting practices like big publishers I almost never buy games from: First, unrealistic release dates. You KNOW that a project always needs more time than you previously think because of, who would have thought, unexpected issues during development. So if your main priority is being a company that creates high quality products, a big part of it is also to think ahead and NEVER promise deadlines that finally don't work out. And even worse: If you need more time, communicate and take your time until the game is PERFECT for a full release. Afterwards you can add and improve whatever you want. But everything that is supposed to be in the game, should work almost without exceptions perfectly. That's also the main reason behind the early access system. Second, like I just said, if your game isn't ready on release date, postpone the game. Releasing an unfinished product is the worst thing you can do, regardless how many horrible publishers are using those practices for years now. And third: COMMUNICATE and be clear about everything. You knew that many things weren't ready for release, so you don't need to wait an entire week or more for internal meetings and worthless discussions before you communicate what's your future plan to solve all the issues asap. If you have to talk about this AFTER release, it means again that some people in the company aren't professional enough and should be replaced.

Long story (not so) short: I try to avoid every product made by mediocre companies, who ask money for unfinished or simply bad products. Not only in the gaming industry. The only difference with the game industry is, that they really dare asking money for something that isn't finished yet (imagine buying a real car and the manufacturer tells you ""oh sorry, but your car will use 60% more fuel and have 80hp less than advertised till our next update coming in fucking 3 month. You bought a pineapple pizza? Well, unfortunately we'll send you the pineapple in two weeks cause we're out of stock. But in the meanwhile enjoy the rest of your pizza."" Well, the last one wasn't probably the best example for many people but you get the idea). So instead of supporting Kunos early access games from day 1 like I previously did, from now on I'll wait till I'm sure that everything in their games has been implemented and is working as advertised.",1559297047,1559297047,False,11,0,0.583448648452758789,1,True,False,False,76561198069158884,201,9,125,0,108,1559300768

Car and track selection - Weak too be honest - yes I know, i Know. its sup[posed to be a GT3 specialised Sim. However, on a side note the game doesnt make me go wow! so i need something to keep me interested! be nice if they made it GT2 or added some classic GT3 cars and stages or something.

Bad points - the little bar thing that tells me how im driving. when you want to get that little bit more aggressive its like it goes ""WELL THAT WAS SHIT YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT YOUR DOING!"" and your sat there like ""but i planed that!"". its little i know but i dont like it! Oh and i would like the option to change settings in game... i didnt know my steering wheel lay out so i hate to write it on my phone and prop it up for my first few races. 

Would i tell you to buy it - Over all. Yes :) 

Its good! its nor perfect and i dont think it will take most peoples breath away but i still think its worth a buy! if we talk just GT3 i find it just as fun (not realistic.. fun!) as PC2 and a about just as realistic as Rfactor 2.

Multiplayer turned out to be marketing stories, so I tried single player. Tons of lag and getting kicked off connection, which causes massive stutter and surging. Imagine if Windows was updating non-stop in the background, that's how the game plays. Hey Kunos, you might want to stress test your servers before launch day.

AI is Project CARS 2 quality. Kind of amazing if you think about it. Assetto Corsa AI is better than Assetto Corsa Competizione AI.

Graphics are quite good, and my 18 month old gaming laptop can handle 27 AI cars with lights on, between 45 and 60 FPS. Kunos really optimized this game well since early access.

Car and track selection is limited, naturally, but somehow really deep. Sort of a RaceRoom feeling, where there's a lot of options within a specific class. But the whole sim is a Blancpain ad, so I get it.

Cars and tracks are rendered really well, to my eye. Physics feel pretty good. Somewhere between R3E and rF2. I got the feeling there was a lot of variance in grip coming from environmental factors. I like that, if it's actually happening, but it will take a lot of getting used to, as there aren't any cues for those changes, other than the car suddenly having a lot less grip.

I got it for 25 euro last October. If they never improve a thing it will be about a 25 euro game, on par with PC2. If they sort it out as they promise to, it's a $40 game.

The graphics aren't as good as AC1 as the textures are blurry and pop ins are more often than AC1 while the shadows are jaggy. Performance aren't the best but it had improved in 0.6. It felt like switching to UE4 had been a terrible idea as racing games made with UE4 always looked as if I am looking through vaseline. 

The driving? It doesn't really have the dynamic feeling that AC has that made the car's suspension to feel so lively in comparison to other games. Something's missing here as it doesnt feel as good as driving a GT3 here than AC1. 

The UI is terrible, especially there is no option to turn off the terrible Race Analysis on the top right. I do not care how I drive, I just want to have fun and I have zero interest in esports. Then, you decided to remove the fantastic idea of apps that AC introduced where the community can develop interesting apps and UI elements can be move around easily. Now, you get this awful UI that looked like a pre alpha that constantly pestering how awful you driving is. 

The content is an issue too, you removed all the great cars from AC and all you have left are the GT3s. Not even the fantastic Porsche Cup car is in or the rapidly growing GT4 class that runs with some SRO events. Some of the tracks that SRO supported series runs on, such as Laguna Seca and so on are also removed which you get this barebones game that AC1 in early access able to offer more tracks. One of AC's biggest strength is with the large variety of meticulously modelled cars that drives distinctively from others, this strength is very much gone now. 

I can't recommend ACC at this stage especially the market has more games that offer similar class but with many more other types of cars and much more places to race on.

My experience trying to play ACC in VR:

Start game in VR, menu is several feet below my seated position so I have to crane my neck to see anything.

Enter driver info; can't use mouse in VR to select each text box. Close out of ACC to start game out of VR.

Start game again; game tries to launch in VR several times even when selecting ""no HMD""

Exit SteamVR, unplug HMD, restart PC.

Finally start ACC on desktop, type driver info, and configure controls.

Start SteamVR and restart ACC under SteamVR. ACC starts in SteamVR Cinema mode

Exit ACC, close SteamVR, and restart ACC letting ACC start SteamVR itself.

Recenter HMD button doesn't work. UI is still below me.

Choose to grin and bear it. Start Career mode. Opening cutscene has no audio.

Load into pit box. View is several feet above my car. Recenter HMD button still doesn't work, but the Recenter HMD keyboard shortcut (that is only introduced to you when loading races) does. Center in cockpit. Pit menu is still below me and impossible to read. Apparently UI elements don't adjust when centering VR view.

Quit game and google a fix.  Edit the configuration settings so the UI is always locked to my gaze.  Now it's usable, but all UI elements are no stuck in my peripheries and just barely legible.

Finally start driving.  The game is a flickering mess of jaggies, even with everything on max and my supersampling setting set to 150%, and with the UI elements in my peripheries, I can't even see what my TC settings are at.",1559204891,1559204891,False,3,0,0.528347790241241455,0,True,False,False,76561198001588207,701,2,3069,0,586,1600056651

VR was not quite ready and there was good input as to how to improve it. Since VR is a big thing in sim-racing, I think this will be improved over time.

My last actual test was in the last big EA-iteration with the NIsmo on my home-turf-track and it was a blast. It looked gorgeous, performance was fine and, most importantly, it felt very good. I would even say, that ACC, to me, is the first kind-of iRacing-contender, that I know.

Comments

0. The FFB and the motion telemetry is top noch on Accuforce DD wheel and for the motion rig. The cars feels properly planted on the road, there is a ramp of decline grip when driving on the edge, vs the instant loss of control in iRacing (pre-v7 tire model).

1. Why car is already started and running on single player practice when my preferences are set to manual?

2. Overall performance is greatly improved (using built-in fps/cpu counter). I have a powerful pc with RTX 2080ti and still greatly benefit from the optimization. I unpluged my VR headset since the game seem to force steamVR on and that seems to be impacting performance. As soon as I upgraded to the last Nvidia drivers and turned on vsync, no more tearing/stuttering. The graphics are really crisp like in iRacing since I turned on the in-game sharpening option.

3. The required position to park your car in the pit is simply too difficult...I had to move forward and backward 3 times to get it right. It needs to be a box like RRE or a dude with a pole like in iRacing.

4. The ""setup"" needs a lot of love for beginners. Every setting option needs a detailed description of what the effect is and what a high or low value does. Simply match what iracing or project cars 2 does. They nailed that one.

5. Not sure why they kept the poorly recorded / placeholder voice over work for the crew chief. You can clearly tell the voice if from the producer (Mario). Professional voice over is $5 for 60 seconds on Fivver. :) 

6. I see hotlap as a game mode, but I don't see a worldwide leaderboard. Am I missing something... I love racing other against the clock with or without fixed setups.

Very early days but currently IMO it doesn't seem to have the same high-resolution, realistic 'feel' in the handling of the car, in AC1 every twitch of the steering wheel has an amazing, deep physics-based responsiveness whereas right now ACC feels a little on-rails.

From the sample of tracks and cars we have so far, they have character and depth; tracks seem to be extremely accurate.

Most importantly of all, the cars are fun to drive, and each car feels different. Too many ""sims'' have all their GT3 cars feel exactly the same and ultimately are far too easy to drive; here it feels like they are spot on. Default setups are pretty forgiving, but when you start winding the ABS and TC down, and go for the more aggressive set ups in search of laptime, they really come alive.

62,50741664,english,"Sitting there in the quiet car, race countdown coming to 10s, Ignition on, Starter. The engine roars up. Formation starts rolling, out of the last corner, towards the line, your crewchief on the radio tells you ""Green flag, Go!"". And from there on forget everything, floor the pedal and fight for thousands of a second.

This game is a serious simulation, be sure of this when you think of getting into it. When you enter a corner you need to think about what each of your wheels is doing, how the loads are distributed, what each square of rubber can give you. But still the entry is quite easy in my opinion. There are three setups for each track and car combination. A safe setup which you can use to get aquainted with the car, a wet setup for rainy days and an agressive setup. The latter being the one for me to focus on. It´s a good base which will work, even if you might optimize some bits here and there after a few laps. When I got there, hunting the green spot of the delta timer in hotlaps, qualification runs or races time just began to fly by.

Right now a week before scheduled 1.0 release, I really enjoy it. Functions are still limited, but the overall is impressive. A short breakdown:

Graphics: Given the right hardware it can look really good. TAA shows some ghosting in replays, but it looks like this is hard to avoid with the Unreal Engine. Hardware is quite important, driving at 4K and 70% scale my 1060 6GB is at the limit. It works fine for me, but it won´t put out a lot more than 60 fps on high settings.

Controls: I have only tested it with my G25 and for a short run with a Fanatec wheel during the Spa event last year. Feedback is convincing for me and provides the information I need.

AI: It might be that you need to do a restart every now and than, but close racing can feel really good. It´s important to set the strength correct (I set it so that I can qualify mid field and it´s possible for me to gain about 1-3 positions with hard racing) and not overdo it on the aggressiveness.

Atmosphere: Game changer in my opinion. The sounds are one of the games highlights, every rattle, shake, pump, curb, marbles, wheelslip, etc. comes to the ears naturally. Running down the straight at Nürburgring, where I´ve been myself quite a few times looks as close as I´ve never seen it in a game.

MP: It´s been a huge point of discussion over the last days, but for me the current system with weights works quite well after a short period of getting used to it. For me this is enough for server selection. During a session my experience regarding ping has been quite ok even though once I had a collision which a buddy of mine whom I raced with didn´t notice. Also I get a short ""hiccup"" every now and than. I guess it occurs when a car model needs to be loaded for a car that wasn´t used in the session before.

To make it short: If you are interested in a serious simulation of an interesting GT3 series, I can only advise you to go for it.",1558383498,1558383498,True,30,6,0.642718195915222168,0,True,False,True,76561197997655942,33,2,21030,321,2738,1601930597

This game is gorgeous, and looks nice if you have a ray-tracing capable graphics card.  The sounds are also ungodly realistic, to the point that they seem a bit annoying if you don't know how a car sounds in real life (believe me - I have never driven a real race car).

One thing that has always stood out about AC is that it feels like you are 'driving' the car. I've always felt that their competition has some sort of steering assist at times (although it IS turned off) around certain corners; this always breaks the immersion for me. There is non of that in this title... every corner requires the same amount of concentration and effort to get it right - it never feels like the car is doing something unintentional.

HUGE improvement with regards to the brakes on the G29. You really need to press hard to reach maximum stopping force... Really thrilled with this.

Another big plus is that you can hear they spent a lot of time and effort on the overall sound. The cars really sound great, good surface feedback, slipstream effect... just overall a huge improvement over their past title.

The AI is all round exceptional; it never feels like there is a 50-50% chance of making the first corner. And racing against them is really fun and challenging.

- Typical bugs of Unreal Engine (looking washed out; ghosting effect, etc) but
- Lot's of options in the graphic settings to deal with them
- Triple Screen not directly supported, but possible get around
- ""only"" GT3 cars of 2018 / 2019 Blancpain Series (who would have thought, duh)
- Advanced physics from Assetto Corsa (engine has been implemented)
- AI has some problems with ramming / ignoring the player, but is raceable (for some Aliens not fast enough)

- running nicely in VR (if you have an appropriate GPU, and NO, a 1070 is NOT enough, as with any other good looking VR game)

90,50264904,english,"learned more about true racing in 20 hours of playing Competizione, than in the previous 300 hours of riding Assetto Corsa.

The swap to the unreal engine gives the track a greater depth and feel, the weight of the cars, physics and traction are represented in ways that just don't exist in the older engines used by sim racers. Perhaps maybe this can be part explained by the VR exploiting that depth of vision, and the bucket seated Sparco racing rig adding to the feeling. It's more than that though, those things existed in the 300hrs of AC. You now hear and feel the wheels spinning up if you over do the gas, your grip wasting away on your tires making ever more demand to get your line and throttling right. The physics engine exploits absolutely everything, the wonderful engine notes demand your attention and speak to what your getting wrong or right.

All of that has schooled me more in 20 hours in the last week, over anything gone before. I needed to see and feel those things i was getting wrong, and in that Competizione is an absolute triumph.

This is a review i wasn't going to write until they did the full release, but last night everything above finally clicked after racing 20 minutes of Zolder in multiplayer. Only finished 9th, but it was 20 minutes of everything i learned over the last week that put me in a group that finished within 2 seconds of each other.

Technically there's a ways to go to improve performance. I run VR and it took a 2080ti, SteamVR's motion reduction, and running steamVR's density scale at 2.0 to get it running smooth and looking to about 75% of what Pcars 2 does without the 90fps because i don't have to induce motion smoothing for a default 45.

I think that'll work itself out over time with improved technology, rendering techniques, and efforts from Kunos to refine performance of everything they've bolted together.

I've got a decent enough PC to run in VR and I can honestly say towards the end I'd forgotten I was playing a game.  The sunset and light reflecting of the track was stunning.

TL;DR - If I could pay to have this removed from my owned games, I would. It's that bad in VR. Horrible implementation, as though there is absolutely ZERO understanding of how a U.I/Navigation should work in VR.
----------------------

Here's how this went for me with the following:
Logitech G29 wheel
HTC Vive
GTX 1080 @ 2000
17-6700K @ 4.4

------------------------

Load the game up and an (Albeit nice) intro video starts playing, although it's in a small floating window slightly off to one side.

Video finishes and I'm presented with an option to enter my full name inc surname, and a nickname.
The input fields can not be selected by keyboard, mouse or wheel. I'm stuck.

After trying all buttons on my keyboard and wheel I finally decide to ALT-TAB and close the game.

Reload the game, I'm no longer shown the name/nickname entry, but I'm thrown mid-air/floating into a garage facing a weird direction. Looking around/down towards the ground I find a mechanic behind me staring sideways at a wall.

But at least I now I have a navigation menu with video/sound options etc, again on a small overlay/screen. I still have no mouse to use so try the obvious keyboard arrows/enter, and pretty much every other button but nothing works.

Try the wheel, to find that the 'SQUARE' button seems to work as an enter/proceed key, nothing else on the wheel worked. Shown in the bottom left is a strange:
 [0-Back | 1-Confirm] or something like that, which means absolutely nothing.

Proceeding through the options ends up a frustrating mess figuring out that the D-Pad on the wheel does actually work for up/down/left/right in parts. But the buttons to enter/go back through options just seems erratic and not the same each time, made more confusing by the fact that 'X' is normally a proceed/enter button when it comes to playstation (G29 wheel).

Trying to actually change/configure options such as 'Throttle input' brings more frustration. Navigating to the option to highlight it, is literally all I can manage. Pressing buttons on the wheel does nothing, pressing enter and more on keyboard does nothing. I tried changing other options, but failed to work out how.

I think sod it, and try to jump into a car.  I manage to get back to main menu and a random button mashing gets me in.

Upon entering the car, my view is wrong and I cant work out how to change/reset it. I think sod it again, I'll just drive like this. Mashed at random buttons on the wheel to get going. Exiting the pits, initially looking good graphically...

Pressed the throttle and realised it was already full throttle.... Pressed brakes. Nothing. It was steering at least! Pressed clutch. Vroom....oom...oom. Rpm drops. The clutch is the throttle, inversed.

ALT-TAB again, close game. 

Load game in flat/monitor mode so I can have my glorious mouse pointer back. Crazy how unappreciated the ol' mouse pointer is when it's ridiculously not implemented when it's a basic form of navigation on PC.

I can now navigate like a normal 2018 PC user by pointing and clicking!
I can now change settings for inputs such as throttle. Although the weird [0-Back | 1-Confirm] thing is still there meaning...something, maybe it's morse code for 'Not Working'.

Some changes made, double checking basic inputs such as throttle, brake, clutch, gears (Flappy paddle), lights, pause, etc are all bound. The menu's aren't great and still look a little old hat, a little improvement over AC. A million miles from PC2.
The descriptions for re-centering the VR view are just overly described to the point you have to think about them.

Jump back on track! Throttle and brake now working, but still inversed. Clutch doing absolutely nothing at all. :-/ 
Back out again, find the inverse options which were correct. Re-choose-choose again. Check inputs visually on all pedals. Throttle, brake, clutch all have 0-100 inputs showing correctly.

Jump on track again. Attempt to recentre VR view, seems to work sometimes by holding two buttons, or was it just one? Eventually get myself seated correctly. Let's leave the pits.

Graphically looking good...Until....Join track. Instantly have stuttering and instantly feel a little sick. Drive through it...Keep going. The car sounds fantastic, like really 'mechanical', the whining of the gears, almost hearing the vibration of solid engine mounts, gears etc. Really does sound superb. But It understeers like hell while I try to ignore the frame skipping and shimmering. 

Try to adjust brake balance, hit my rotational knob (The one on the wheel, calm down) and see the drivers arms actually animate doing the same sort of thing, Thought oh that's cool, and it kept going as I tuned my G29's dial, but then it made me feel more sick just because there was a delay which was pretty prominent. With little/to no delay it would be great! Although maybe an option to turn the animation off would be good.

Getting faster around the track. The car never felt too impressive (Without any tweaking), and the graphics seemed to get worse/more glitchy the more I played.

-------------------

At this point, I turned it off. Watched Youtubers having much the same issues, much the same comments on how the physics aren't quite there and numerous other issues, many of which seemingly may or may not be fixed/integrated into the game.
I'm not filled with confidence at this point so I'm considering a refund, especially as when all said and done, although it 'May' end up at least easier to navigate, it may get better graphically (Optimised), the physics may well improve...It will still be a few cars and a few tracks.

I wanted it to be awesome and show potential, with graphical glitches, navigation problems and all to be expected! I really did.

With this kind of early access release being in the state it is though you can't feel confident in how the game will improve, simply because right from firing the game up, you are presented with issues. Simple issues that should not be there even in early access. It's more an alpha test demo IMO. If you don't get navigation right from the start, then how can you expect other functions to be used, tested, constructively criticised or complimented?

To summarise:
The physics are not up to scratch IMO, cars look a little strange as though they're floating in an arcade like way, the most basic of mouse integration isn't implemented in VR, it made me feel sick as AC does (Literally can't play it) along with other people/reviewers reiteration of issues...Well I'm just not confident in it myself.

I have 12 days or so to refund it, and hope that in that period at least basic mouse navigation is added to make the other errors more palatable at least.",1542309724,1554340147,False,2,0,0.450900018215179443,0,True,False,True,76561198297606643,59,14,527,0,58,1554839430

Pros - Graphically, it looks much better than most titles out. Sound department did a great job, too. UI, seems to be pretty decent. 
Cons - Tire physics are a disaster IMO. FF feels clumsy at best. 1 car, 1 track? 
I won't refund it, as I'll save myself 45% from full price now, but they really need to pay a lot of attention to the physics and FF for me to have any interest in firing it up again. Also, how can you market VR if you aren't prepared to launch early access with it?

Update 3/29 - While they have made some vital improvements, if I don't feel like dealing with the server issues online, I play against the AI.

All track are laser Scanned which is so weird driving on the track, I'm use to other racing game were only Nurburgring is Laser Scanned. Track are very nice details and braking line and racing line are perfect !

For now Assetto Corsa Competizion is first in the lead. iRacing is way to expensive and feels old. This game lived up with Unreal Engine which is the most powerful engine you can find right now, even though they use their own physics and not the engine physics it's still a realistic Racing Simulation.

Did not play really in the rain at his full potential, but it's good. It's like Project Cars 2 but better. nothing special there.

Cars design and sound are spot on. Though, the Ferrari 488 GT3 need a bit of tuning with the back fires. I can't wait to have the Porsche and other GT3's. I hope they will put like the Ferrari Challenge, Porsche GT3 Cup Challenge and or the GTE class.

This game has really good potential. It's not a money grabber like Forza or iRacing.
All content in this game are legit LICENSED !

It's the first Racing game that you can crank an engine without the Ignition being ON !! Like real life.

Ok, let's talk about Physics. I never drove a real GT3 race car before. But from video, I cann tell you that it's the same thing.
Sound are the same thing, How the car noise dive in hard braking, how the car bounces when going in bump is like the same as seen in videos ! Look at 19Bozzy92 and look at ACC physics. You won't see a single difference as both are super close !

That's it for now. Only thing I would love to see is like RaceRoom Racing or R3E that when in Flying mode you can heard the engine in the back ground.

Only thing I would tell you is buy the game now before it got expensive before release. I paid 35$CAD and now it's at 50$CAD. So jump in before it's too late :)

This game uses the UE4 engine, which undortunately will be hard for the modders to work with, some say impossible, but lets wait and see..

60,48147646,english,"A Casual Gamer's Review

So a brief background on my experience with racing games. I don't play racing simulations. I barely even play arcade racing games, the one's I did play though were NFS Underground 1 and 2, NFS Most Wanted, Dirt 2, and Real Racing 3 (on the iPad). I played those game with all assists on (steering, braking, clutching, etc) - the only thing that I had to do was press forward, left, and right, and sometimes brake. I played those games on keyboards - NFS Underground 2 with a PS2 controller. So much for my racing background.

Right now, I am playing Assetto Corsa Competizione on an Acer Predator laptop. Here are the specifications:
Intel i7-6700 HQ
nVidia GTX970M
16GB RAM
1 TB HDD

You might notice that I don't have a high end gaming PC but this game still gives me 30-42 fps with the settings all set to EPIC and let me tell you, ACC is a beautiful game (graphics wise). There are noticeable fps drops at certain times of the day - for instance in Hungaroring at 5pm the fps drops to 30fps and at some turns it further drops to 25fps. Rain also affects the fps ever so slightly and the drop is barely noticeable compared to the time of the day. I also did a quick race with 16 opponents and the fps remains at 30-42. While there remains much to be optimized, I am more than satisfied with how the game runs on my laptop. On a sidenote, I get 60+ fps when I lower the graphics settings. I would also like to note that I don't play multiplayer (maybe when the game fully launches).

As for controls, I was disappointed that ACC does not play well using keyboard - sorry, that was an understatement, keyboard controls are trash. Fortunately, I am having fun playing ACC on my Xbox 360 controller. The developers claim that keyboard and controller support are (as of the moment) minimal, but I am perfectly happy with my Xbox controller. That being said, I borrowed my friend's Thrustmaster T150 and holy sheet the difference in gameplay experience is like night and day. This game was definitely designed with a racing wheel in mind.

ACC is also office friendly - that is to say you can play this game offline with AI opponents. I played a quick race with all assists turned to max and AI difficulty set to lowest (80) and aggression to 0 (I know, don't say it) but I was still having difficulty beating them. If you come from arcade racing background, I would advise you to practice on your own first as this game takes some time to learn but once you do, I swear the wins are more ""rewarding"".

As to actual content, ACC is still in early access. There are only four tracks available and a limited number of cars but I don't really care, I bought the game for the Ferrari 488 GT3.

TL;DR Assetto Corsa Competizione is a hardcore racing simulation that is surprisingly accessible for casual arcade racing gamers - provided you are willing to learn that there is more to racing games than just pressing W.",1546784632,1546784632,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,True,76561198083173811,264,12,958,0,529,1569383522

64,48032948,english,"One of the most realisitc racing games I have played since I quit iRacing. I grew up playing NASCAR Racing 2002 and then shifted to street track focused games like GRID and Project Cars 1 & 2, so my history with racing games is pretty long, over 15 years! 

Despite this game being in EA, the product already has an excellent polish in both gameplay and graphics. The main thing I miss is my H-gate shifter that I got to go with my Logitech G920, but I'm sure they will take care of that detail soon (1/2/19 G920's companion shifter isn't functional). 

I just recently got a stainless steel folding wheel/flight mount and boy does it feel nice in this title. Somehow this game is able to capture the feel of racing, a hard concept to explain, but anyone who has grown up around racing will see what I mean when they get in game. A lot of racing games leave little re-play value outside of Multiplayer, but Competizione is somehow able to feel exciting even in time trials/hotlaps!

The realism of this game is really where it shines, from weather to track conditions to pit stop adjustments, almost nothing was left unturned in this ambitious title. Sound design is superb with all the adjustments you could possibly want, aside from setting the number of audio channels or the dynamic range (i.e. laptop speakers, headphone, full range). It's the quality of track and car effects which stand out, 800+ horses sounds almost intoxicating to my ears.

VR is at best awfully optimised at present even on my 8700k @5ghz and a GTX1080Ti FE it’s only just passable on hot laps with no other cars on the grid..

I drove the Huracan GT3 car (which I've raced in real life at Sebring 12h) and the car felt like it was on ice and constantly sliding with TC engaging in the weirdest way.

I find this sim even harder than driving the cars in real life. I've applied setups from real-world tests I've done in an effort to try and cure some of the handling issues but to no avail.

84,44725256,english,"A nice glimpse of what the next 6 months of development will have in store for race sim enthusiasts.

Just to name one of the new features compared to Assetto Corsa is the driver rating system. Although it doesn't always connect to it's back end server (Early Access, guys). It rates you how well you do as a driver on multiple skills, but also coaches you to improve your driving. A very nice touch I must say, and very confronting at the same time. All too often I get the ""Too aggressive"" message. And after braking a bit earlier and smoother and easing on the throttle you will see the occasional ""Perfect"" followed by an improved lap time. Awesome!

[Release 0.3.4 Update]
Kunos have added basic multiplayer (practise only for now).
The rating system has no more connection issues, like I mentioned above (was fixed in an earlier release).
And we also have the awesome BMW M6 GT3, what a nice and controlable beast is that!

Some con's that come to mind:
- VR works, but getting nice and crisp image quality takes some experimenting with the settings and reading the forums. Plus the temporal anti aliasing is leaving some ghosting effects.
- Also when it turns dark and the headlights turn on, you notice that the framerate drops when it gets crowded on track. So your VR experience is not always buttery smooth. Even on a fairly beefy system.

But remember it is still early access, so these issues are bound to be fixed later on.

94,45838556,english,"I am recommending this game because I can see the great potential it has. When it works it is so much more immersive than any of the other sims - mostly due to the sound and the violence of the force-feedback (if it works at all).

In its current state at build 3 it is still way from decent from a usability standpoint, especially in VR which is currently a bit of a joke. 

Force feedback for my direct drive wheel worked in build 2 (it wasn't great but it at least worked) but in build 3 it no longer does most of the time. If I reboot and start this game first thing then it does work about one third of the time, but if I run any other game first then this one it doesn't work. Starting any other driving game has no problem with it, just this game. It can take up to about 10 attempts restarting the game to get it working sometimes. Not ideal!

For the cars, the Lambo drove terribly - nothing even close to a real car (I've driven quite a few race cars on real tracks). It was very floaty as if on roller skates and you never really felt you were in the car in VR.

The Bentley was much better. Felt a lot more like a real car, but still there is something wrong with the feeling in VR. Somehow you don't feel you are turning in the right way within the car as it corners. As if you are on a swivel chair. This is true for all the cars in VR.

The BMW was a bit better again and, when everything works, I love racing it around Paul Ricard - it feels so real but unreal at the same time. I really want it to feel real and it seems to have the potential but there is something very off about it in VR - both the movement and the force feedback. 

The lack of mouse support in VR is a joke. It makes the whole experience a complete pain. I mean, come on, no mouse support in the 2nd VR release. That's awful and says something about priorities for usability - very low.

Force feedback is both great and terrible at the same time. There is a rawness about it that other sims don't have - it draws you in with the violence it can exhibit on a direct drive wheel, but at the same time it does not feel real. It feels like a big elastic band is wrapped around it and the further you turn the harder it gets and if you let go it springs back violently. There is no feel for understeer or oversteer at all - it took me a while to realise I was understeering through all the bends at first but then I realised the sound was giving it away, not the steering. Instead of basing the FF on AC, which has one of the best implementations around, they seem to have started from scratch and it it really, really poor (but also awesome in some ways at the same time - go figure!).

Graphics is another area that has great potential but falls flat in build 3. In VR I have most things on high or Epic in VR (2080ti) but it is all blurry. Even looking at cars next to you are really blurry (sharpness set to 100%). If it could just be brought into focus it would look great but for now it looks you are looking through a lightly frosted glass at the world.

I have high hopes for this game but as of build 3 with terrible drivability of 2 out of 3 cars, intermitently working and rubber-band-like force feedback, lack of the basics for VR like mouse support, blurry VR graphics, and so on, I could hold off buying this until it shows more promise (you'll pick it up on sale soon enough after release) but then you would miss out on some great fun it provides already (BMW on Paul Ricard in VR). I keep going back to racing the BMW at Paul Ricard at 98-100% strength and love it (and hate it because of the potential for greatness that is not yet close to being realised).",1542363906,1543485265,True,0,0,0.501176536083221436,0,True,False,True,76561198026746020,69,5,5061,0,2686,1600298538

Best Simracing game on the market yet (considering physics, sound, visuals, track build, etc.) Watched CSGO Faceit Majors day and night to get souvenier drops and then sold them to buy this game (since i am a student... no money). Thanks Valve.

I hope the developers will release proper manuals of each car during the development to make it clear that which car has which utilites (for example the Huracan GT3 has automatic clutch system). 

Best experience so far even in Practice mode. Highly optimised game. Getting 25-30 FPS @720p @ultra_settings in every weather condition on my Potato (w.r.t. this game). Minor bugs which if you report on https://www.assettocorsa.net/forum/index.php?forums/acc-general-discussions.62/ will be fixed ASAP.

AND BY FAR i freaking LOVE this game!

The developmentment from the offical release till 11/25/18 has been a process for sure, a lot of features and tweaks have been added/made to make this game feel and play so good!
SERIOUSLY THIS GAME HAS WICKED AMOUNTS OF POTIENTAL. GIVE THIS GAME A TRY YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT

I remember in the beginning there was slight input lag, FFB was a complaint and optimization wasnt to great...
I own a ts pc racer, t3pa pedals, and now at 11/25/18 the FFB is by far simply amazing, when the car is sliding out of control im able to correct the slide like a real life rwd vehicle. Also the bumps on curbs, and the road surfaces have improve dramatically! The precise quickness of input the game recieves from my wheel is amazing also.

my rig is a ryzen 1600x, rx 480 8gb, 16gb of ddr4, and this game with custom (but mainly higher end settings) gets me above 60 fps on 1080p on a graphically demanding title. and if you know the unreal engine it doesnt like amd to much, but the optimization is very very good compared to other unreal engine games! i have no lag issues, the only time i experience some stutter but very slight is in multiplayer when players join. but it is very minor.

YOU FEEL like you are actually there, racing in the cars you are driving. Seriously the sounds are so good that imo they sound way better then iracing and raceroom. whatever kunos did to the sound really makes you feel immersed into the driving, and this feature by far has me eger to continue playing. Cant love cars without a great sound!


Pros:
Sound is simply amazing
graphics are beyond PC2 Level
FFB is simply more improved and feels really fantastic
Menu's are simple to navigate and easy to tweak
onboard view angles and settings are amazing

Cons:
Early access game = not to much content, But this isnt terrble
Ive heard issues with vr, but i do not play in vr. IF you play with vr wait till they patch the known issues
Overall con - its an early access and not everything is in place yet (which i wish was)



Overall if you are a sim racing nut and want a great game to throughly enjoy then this is for you! 
If you are a casual racer, this game can be for you but dont take the game as a joke, race fair and clean!
Great game, amazing how well it has came in such short time, updates are being pushed out decently often.

12,46986523,english,"I really can't recommend this game enough. I follow the Blancpain GT Series closely so I was thrilled to see it receive its own dedicated game, but failed to anticipate just how great a job 505 would do with it. The attention to detail is mind-boggling. It's perfect, with tracks replicated to the inch and the cars sounding just as raw as they should, right down to the last crunch, whine and whistle - a feat which few other games manage.

I loved the original Assetto Corsa, but there were a few issues. In terms of graphics and audio, on my PC at least, you could tell it was the first game in the series from a relatievely inexperienced developer. On top of that, I could rarely do a full lap without spinning out seemingly without reason - although more to do with struggling to find the sweet spot on various sensitivities and deadzones than the game's physics. ACC fixes these comprehensively. It looks and sounds gorgeous, and plays exactly how I'd want it to. 

It's important to remember that despite these strengths, it's still in early access. At the time of writing this, there are 3 cars and 3 tracks and the full release is likely around 5 months away, yet it's already incredibly well refined. That said, there's so much more potential to fill when you consider DLC - if the SRO decide to let Kunos and 505 delve into their past categories  (which isn't unlikely) the results could be phenomenal. GT1-4, the new GT2 class, British GT, Blancpain, FIA GT, and BPR (to name a few) all together in one game to such a high level of detail? Yes please.

Considering the likes of Forza and Project Cars already have a problem on their hands with the ACC early access, I have no doubt that the full game will absolutely be worth your time and money.

ive played pretty much all the driving games and sims ever worth playing.ac and acc are the only driving sims left on my pc bar rf2.i do like a couple others and have been the biggest fan ever of grannies tourisimo.when im driving and pushing quicker and quicker laps i go into the zone out phase.consistant and smooth.im not the best racer but i give some.i like to get there as effortlessly as possible and here on acc i can do that same as ac.the menus are a little arcade but whats really important is the drive...
now i have a g29 which is not true direct drive but nether the less is pretty good on the ffb.ive had a g27 too.the feel i get on assetto feels very close to driving fast for real.other sims are close too but other points in those sims let them down.
  i will warn you not to get this game on early access if you dont want few tracks and cars right now.not long for more.but if ya want a very nice indeedie fast as fluff drive then get it right now.this is going to be one of the best serious drivers sims of all time when it goes full release.long races for clean am to pro sim drivers.everything is balanced nicely on unreal engine and the physics are damn good.same as ac pretty much.
the new ranking system looks to be like its going to work very well.even though 99% of drivers in practice at the moment are very clean and curtiuos.this is not for the light harted driver either.yuove got to be quick and for long stints.everything you do goes towards a points system to rate you in different aspects.
spot on physics
looks real nice
sounds amazing,headset
accurate tracks
accurate cars from the mb gt3 series
simple yet sophisticated menus with a dash of console
best driver rating system yet....hope this transfers to vetting and matching drivers well
if ya havnt got a wheel and pedals i sugest you go clean some cars for cash and go get one.looking to upgrade to direct drive but hey this is still effin awsome.
99/100
ps. for anyone who wants to be silly and make a comparison of ps4 ac just to try and diss acc then stop.dont even.ac is dumbed right the fu4k down for ps4 bar the physics.i have it so i know i play them both as i race ps4 sometimes.console has nothing on pc for sim gaming at this time.",1542913896,1542913896,True,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True,76561198169848822,38,2,16784,0,4525,1598649750

Performance is fantastic in VR and it's probably the best looking VR game (right behind Hellblade). Unfortunately, there are so many bugs and weird glitches that it ruins the experience, especially in VR. 

First off, the game doesn't launch if your SteamVR is already on, so you need to start the game with SteamVR off for it to even boot up, which is very annoying. The worst part about this is that for some unknown reason, upon starting the game, the program seemed to change my primary sound device to my main desktop speakers and not to my Vive. And it seems to have locked these settings in SteamVR because every time I start SteamVR now it defaults back to my main desktop speakers. Super weird, right? And even worse... because the game can only be launched with SteamVR off, means that every single time I start the game the sound won't work. Changing my audio device while in-game doesn't seem to work too, so I'll never be able to play this game with sound while in VR until a patch is released. 

The controller sensitivity is also way too high but I won't give them crap for that because this game is probably made for steering wheels, which I plan to get later on. Once they fix these very annoying game breaking issues, then I'll change my review to a positive.

The graphics are gorgeous, absolutely stunning. I ran a flawless 60fps (v-sync on @ 1080p) with my Ryzen 5 2600x (No OC) and STRIX 1070

The game has much improved since the first release. After playing some with the new updates and hotfixes, the game is surprisingly playable. 

Controls work properly now, and you can actually get Force Feedback . Cars, even in the 'storm' weather preset, are very drivable now. Bumps are not the ice patches that they were before, and you don't spin out every time you nudge the wheel.

But, there's still no multiplayer, still no mods, and still a drought of vanilla content. Orignal AC has much more mods, much more vanilla content, and has multiplayer.

The long and short of it is this:
If you want a well developed, high quality game with a virtually endless supply of content, get the original Assetto Corsa. 

But, if you want a game with high end, modern graphics, and a superior physics engine, grab ACC. More content is on the way (it is in early access after all), and mod support will likely come in the future as well (please add a Steam Workshop page this time around).

This is a great looking game for sure and runs quite well even in VR on the highest settings (running a 1080).

I get a really good feeling in my wheel of the car straddling the limits and can manage the car back to full grip (or not) based on the feedback. I'm using simvibe as well which works great but the wheel really provides some good feedback. My favorite sim is raceroom for pure driving feel and enjoyment, but this is up there. It still does not translate the feeling of speed like R3E manages to through some voodoo they have going on, but it's early. Overall very promising and worth the experience for any sim racer. VR is currently useable. Just expect to spend 10 minutes getting it going and the menus in the right spot and such at first.

For WMR users, i found the best way to get it going is to add the -vr in start commands, then start the game from steam without steamvr running yet.

Assetto Corsa Competizione is not Assetto Corsa 2. Assetto Corsa is your usual racing sim: it offers a bunch of cars, events, and a tracks for you to figure out what kind of racing you want to do. Granted, it’s excellent, and does a remarkable job of capturing the essence of driving a performance vehicle at speed. But it’s hard for a game to reach real greatness when it’s trying to give you a little bit of everything, instead of mastering a single idea.

Assetto Corsa Competizione is the official game of the Blancpain GT Series. Gone are the road cars and race cars that aren’t GT3s. Also gone are a number of tracks. For the pre-release version I played, it’s actually down to one car (Lamborghini Huracan GT3) and one track (Nurburgring), but the final version will of course have everything from the series.

With this self-imposed limitation comes the opportunity for real refinement. Getting 17 cars perfect and laser scanning ten tracks takes a lot of effort. Offering dozens of cars and tracks just means that, unless it’s a multi-year project with a constant influx of cash, the resources aren’t there to attain perfection. That’s why this limitation appears to be laying the foundation for brilliance.


The car dynamics are fantastic already. They wiggle believably when given overzealous inputs, get a bit sphincter-clenchingly unsettled if you hit a curb too aggressively, and maintain just a hint of oversteer before spinning out. That’s what real race cars do – they’re not meant to drift, but they are meant to give enough feedback for a skilled driver to feel when the limits are being pushed. It’s genuinely difficult, and it should be.



THERE'S A LEVEL OF TRUST IN YOUR DRIVING SKILL THAT FEW OTHER RACING GAMES OFFER

As is it is on actual asphalt, driving a race car in Assetto Corsa Competizione is dramatically different from a road car, even when pushed to the limit on the track. Even the more hardcore sports cars are designed to give leeway to amateur drivers who just happen to have the cash for something fast. Race cars assume professionalism from the driver and don’t tolerate sloppiness – it’s a level of trust in your driving skill that few other racing games offer. The weather is also some of the most realistic I’ve experienced in a game. I’m one of those drivers who loves a wet track, and that feeling of reduced grip and increased opportunity to set yourself apart from the pack kept me coming back.

Ode to the road
ODE TO THE ROAD
At the other end of the spectrum of Assetto Corsa, we have the much more arcade-influenced Forza Horizon 4. Both games, however, share love for good asphalt.


Where Assetto Corsa Competizione falls a bit short is the force feedback and the setup. A significant portion of my time was spent configuring my wheel (a Fanatec Clubsport) by navigating a few unintuitive menus and eventually discovering that all my inputs were inverted by default. While I’m happy I was able to change it, I’m a bit baffled as to why I had to do it in the first place.

Once I finally got out of the pit lane I found another problem: the steering is surprisingly light and feels dead. This wheel is usually a fairly good communicator, which is odd that it felt like it was giving me a leisurely cruise in a 2001 Buick Century rather than an assault on the Nurburgring with a Lamborghini race car. I turned the force feedback gain up all the way and it was closer to what I was expecting. Once that gets sorted out this could easily be one of the best racing sims out there. Beyond that, I’m happy to see the Blancpain GT Series get a dedicated game, and overjoyed that it’s one with such attention to quality.",1539576110,1539576152,True,7,0,0.551815927028656006,2,True,True,True,76561198190516315,57,7,30206,0,8826,1551307245

53,45124566,english,"I like AJ's review here - good summary. As a direct comparrison, I drove the same car and location in Project Cars 2, first in practice and then a race. This tends to high-light immediate differences, but as I've never driven a Huracan at the 'Ring I won't opine as which feels more 'real'.

Not having TrackIR or VR I rely on 'look to apex', and have found the 'helmet' view in PC2 disorienting with its anticipative interpretation, so cannot use it. ACC's version has less actual rotation, but I find the head tilt and pitch movement very immersive. I can almost feel the car move.

The graphics are less sharp due to the TAA used with the Unreal4 engine, but there is a total lack of 'jaggies'. My old eyes do not mind the lack sharpness compare to MSAA in PC2, but this is bound to improve with more development. Both run at 75fps (v-sync) at max graphics (recommended pc spec), but for some reason ACC gives me the impression of being more photo-realistic.

The AI in ACC are actually rather good, and I have completed several races against them. I have seldom managed this in PC2. Not really relevant if you will only race on-line in future, but at least still engaging.

Using a TMX set at 900° with settings at realistic except for auto clutch (two pedals), the FFB feels more intuitive and communicative in ACC, but the car is more difficult to catch when you overstep the mark (reminds me a bit of GTR). ACC requires more finesse and therefore feels more rewarding to me than PC2.

At this stage (Release 1) this feels like a finished product with very limited content, and at the EA price in my country it's a steal. I am sure it will still improve as it is developed, but if all that is added to it from now is additional content, I would not be dissapointed.",1538770738,1538771247,True,9,1,0.590163946151733398,0,True,False,True,76561197971130768,77,2,4770,66,769,1600958192

It is lacking the ability to assign engine start. So selecting manual engine start is rendered useless currently. I run everything on realistic settings and manual, and assign everything on the dash and wheel 

The game visually so far looks good but not great. I have a ASUS 980ti STRIX and this Sim is barely pushing the limits of my GPU. I have a feeling they are holding back graphics a bit. As I am running this on a Samsung CHG90. The detail of the cockpit just isn't up to scratch as expected. 

The helmet cam setting is vomit inducing. Do not use it. It has way too much shift to be usable. I haven't checked to see if that is adjustable for less movement. Primarily because it's just bad currently. 

I primarily Race in VR when able, but often race on my monitor. When this title gains VR support I will comment on that. 

The handling needs work, a lot of work. I will premise this (Take this for what it is worth to you), as a person who has rented high end cars like Lamborghini, Ferrari, Koenigsegg etc. I understand that this is a different realm in regards to track racing versus street use, but still physics are physics in relation to driving an exotic car. On a dry track with optimum Tyre Temps etc. You spin out with the most minor tap from another Car in corners. You don't just slow down and drag through the dirt or the possibility of recovery. You fly through it like you're on ice and spin and rotate comically as if the rock pits weren't even there. Don't even ask about driving in rain. It's basically impossible to push the limits of the car in relation to weather. It needs more work.

Adjusting Traction control Below 6 is pointless. You can't keep control of the throttle and be competitive. Adjusting ABS at all seems pointless. Any adjustments render ABS broken. You can't keep up with the AI in corners. They seem to not care about the current physics model that you must adhere too. I don't see a Brake Bias adjustment for the Lamborghini, which may just  be the car specifically in reality, but the game allows assignment of it. The Lamborghini needs Brake Bias Controls, period. The current bias is way to heavy up front and you dive the nose a bit much with a lot of under steer. 

The sound is a plus. The dynamic sound for all the functions of the car sounds pretty spot on currently. I give kudos for the mostly unnoticed sounds such as perisitant rock chatter as you race on after cutting through the rocks. The rock chatter slowly diminishes as if you are clearing the undercarriage of leftover rock debris as you travel the track. The greatest thing about the game, currently, is the sound. Flying by the stands hearing the echo on a nice sound system is grin enducing.

If you are a hardcore Sim racer, buy into the game, as it looks promising as Beta release. But if you are a casual player of race titles. Wait until more has developed or the game fully releases.

I am not much of a racer but I enjoy the simulation part of the game. I turn off all the assist. I play in cockpit mode and switch off as much HUD as I can. Full immersion. I am aware that multi-player is not my cup of tea. But I still bought the game for the single player experience.

I play with gamepad. I have the F1 franchise, DiRT Rally and DiRT 4 (and other DiRT) in my library. Assetto Corsa Competizione is just not playable as a gamepad user. I have tried the recommended setting from the community. But nothing works. I have so much fun with other racing sims. For Competizione, I spent all my time trying to find a gamepad setting that works (which I failed) rather than enjoying that one track this early access offers as of now.

I am disappointed of course.

If you have a wheel, please ignore & take this review as a Recommendation.
-Pasted from my refund request, edited for this review.
[i] [inb4 ""It's a racing simulator what did you expect casual?""] [/i]


I bought this game aware that it was made primarily for wheel users, but I did not know it would be completely unplayble on gamepad. I went through literal scores of configurations and combinations of settings [i] (""scores"" being in terms of units of 20 - what a useful word I definitely didn't just look up right now, lol), [/i] to try and get it to the point where I could at least just drive around the track comfortably, but wheel response on controller is so incredibly sluggish and innacurate, yet at the same time paradoxically twitchy and percise, that I just wasn't able to do it.

The best way to describe steering on pad is that it's incredibly sensitve upon initial input, but the game struggles and really just completely fails to follow movement upon release, lagging behind your inputs significantly.
The real life driving equivalent would be to make a turn, not center the wheel or counter steer in any way to straighten out the vehicle, but instead completely let go of the wheel mid-turn hoping for the best, subsiquently drifting into oncoming traffic; it's just not how you drive, it's literally impossible to drive like that.

Again: all the play time you see was spent working on the controller settings. This isn't an issue with my ability as a driver or me just losing control of the vehicle and getting frustrated due to janky inputs on my end - I can drive perfectly fine, but even with [i] incredibly [/i] smooth inputs (I [b] really [/b] exaggerated how smooth I was being with my inputs at first because I thought I was just bad), it just feels like absolute garbage to do so. I've gotten such a feel for it through trying out dozens of configurations, that I can tell that the in-game steering wheel isn't even mapped to the analog stick's movements in refference to how far it is away from center position - the game reads stick input essentially like trigger input: ergo, how much ""force"" is applied, but not where it is in relation to the X axis. As you release the stick, the game basically reads it as you slowly disconnecting the controller.

It's just unplayable. It looks fantastic, it sounds great, it runs incredibly well, and I can tell the physics model is top notch from the bit of driving I did do - but I can't afford a wheel, so to me and everyone else that can't: it's unplayable.
It's really fucking sad, but I mean, just try playing Dark Souls Prepare to Die Edition on mouse and keyboard without DSMfix, or Guitar Hero with a Rapala Pro Bass fishing rod controller. Yeah, [i] technically [/i] you can do that, but you also [i] techincally [/i] can drink lighter fluid: neither are a really pleasant thing to do unless you absolutely hate yourself.

I know you Elite Pro: Gamers Rise Up™ sim racers out there will probably want to tell me off for even [i] attempting [/i] to play an Assetto Corsa game with pad, but even Super Meat Boy warned you on startup what controller input it was meant to be played on, and it was still very much playable without it. I really feel there should be some warnings in the system requirements that this game is meant for wheel [i] ONLY. [/i] I really don't want to rag on this game, I can tell it was made with passion and love - the attention to detail is incredible, and I can tell it's just genuinely great in every reguard - with a wheel. The fact that I can't play this due to monitary limitations is honestly pretty upsetting, but if you're out there with a clutch, shifter, pedals and wheel: this one is clearly meant for you.

80,44946542,english,"This review is true for the Early Access phase of this game.
On the moment of writing the game has one track, which is Nurburgring GP, and one car, which is Lamborghini Huracan GT3.

The only game modes available is a standard race, a hotlap session, a hotstint session and practice.
The game moved to Unreal 4 engine, which allow for Day/Night cycle and rain conditions.
The HUD in the game changed compared to Assetto Corsa, it's not a ""make your own HUD with apps"", but a really polished and informative one.

There is also a system with the feedback to improve your driving, which consists of Consistency, Track competence, Car control and Pace. I find them pretty helpful. I won't go too much into detail, they basically tell you where you can be better, and provide goals to achieve, so you can improve your skills gradually.

The controls are adjustable only on racing wheel, for Xbox pad or Keyboard you will have to deal with presets, this will change in the future, they're not bad though. When trying to set up the controls for your wheel, make sure you invert pedal and wheel inputs, this may not be obvious.

The FFB is pretty nice to me, this is highly subjective as you can imagine. The physics feel like Assetto Corsa, but the brakes are not so prone to lock-up, which is an improvement.

Graphics are nice and not demanding, I play on med-high settings, with stable 90 fps (hotlap session). My specs are: i5-2500, 1050 GTX 2GB, 8 GB RAM, Thrustmaster T150.

Even at this stage the game is really enjoyable in Hotlap and Hotstint modes, so I highly recommend to buy it in this stage to save for later. Think of it as an investment. This link is in the game's description, but here you go anyway: https://www.assettocorsa.net/competizione/roadmap/

Also, as it is Blancpain GT series official game, just head on to their site and see for yourself what this game will have in the future.
Cars: https://www.blancpain-gt-series.com/cars
Tracks: https://www.blancpain-gt-series.com/calendar

As you can see, the road cars aren't planned, for this you have the original Assetto Corsa.

Despite some may critisize Kunos for selling it at this stage, I think this move is highly beneficial both for them and for players. You get the full game in the future and already gain access to test it, they generate much more revenue in 2018 and gain more potential users in 2019.

Sound design is way better than before, and imo the best sounding racing game ever with the exception of Raceroom.

The AI is really fun to race with though they have some quarks in certain situations, but given how early the game is in its stages it's really nice.

Graphics for me look really good and quite well optimised, not being as intensive as I thought it would've been.
They look especially gorgeous while raining or at night.

Physics wise I feel it's quite similar to Assetto Corsa, FFB seems to be a hit and miss for most people but for me on my G27 it's pretty good too, 0 complaints.
Driving in the rain, especially in storm weather, is probably one of if not the most fun I've ever had driving in a racing sim. Something about it that is so challenging but not frustratingly so, and just keeping the car on the track is insanely rewarding. And when you lose control, you are simply gone. It's very similar to what happens in reality too.

IMO it's worth the purchase, it shows a lot of promise and atm since it's still early access, it's discounted.

UI

+ Intuitive and easy to navigate.

Options
+ Enough for first Early Access release.
- Would like to be able to change controls on the go next release, restarting races to change controls can be tedious.

FF
- Lowest point, needs tons of work, even with optimal settings on my CSWV2, I was not able to find a communicative enough setting.
- Curbs, although more dangerous than other sims, do not feedback well enough through the wheel.
- Love the rubbered surface but needs more feedback to make it stand out as a dangerous line to take.

Short Summary:
So far it is a great EA game with lots of potential. As it is, it will only attract those true SIM racers out there,  so if you're after a fun game that will occupy your time, this is not it. 
It is a gutsy, hard to learn, nigh impossible to master SIM that will give you sore shoulders and sweaty palms. Cannot wait for next release!

Looking Forward
o VR: since SIMing on VR, it has been difficult to revert back to 2D.
o Career mode: Hopefully we can see a fleshed out and well implemented Career mode that emulates all the drama and the pizzazz of the real word competition.

If you played A.C. you'll feel at home here! The game feels great already with the default G29 profile it loads(instead of AC where I had to tune it to my preference). The car feels similar to the AC version but it's heavier and you can feel it more.

The track is the same but clearly improved and again, you feel it more and better.

What about the weather and night time? Absolutely AMAZING!

If you plan on getting the game later on just buy it now for the discounted price. Sure there's only a track and a car now but the amount of regulations, the new laser scanned track, the weather and such make it worth it already.

Racing around the ring at night time with the ""Monsoon"" rain setting is stunning to say the least. You can see the rain drops on your windshield changing from when they land, when they start to move based on what your car is doing and so on.

You can also see the track getting more and more wet and the water actually moving on it! There's puddles filling it, you need to care about aquaplanning and so on.

One last thing is the sound: it improved so much you can feel it already, it makes the experience even richer than it was before!

45,44756344,english,"Top marks Kunos! This is how you make a modern sim!

Even in it's early access stage (2nd build as I type this) ACC shows so much promise. It looks incredible, even beating out Grand Turismo in term of visual fidelity, and the replays in rain and dark conditions look so real you have to blink!

Bear in mind that this game includes one car available to drive, on a single track each month. Each month we'll get a different Blancpain car and track to use. At the moment the weather conditions do no cycle as you drive - so a wet track won't become dry. But tbh, that's not a restriction, as it's such a pleasure to drive a physics engine that tops Assetto Corsa, with grpahics that look so nice. I'm running a 7700K and a GTX1070 and it looks awesome, even though I've not maxed my settings.

Older games like RFACTOR2, RRE and PCARS all seem to stutter and drop frames when their respective game engines supply gameplay to my TFT (144Hz) when they drop below the setting I have chosen. So, 100hz, 120hz, or 144hz. But amazingly ACC does not suffer this same problem. The action is much smoother.

I can watch a race replay (with 21 cars(20 AI and me)) and even in rain I'll get 100fps, but it'll look smooth compared to that same framerate on RRE or PC2 for example. So, I don't know what Kunos are doing, but at this stage it's awesome and I'm really impressed. Never did I imagine that a PC sim would get visuals of an overall very high quality such as Poliphony's engine. By the way, if a replay is running at 100fps, it's doing 30% more than that whilst driving. They've done an amazing job of optimising the UE so far. There are plenty of settings you can tweak too. So even if you have a slower gfx card, you can nudge the settings down and it'll look nice. I did note that for the UE, I was forced to set AA to high, and set the method from FXAA to temporal - this was the only way I got jaggied lines to almost complete go away. It looks much better with these options on IMHO.

I've never had the game crash. I can drive fine without altering settings with zero assists on the pad (aside from the factory ABS and TC settings enabled). 

If you purchase ACC anytime in the next 2 months you'll get ACC for £22.49 - and this will include 2019 liveries as an addition for free - post launch next year. A complete no brainer. If you can cope with one car and track then don't sit on the fence, there's so much to fall in love with.

There are blogs on assettocorsa.com in the forums that explain what new work has gone into the physics engine. This is not a port. The feeling you get when the cars drop off a curb is great, and as I say, I say that as a pad user.

This has already exceeded my expectations tbh.

There may only be one track and car per month, but just getting chance to drive with a more detailed physics engine at night and in the rain is blooming amazing. This sim is going to force others (hopefully) to up their game. Going back to RF2 now, is going to seem like playing RF1 in terms of visuals.

After using ACC, I'm not sure I can stomach the stale graphics in RF2 and RRE. This one title will likely retire all miy others!

Buy it, it's a complete steal at under £23. Just be aware you are getting a developing game, with lots of new features that are yet to be completed. We've already had a game update to address a few bugs though. A brilliant start to the aarly access program.

The Negative Thumbs down dont make much sense at the moment, unless you just dont like the game. But complaining about the Lack of stuff right now just isnt fair.

If you want a cheap purchase now for a Racing SIm thats going to end up being brilliant later and double the money, just buy it now.

Whilst the initial car and track selection is very limited, it has allowed Kunos to focus heavily on the Huracan and Nurburgring resulting in a solid step up in terms of simulation over the previous game. AC was a good sim but ACC steps it up another notch in every area to create a very strong base to build upon over the early access period. 

One area that has impressed me in particular is the wet weather driving. No other sim has nailed it as well as ACC. Lap times take a significant hit and every mistake is punished. There is nothing more scary than aqua planing at 120+mph, constantly fighting the car even on the straights. I cannot wait to see what the dynamic weather system does to longer endurance races.

There are obvious issues e.g glitchy textures especially in the rain, the virtual rear mirror lacks shadows and spray, car setups resetting, lack of wheel settings... But this is to be expected with a brand new engine.

The game looks, sounds, and feels amazing. The first car available is the Lamborghini Huracàn GT3 and, from my personal point of view, both the sound and the car handling is way better than Assetto Corsa, resulting in a more immersive and challenging experience. This means that the core of the new physics model is very effective and consistent in all weather conditions and time of the day. 
The graphics, thanks to the UE4, is simply astonishing and day/night transition is now a reality.
The game, at this early stage, is also stable and I can achieve a reasonable amount of FPS on my mid level PC (i5 2nd gen, GTX 1060 6GB, 8 GB DDR3 @res 2560x1440). Further testing is ongoing.

- A ton of input lag compared to Assetto Corsa, which feels like it has wee bit itself.

- Ai are smart, but currently after about 7 minutes the Hurican drivers decide to have a sleep 
   instead of racing. (Probably fuel related because they still turn if you push them)

- 1 track, 1 car so far. Nurburgring GP (GT Layout with the fast chicane) and the Huracan 
   GT3.

- FOV and Seating position are strange at first, but easily changed.

- Only Single Player. Quick races, hot stints and laps and practice.

- If you set the game to have you manually start your engine, the controls to start it are not in 
   game so you just sit in the rolling start grid, stuck.

- The lack of grip in the rain is crazy and you can spin forever (almost literally) if you lose 
   control which looks funny.

- Visually, incredible. Like replays look so close to real footage it's mindblowing, if only you 
   could take the vignette style border out.

Really is only a basic demo so far, reminds me of the Projects Cars 2 demo but with less content and way more immersive physics. Shame it's GT3 only, but even if you're not much of a fan it's brilliant.

Although FFB is very well done, it still needs a little bit more work I say. Everytime I go over a curb/kerb (or however you spell it), the wheel doesn't twitch or react. Which does in the old assetto corsa.

Setups, I think it still missing something, like ride height, gear ratio. Secondly, adjusting the parts is flawed. It offers a left right button which you have to click and hold to adjust, rather than click, hold and drag. 

Physics, or car behaviour. Very similar to the old game, EXCEPT for one thing. I don't really have any real-life racing experience, but I think the car is more predictable when cornering compared to the old game. Which makes it very forgiving, I say.

DAY 1 Early Access First Impression Review.
Of course i'll update it from time to time.

1. Physics
In a short way, It's Assetto Corsa we loved but prettier. WAY PRETTIER (that lighting, so gewd). If the game fortunately could detect your devices and you can setup your wheel or gamepad properly (which is currently pretty iffy and could & should be improved) then it's good, It handled just like AC did, but with some minor and major differences for the better. 

Car have a nice weight feeling whilst still very agile. Tires are grippier to a point where car started to slide / oversteering. Then you can save it while looking like a badass (even when you're practically losing time doing so). Very satisfying

Basically if we look from AC1, of course it will feel weird at the very first time you drive. But mainly that's because we customize and maybe tailor it to our specific taste. That's several years of early access for you.

Well FFB could be improved. Of course, I'm used to alter and suit the FFB (please do something about the damping, let us customize it). In the end, sim racing is about immersion and what our brain percieved as ""real"" or at least believeable. I've never driven the real GT3 car of course. At least, let us believe what it is like to drive one.

I still only do 3 laps on dry and 2 laps on wet (and doing million pirouette doing so). I spend 20 minutes just to dial everything to my likings first. I haven't got time to try tasting the AI.

Wet surface for me (unskilled potato) are impossible to drive without TC and ABS. But not overly over the top out of control when I blast past some puddle. I need to evaluate it even more.

P.S Finally car setup screen that make sense. It was nightmare-ish in AC1. Change one thing and whole car needs to be mended due to misalignment. It's supposedly to be better this way. And I sincerely approve. It looked polished now. In fact, the UI is more ""game"" like than before with slick modern look.


2. Graphics and Presentation
just look at it, yes maybe you could find some bugs here and there. And Anti aliasing could be too aggresive at times (blurry, soft looking images). But it's still a GREAT sign for what to come next. Dynamic track, optimization, etc. Roll on. Not much to talk here. Great chase cam, good cockpit / helmet cam (maybe it could use a wider range of position option, pitch angle maybe?). UI Improvements are real. It wasn't a strong point in the previous title And setup screen are avoidable for a total beginner on sim racing (that real time physics based value, was scary the first time. headache inducing at times). Now you can navigate through the UI with your preferred controller and it's customizable. I think kunos experience on AC console release played a big part here.

Rain, time of day, etc. are hugely welcomed here. Maybe some more optimization to come. But the performance is average at best right now (day 1). Also the gap between epic and high settings are sometimes too far IMHO. Driver animations are also saw a clear improvement.

HUD are nice, But i ended up monitoring the TCS, BB, and ABS value in the car dashboard instead. Immersion value +++.

Replay mode are also improved in my opinion. Haven't seen the photomode, idk whether it's available or not right now. I like motion blur on replay but not when i'm driving. And when at replay mode, it seems bugged a little bit. Car dash showing error NaN, fuel pressure warning, etc. And wiper aren't working? I'll check it again later.

Water on track are glass like. I like pcars2 version of how water looked on track but i prefer ACC version of driving over it. Water spray looked impressive on chase cam.


3. Sounds
Well at least for me, the car sounded the same with the good old AC? That's not a bad thing. With several layer of detail added. Like chassis flexing sound, ABS grunting, gravel, and marble sound, tire and wind sounds good too. So it's OK for me right now. As long as I can distinguish the sounds between the cars (right now there's mainly 2 car sounds since huracan and r8 are virtually the same engine inside. at least until we could drive both of them) it's good.


4. Gameplay, content, and modes
I'm excited with the rating system, i can't wait for the implementation. Ah and also multiplayer server setup. It's really confusing in AC1. Rolling starts (YES, could this be transferred to old AC pretty please kunos?),
Proper working ideal line guide. Good for beginner and learning track I'm not familiar with (well maybe i'll use it at Paul Ricard) 
There's still a lot to come, it feels like a kid waiting for lunch time in a boring classroom.
Currently only one driveable car (with several skins for each teams) and track (nurburgring GT), Calm down, you saved money buying this now. Take it as ""investment"" of some sort. See the development road map. Wish everything will go as planned and even better. The modes, yeah it's alright. Still very early on the development. They need our feedback too, give the devs constructive input and they hopefully reacted in a good way which is highly likely. 

In the end, calm down for now. Feast your eyes, dreaming for what more to come. Keep the expectations realistic, hope for the best for the devs while being a part of the development of this hugely potential ""sim"". And for now, play AC1 (or any other ""sim"" you like).

tl;dr it's good but it's unfinished and the dev said so. Buy now, play later.

EDIT
End of Day 1 Impressions
Performance
After laps of laps trying to tweak the graphic settings and i'm satisfied with the single driver / hotlapping performance in clear and storm(stable at 58-60 fps). I jumped to race with AI in clear condition. My goodness, 50fps at start of rolling start and then ""slideshow"" while crossing the start line. Then after turn 2, stable at 55-60fps. I think it's just not optimized yet. I hope it will be fixed in the future.

FFB
Yep, the FFB is too ""damp"". Weighty yet you seems to lost the detail. Hope it's adjustable soon. Meanwhile, I pretty like mid corner feel, it feels like the tires are squishy now.

5,44716937,english,"Well, I had to wait until today to give it a proper go and I am really impressed. My ffb was almost perfect right out of the box, no clipping, I felt everything and I have to be honest and say I've never felt a more communicative ffb right out of the gate than in this. The car feels great, I can feel it understeering, I can feel the understeer ease off and the car come back in, I can feel the oversteer. Everything feels great. I love the HUD elements that are in too that communicate everything you need to know about your TCS settings etc. I can feel the brakes and tyres coming up to temperature, likewise I can feel when they are overheating. It's just.... right.

Now, the looks. Obviously a sim's most important criteria to be judged on is the way it feels. Does it feel like driving a car hard on track? Well, I've only driven a race prepped M4 and an F4 car on a track, not a Blancpain GT car but from the experience I do have yes, it feels fan-fappin-tastic. Now add visuals to that that honestly are the most damn near photo realistic graphics I've seen in any sim, game, movie, whatever. period. This game is drop dead gorgeous. 

Driving at night in the rain seems just as scary as you'd imagine it to be, but at the same time hypnotically beautiful in it's representation of it on our monitors. The way the spray intensifies at speed and changes all the time depending on where on the track the cars are, what speed they are doing, the level of rain on the track. So many factors make this the most realistic depiction of driving with spray off the car in front of you that I've ever seen. You'll be moving to different lines just to see in front of you, and you might just find a line that other cars haven't figured out yet. All the hallmarks of racing in the rain. Absolutely brilliantly done. That's just in-car. The first replay I watched my mouth opened and I honestly got tingles as I've never seen anything quite like this before, and to be Frank (who is Frank?) it's just a joy, as a gamer, to be alive with graphics like this. I really was very, very impressed. 

The lighting (even without RTX) is just phenomenal, and as I said before to someone watching a race in the dark like that with those cars really did remind me of watching the GT racing at Brands Hatch in the pitch black, hearing the cars roaring down Paddock Hill before seeing them thundering past in a cacophony of noise and rumbling ground beneath my feet. The same goes for during the day, the way the sun sets is mesmerizing, and having full manual control of all the lighting as the sun goes down is great too. You can control your rain lights, your low and high beam, flashing lights, directional indicators, hazards, everything (full menu and UI control from the wheel itself is also very handy).

Anyway, I don't want to go on too much, but I had to say something because if you are a fan of motorsports in any way, shape and form you owe it to yourself to get this game/sim and enjoy watching it grow. I believe the price will go up the more features that are added so it's worth getting in early imo. The Lambo is driveable on the Nurburgring currently, with more content being added each month up to full release.

As first releases go of an early access title goes this is incredible. Now if there are any kids reading please look away now as I can only think of this analogy as I type and I apologize in advance but it is what it is. It's how my brain works... sorry(!)

I'm running this on a GTX1060 (6GB) with triple screens and the frame rate does drop to 30 (I'll probably just switch back to a single screen for just this game). Dropping the details down from Epic does bring up that rate but makes it way less appealing. The HUD is good but I need to get used to the tire/brake display (doesn't really make sense to me yet). 

To me the car feels more realistic than it does in other sims. Especially since it takes a lap or two to bring the tires/brakes up to temp. For my first few tries I had to teach myself how to control the car through corners with cold tires and not make stupid mistakes. The sim is less forgiving than other sims and that is forcing me to learn how to drive better (in a way that other sims like pcars2, iracing, and rfactor2 do not). 

Almost without saying, the AI is pretty bad. I ended up punting a few cars out of the way since they slowed down so much in the corners. And that one Lambo that suddenly slows down in the middle of the race? Yeah. That's actually good training since I've had to deal with something similar to that in a Lemons race a few years back (almost t-boned a Nissan that got a high speed corner wrong).

The car feels good, the AI is crap, but all that is OK, regarding the state of the game.

I dont know if this game will have mod-support, but I think there are several things, which should be implemented natively. 

If you dont have VR (like me) and play with a proper FOV, you NEED helicorsa. 
I have no idea where the cars surrounding me are and this cant be right. 

Pls integrate a [b]native radar[/b].

Please integrate a native [b]real head motion[/b].
Meaning, that your camera should follow the direction youre steering. 
Integrate two important options:
The angle at which the ""head"" starts moving
and the max angle, how far you look into the direction youre steering. 

Im sure this hasnt to be said, but im suprised that I dont have a timetable on my HUD:
live info about how far you are ahead or behind to the next opponent. 

Hud Scale 

moveable hud objects!!!

Telemetry etc.

Of course limited functionality so far but that was clearly communicated by Kunos. People who complain about this should better start to learn READING.

Regarding this first pre-release what stands out?
+ Incredibly good & believable physics
+ Tyre modeling by far the best of every Sim I played so far
+ No need for finetuning FFB settings, it works out of the box (Had only to limit the gain to around 95 with the CSW 2.5 to avoid some minor clipping)
+ Very, very demanding complex (yet believable!) driving behaviour to keep the car on the track and doing fast laps
+ Sound is the best out of every Sim so far (fast down shifts in the Lambo put a grin on your face every time)
+ Much more styled UI, especially compared to AC
- Usability of UI could be better
- Control configuration is not very usable (e.g. if I klick on some buttons I want to see that on the UI to check if it is already allocated)
- FOV settings limited (should be able to be done on the fly like in PCars2 including viewing angle!), btw. it is important more than in any other Sims to set the FOV right here, otherwise you have a hard time to handle the car and getting faster laps.
- Needs very strong system to run high FPS (with 8700k & 2x1080-sli sytem, it runs around 50-60 fps, I need 120 for my monitor!)
- I expected a bit more graphics-wise, it is on par with Pcars2, but not significantly better (could not use the raytracing feature obviously)

I guess most of these points probably will be adressed and are still in development until the official release. For Sim-racers, this is THE must-have title without any doubts.

Casual racers are going to be pulling there hair out just trying to get on the track. Some sour tasting issues. lots of broken or maybe there just confusing options.

The only and biggest issue I had so far is SLI not working properly, one card uses 90% while the other stays at 15%. I hope they fix it.

Drawbacks: Knowing that the game will only focus on the GT3 series makes me sad, it is going to be a very limited game, not much tracks and cars.. and probably no mods.

I've tested ACC for hours and everything went rock-solid. The only thing is that fps drops a little sometimes (GTX1070), specially when it has more complex lighting. But overall was amazing, beautiful game!! The beloved AC physics still there, but even more dynamic. 

A couple things to increase the game immersion:

* Shaking effects on the hands/steering (as we see on real cockpit shoot) 
* The ability to fully customize the HUD (like AC)

Can't wait to see more!

The physics and force feedback are the most authentic one so far in a racing simulator.
In the original AC the cars sometimes felt like they would be slightly floating above the street meanwhile in PC2 the cars were extremly nervous.
In ACC the current Huracan GT3 simply feels right.
It feels stable, challenging and you can sense how far you can push it and the physicengine never goes haywire. 

The acoustics simply add up, as you can hear every part of the car with astonishing detail and sense of space.
Also the subtle forcefeedback and soundeffects when you go wide onto the kerbs or when the floor touches the ground are super well done. :3

The graphics also look very polished and natural with fantastic details.
While AC looked fine at daytime the engine never allowed Night or Rainraces.
Meanwhile PC2 looked very unnatural and had the worst aliasing shimmering of all time.

The game simply feels on point in every single aspect.

So far im very impressed with what Kunos did deliver.

68,44704789,english,"So, it's early days. Don't buy this expecting a fully featured game!!! When you first open the game it gives you the option to view the roadmap for when new cars/tracks/features are being added, or you can view it here: https://www.assettocorsa.net/competizione/roadmap/

Currently, there is ONLY the Lamborghini Huracan GT3 and the Nurburgring GP track layout, although you can run it with/without ai (fyi, the AI are in a mixture of cars not just the lambo), and change the weather and time settings so there's at least a few changes you can make. 

With a T300rs gt edition (had no issues mapping pedals, steering etc... I do wonder if the people having issues or playing on a keyboard are actually just stupid?), currently I've found the force feedback not quite as good as AC, but not far off! with a bit of fine tuning could probably get it identical but by default it's slightly lighter and also doesn't help spin as quickly to catch oversteer. 
The handling model is very good, as is the way it reacts with the different weather options and doesn't suffer with some sims floating effect if you get under/oversteer.
The graphics are pretty damn good, but that's to be expected with a 1080ti and everything on ""epic"", no issues with framerate even with all of the ai on track.

What will decide the fate of this game,  whether it will turn into either one of the best, or one of the worst, will be the implementation of the online system. The method for joining sessions, how it can match you to players with similar ratings (different ratings shown on the roadmap/game info), ghosting of trollers, endurances races even possibly with multiple drivers per car so you can do stints in a 6hr for example etc etc etc.
As a single player game, it doesn't make sense at all. To me this is the Gran Turismo equivalent of GT Sport and Assetto Corsa is Gran turismo 6 or 7 when it ever comes out. ACC has fully gone with the 1 series esport/competition whereas AC has the variety, mods, career etc. 

Personally I'd wait until just before build 3 when the online comes out, and buy it before the price goes up. Very impressed so far but there's just far too limited content and no online systems so really will have to wait til the full release to see how it turns out.

One small problem, the rain traction doesn't match real life.  There isn't much difference between the dry line and the wet line in the rain.  Its like a general friction downgrade which in real life grip varys significantly depending where you are on the track.  

The controls are not well communicated in the options screen.  Could not figure out how to start the engine.  Just put it to 'auto start' for now.

My wheel T300 with T3PA pedals works fine, not a lot of customization if any is available on handling, FFB and such but does the job. 

One thing that I got stuck on was manual engine start, so here is a tip: 

If you want to start the car engine manually, make sure you have clutch assigned, manual clutch to ON in  assits menu and manual engine start. When you load in, hold clutch pedal, press & hold Shift + i to turn ignition on then precceed to hold S until engine is up, and then follow your regular manual start from neutral > 1 st gear.

First things first, I never really got into AC. I tried it a bit at a friends setup, but it just didn't click for me.

However, after the getting familiar with ACC for the first 30min or so I can say that I'm going to like this game. A lot.
What I instantly noticed is that the feedback I got from the track and car just made sense. You feel the tyres coming online, or the brakes not gripping enough, bottoming out over a kerb, losing the rear or overdriving the car. I'll admit that I'm not the best in rating the overall ffb, but it felt ok to me. Maybe a bit jolty, it could be a bit smoother I guess.

The rating system is one of my biggest pros so far. It puts a lot of emphasis on consistency and cleanness. I think the amount of feedback and data they can relay back to player through it is good for improving. If they go ahead and expand/fine tune it, it will be great for matching equal drivers imo.

There's still a lot of work to be done, but that's to be expected. However, it looks like it could be a fantastic driving experience when it's done. The groundwork is certainly there.

I play with a T300RS and single screen. Wheel worked out of the box (alt-tabbing breaks ffb though), and most of the buttons are not bind by default.

Look at it this way. If they said - we are looking for diehard fans to help comment, critize and shape the game. You'll play a drastically limited BETA version. We need everyone focusing their feedback on the same car and track to minimize variables as we polish the game. You get to help shape the final product. To join our BETA and be sure we're only getting in dedicated testers we want you to pay $25 to join the program. In return we will give you the full game at the release.

Now that's not a bad deal as long as you know what you signed up for.

Now here is some feedback (hopefully they read this)
- There are some typo's so proof read your english
- The wheel recognition (TX) and set up wasn't smooth. It found my wheel but it would not drive the first time. I had to do it a second time with a forced save to take. I also had to figure out how to dive into the advanced settings and invert the pedals. No other games but AC and ACC seem to do this.

[b]First off the Pro's[/b]

[b]Graphics[/b] - Stunning visuals. Both track and Car are beatiful in all aspects. Dry, Sunset and wet weather all look visually stunning.
[b]Optimisation[/b] - No issue as yet - Smooth and crisp at 1440p with zero stutter GTX1080
[b]Sound[/b] - Deep and informative. Engine and ambient are on point for me
[b]Physics[/b] - Great feel so far but somewhat overshadowed by lack of FFB as yet
[b]Replays[/b] - The replays are a sight to behold and available in pause menu during race.
[b]Wheel Support[/b] - My G29 works a treat. Have come accross a comment to state there is no option for manual gears, this is incorrect. There are options for Auto and Manual gearing you just need to look.

[b]Cons[/b]

[b]FFB[/b] - Whilst the FFB is present, there is a lack of feel to it. Nothing at all like AC but i for one live in hope this is addressed soon.

If you are a fan of sim racers then this is a must. Look past the lack of content as it stands at this point and dive in now at the entry level price. This is the most promising sim racer i have played and cannot wait for what is to come.

What to expect in Release 1:

One Car: Lamborghini Huracàn GT3
One Track: Nurburgring GP
Events: Special Events, Hotlap, Quick Race (AI)
Limited options, ForceFedback is not functional yet on all the controls...some works. You could use some wheels but not all are supported yet neither.
Many advanced options are disabled, you have the BASICS.
No option to change the driver seat yet. You sit on the left side only.

Graphically the game looks good but is not the best looking yet. 
I'm forced to use AA like FXAA or TAA, there is no way to disable them. One thing that it really looks good is the rain, the wet road and climate is visually stunning, maybe it needs a stronger storm and lightnings.

The gameplay is minimal so far. But if you are eager to try it you could practice a lot and have a quick race with the AI and it is playable, and ... That's it. The special events might bring small variations but they are still the same track and car in the end, like hotlap event, and race.



Promising release. 
But be aware, it is EARLY ACCESS. 
EARLIER than most other EA that I have supported before.

this is something special, played AC, forza7, pc1,pc2 ... but this is different, comes really close to how real race looks like on live tv, just done few laps and played replay, and is simply stunning, light, shadows, attention to details, sound are fantastic, no need to worry about how driving is going to feel controls/feedback etc.... anyone who played AC will know why and it is a beta version so its just going to get better and better
played full hd on GTX980Ti, i7 4.5, 8g ram, ssd, smooth no issues
