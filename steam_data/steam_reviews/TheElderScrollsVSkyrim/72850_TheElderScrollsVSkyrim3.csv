That being said, the enviornment is still extremley varied, and assuming you don't fast travel all the time, it's still a huge map. The enemies are varied, combat feels satisfying when you beat someone, and many new or improved features exist because of the developer's lessons learned from Oblivion, and Fallout 3/NV. This game will feel familar, yet different.

In some time the Development tools will be released for PC, and the game can only get better.

It's one of those game that proves that environmental design and placement is alot more important than flashy textures, effects and sun rays! 
If your not fighting the undead (or raising them to fight for you) then your catching butterflys as they land on wild flowers.
If your not stealing everything from the citizens of a riverside village, then your climbing precariously to the peak of a mountain only to find a dragon awaiting you!

The best bit is, the storyline is variable based on who you work with and the manner in which you perform expected tasks in the game. The story still goes from A to B, but everything inbetween makes it more like 000AAA to 999ZZZ.
Roles intermingle allowing you to explore different races and specialisations to suit whatever gamestyle you like, whether it be a mage, an assasin, an archer, or a melee figher.
