I use Facerig when once and a while on my Twitch channel and it was a decent thing to jazz up a stream every now and then. However I need to state that if I didn't get this in a humble bundle some years ago, I would probably not buy this. This is really just a novelty that would wear thin after messing around with it on a weekend. You might get more mileage if you are a streamer or making Youtube videos but even that is stretching it.

3. random crashes this being on 3 different PCs
4. creating your own AV and getting to use it,follow the their support forum,see a lot of issues but I gave up after they gave a rude comments before they made the wizard program years back.

We are sorry you've had this negative experience but there is a lot of information in this review that conflicts with verifiable facts, as follows:

Point 1. It works better with a good camera and better light, but it also works in non ideal light conditions:
Independent source: many user screenshots from Steam like this one : http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=564196486
or this one:
http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=551672290
or you can find more by browsing the screenshots section.

Tracking got even better when we switched to the ULSee tracker in Spring 2015. It is true, the users who optimise their capture space get far better results than the ones who don't, but the program does work even in non ideal conditions.

Point 2. The crowdfunding campaign for FaceRig ended in February 2014, and the program was on Steam in Early Access available to the public on August 29 2014, (was available to all the backers 24 hours before, on 28'th of August 2014).  
That's just 7 months, not years, and it matches the promise we had made in the crowdfunding campaign. In those seven months  we've communicated on Facebook and email and we also had 7 official updates on Indiegogo (1 update per month). Then as the months went on we made them less frequent ( every two months, then 3 months, 6 months), and this was done at the requests of some of our backers because they simply got their news from the website or Steam. 
Independent source: The Indiegogo website: https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/facerig#/updates

3. Occasional crashes might have happened during the course of development, as we do work with hardware and software not typically used in game development ( webcams and virtualdrivers) , but they were usually corrected if a bug report was correctly filled.

4. Please reach out to us on info[at]facerig[dot]com and please point out the emails or support thread so we follow up on the status of the rude comments. 
The workshop does have quite a few avatars already, both 2d and 3d. 
We offer art support as our time allows (we are a small team after all) for issues that are specific to importing a 3D asset in Facerig, but not general art support for aspiring 3D modellers /animators who are just learning how to use a 3D modelling package (although we wish it was possible in an ideal world, the truth is in the real world we simply do not have the time and resources to also teach people how to use 3DS Max and Maya, that is not the purpose of our art team, we need to let you know about aspects specific to FaceRig).

5. No Man's Sky has a Steam overall rating of 32%. FaceRig has 84%. 
They are hardly similar in regard to public reception. I understand that your personal opinion is different, but in reality they are simply not the same.  Source: Steam Store Ratings.

Also:We did almost no traditional marketing for FaceRig, its was mostly organic growth, via word of mouth, mainly people using it on Steam, Twitch  and YouTube. We've always stated that tongue control on the regular webcam version is done via puppeteering  controls, not tracking, and that you need depth sensors for reliable tongue tracking.


Best regards,
The FaceRig Team."

if you thought that Joke was inappropriate, wait until you see my draft

Anyway, if you‚Äôre looking for FaceRig, then you probably already know what it is and what it does. If you suffer from dementia or something, here‚Äôs a refresher. It takes a camera input, does some face tracking magic to it, put it into a 3D Model/Live2D avatar, and output it as a video/stream. There‚Äôs other software that can do this, but Considering how old FaceRig is, I‚Äôd consider it to be the easiest, most feature rich, and most accessible (the fact that It has a community constantly uploading models also helps) compared to other options (unless you have an entire company developing their own version of course). That being said, you do need the Live2D module DLC to use about 99% of the community uploaded stuff, and I‚Äôm pretty sure 99% of the time, that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre going to use this for.
All resource and documentation can be searched online. Use it to turn whatever 2d Fantasy you‚Äôre dreaming every night. Use a voice changer if you want to add to the effect. You should preferably buy it on discount, although it‚Äôs pretty reasonably priced nonetheless. Cheers.

[spoiler]Ps. Draft stuff
Facerig is an application to turn into an anime girl and bait some weebs
Facerig is an application to turn yourself into an E-girl and start selling some bathwater
Facerig is an application to bank on the recent VTuber Boom
Facerig is an application to commit cultural in-appropriation 
Facerig is an application to make your very own e-621 appropriate content
Ange Katrina is so fuckin cute, I can‚Äôt
Facerig works well if you're not wearing glasses, or ones that has minimal Glare
If you are wearing glasses, there's a community post about it to try circumfend that issue
FaceRig is a shell for FaceRig Live2D Module DLC
Wakaru Ver.Beta is basically MMD, and if you don‚Äôt know what that is, google it yourself.
[strike]PrprLive is still unreleased as I‚Äôm too much of a millennial to wait 2 days and make appropiate comparison  [/strike]
PrPr Live, is better in everyway if you're only concerned with live2d
PrPr Live is made in China tho, and this program requires webcam to function
Basically, use a firewall if you want to use PrPrLive
Avalive, is a fuckin scam
FaceFun, is also a scam
Facerig other 20 DLC is way too fuckin expensive and you probably will never use any of the avatar
Facerig‚Äôs 3D anime girl is absolutely terrifying 
Facerig needs more god damn Documention, not a god damn Steam community reply.
This Draft, is actually the least Inappropiate part of this review

Edit: Luppet, is a program you probably never heard of before, because most people who read this can't speak Japanese.
Luppet also only works with 3D models and good luck trying to make a good 3D Anime model by yourself.
Anyone who uses Vroid, Koikatsu, or V-katsu is fuckin gay
VmagicMirror works only with 3d model, but are able to ""simulate"" lower body movements
Vdraw is VmagicMirror, except your avatar can ""Draw""
If you don't know what I'm saying, google it.

15,74056830,english,"After playing around with this for a few hours and deemed unfit for a refund, I decided it at least deserves a review.

Looking at this purely as a streaming tool, I find it to be hot garbage. At least, the 3dDmodels and how inaccessible it is to use custom models, unless you have a vast amount of experience in 3D modelling, and even that's not going to be a walk in the park. If you're looking for commissions, you're looking at hundreds of dollars, potentially over a thousand for a full setup. On top of that, the 3D models are simply fairly lazy and un-creative, none of them really being a remotely worthy replacement or addition to a webcam for streaming.

On to the most unfortunate things about the actual program, I have no issue with Direct 11 games but for whatever reason, you're stuck with Direct 9 otherwise it simply will not launch. The audio inputs and outputs it adds are reported by a vast amount of users as completely messing up the audio on their system. Fortunately, I didn't have enough hours with the experience where it left a turd stain on my computer as a goodbye present but unfortunately, too many to negate a potential refund, but I can't say I got my money's worth.

The tracking is fairly poor, but the worst part is the mouth and the ""talking"" animation. As reported by others, if you've got a beard or glasses, good luck getting an accurate representation. While for your eyesight you can always put on automatic blinking, I've not found a very good system to work with the lip tracking, the audio lip sync was worthless and just didn't work well enough to consider it an option. It really didn't seem to capture your expressions at all, maybe at a 25% effort was all it could really muster. 

Overall, if you're looking to stream, you're going to want to look into the 2D DLC because the 3D is hardly worth the effort., The avatars really don't look very good and the tracking and syncing will get you maybe a couple of hours worth of entertainment. Either way, unless you know something about 3D modelling or have a lot of money to spare on commissions, or you really don't care too much about customising a decent looking avatar, I'd avoid this. The ability to take your webcam and make it into a 2d/3d model animation seems so plausible nowadays, but we're not there yet.",1597021242,1597021242,False,3,0,0.502781987190246582,0,True,False,False,76561197978154688,235,1,245,0,245,1596990365,,

The avatar-designs are gorgeous, the software has a nice interface and quite some functionality. It is definitely worth the 15 bucks I was charged.
But: I think the mapping from real face to avatar could be done much better as of today (year 2020). It looks like the AI-Tech is on a level like 5 years old.

24,68092731,english,"You know, back when FaceRig came out in 2015, I found it to be pretty neat and cool, and somewhat functioned as intended. However, as of my most recent experience, it has brought me great shame and disappointment; sheer anger even.  

When I installed and booted up this program I was greeted with a 17 step setup that required me to install 3 separate 3rd party programs to finish the setup, one of which completely tourso-grinded my audio drivers, and the other two turned my computer into the equivalent to that of a shitty single slice toaster. Beyond all of that, the software wouldn't even start when I tried to boot it through their launcher; so I did what any normal person would do in this situation, uninstall the software. But here's the problem, what about the other 3 pieces of shit programs that had to be installed just for fancy shmancy facial recognition software, that didn‚Äôt make it work run off to? It wasn't uninstalled that's for sure. And why the fuck does my computer still run like hot trash? that's a good question, task manager doesn't seem to know, guess I'll just fuck myself. 

I remember when I first used this program back in 2015, the facial recognition wasn‚Äôt the best, and as far as I‚Äôve seen to date, there hasn‚Äôt been too many improvements, if any. Every now and then the avatar will appear to have a lazy eye if the users eyes aren‚Äôt open enough, and sometimes appear to be having a stroke, or that 1000 mile stare. Unless the user has a pristine face, with over exaggerated features, I think the avatars would work just fine. But anything other than that, the program might have a serious problem with it. Seems kinda face-ist if you ask me. 

Now in the year 2020, I never thought I would see pictures load from the top down; from what felt like a 5 minute google search. After I installed and then uninstalled this piece of shit software, I was greeted with the nostalgic feeling of the early 2000's. I honestly wouldn't be surprised if it made me install some sort of malware, or even started using my computer to mine crypto, because that's what it felt like. one hard reset on my computer that took longer than it should have seemed to fix my problem of crippling processing speeds, it was almost like my computer went to get lobotomized, but ended up getting sodomized instead. The sheer inconvenience of a facial recognition software pegging my computer in every way possible, not doing what was promised, had truly invigorated me to make this review. 

Words don't describe how I feel about this program, I‚Äôd have to be some nihilistic fuck freak that suffered from some serious head trauma to even enjoy this program. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this program if it was the last facial recognition software on earth, especially in the state that it's in. The fact that it isn't compatible with pre-installed Realteck audio drivers, makes me question what the fuck went wrong in the development of this program. Seriously it's facial recognition software, not a god damn soundboard. What the fuck does FaceRig need to transmit audio for, and why do I need to install shitty 3rd party software for it anyway, why couldn't the audio drivers come with the program? Again, why does it even need the audio drivers? Something here doesn‚Äôt seem to be adding up, but that might just be me.

Another thing that really bothers me is the lack of a community workshop, something that this type of software should have, and would benefit from having; a feature that should have been implemented a long time ago. It would have something more to offer the community, but instead it‚Äôs a dollar or more for a pack of characters, if not one avatar. doesn't seem right to me given the price of the base program. On top of the base program there‚Äôs the pro and studio versions, and reading the description for the pro version alone, makes me feel like my bottom end is being reamed for all it's worth; giving no technical advancements/improvements in terms of the base program, and as far as I'm aware it's for people that are ‚Äúmaking profit‚Äù off of the classic version, or are using it for commercial use. if someone‚Äôs making more than $500 a month while using the classic software, they must now spend part of their next paycheck on their knees to face rig, and then on some licensing that doesn‚Äôt seem to come along with it. Also as far as I'm aware - as the description doesn't say anything about it - the DLC avatars don't come with the pro software, so there‚Äôs more cock sucking action that may need to be commenced, just to add some avatars to the users arsenal. As if they haven‚Äôt spent enough.

Now I can vaguely understand the reasoning behind not having a community workshop for the program, due to people making avatars of licensed characters from movies and what not, perhaps something that could get the company into trouble, or maybe even hinder the reputation, but there's a bunch of other products out there that have a community workshop, and as far as I'm aware they haven't gotten into any serious shenanigans. Looking at something like VR chat, it may not be a facial recognition software, but there‚Äôs a lot of impressive avatars made by the community that could get someone into a lot of trouble. Even with that, I‚Äôm sure implementing some sort of filter, or verification system, would be better than not having any community involvement at all, perhaps having some sort of event for who can make the best avatar, would be going in a step in the right direction, in terms of building a bigger community. 

I think that this program still has a long way to go, and hasn‚Äôt really changed a whole lot since it‚Äôs release, maybe a few patches that helped with facial recognition, but I personally don‚Äôt see much of an improvement. I can say with certainty that FaceRig will not be the end all be all in terms of facial recognition software that turns people into an avatar. I can see some other company coming in, and offering more to the table then FaceRig has currently. I don‚Äôt fully agree with the price, or  the terms of HoloTech, it seems to me like they‚Äôre trying to milk their program for all it‚Äôs worth. I don‚Äôt see a problem with asking for more with the Pro versions, but I think that when someone is making at least $500 just for using FaceRig, even though it may have little to nothing to do with that money is a little bit of a stretch, and asking for more than 10% of that for the pro version is kinda bullshit. But that‚Äôs just business.

TLDR; I think this program is a steaming pile of dogshit, that needs some sort of community workshop/involvement, better facial recognition technology, better price for what you get and not have mandatory third party software that bricks your computer.

Unless someone has access to a time machine that goes back to when FaceRig first came out, and the technology had that wow factor. I cannot recommend this software to anyone, for any reason at all. If I could refund this I 100% would, but I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôm more than a few years past the expiry on that one.

Things to keep in mind before buying.

1.) Face rigs does not work well for those with beards. If your lips are covered by a beard it will not function as intended.

2.) glasses . Like the beard would also get in the way  with the program

3.) when you calibrate made sure that your face is  neutral for best effect. 

4.) if you have  back ground sound like fans it will trigger lip movement even when you are not speaking. go into sound devices and look for facerig virtual mic turn that down.Doing so in program isn't always  accurate. I had to turn it down in  sound devices  for mine to stop that. Turning it down in the program did not work even when I set it to almost muted.

Silly software, FaceRig has been uninstalled due to the limitation of the disk space.
 After uninstalling, it has been the normal until the day when the microphone of the online lecture has no sound.
I Checked the microphone privacy,QQ voice settings and external microphone in WIN10 repeatedly, and finally found FaceRig Virtual Audio Driver in the device manager?
I really don't know what you want to do if your stupid software is uninstalled and can still occupy my device manager list? ? Also set FaceRig Virtual Audio Driver as the default microphone device even after uninstalled????
None of the previous content is the point! ! ! After I discovered this, I repeatedly uninstalled, disabled FaceRig Virtual Audio Driver from the Device Manager, restarted the computer, and it still appeared on my computer.
I have no choice but to give up the speech contest of the day.Later reinstalled the WIN 10 system to completely solve the problem of no sound from the normal microphone.

First I want to start off with saying I contacted the Dev's via Twitter as I was curious about a Dragon model, and much to my surprise in under nine minutes I received a reply. Looking through the discussion page here on steam, I am impressed as this is a level of Customer care you cannot find anywhere. But enough about that, you are here wondering what I think about the program, so:

Upon first launch of the program I did need to wait for a rather short period of time as 21 other programs were needed. Do not let this scare you, as they are rather small, and things that cannot be added through stream. I ran this program on my laptop, so I was very pleased to see it did auto detection through the included web cam. On less thing for me to jack around with. There was a slight issue with the models not looking right, however using the built in Calibration, and everything is fine.

The UI is rather clean, and rather intuitive, so you are not having to waste countless hours with google searches and asking how to get it to run, and the ability to take pictures and make videos from the program it's self is very nice. There is even a option to control the lip syncing, and if you are like me; you can change pitch and tone of the voice to match the model you want to use again within the program it's self.

my only  complaint which is a rather small one is that when downloaded and opening the program, it switches my audio output to the program, which in turn cancels out all other audio from my computer. However this took a whole two seconds to fix, however this cancels out my live sampling. 

But other then that, if I can having this program up and running and doing videos in under then minutes then anyone can. Thank you to the Dev's for the work they put into this.",1585845209,1585845209,True,0,0,0.466595977544784546,0,True,False,False,76561198277950115,121,10,623,0,34,1597075382,,

6,32673908,english,"In 2015, this seemed like some new interesting software. The price tag on this should have been lowered to $5 by now and here is why:

1) The lack of software updates and improvements makes it feel like the lead developers abandoned it. Only a few new models are added every few months, but no significant program improvements are made. I bought this program a couple years ago because I thought it was really cool and believed the developers' intent on future implementations like hand recognition. That obviously hasn't happened yet. 

2) Face-tracking is still mediocre. If you have any facial obstructions, such as long hair, glasses, etc., the program won't recognize you. Half the time, it seems like the facial tracking overexaggerates expressions or outright fails to accurately capture simple facial expressions like winking. 

3) The process of adding your own non-Live2D model is daunting if not near impossible. If you think adding your own VRChat avatar is a pain in the ass, you don't even know the horror show behind adding a 3D character in FaceRig. I wanted to add some of my own models in, but it just didn't seem worth the effort considering reason #2 and the practical uses of this software. Plus, their [url=https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9A2HzJCWwFWYnN6SFRPbW1mRWM/view]guide[/url] is the only actual information they provide apart from a video, but neither of those are helpful.

4) Even though there are other characters that can be downloaded from the Steam Workshop, around 70% of them are Live2D anime characters. I have nothing against 2D or anime characters, but it only points out the disparaging lack of 3D model content.

5) Configuration is irritating because it is required every time before rendering the models and the settings don't actually save. 

I would have recommended this when I first bought it, but I recant that notion. The actual application usage is extremely limited, so wait until a price drop before buying this.

[u]EDIT: January 1, 2020[/u]

A late change in my review, but if you want to stream with this software, you have to pay even more money to essentially get a license that allows you to use this software in any videos or streaming sites with monetization. Their greed only proves this software was just a marketing endeavor.

Also, same code and UI over the past 3+ years. Normally, software like this goes through an overhaul, but this one hasn't. Hilariously enough, the devs wonder why nobody is making any 3D content when the process is so extensive.",1498212233,1577950313,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198177909485,86,18,728,0,625,1577954522,,

91,55750717,english,"TL;DR: Very tough to recommend with long bangs, long facial hair, or narrow eyes. However it's certainly usable even with those.

We recommend this with some caveats. It actually tracks fairly good with a 1080p camera. The eyes look fantastic even with semi long eyelashes and the blink tracking works pretty darn well. The head tracking is also pretty fantastic, however tilting your head forward or back can also affect how other parts of the face are scanned for 2D avatars. Looking up might make your character open it's mouth for instance. Though the program is pretty flexible with it's advanced tracking configuration. So messing around with that can make it a lot less noticeable for 3D avatars. Long bangs can get in the way of eyebrow tracking, so it's advised to tie hair back or trim bangs. Mustache hair can get in the way of mouth tracking, so shape it up or pair it down. Narrow eyes make it a tad harder for it to notice eye movements, but only marginally so.

For the best experience we highly recommend trying to customize as much as you can yourself after you set the ""auto configure"". Each person we used had a different face and required some settings to be changed. Also, remember that you can save auto tracking configurations to be used later. However, note that some avatars work better with different configurations. For instance, some 2D avatars don't use a lot of the body movements, but the 3D avatars do. 

Hand tracking and tongue tracking is also possible with the IR Real Sense intel camera, but we have yet to get one. Will update review once we manage to pick one up.",1571953947,1571953947,True,11,0,0.619307100772857666,0,True,False,False,76561198038728155,422,44,12566,0,757,1597484560,,

First one, which I don't think is the case, is when the FaceRig Virtual Camera driver is missing (this causes the Virtual Camera to not appear as a source in OBS).

15,45339011,english,"I'm gonna have to review this one from a largely personal perspective. But I'll do my best to be a tad ""objective"" as well.

   First of all, I'm an artistic type, so I may have, erm...uses for this. Maybe. Not sure yet. So I'm eyeing up the ""Pro Upgrade"", which makes the whole package a tad more expensive, but is clearly of no use to anyone who just wants to amuse themselves and/or their friends. So is fifteen bucks a good buy if that's all you're looking to do with it: have a little fun? Sure, I'd say so. Possibly depends on how easily amused you are, and how many hours you think you'll get out of it all. Your money, your call.

   Second up, tech stuff. Hmmm...well, I have a pretty decent gaming laptop (HP Omen), and an at least passable webcam, and I've found the lip-syncing on this software to be...well, let's just say ""inconsistent"". I definitely seem to encounter ""lag"" issues here and there, but in all fairness, those of you with uber-rigs may not have the same problems. I'd probably advise reading other reviews to deduce this specs-specific information for yourself (Lord knows I'm no expert in that area, hence why I've kept my own information minimal).

   I've certainly managed some magical [i]moments[/i] here and there, and some of the characters are fantastically expressive, but...they all seem to have their definite limitations, i.e. some look good when shouting while others barely move their mouths, making them fit for little more than mumbling. I certainly haven't found a character that I would describe as having a terribly broad ""emotional range"". Again...depends what you're looking to use 'em for.

   Short version: a decent if unexceptional piece of ""gimmick"" software, with possible applications for those of us with more product-oriented goals in mind. I'd certainly recommend you have reasonably decent gear though, as I suspect this wouldn't run well on a ""toaster"". One thing I will give a very definite shout-out to: the character designs are by-and-largely fabulous, and you do get a reasonable variety of them with the basic version; though as with most things of this nature, you'll have to look to DLC and Workshop items to widen your options. And there does seem to be an absolute [i]shedload[/i] of free Workshop stuff, so that's a definite plus, though I can't yet personally vouch for how well any of these work.

   Oh, and one final warning: be patient when first installing. It took me quite a bit of trial-and-error to get the damn thing to [i]launch[/i], never mind get the best results out of my webcam, mic, etc. Don't expect to just plug-and-play, even if you're only in it for the fun. But fun you may well have, once you get the hang of it all.

   Verdict: 7.5/10.

This program is still a great one to use but I need to warn people of a little bug with the installation and using this program.  Sometimes it will default your audio output or camera device to its virtual version voiding your sound or ability to use your camera.  There is a quick and easy fix to this by just switching your default audio or camera from Facerig's virtual settings to your computer's default. I'm not very good at explaining how to do this but their are many videos and how-to guides on how to do this online.  If anyone wants me to make a video on how, I might.

My computer is a much better computer now and runs this pretty well. No need to uninstall to get the defaults to work again, just for your information. :) Hope this helps.

Original Review:
This software was almost too powerful for my computer, but despite the lag and only having 3 GB of memory, the video created by this program was quick and fluid.  It is fun to use, and makes for a great vlogging tool if you don't want to use your own face.  Poor teeth, bad hair, or just want to remain mysterious as to whom you are?  This is an ideal tool to use.  I used this 2.4 hours before I even realized it.  Eager for some more use.  Would like my own specialized custom avatar for this, but so far I am no one.  Maybe for my next video, I'll be Pewdiepie?  Who knows. :)",1446339472,1565779516,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198175086630,789,31,1357,0,141,1565866412,,

I tried to get it to work by cranking up the settings but when i do that i get up to 50% CPU usage and even with all of that it STILL looks the same! The fact that I have a ryzen 7 2700x and its taking 50% CPU usage is nuts to me. I just dont see why this tracking is worse then your phones face tracking. This is a way nicer camera and way more powerful computer. 

 Also After playing with it for a few minutes, i noticed that at least some of the models provided are kinda jank. One was missing parts of the eyes when you opened them up wide, so you would see the background in the models eyes (lul) others had holes in their mouths with the same effect. just comes off as low effort, or incompetence.

As for the FPS drop, that might happen if you use both FaceRig and the other game with high settings; adding FaceRig to your streaming configuration (stream software + game) will add some CPU/GPU load. Face tracking and high quality rendering come with the CPU and GPU resource cost, so if you are running a game at high quality graphics option, you may have frame drops.

There are some things that you can do to make FaceRig footprint smaller on your setup:
1. use FaceRig at a lower resolution, you can go as low as 960x540. I assume you are using FaceRig as webcam view, so the view is already small.
2. use a lower setting in the game you are streaming, after all, you are basically streaming two games (resource wise)
3. use window capture instead of FaceRig Virtual Webcam and disable Broadcast. There is an option to hide the interface.
4. limit FaceRig's refresh rate to 24-30 fps. Go to General Options > Performance Tab.
5. Camera resolution needs to be low (General Options > Resolution).

14,51088900,english,"Already worth it. Going to use the pseudo-camera it generates to pop into my work meetings and troll the heck out of anyone and everyone. I am particularly happy with the turkey, the white potato with a face sitting in a bowl, and the creepy sandwich. Installing it in Ubuntu to see how it works there. Confirmed working in OBS studio, though I'm too lazy to stream otherwise I'd have bought the pro pack. Only hitch is that there are no obvious quickguide/instructions - had to figure out to turn on broadcast in order for it to output to the pseudo camera.

Also meant to add that in order to improve tracking, I moved the camera closer to me so that the top of my head and bottom of my chin with my mouth open was about 4 wingers-width away from the edge. I had to get a little creative to get it that close since it normally balances on top of my monitor (and doubt I could do that with built-in camera on a laptop), but given how it appears to function that only made sense. 720p res on my logitech camera seems to be the sweet spot for this thing.

Another update - as of Proton 4.2 (the thing that trys to let Linux Steam try and run Windows things) it doesn't run in Ubuntu 18. Not surprising b/c it wasn't meant to... but just thought I'd mention it. You can get something to come up when bypassing the launcher... but the inherent problem with virtualization and Wine in particular (which is what it looks like) is that the hardware isn't transparent... so I doubt it would ever work using Proton. 

Works fine in a Windows 10 VM using Virtualbox and letting the VM capture my USB camera. Granted, you need at least an SSD to host the VM, a 4th gen i5 (3rd gen i5 laptop studdered) and enough free memory (assigned 4gb) to avoid significant lag though. Don't bother if you plan on using a spinning disk especially if you are recording locally. You can use Window capture in OBS Studio to capture the Virtual Box Screen and then use the Crop/Pad filter to get rid of the top/bottom/left/right elements left in the screen that you don't want.

Don't get me wrong, Facerig is definitely fun to use. It is fun to mess around with the different skins and features, but that is all that this software offers. Once you mess around with each character, you will get bored quickly and quit being amused by them as easily. As for the fundamental selling point, it works just about as well as you would expect. It is not perfect, but the face recognition isn't bad at all.

On the down (and more technical) side, the interface is absolute Hell to navigate and makes doing almost anything just about impossible without watching tutorials. Not only is the interface very irritating, but the software doesn't allow you to save your user settings. Why doesn't it?! You can save all of your work, but not your settings and configurations? Every time you boot Facerig up, you must reconfigure everything to run it. It is very irritating having to do that every time!

If Facerig was just a whole lot cheaper, I would recommend buying it.

I'd recommend having a good gaming rig to get the best performance. I get the best results at 1280x720 on my i5-3570k, 4gb gtx970 and 32gb of ram. Using a Microsoft Lifecam Cinema camera, max res is 1280x720 also.

Note: Before I get started one big con with this software is it requires some manual setup that might not be clear for many users. FaceRig downloads and installs along with it's DLC, but, and there's always a but hey? You need to install a couple of apps buried in [b]teamapps\common\FaceRig\Bin\prerequisites[/b] for FaceRig to fully work with other programs like Skype and Discord.
The software should really automatically install and uninstall what it needs.
Also check your DLC page, you may have to manually install the Pro license DLC manually as that also does not automatically install either.

Software summary:
It's a fun program, lots of customisation and content for the base price. Models are high quality and animations overall are good.
But it can be a lot of trial and error to get it working right. Setting the right animation, animated or targetted? The right lighting, camera qualiity, overall PC specs and graphics resolution and quality.
Nail it and the lip synch can work well, fail and your avatar will look like a bad dubb. 

But be prepared to read the manuals if you want to get the most out of it. The program has a lot of options to mess around with.

Basic is good for messing around on Skype/Discord and pranking your friends and for $15 bucks it's worth it I reckon.
I'd be cautious about getting a pro license. I have it and from what I can see there is no difference between it and the basic version.
Pro just alllows you to use the program commercially like on a monetized youtube channel.
If you aren't monetizing your content don't bother getting pro.

Also FaceRig only exports to webm format. No more popular formats like .mp4 etc.
To get other video formats you must buy FaceRig studio for a couple hundred bucks.

The export video quality of the webm is poor imho. But that can be solved by using an external capture program like OBS or nVIdia's Shadowplay/Share to record the FaceRig window at a higher quality and a format of your choosing for free.

FaceRig Studio also allows for much more detailed puppeteering too I beleive and is more aimed at commercial application than every day use.

DLC wise it's not too overly priced for new avatar packs and there are many, and they often come on sale. 

So yeah, for me it's a yes for basic. It is a good price for what it is.
Having to install drivers manually is a pain and I'd love to see some optimizations regarding performance and improvments in mouth tracking/synching.

As for pro and studio I'd think hard before parting cash for them.

I went ahead and tryed out the different avatars and there is a lot to choose from. You can be a talking dinosaur, a present with a boy in its mouth, a hamburger, santa claus, different kinds of animals and much more. I ended up buying the 2015 Halloween dlc too and going with the werewolf for a gimmick I made up called ""The Space Werewolf"" which has been working well so far for me because some streams I can be in face rig as a werewolf where as other streams I can just be me and thus the werewolf avatar still maintains the human immersion. 

Face Rig is also great because after you calibrate your body and your mouth before you start streaming or making videos, it literally makes it seem like your character is alive and I had a bunch of people give me their opinions and most of them were like Plaximos, you look so realistic and freaky which for a werewolf was the vibe I wanted.

Indeed, there are a few tweaks to be done, such as disabling winking - one of the major issues that glasses can cause is the program misreading your eyes (often because of glare) and assuming that you are blinking when you aren't. To fix this, go to ""Customize Avatar"", click on the ""Special Actions"" tab, and then scroll all the way to the bottom. There will be a box ticked with ""Enable Blink"" beside it. Untick this box.

The second option would be to ""Widen your eyes"" - the ""lazy eye"" appearance, is due to the fact that FaceRig misreads your face thanks to your glasses obscuring your eyes a little. This can result in the program thinking your eyes aren't open properly. To fix this, go to ""Advanced Face Tracking Calibration"", click on the ""Expression Units"" tab, then adjust the parameters for ""Left Eye Closed"" and ""Right Eye Closed"" to compensate for the tracking errors your glasses are causing.

To summarize, FaceRig has problems misreading your eyes due to the glare from the lenses that might be due to a light source that hits your glasses directly, and also due to thick frames that obscure your eyebrows.

I also wear glasses and making sure that you are in a well lit environment will lessen the glare from the monitor upon your glasses' lenses.

If you have issues with a program, I strongly suggest that you contact the support team. Our team constantly responds to user inquiries on the Steam forum.
Regarding your issue, it can easily be fixed by following these steps:
1. use FaceRig at a lower resolution, you can go as low as 960x540. I assume you are using FaceRig as webcam view, so the view is already small.
2. use a lower setting in the game you are streaming, after all, you are basically streaming two games (resource wise)
3. use window capture instead of FaceRig Virtual Webcam and disable Broadcast. There is an option to hide the interface.
4. limit FaceRig's refresh rate to 24-30 fps. Go to General Options > Performance Tab.
5. Camera resolution needs to be low (General Options > Resolution).

I loved this program, it allowed me to unleash my inner waifu. The face tracking limitations from the software itself and the half-baked models did not stop me from using it. 
However, they forced me to exaggerate any facial expression that I wanted my characters to display - this was the start of the end for my life.

Hours of making the most sickening and unnatural faces in real life, only to achieve normal results within the software, my face was slowly getting deformed - any expression I made outside of the virtual world has become creepy and unsettling. A smile that I pictured as normal, now became twisted into something that would make the Joker cry. A sad face that should illustrate my depression and make the people witnessing it feel my pain, now became something to laugh at, as I became a blob fish that's been stepped on a few times for good measure.

My mother could not take it anymore and broke down crying, seeing her once normal son who turned into this abomination, eventually deciding to disown me and burn my computer that caused it all.

I ended up living on the street and have been shunned even from the homeless community, which I am now supposed to be a part of. I am now known as ""Sh!t Face Supreme"" by everyone in the community. It is truly unbearable and I want to end it all - I plan on visiting the people who made this program and give them a serious punishment, simply taking a look at my face will etch terror and fear into their souls, I am certain of it.

Regardless, this program deserves a solid sh!tfacesupreme/10, as it allowed me to find a few hours of joy before taking my life away from me.",1524922406,1524922877,True,1,23,0.487804889678955078,0,True,False,False,76561198103056206,67,17,722,0,464,1554720791,,

Adding FaceRig to your streaming configuration (stream software + game) will add some CPU/GPU load. Note that face tracking and high quality rendering come with the CPU and GPU resource cost, so if you are running a game at high quality graphics option, you may have frame drops.

There are some things that you can do to make FaceRig footprint smaller on your setup:
1. use FaceRig at a lower resolution, you can go as low as 960x540. I assume you are using FaceRig as webcam view, so the view is already small.
2. use a lower setting in the game you are streaming, after all, you are basically streaming two games (resource wise)
3. use window capture instead of FaceRig Virtual Webcam and disable Broadcast. There is an option to hide the interface.
4. limit FaceRig's refresh rate to 24-30 fps. Go to General Options > Performance Tab.
5. Camera resolution needs to be low (General Options > Resolution).

    We have streamed on twitch actually, and we had no issue on a mid-range computer (i5-4690 and nVidia GTX 750). We streamed Rocket League and Don't Starve with FaceRig running as a facecam. Unfortunately, the vids aren't available anymore.

Go to the Advanced UI, General Options, Performance tab, and change Main App Frame Cap. Make sure you are running FaceRig on DX11, it will clear some of the CPU usage, on some avatars the CPU usage is half of the DX9 version. Change this option from the Launcher, Render API.

93,41048137,english,"Well folks..... This is a great bit of software.
However it COULD be made much better with just one simple addition.

Let the user grab the face tracking dots to position them.

Simple!

The big problem with this software is calibration of the face and motion. Dont get me wrong it does a really good job automatically, but it could be much better if you could use the software to move some of the dots about.

This becomes clear when you see the lip/expression syncs on some of the models.  Now ok, not every model is good for expression and lip syncs... but some of them like the deamon should be up to the task. I believe that it could be improved significantly if the user could ""tweak"" the auto tracking.

Also while the webcam is usable, it is far better to pre-record video and use that as a input-feed.... you get way better results.

One other area that could be better is the menu and sub-menu links.  They are not intuitive enough so you kind of have to dig about and mess too much to set things up.

I know this software is still growing and the devs are working on it, so I cannot wait to see how it develops. 

When all is said and done I do recommend this software, and provided they change some of the menu set-ups etc this program could become a great bit of kit. :-)

98,38770976,english,"Alright, since people seem really knit-picky for clarifications, let me clarify why I had difficulties with this program.

I had the original intention of buying this to create an animated avatar that I would use in place of a webcam in my Let's Plays and reviews. I was excited to try it out again, but I ran into a problem: there's no detailed tutorial for how to properly go about making an animated character. I'm a visual learner myself, so I instinctively searched on YouTube, only to find glossings of the subject. I went to several websites and found nothing noteworthy.

After a few hours of digging, I went back to the software and sat thinking: is this really worth the trouble if the community doesn't create a dedicated guide? I only say this because the guides aren't that much more helpful. After pondering the thought for about an hour, I decided to refund Facerig.

Before I refunded Facerig, I wanted to run some tests on my equipment with this program. I used several microphones and webcams, but found the lip-sync and motion capture to be unresponsive across the board, even through a few configuration changes. Some webcams and microphones worked better than others, but not to the degree that Facerig promises.

I come back to this review while skimming through my reviews because I felt like I wasn't clear in my experience before. Well, now I'm being clear when I say that Facerig isn't exactly bad, but it's more of a tedious process to do the simpliest of things. A friendlier user interface and possibly some developer tutorials would be nice additions to the software.",1514447694,1521745698,False,5,1,0.461158066987991333,2,True,False,False,76561198140550076,292,50,24,0,24,1514251271,,

20,40221772,english,"I recomment this but with limitations and weird design choices that severly reduce the fun in it.

My biggest gripe is with exporting: Every Video is recorded in a weird playback Format and needs to be exported before it can be watched with anything but the Program itself. This is not uncommon but weirdly unuseful and infuriating in this program.

This format is useless as the Audio and Video are out of sync, so even if you have to crop or somehow change things you will need to do so after making it into a video. 

Now why the Program doesn't have an option to record straight to video is mindboggling - or at least have the exportprocess started automatically after recording, if the in-between-step is necessary. If you try to make a few small clips with it, and do multiple takes on them, just the exporting makes you go mad - especially because you can always only select one video for exporting. Why cant I select all 10 Takes and the program exports them one after the other?!

With that said, the Program works fine and if you have a decent setup with a good PC enough light and a good camera it does run pretty smoothly.

The format that you're referring to is .rpl and its purpose is replaying a performance with a different setup than it was recorded with and visualizing the performance
in real-time with any mix of avatars, props, backgrounds, light tuning, post process effects, etc. What you want to do is record a video and export it without
going through the replaying of the performance. This can be done by switching to ""Basic UI"" and selecting the ""Record a performance and then export it as video"" option. After recording your video, you can export it as .webm and then convert it to other formats with the help of third party converters or online. You can find an
audio-delay slider in the Sound settings and that setting is there because in many cases the video and audio paths have different delays (for instance, even Windows
sometimes buffers the audio for pre-processing so it can cause a delay). So, the delay is caused by the fact that FaceRig has to buffer a bit of the sound to do
an analysis. By delaying a bit of the sound with the help of the slider, then the combined output (lip motions and audio) will be in perfect sync. If you need more
information on what the setting does and how to use it, feel free to contact us at info[at]facerig[dot]com.

FaceRig's main purpose is to provide creative people a tool to entertain their family and friends. It can be used to make videos, make comic books, gifs, create 2D or 3D avatars, broadcast on chats like Skype or Hangouts, stream, etc. There are numerous uses for it, some of them we didn't even anticipate, but were pleasantly surprised when our users presented them to us.

There are some things that you can do to make FaceRig footprint smaller on your setup:
1. use FaceRig at a lower resolution, you can go as low as 960x540. I assume you are using FaceRig as webcam view, so the view is already small.
2. use a lower setting in the game you are streaming, after all, you are basically streaming two games (resource wise)
3. use window capture instead of FaceRig Virtual Webcam and disable Broadcast. There is an option to hide the interface.
4. limit FaceRig's refresh rate to 24-30 fps. Go to General Options, Performance Tab.
5. Camera resolution needs to be low.

There are two ways to autosave your prop load-out. One of them involves quick save slots for characters (you have 10 of those) the other involves toggling on the Autosave function for the entire program.

The Autosave function :
Go to the advanced UI ( UI+ button) -> General options ( cogwheel icon on the right) Preferences-> General and  toggle Autosave On. From now on almost all your settings ( program/avatar/tracking settings/color customisations/props etc) will get auto saved on exit, or when you change an avatar. So if you customise Fluffo, then go to The Lava baron, and then when you go back to Fluffo, your last used settings for Fluffo will auto load. This method can be a double edged sword sometimes though, because if you mess up some other settings, they will also get auto saved, so you will have to remember to manually reset faulty settings to defaults when strange things happen :). So only use autosave if you are well knowledgeable of what settings affect what aspects of the program , so you are not surprised when disaster strikes :).  As a safer  alternative to auto-saving everything  we have implemented, avatar quick-save slots.

The Quick save Slots
After you have configured a certain avatar as you like it (distance from the camera, background, props, colors etc)  simply press  Ctrl+Shif +1, and all of that will be saved on avatar quick save slot 1.  To load the contents of avatar quick save slot 1 , press  Ctrl+1 ( without shift) .  You can have 10 total spots for quick saves, keys 1 to 9 and also 0 :). This way you can have up to 10 characters pre-set, hot-swappable, and can even do like dialogues between them :)

If you have further questions about this system  you can always ping us on the forum or at info[at]facerig[dot]com . :)

That Windows error usually appears when a required DLL file ( either by the OS or by FaceRig) could not be located. This can happen because of missing installation files or logical drive errors ( among other things, but those two are the most probable) .
 
Please make sure that
 
- FaceRig was installed when the Steam installer was running with administrator privileges.
- There are no missing FaceRig files( right click on it in the steam Install folder and choose "" Verify Integrity of the Local Application Data Cache"")
- All the redistributables from the [SteamLibraryFolder]\FaceRig\_CommonRedist\ were successfully installed as well.
- you run a disk check on your drive to make sure there are no logical disk errors.
- your antivirus is not blocking the Steam client or any of the installers from writing their files in the FaceRig folder.
 
If you still get the error even after the above please read the pinned thread here http://steamcommunity.com/app/274920/discussions/2/34096318703798146/
and mail us the data mentioned there , with a link to this thread ( if you haven't already) .

To detail a bit what the issue is, the redistributables install correctly, but somehow the OS provides a 64 bit of d3dx9_43.dll or in your case d3dx9Compiler_43.dll, while FaceRig is a 32 bit application, hence the issue.
If you search the web on this issue, there are tons of posts for all games and apps out there with tons of solutions that don't actually work.

Please also make sure that your antivirus software isn't deleting FaceRig files and preventing it from running properly. We do not recommend disabling the AV, but rather that you add an exception for the FaceRig folder.
It is also possible that the redistributables did not install correctly so I suggest re-installing them. Just go to <steamInstallDir>\SteamApps\common\FaceRig\_CommonRedist\ to find them.

10,32354803,english,"I first purchased this product in October of 2016. It was fairly fun to use, I even used it in some livestreams. I refunded it not long after, however, not becausse I didn't enjoy the product--but rather because it kept reading my glasses as being my eyes and so my expressions would be distorted. It would make it look like Fluffo either had a severe case of lazy eye or some type of damage which prevented his eyes from staying open. While it certainly gave me many laughs, it bothered me that there was no way to effectively compensate for this without losing a degree of functionality. I need my glasses on to be able to see at all, being extremely nearsighted. It was my hope that they would come to accomodate for users who have to wear glasses all of the time, or otherwise have their trackability by the face-detection software be impaired.

Instead, when I reacquired the software on June 9th, I was disappointed to find that the face-detection still interpreted my glasses as being my eyes--even more so than when I first tried FaceRig. I had gotten a new pair of glasses since the last time and thought that maybe after a few months the software would have been improved or other methods of compensating for problems that wearing glasses cause with face-detection would have emerged.

FaceRig is a unique program, to be sure, and definitely one that you should try out for yourself. But be warned, if you have to wear glasses all of the time, the face-detectin owill in all likelihood see part or all of your glasses as being your eyes, and you'll be left with awkward, twitchy and otherwise unpleasant facial expressions. 

All that aside, FaceRig is worth the cost. It's my hope that the program can be made more accessible to people who wear prescription glasses 24/7.

If I run through its calibration it might work for a short time, but generally will start to show signs of issues within minutes.  Some models are more forgiving.  This is not terrible, as it was meant for my wife.  The only issue is that for some odd reason this software seems to think her left eye droops.  Only, on her actual face it doesn't.  Not even a little.  Calibration does not help with this.  Repositioning the camera does not help, nor adjusting zoom.  It might be ok for a bit, but if she moves her head a little then returns to a neutral position, it's like the character has a lazy eye.  It does the same thing for her sister.  No clue why.  Talk about a self-esteem killer that costs money.  She won‚Äôt touch this thing now.  Sticking your tongue out does nothing with the characters, and there is supposed to be a key you can press on the keyboard to do this, but this does not work either.  No, I can't recommend this.

Some additional info:  I am using a Logitech c920 webcam for capture.  I have turned off ""right light"" which is necessary for 30 fps capture at 720.  Everything is set to auto, but I have tried playing with manual setting to see if more or less contrast/bright/saturation and trying to ensure as little grain would help the software.  I have better that typical lighting as I have a studio light stand in with umbrella diffuser pointed at my face and 3 good over head lights.  All 85 watt CFL 5500k temp if the devs know or care what that is.   I also tried using the software‚Äôs ability to take a recorded source and apply the character to this.  I have some much better cameras I tested with.  I used a Sony Z1U which is a full professional broadcast camera from about 10 years ago and a Panasonic v770 which is my goto camera and those videos have shown the same issues both for my wife and for myself, so it seems to be an issue with the capture algorithm and not the camera.

Regarding the tongue movement, that is a feature that can't be achieved with regular cameras, since they can't see depth. That is why an infrared camera is for.
You can use the key driven tongue by enableing Special Actions from the Avatar -> Behaviours tab and then pressing S and clicking on Mouse Right."

Adding FaceRig to your streaming configuration (stream software + game) will add some CPU/GPU load. Note that face tracking and high quality rendering come with the CPU and GPU resource cost, so if you are running a game at high quality graphics option, you may have frame drops.

There are some things that you can do to make FaceRig footprint smaller on your setup:
1. use FaceRig at a lower resolution, you can go as low as 960x540. I assume you are using FaceRig as webcam view, so the view is already small.
2. use a lower setting in the game you are streaming, after all, you are basically streaming two games (resource wise)
3. use window capture instead of FaceRig Virtual Webcam and disable Broadcast. There is an option to hide the interface.
4. limit FaceRig's refresh rate to 24-30 fps. Go to General Options, Performance Tab.

We have streamed on twitch actually, and we had no issue on a mid-range computer (i5-4690 and nVidia GTX 750). We streamed Rocket League and Don't Starve with FaceRig running as a facecam. Unfortunately, the vods aren't available anymore.

46,30792136,english,"This piece of software is not only badly designed, its fundamentally flawed from the get go.  This is just an outright bad idea to go with.

First off, the concept of face tracking itself.  This method of motion tracking using a visual camera is abysmal.  It takes far more resources than any other tracking method.  Its only benefit is that you can use a generic camera that any person will be likely to have, but more on that later.  It does not scale well at distances; in fact, it is very picky where you put your face at all.  Minute lighting differences or wearing glasses has a drastic affect on tracking quality.  Tracking with a single camera is also very limiting to this software‚Äôs uses.  Being ‚Äúphuny‚Äù on a YouTube video or a Skype call is about all you can do with this.  Its so picky with tracking that you basically have to sit in a single spot, barely dispacing yourself from initial tracking or else risk losing all the tracked animations.  You can forget about looking in any direction that isn‚Äôt in the camera‚Äôs general direction.

Secondly, the hardware. If you use a $20-40 webcam you got at Walmart, you are gonna have a very bad time.  Of course you would want professional recording equipment if you wanted optimal results for something like this, but FaceRig performs so poorly its basically mandatory.  The developers even go so far as to say you NEED a 60FPS camera; something that is pretty important, but is NOT a standard for PC web cams.  Majority of web cams on the market cap at 30 FPS because they are not intended for this kind of use(expected use is video chats, which focus on limiting visual data for better streams).  This isn‚Äôt a big deal for YouTubers, who would have the necessary equipment AND the know how to configure a proper setting for it.  Your general prank Skype callers will quit of frustration.  Speaking of the YouTubers though!

Yall are gonna have to pay up for an extra, professional license if your channel is popular.  Honestly?  Spend your money else where.  Plenty of better, cheaper gimmicks that end up looking far more entertaining than this crap.

You know why all the screen shots have this excited, ‚Äú:D‚Äù face to them?  Its because that is the easiest face for this software to pick up accurately.  In actual use, you will find awkward glitches in the tracking constantly.  Again, unless you are a YouTuber with good equipment, you‚Äôll make a fool of yourself in a way you didn‚Äôt intend for; buying this garbage for $15.

Mentioning pricing reminds me: do you want to use all the anime grills people have made in the workshop?  Do you want to use workshop content at all?  Because fuck you, that‚Äôs another $4 just to have the right to access them.  The entire workshop is filled to the brim with 2D Live content.  I could only find 3 regular FaceRig mods in my search.  I subscribed to 2 of them, 1 crashed the application.  In the off chance that you want to make your own 2D Live character, you are in for an even bigger world of hurt.  The application needed to make the characters is developed by an entirely different third party, whose based in Japan.  Majority of the quality tutorials are in Japanese. Its also quite a bit more expensive than this app itself; as opposed to regular 3D models which can be made in open source modeling applications such as Blender.

One thing that completely baffles my mind: a pre-recorded video of someone‚Äôs tracking performance can yield different results when fed into another PC opposed to the live performance.  Its so mind bogglingly shitty, I really can‚Äôt explain how you can mess up an app that bad.  Perhaps I should take it up with the forums, but I really don‚Äôt care at this point.  The tracking is inaccurate anyway.  You will be fighting with it constantly, trying to find the optimal sitting arrangement just so you don‚Äôt have to worry about it derping out every 3 seconds.

Lastly, to extend on the point of this awful design, visual motion tracking is both inefficient and, at this point, obsolete.  Emitter based tracking has taken over this department.  Its a bit more niche, considering that you need very specific, extra hardware along with the software, but it performs so much better with less overhead on the CPU.  It scales better, it detects better, and it can be run with a single standard design.  Even if you use visual tracking, using something similar to the PlayStation Moves colored ball design is far superior than trying to keep track of every possible configuration of skin tone, head/mouth/eye size, hair/glasses, etc.  It would be silly, but I would EASILY prefer wearing some skin tight mask and software specific camera than using this.  This app is worthless to me, and should be to just about anyone else.  By the time you spent money on professional recording equipment and the DLC packs you want, you could have easily purchased something a lot more entertaining and useful.

PS:  Why do you have achievements?  Why does any kind of software have achievements?  I don‚Äôt use software to feel like I have done something cool, I use them to help MAKE something cool.  That isn‚Äôt gonna happen with this.",1490704754,1490704754,False,6,0,0.527995109558105469,2,True,False,False,76561198004346647,818,37,1056,0,520,1497210772,1490714615.0,"Hi,

I'll reply to you inline for each of your complaints.

[Cabby] This piece of software is not only badly designed, its fundamentally flawed from the get go. This is just an outright bad idea to go with.

[Aty] FaceRig's main purpose is to provide creative people a tool to entertain their family and friends. It can be used to make videos, make comic books, gifs, create 2D or 3D avatars, broadcast on chats like Skype or Hangouts, stream, etc. There are numerous uses for it, some of them we didn't even anticipate, but were pleasantly surprised when our users presented them to us.
For example, a user used FaceRig to decorate his house on Halloween and scare passers by with live characters who spoke to them.
There are as many uses of FaceRig as long as the users' creativity permits (:

Tracking with a single camera is also very limiting to this software‚Äôs uses. Being ‚Äúphuny‚Äù on a YouTube video or a Skype call is about all you can do with this. Its so picky with tracking that you basically have to sit in a single spot, barely dispacing yourself from initial tracking or else risk losing all the tracked animations. You can forget about looking in any direction that isn‚Äôt in the camera‚Äôs general direction.

[Aty] When we came up with the idea to create FaceRig, we decided to first market it for the home user, and then for businesses.
Regular users will have low end webcams and yes, they come with some limitations. But that is exactly why we recommend that our users have the minimal requirements devices and have light in the room. We have several tutorials and guides online that helped users having issues with the tracking.


[Cabby] Secondly, the hardware. If you use a $20-40 webcam you got at Walmart, you are gonna have a very bad time. Of course you would want professional recording equipment if you wanted optimal results for something like this, but FaceRig performs so poorly its basically mandatory. The developers even go so far as to say you NEED a 60FPS camera; something that is pretty important, but is NOT a standard for PC web cams. Majority of web cams on the market cap at 30 FPS because they are not intended for this kind of use(expected use is video chats, which focus on limiting visual data for better streams). This isn‚Äôt a big deal for YouTubers, who would have the necessary equipment AND the know how to configure a proper setting for it. Your general prank Skype callers will quit of frustration. Speaking of the YouTubers though!

[Aty] I think you misunderstood our messages. FaceRig works with any webcam. But if you want better results, we did recomend special high end equipment.  That does not mean that we recommend that everyone should use that special equipment. It depends on the results each user desires.


[Cabby]Yall are gonna have to pay up for an extra, professional license if your channel is popular. Honestly? Spend your money else where. Plenty of better, cheaper gimmicks that end up looking far more entertaining than this crap.

[Aty]We do still need be sustainable as a business long term, in order to keep improving FaceRig, adding features and content so that's why the program can't be free; and we also need to convince our tech partners that using their tech in a low cost product is a good idea,  so we had to include limitations for commercial use. So that's the main reason any FaceRig Classic and FaceRig Pro have commercial use limitations, that's why we have a fairly complex EULA and that's and why Facerig Pro costs more (because it starts to have some commercial use).  However, most users who pass the $500 monthly revenue seem to understand why they would have to pay more for a professional tool that helps their channels grow.


[Cabby]Mentioning pricing reminds me: do you want to use all the anime grills people have made in the workshop? Do you want to use workshop content at all? Because ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• you, that‚Äôs another $4 just to have the right to access them. The entire workshop is filled to the brim with 2D Live content. I could only find 3 regular FaceRig mods in my search. I subscribed to 2 of them, 1 crashed the application. In the off chance that you want to make your own 2D Live character, you are in for an even bigger world of hurt. The application needed to make the characters is developed by an entirely different third party, whose based in Japan. Majority of the quality tutorials are in Japanese. Its also quite a bit more expensive than this app itself; as opposed to regular 3D models which can be made in open source modeling applications such as Blender.

[Aty] Yes, the Live2D Module is licensed from Live2D in Japan. But they offer a free version for any content creators who do not want to use their tool commercially. As for the tutorials, we've provided English as much as we could:
http://steamcommunity.com/app/274920/discussions/8/485624149164823989/


[Cabby]One thing that completely baffles my mind: a pre-recorded video of someone‚Äôs tracking performance can yield different results when fed into another PC opposed to the live performance. Its so mind bogglingly ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•, I really can‚Äôt explain how you can mess up an app that bad. Perhaps I should take it up with the forums, but I really don‚Äôt care at this point. The tracking is inaccurate anyway. You will be fighting with it constantly, trying to find the optimal sitting arrangement just so you don‚Äôt have to worry about it derping out every 3 seconds.

[Aty]Of course it does, it depends entirely on the machine you are running the program on. A machine with the recommended requirements will perform better than one with the minimal requirements.


[Cabby]Lastly, to extend on the point of this awful design, visual motion tracking is both inefficient and, at this point, obsolete. Emitter based tracking has taken over this department. Its a bit more niche, considering that you need very specific, extra hardware along with the software, but it performs so much better with less overhead on the CPU. It scales better, it detects better, and it can be run with a single standard design. Even if you use visual tracking, using something similar to the PlayStation Moves colored ball design is far superior than trying to keep track of every possible configuration of skin tone, head/mouth/eye size, hair/glasses, etc.

[Aty] I do not understand why you would complain that FaceRig Pro and the $4 Live2D Module cost too much, and then suggest that we should change the tracking technology with one that would make the whole program's cost skyrocket.
However, we are working on implementing other sensor into FaceRig for those who can afford it. For example the Leap Motion DLC is free on our side, but you need to buy the special camera to use it. Just like the Intel RealSense DLC.
Also for FaceRig Studio we are going to release a PercePtion Neuron module, which will have a much better accuracy.


[Cabby]PS: Why do you have achievements? Why does any kind of software have achievements? I don‚Äôt use software to feel like I have done something cool, I use them to help MAKE something cool. That isn‚Äôt gonna happen with this.

[Aty] For the people who love to collect them (:"

Also, it works well if your glasses are not reflective. Reflective glasses block line of sight to your eyes. This is most noticeable in a dark room when your computer monitor is the brightest light source. If you don't have non-reflective glasses, try putting the brightest light source behind or beside you instead of in front.
Also, glasses with thinner rims are preferred since they block less of your eyebrows.
You can also use the advanced tracking settings (and the settings in the avatar behaviour tab) to compensate for oddities."

There are a few tricks to get a better performance:
Make sure FaceRig runs in Dx11 mode not DX9 mode 

Lowering the FaceRig render resolution does not help the CPU that much, just a bit. Capping the FaceRig main thread framerate helps a lot more, and so does setting FaceRig as a lower priority process. 
The refresh rate of the application is set to 60 fps by default. Turning it down to 30, or even 20-25, could greatly help as it clears some CPU usage."

We are sorry your initial experience was not ideal. 
The problem in most cases are not necessarily the glasses, but either:

1. the light setup that causes your glasses to give off strong reflections 
2. less than ideal framing (face too far away from the camera, so there's not enough pixels to work with for the tracker). 
3. Maybe lack of a proper  neutral expression calibration ?

Because, in certain light setups, of the lens light reflections block the camera's view of your eyes, the program cannot track what it cannot see in the webcam feed. 

Disabling tracked blink in the Avatar behaviour, and altering your light set-up a bit will vastly improve your experience.  Also there is this pinned thread in the forum with extra information: http://steamcommunity.com/app/274920/discussions/2/613935404221245524/

We are sorry to hear about your experience with FaceRig being a negative one.

However the amount of facerig videos that you can find from Twitch streamers on Google, Youtube and Twitter and Twitch   (For instance  https://youtu.be/Iye30ej4bjA?t=1m7s  )  do tend to show that this is not a common  issue, many streamers do manage to configure the FaceRig settings so that they do get good performance while playing games.

For instance:
In regard to CPU performance the largest positive impact is given by running FaceRig in dx11 mode, instead of  DX9 (launcher setting). 
One other thing that you can try to do is set FaceRig as a lower priority process ( in preferences/performance, within FaceRig). 
For GPU bottlenecks, setting a lower render resolution should be enough.

Hard-limiting the FPS or the tracker thread can also help but should be among the last things on the list:).

However, with the measly laptop I came to Steam with it wasn't going to happen. Was Facerig one of the reasons I decided to upgrade? Actually, it did factor in.

So, shiny new computer tower installed, widescreen monitor, webcam, microphone... everything was ready.

Facerig did not disappoint.

I was looking for something to create stories on for school, something the kids could take home or be sent to parents over social media, something a little more interesting than an audio recording and it hit that spot straight away.

So, I used it on and off until it came to organising a Halloween event for the school. With a little planning and a Skype setup, we arranged it so the students had a locked-room challenge, hosted by a Halloween monster (thanks to one of the DLC packs).

Sure, Skype support has been problematic lately, but that's Skype, not the software. Give yourself a half decent webcam, a decent lightsource and remember to keep your expressions animated and this will deliver the goods without fail. It's a great toy and a great resource and when I brought it in for Halloween, my colleagues were perhaps even more impressed than the students.

As long as you know what this does and what you're getting yourself in for, then I thoroughly recommend this software.

If you use FaceRig for streaming, your PC needs to be above the minimum requirements so that lagging will not occur.

You can try this for better performance:

First, the refresh rate of the application is set to 60 fps by default. Turning it down to 30, or even 20-25, could greatly help as it clears some CPU usage. Go to the Advanced UI (last option from left to right on the top bar), General Options dialog, Performance tab, and change Main App Frame Cap. 
Make sure you are running FaceRig on DX11, it will clear some of the CPU usage, on some avatars the CPU usage is half of the DX9 version. Change this option from the Launcher, Render API.
Change some graphics options to clear some GPU *and* CPU resources utilization. Change the render resolution to 640x360 (try out different values to see what suits your needs) and the shadow map quality (go to Low) from General Options dialog, Graphics tab. You can also tweak the Fur Quality, Skin Shading Quality and Use Animated Normals, to balance performance and visual level to your needs

Having said that, It is also the most aggravating piece of software I have ever run across in the audio department. I bought it to use in conjunction with Morphvox Pro for a special purpose for children's lessons. Yes it is true that my Computer is not a high end desktop system but it holds it's own with this stuff but it is constantly losing it's ability to have the playback loop work. With and without the Morphvox software running. I have gone thru all the settings many, many times and re-installed the pre-requisites over and over. Sometimes the second pre-requisite does not re-install without first going into the control panel and deleting it there as per computer instructions because ocaisionally install_webmd refusing to finish installing unless you uninstall first and then it requires a computer reboot before it installs correctly. I have done the virtual mic, screaminbee when Morphvox is running, windows mapper, my mic and every other combo to get playback loop up and working again while recording to no avail. It has become so frustrating to me I am just dumbfounded. Sometimes even the mouse will hover and highlight every single option except the exact one you are trying to highlight (i.e. devices) I am not a complete idiot either as I do actually hold a degree in computer science and have messed with computers since the TRS-80 model 1 which I bought in 1981. The audio stability of this software is just something to be desired. So I go ahead and record without playback loop audible and when I load in the .wav file or the movie, it of course has recorded without any effects that I had assigned and that is without Morphvox open and just using the in-house effects. I have a Logitech h390 headset with mic and the sound comes thru fine and is heard easily but just not the playback loop.

I commissioned somebody to design a 3D model for facerig and he soon run into trouble. He tried to get support to get it working, but support ended up turning their back on him. I tried to see that facerig devs can expand their rigging services, but instead I was told to throw the person that commissioned back into the lion's den. He soon came back telling me that it didn't work out as once again they became quiet. He told me that we may not be the target audience for this software and I agreed with him. They did turn their back on us twice. 

I wanted it do a youtube video on my channel to complain about facerig, but I couldn't figure out how to do it without breaking my character and going OOC.

We have answered you each time and we have offered to complete your avatar with the only request that you need post it on the workshop.

84,19366789,english,"[h1]Why I got this[/h1]
It allows me to talk like my Freekin blue 4 eyed lizard alien avatar! (imported my own character)
And it looks so fluently and dynamic that my friends gets creeped out at times!

[h1]How I discovered it[/h1]
One of my danish friends decided to use it in a skype call, when i watched him talk like a wolf that way I asked about it at once! Bought it as fast i found out about the character import possabilities.

[h1]Do I reccomend this?[/h1]
First of look at my time using this software.
Then look at my main reason.
If you love pretending to be things or roleplayting this is a go! Especially if you like cosplaying, I call this the ultimate digital cosplay software! You can be anything if you make it! Like my avatar used in my steam pic. (which i made)
I say you cant find anything better for free. And I cant see anything better for money either. Software renders itself as an virtual webcam usable in any software that accepts webcams.

[h1]How did i get my own character into this?[/h1]
Well i had this avatar i made a little while before knowing this softare, basically an alien i made in spore and exported to later on modify allot in blender (improving the look and adding more realistic suitable clothes). Then i read through the manual several times and experimented with the example characters aviable. Then i made my own character working the the whole head with tongue and 4 eyes working and everything. I knew a certain amount of how blender worked which is why i could pull this.

Later on i did an upgraded version of my blue personal character with 2 working arms beside the head. And the whole body visible with a wagging tail behind me.

I also got an character released at the workshop (guess what) another character made in spore but modified a little later on. Worth a look!

Technically yes, you can create custom models but, trust me when I tell you...it's daunting. The 2d models are easier because there's some better tools to use but if you're wanting to add a new model or do something custom then you might want to pass on this software as it's just not there yet.

Another thing is their documentation. You'd think that a company would just create a spot on their website with all their documentation or any help files, but no...their documentation is spread out all over the place, forums, steam, inside threads created by others. So not only is it EXTREMELY difficult to add any sort of customization, the documents that you will need to do that is literally spread out all over the place.

In the end, it's a very promising peice of software but until they get a definitive set of documentation, some better tools, and refining the avatar creation process this unfortunatly limits this software to just a gimmick.",1471876298,1471876298,False,1,0,0.442424237728118896,0,True,False,False,76561197973401943,441,49,634,0,510.0,1528920998,1471937439.0,"Hi there,

We have created FaceRig with the intent to be an open platform.
The documentation necessary for creating a 3D model is in one place right here http://steamcommunity.com/app/274920/discussions/6/485622866436709756/.
Indeed it does require some skills to create a 3D model and as for tools, you can use Blender , Maya or any other 3D software as long as you follow the documentation.
Our 3D artists do provide support and feedback for the rigging part and they can be reached via email here artsupport[at]holotech[dot]eu.

Does your laptop meet the minimum requirements.
Here they are: MINIMUM: 
OS: Windows¬Æ 7 or later 
Processor: Intel¬Æ Core‚Ñ¢ i3-3220 or equivalent 
Memory: 2 GB RAM 
Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce GT220 or equivalent 
DirectX: Version 9.0 
Storage: 3 GB available space 
Sound Card: DirectX 9.0c compatible sound card 
Additional Notes: For image based tracking you need a webcam. For sound base tracking you need a microphone. The requirements are based on desktop systems, not mobile (netbooks, ultrabooks, laptops, tablet pc). The mobile versions of processors and graphics adapters are not equivalent to the desktop ones. If you have a mobile PC please make sure the charger is plugged, you are running on the best graphic adapter and in high performance mode. We do not recommend low end integrated graphics adapters.

If it does and FaceRig still does not work then you will need to provide us with the Vp.log and dxdiag files like here http://steamcommunity.com/app/274920/discussions/2/34096318703798146/ so we can investigate."

I purchased FaceRig and then saw their demo on youtube of using the Intel RealSense cameras with IRFaceRig.  I was impressed with the demo, so I purchased an Intel RealSense SR300 camera and then downloaded the IRFacerig program.  Unfortunately, the IRFacerig program is missing a lot of features that FaceRig has.   One of the developers of FaceRig responded that this is by design since the IRFacerig version is free and FaceRig is a paid version.  The recent version of FaceRig does accept the Intel RealSense SR300 camera as well,  but I have not figured out successfully or found documentation on how to do facial and hands tracking the at same with FaceRig and a RealSense SR300 camera with FaceRig. (Or which avatars support hands tracking).

Your webcam is not being properly initialized and you need to reselect it (switch to Advanced UI- Advanced tracking config- Trackers- Ulsee -input device- add your webcam).

You can record your performance in FaceRig Classic and in FaceRig Pro.
The only difference between these two is that FaceRig Pro is used for content creaters who use FaceRig on theri channels and they make more than $500 per month.
As for mocap/ recording your animation and import it into 3|D softwares, these are features for FaceRig Studio as it was also stated in our Indiegogo campaign"

85,12045637,english,"I bought it. I've spent over an hour with it, during the day, at night, with lamps on both sides of my monitor to light my face evenly, with glasses (avoiding any reflection at all), with contacts, after trimming my beard to the 4mm minimum I'm willing to do, all while using a fairly decent HD Logitech webcam. The avatar will slowly shake it's head with me, do some stiff nodding and slow blinking, and every now and then it'll catch some movements I make with my face, like raise an eyebrow or move my mouth left and right. It might start moving it's mouth like it's talking when I make a sound. That's about it.

Here's my primary experience so far. The left eye is half closed most of the time, winking with my left eye does nothing, winking with my right eye closes both eyes, it randomly opens the mouth and won't shut it until I reset the calibration, it smiles when I frown, it smirks with one corner of the mouth when I smile, the mouth doesn't even hint at trying to move with mine when I talk, but humming a tone into the mic makes the avatar start moving it's mouth like it's holding a speech (so if I clearly articulate a long ""KAAAABOOOOOMMMMM"" it'll do something random more along the lines of ""weabolalaoooahlagaoubomadaou"" - probably leaving the mouth open at the end), the (random) mouth movent has a massive delay so even with some imagination it doesn't look like it's the one talking... The fact that Facerig ""cheats"" to emulate talking by making random mouth movements when you pic up sound on the mic shows that the devs even know the mouth-tracking doesn't work.

You'd think I'd have the most difficult face in the world to track, but I've been blessed with a fairly symetrical face, I'm white with dark hair (so you'd think eyebrows would be the easiest thing in the world to find), have no blemishes to get confused with, and sport a light, well-trimmed beard. My face certainly doesn't go in the ""difficult to track"" category and I've tried lighting setups that are starting to border on professional.

Facerig is pretty much on par with the gimmicky stuff that used to ship with webcams 6 or more years ago, when it comes to how well it works. I own a ton of games and take chances on early-access things often, but this is one of the few times I'm pretty disappointed. The only thing it has going for it is that the 3D models are nice and it's fantastic that it'll be opened up to people to develop their own models (hopefully through Steamworks). The software itself is made with some strange, old-looking, custom interface, where each type of setting opens up in a different, separate window, and quite often they don't even open the first time you click on the corresponding icon. I simply can't think of a single redeming feature beyond the nice-looking models and the associated customization/lighting. Absolutely everything around the avatar models themselves kind of, well... sucks.

So, it's fairly obvious why I don't think this is ready for sale at all - early access or not. This is barely free, open-beta, prototype material considering the core-functionality is barely dragging itself along. The interface might get a complete overhaul, but I kind of doubt it. It's likely to keep looking like one of those nVidia 3D tech demos. And that's where I get to my point. This is a 3D tech demo. Not an application. I truly, truly, wish it was - otherwise I wouldn't have bought it.

---

PS. I can tell a lot of work has gone into this, and I don't mean to bash the team. I know how hard it is to work in a startup and I wish them tons of success. Hell, you trippled your IndieGogo goal and you're front-paged on Steam, so I'd say you've hit some major milestones and major congrats are in order for that. People want what you're promising, and I'm obviously one of them. However, this is a pretty lousy result of more than a year of work and hundreds of thousands of dollars. I'd honestly toss out ALL the programming, keep the models and start over with a proper interface that doesn't look like you took inspiration from ten-year-old versions of GIMP and Blender. I'm almost certain that you let the 3D designer(s) think up the interface as well. Take on some guys who did a master's thesis or PhD on face-tracking to build that part. It's not easy, but it's most certainly not the rocket-science you make it out to be. I know you won't start trashing all the code, though, since that's one of the hardest things to do in start-up-land, but what you've spent so much time and money building barely works at all, and that's a very bad sign. It means development is truly slow (which is fatal for a start-up, for reasons ranging from dying motivation to loss of market interest and severe second-mover risks) and it points toward thinking that you've got some magic under the hood that can't be done better. Believe me, it can with the knowledge you have now. You know that it's not even close to how well you imagined it to work. Focus on that.

March 2016 Update:
Two things: Snapchat and MSQRD. I hadn't given any thought to Facerig again until these two MOBILE APPS suddenly introduced face-tracking as a free gimmick and did it a hundred times better, and I thought to myself ""hey, didn't I blow $20 on a crappy piece of software that didn't come close to this?"" Seriously, if a little team like MSQRD can come up with far superior face tracking with probably a fraction of the time and funding on freaking mobile phones, that just goes to show what a failure this is. If I could thumbs-down Facerig twice, I would. There are far better, free alternatives. I'm sure the Facerig team had a collective kool-aid-drinking fit when they heard that Facebook bought MSQRD. Did I mention the terrible face-tracking before? Second-mover risks? I think I did.",1410371509,1460581576,False,199,5,0.62075883150100708,17,True,False,False,76561197971843082,1183,18,113,0,113,1460582889,,

No amount of troubleshooting fixed it, and I decided that a slight asymmetric feature of my face (my left eyelid droops EVER SO SLIGHTLY-- almost unnoticably unless you're looking at my eyes side-by-side and I just told you about it.) was causing the on-screen avatar to have a stroke and a seizure at the same time. Even holding my eye wide open and sitting perfectly still, portions of the avatar's cheeks and jaw jiggled and twitched aimlessly and when moving my mouth to lip sync, it only moved about every other word.

If you're really interested, and you're hopeful for a working FaceRig, I would either ensure that it works for you, ensure that you're using ideal settings (both computer settings, and real life contextual settings such as plain, bright lighting and sitting a specific angle to your webcam) and even then don't be surprised at the unfortunate hiccups, twitches and other immersion-destroying issues.

We constantly offer support and assistance on our Steam forum so any time you encounter issues or you have questions we are here to help. As for twitchy avatars, a proper calibration needs to be done in order for the avatar to behave like in this tutorial https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB_bxGF2JWM&index=2&list=PLwxwPv-15rVtP1S1DnkP7S6lZoFjAmY2k

For a twitchy avatar you can adjust the smoothing slider which can be located by switching to Advanced UI then select Advanced Tracking Configuration and by Selecting the Body and Head Pose you can adjust the Smoothing Slider.
If the avatar does not have the eyes opened then the calibration has not been done correctly.It can either be because you did not registered a neutral position from the beginning or by not fine tuning the eyes.
This can be done by switching to Advanced UI then choose the 4th top option from the right side menu. There if you go to Expression Units - Eyes you can adjust the sliders based on sensitivity. Here is also a tutorial to guide you through this process http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=527751224&insideModal=0
You also have the option to turn off or on the audio based lipsync. The audio based lipsync can be found both in Simple and Advanced UI, it's the one that looks like a mouth. It is also recommended to use quality headsets with good noise cancelling microphone for optimal lipsync, as any background noise will interfere with its accuracy. When the lipsync is on it means that the audio based tracker detects the spoken language and then translates them as animation applied to the avatar.
Any time you encounter issues, don't hesitate to contact us and we will assist you."

The programmers have a launcher inside their program that basically serves no purpose other than to try and get you to buy their halloween avatars or whatever, which is irritating and bad form for paid software. To make matters worse, the launcher they use is prone to hangs and the developers left it in knowing full well that once launched, it freezes systems. (I can tell they intentionally left it in because they have a launch option choice to TRY and bypass it; but if you forget to select the bypass option, have fun with your computer restart, because thats the only way its closing!)

I would often coat myself in ketchup and mustard, then sprinkle seeds in my hair and stare into the mirror for minutes at a time, willing myself to become a hamburger. However, this bit of role-playing never fulfilled my desire to be a hamburger.

Now, now my dream will finally be realized. My first order of business will be to record a video of me as a hamburger and send it to my grade school teacher. I'll say, ""MMmmmMMMMMMM!!!!!"" (For, of course, hamburgers cannot speak English.) She will know instantly who I am, and will type her response as tears of regret roll down her cheeks and onto her keyboard. ""Little Cheshire,"" she will type, ""I was wrong. I was so wrong."" My hamburger self will smile as I read her response, knowing that all the while, I understood that I was right to dream of being a hamburger, most noble of all handheld foods.

- Avatar customization

Cons
- Large use of CPU
- Somewhat requires a high fps tracking
- Yet to be fully optimized?

This software isn't really that great, but it's a step forward in terms of getting this kind of feature into the consumer market, so I'm okay with supporting it. I purchased it specifically because of the Live2D module, but that's also been a bit disappointing.

The face tracking is fine, but the rigging and parameterization aren't really up to snuff, so the subtler gestures of the human face are really under-expressed, and the more overt ones are sometimes overexpressed. There's also little accounting for the differences in expressiveness between the various human facial structures and ranges of human physical expression. Some people show teeth when they smile, some don't. Some people's lip edges actually point downward when they frown, some don't. Some people open their mouths wide when they speak, some people make subtler lip motions. I can see the tracker keeping up with all of this, but the model does not seem to account for it correctly. Tuning is long and tedious and only helps a little bit. Most furstrating, though, is the [i][b]significant[/b][/i] latency in the model's expression.

I don't think Holotech has been lazy here. I think the tech is just still in its infancy. Live2D was particularly disappointing because the range of expressiveness for the models tends to be so very low to begin with.

Still, I consider this to be prototypical tech; breaking ground in a new consumer segment. I'm hoping that FaceRig gets some competition and that all of the involved tech (especially Live2D) makes large strides forward.",1451544102,1451544102,True,0,0,0.459821432828903198,0,True,False,False,76561198135143088,605,410,344,0,344,1451512473,,

I can't say I'm disappointed.

One of only downsides I've really face is the fact I wear glasses, and that can kind of mess up the eye tracker. While this can be pretty much fixed by disabling the eye tracking/enabling autoblink or ajusting light to fix glare, it makes me sad that I can't squint or look surprised with those features disabled/enabled. So, if you have glasses, this still can work, but you may want to look into using contacts with this instead (or be like me and give up on your glasses and use this blind).

The only other downside I've found is that I prefer to use a headset to talk (if I used my webcam, there would be a bit too much background noise) and the headset can mess up the ability for the software/webcam to see some facial expressions. However, this could be fixed by getting a standalone mic that would just sit on a desk, but still block out background noise.

Overall, this was totally worth buying a brand new webcam that I will never use for anything else.

I tried it myself and found it rather disappointing (for reasons detailed below), but I still have not changed my mind about the fact that it has a lot of potential. It is a shame because I actually wanted to purchase the Pro license so I could broadcast with FaceRig.

- Most facial features (eyebrows, chin, forehead, etc.) on most avatars tend to jitter like crazy, rapidly and haphazardly fluttering even with my face up-close and perfectly still. I have a good camera, and I did try to play around with the ""Smoothing"" options that were designed to get rid of this facial capture anomaly, but to no avail. This may sound like a minor issue, but it really hinders performance when I encounter it. I looked in the website's forums for this issue and found only one other user who had it, and his query is yet to be answered.

- Some characters severely lack certain expressions. For example, the ""wisdom"" guy seems to be unable turn (not tilt) his head sideways, except through manual controls.

- Sort of related to the above issue: It is very difficult to have a character shake its head ""yes"" or ""no"" without anomalies. For example, the ghost in the Halloween DLC is almost incapable of doing a coherent head shake. He is also unable to nod ""yes"" without his eyebrows erroneously registering a series of scowls and raised brows. This was especially discouraging because I liked this character most.


- I noticed some characters completely lacked customization options, such as the aforementioned ghost. 

It seems to be all these issues may eventually be solved while this software continues to be developed and improved. However, in the state in which it is now, I find it almost unusable at worst, experimental at best. My refund request is pending.

I appreciate the effort and intent here, but unfortunately it just doesn't deliver. For example, if I make a sad, pouty face, the avatar will often smile. If my bottom lip curls up over my top one, into a pout, the avatar's bottom lip should curl up over its top one. There also weren't nearly as many avatars as I was expecting--and many of them were limited to just one gender. So, for example, there was only a female alien, no male alien.

Most of the issues you mentioned can be addressed by properly configuring the program.
Take a look here at what a proper  configuration can produce : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLohwYLxVxs

What's especially important:

- framing your face in the camera correctly (not to small/far away, and not cut off by the image edges) 
- proper lighting (for instance we've seen many screenshots taken in dark rooms with the only light being what comes off the monitor, which is needless to say bad for image-based expression tracking) 
- setting up a neutral pose and expression correctly 

We do agree that using for the first time expression mo-cap technology does have  bit of a learning curve associated with it, but we trust is worth learning to use the program correctly (if used improperly we agree the results will not be stellar, like in the examples you've given).

The face doesn't match my actual expressions very well and only a limited range of expressions are possible. I can smile, I can kind of squint my eyes (but sometimes the eyes act weird). I can shake my head no, but if I nod yes, it confuses it into thinking I'm closing my eyes because it can't even figure out that face getting shorter = angle changing. Somewhat understandably, it doesn't track my hands, but that's a huge handicap when I talk with my hands (I'm part Italian, it seems to be in my blood). Really, the advantage of seeing my face or an avatar is that you can see my expressions. If I can't make half the expressions I want to or even make gestures with my hands, then it's no better than a phone call with no visual representation.

I used this with MorphVox to modify my voice and the effect was kinda nice. It would be cool if this app had better voice changing abilities to actually match the characters, although fixing the flaws in the facial expression tracking is a much higher priority.

Also, the fact that this is Windows-only is a huge bummer. I would prefer Linux and Mac as well as the main thing I'd like to use this with is Skype, which is already cross-platform and I'm not on Windows most of the time. Having this on iOS and Android would also be a plus if I'm still somehow able to use this with Skype (might not be possible though).

Sorry to hear about the negative experience with FaceRig. From your review we get the feeling that perhaps you did not yet understand what the neutral expression calibration is for, or how to perform it correctly. Please make a thread on the Steam Troubleshooting forum with details about these problems (if you can, also send us a captured facecam feed) and we will help you out with information on what is wrong with your mo-cap set-up.   As you may imagine that the program wold not have had an 85% positive rating if poor tracking was the norm, but we do agree that it is a bit more complex way to interact with the computer, than just via mouse and keyboard or controller, so there is a learning curve especially for those who have not worked with mo-cap before.   

Regarding the black feed: There's actually a specific pinned thread in the Troubleshooting section to help those who are seeing a black feed in  Skype (usually the answer is deceptively simple : folks simply forget to toggle broadcast on in FaceRig or  are unaware of the fact that in Windows only one program can use a webcam device at the same time http://steamcommunity.com/app/274920/discussions/2/523890681411352799/ ).

We're sorry to hear about your negative experience with FaceRig, and while of course you are fully entitled to your opinion, you are presenting very inaccurate information in this review, as seen in the following examples.

1. The Virtual Camera Driver does exist and it does work (it just needs to be properly installed and properly configured).  
Simply look up recent videos on YouTube with FaceRig on Omegle or Chatroulette, there are LOTS of them, made by various people,  and they all use the FaceRig Virtual Webcam driver.
https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=facerig+omegle
You can do the same for Skype and such.

2. The voice would match the character's lip motion if the user picks free-form retargeting avatars, like here:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLohwYLxVxs   
and/or if the user has enabled and configured the audio based lip tracking correctly, like here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iUQSHZ4lmxY

There is a bit of a learning curve with FaceRig for users who have never used mo-cap software before, but that does not mean that good results cannot be obtained once you learn the basics :).   

In closing:  we do not claim that the program  is perfect, ( far from it, there are many legitimate bits of critique that we pick from the steam reviews and user forum and integrate in our development plans), but what was described in your review is ... something else entirely.

I'm loving how this software works, very impressive!

This really affects mostly to 3d characters rather than the 2d characters from the dlc ""Live 2D Module"".

The calibration between webcam and screen is fantastic! It's fun to make interesting expressions, and I take an interesting advantage of this for sketching. [b]Yes, sketching![/b] It's very good practice, to me that is. It's like drawing in art class with a live model.

A recent Windows update seems to have had adversely affected two Microsoft Windows redistributables related  Visual Studio that were also needed by FaceRig. This is not a FaceRig specific issue, and is easily corrected by re-installing the mentioned redistributables.  We suspect that is most likely the issue that was affecting you and we would have guided you on how to do that  had you made a post with the needed log files on the Bugs and Troubleshooting forum.

The links you have posted in your review are rather old (one is from more than a year ago when the program had just entered in Early Access, other is from about 5 months ago immediately after the program launch).  Many aspects  have changed since then, and those threads are not representative of the current program state by a long shot. 

Please realize Very Positive rating on Steam (85% positive reviews) would not have been possible if the product was not generally good; the problems you mention are solvable with a bit of patience, and they are the exception and not the norm. 

Happy Holidays.,
The FaceRig Team."

Our experience is that the voice effects do work through Skype or any other chat program, if you set the audio part up properly by using  the included virtual microphone driver (just like you do for the webcam for the video part).  If you have experienced issues getting it to work please describe those problems in detail in  the Bugs and Troubleshooting section of the Steam FaceRig forum.

I bought this as an early access and worked under Windows 7, but now under Windows 10 no microphone can be found. Someone had the same problem and uninstalling Windows 10 was the solution to get it back to work. I posted a response on their own forums but two weeks later no reponse at all. I don't expect a solution in two weeks but a message that they would look into it or some questions for more information would seem normal. All my other programs seems to work fine under Windows 10 and they all use my microphone without problems...

Our dev team tries to answer all users and help them solve their technical issues as fast as possible. I don't know how many developers you'll find are doing that on Steam or any other software forum:)

If you've posted on facerig.com it is possible (not probable, but possible) that we've missed your query since there is a pinned post there saying all technical issues should be posted to the Steam forums since that's where our programmers are most active. However, if we've missed your post please link it so we can take a look as we do want to help.

As for people installing or uninstalling Windows 10, it's not a secret that early adopters of an operating system have always had issues with software/drivers. We never did or will recommend that a user uninstalls or switches OS in order to make FaceRig work. We do, however, require some files and additional info to be able to troubleshoot the issue and it so it doesn't occur anymore. If everyone switches back to their previous version are doing the least desired thing (by us at least) and don't really help us improve the program.  While we do QA ourselves and try to test as many cases, it's impossible to catch EVERY issue. 

Anyway, reply here linking us with your Steam bug report submitted on the Steam forums. (here is how to submit a bug/crash report http://steamcommunity.com/app/274920/discussions/2/34096318703798146/)"

16,19729703,english,"It's less like looking into a mirror than it is like watching a monkey trying to mimic your expressions, but FaceRig has significantly improved in its functionality since its official release in July. Many of these models are fantastic in their capacity to display highly-expressive emotion properly and on time, such as Zyraxes (R), which appears to look stoned half the time when I use him. In addition, they're collaborating with the developers of games I appreciate (such as Starbound; I wouldn't have purchased FaceRig if I didn't instantly fall in love with the Floran model), and revolutionary experimental software (Live2D), the former of which is offered for free.

FaceRig has given me a significant amount of enjoyment through Skype shenanigans, among other things, and was well worth the $15 price. I'm not sure I can recommend it for business use, given that it's still highly unrefined, however, with the sheer number of currently available avatars, the potential for more to be released through the Steam Workshop and for free, and the quality improvements of existing avatars FaceRig has implemented since its appearance on Steam, it continues to explode with potential. Currently the best publicly available facial-recognition software, FaceRig is worth buying just to see Zyraxes twirling a highly-suggestive alien antennae attached to his tongue as he reacts with you to the display.

PS: I do hope they avoid rigging real people. Their Pewdieverse DLC was a horrible idea, and although that may have been mostly due to the average Steam user's ""slightly"" negative impression of PewDiePie, I feel the concept itself is bad. FaceRig seems to model its best characters after works of fiction and fantasy (such as TF2), and I would hate to see it begin adding celebrities such as Brad Pitt. If that were the case, it would be targetting a very specific audience not commonly found on Steam... God forbid they add other youtubers.

Voice recongnition and configuration... crap. It's only really mouthing half what you are saying and mumbling on it's own afterwards. 

Face matching... crap. If you notice, the eyes are very droopy and for some characters, they don't even look at you when you are staring at the camera. So bad eye contact configuration as well. 

Character customization... is very inconveniant and limited. The most you can do with character creation is honestly, just color the character and give it some props here and there. No costume selection or anything like that though if you were hoping that would be in the program. (not that I did but just something I thought you should know)

There are some props you can use to use as a ""costume"" like hats and glasses. I tried putting my character on with glasses and why the hell did they spawn it in between the nape of her neck... why were they trying to waste my time with that? What's worse is that they have HAIR as part of the props. 

""Oh you want bangs for your character? Here you go! But we're going to make it even more difficult for you by spawning it in the middle of the air and when you try to actually have it connect with the rest of her, it'll look like the most unnatural thing ever. Have fun."" 

Just... f- you!

Hello,

FaceRig is a software aimed at entertainment and content creators alike. Thus, we offer quite a bit of customization options to improve your exeprience and that of your fans/viewers.

""Voice recognition"" is quite good if you'll take a look at this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PYDCegwUcA it just needs a bit of tweaking to work perfectly with your microphone as there are inherent delays and background noises that need filtering (these differ from hardware to hardware and thus cannot be done automatically)

While the default calibration recognizes a wide variety of facial types and features, being a 2D sensor (just your webcam) recognition is requires a bit of finetuning that can be very easily done. Here is a guide. Just go to whichever face part is acting up for you and look at how to tweak the sliders for it :) http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=315322209

The props offer the user the possibility to attach them to a various amount of bones. Which bone you attach them to dictates which part of the body they will move with (depending on the prop you will want a different body part, moustache-mouth, hat->head, piercing-many parts!). So the initial placement may not be ideal for ALL of the bones but we've optimized it for a few base bones like the Head bone. Optimizing every prop for every single bone in every avatar is possible but would/will take time and, in some cases it might even be pointless since some of our users really like placing props in very unusual ways to express creativity (which we absolutely LOVE). Here is a show presentation of props and how to attach them https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9yoDPybyKE Tweaking around with the bone and sliders will help place the prop exactly where you want it to be.

Oh and if you select the CUSTOM skin that most avatars have, you will also notice that you can change A LOT more. Like add a skin to the avatar's surfaces (skin/fur/clothes etc)

The software is made in a way that it will allow the maximum amount of customization for the features it has. It's meant to tickle your creative bone and offer you the possibility of doing fun, expressive things with it.

Additionally we provide support for ALL of these features by having a team that's active on the Steam forums (how many other devs do that, really now?) so you can drop by and ask us stuff any time you wish. Drop by and make a suggestion of how to improve a feature and we'll take it into consideration!"

You can configure the program to use less CPU, by using settings that have nothing to do with the resolution ( rendering in a lower resolution mostly affects GPU occupancy, not the CPU occupancy) . 
We have ran FaceRig on systems similar to yours and we definitely did not get typical CPU usages of 60% to 99% if the running programs were properly configured. Please make a post in  the Bugs and Troubleshooting forum about this so that on Monday, when the programmers will be back in the office, together we will sort out why it behaves like this on your system, and what settings are optimal for you. :D 

In the mean-time here's what you can try: 
You can limit the fps of the main loop from the default of 60 to a more manageable 30. 
Furthermore make sure your webcam is not providing video feed at an excessive resolution ( like 1080p) as  720p or even 480p should be plenty  for face-tracking, anything above that is just extra work for the CPU.
Also make sure you are running in dx11 mode ( dx9 mode does eat significantly more CPU)
You are maybe using the experimental ""nextversion"" branch, where we specifically warn you that on ""face lost"" events , the cpu usage will spike. If that is the casejust roll back to the default branch if you do not want to deal with experimental implementations :)


At any rate, It is best to make a thread on the support forum where you can explain the issue in detail and we can provide solutions and do the needed detective work to figure out why it takes 99% on a 8 core cpu
:)  Regarding the refunds policy : that's 100% handled by Valve/Steam, not by us :).

Both these issues are most likely caused by how you have configured your visual and audio tracking set-up.  Drop by the forum or send us a recorded face-cam feed, we'll analyse it and show how how to do it properly so you get near perfect lip-sync and consistent tracking :)

Incidentally in the screenshots section, in about one in six screenshots that show the users we see very poorly configured light set-ups ( for image-based motion capture), which is suspiciously close to the disapproval/approval rating of the Steam reviews, so is hard not to draw a parallel :) . 

We trust that the problems that most of the disappointed users are facing when using FaceRig stem from the fact that they do not truly try and to ""get"" how image-based tracking and sound based tracking works and also have no desire to drop by the Steam FaceRig support forums to learn how to optimally set up their capture space."

Is your little laptop that almost could, above the listed minimal requirements for CPU and GPU?

If the answer is yes then probably is a settings issue that you can tweak and after that FaceRig will work smoothly, so  please drop by the FaceRig Steam bugs and troubleshooting forum and make a thread so we can figure it out.  
For instance most folks do not realize that on many laptops with inexpensive microphones  Windows comes configured by default with lag inducing sounds effects - such as digital noise reduction-  already activated, and those can add about 0.2 seconds of input audio lag before the sound even reaches FaceRig. This will of course mess with the audio based lipsync.  Also most folks do not realize that many laptops have very poor cooling, as as soon as their GPU and CPU start actually being used, they overheat and soon after they get auto down clocked, so their real performance in those cases is only a fragment of what is written "" on paper"").


If the laptop is indeed below the listed minimum specs then ... yes hardware below the minimal requirements will perform sub-par :) ."

1. Most likely you did not activate sound-based lipsync at all.

3. You did not deactivate lag inducing microphone effects from the windows microphone effects ( such as Acoustic noise cancellation or digital noise reduction that add up to 0.2 seconds of  audio lag to an user's microphone before the sound even reaches FaceRig.).

Sorry to hear about this. We just wished you had at least attempted to make a post on the bug forum and given us a chance to offer you support before deciding to give up on the program  (which is still in Early Access)  :)  . 

We have recently added a new unified virtual webcam driver, to replace the two old ones that we were using before ( for 32 bit and 64 bit apps) .  This reduces ( not increases) the number of additional installs , plus the new one one is compatible with more browsers, more chat apps and with the upcoming windows 10.  

It was developed by a specialized company ( not us) , Adoriasoft LLC, who has developed virtual drivers before. It has spent time in their QA lab (both alone and as part of FaceRig) to test against possible problems before being deployed publicly.

Many of our users on Steam also have manually installed it and tested it a few days ahead of wide scale deployment, and have confirmed to us that it works.    

In the last 20 hours, after wide scale deployment , we have learned that on few cases (total of 4 signalled to us so far, you included) , users (definitely not all, but probably more than 4) after installing this new driver had to plug/unplug their physical webcams or, in the case of integrated ones, enable/disable them from the device manager so that they re-gain their status as default webcams. That's the problem you are most likely experiencing. 

As a side effect, if the FaceRig program starts and does not find a proper real webcam video feed, it temporarily uses up more cpu trying to find your face on whatever input feed it receives. That behaviour is caused by the tracking library, which is also not developed by us, but licensed from ULSee Inc, a company with a reputable pedigree in the field of computer vision.  

To bypass that issue you can simply disable the face tracking from the top menu setting or from the program launcher settings (which you can access before even starting up FaceRig - we have built such a launcher particularly thinking ahead about situations like these, where you need to access the settings from outside the program) until you can sort out  the webcam settings within the program, so your CPU is not used by the tracking library in the interim.  

If your system specs are close to the minimal ones, then yes when you face is not being tracked and  the tracking library is in ""seek face"" mode, that can demand quite a lot from your CPU, and it can cause it to be sluggish, especially if it is on the low-side performance wise. 
We will look into ways of further limiting that effect. At any rate, any program by itself, even if it demands a lot of CPU power,  should not be able to just fry a system, unless that system has a defective cooling or is overclocked. 

We apologise for the inconvenience this has caused :)
There are no ""million"" plugins involved.
All the parts of the program are developed by competent developers, and tested before they even reach a single user on Steam. However bugs can still slip by. It is part of a normal Beta/Early Access process.


Regards
The FaceRig team :)"

36,12237777,english,"What is facerig? It's a mocap (motion capture) system for webcams, which replaces, in pretty close to real time, your face with a 3D animated model instead.

Overall, it's a very good program. The models are mostly high quality, the customization options are fairly respectable and so on. There are a few issues, such as lip synching which assumes you have a brittish accent and tends to add extra syllables that aren't actually pronounced. Another minor issue is it has problems tracking any sort of quick motions or motions which go past a fairly restrictive range of movement and it'll take a second or three to re-synch.

As a whole, however, for $10, it's remarkably high quality. Many times over higher quality than it has any right to be for that cost, actually. It's fun, effective, and will generate some pretty fun conversations at the very least.

A lot of the features have yet to be implemented, so keep in mind that this is basically beta software, yet higher quality than most full releases.

The difference between the standard version and the pro version, is simply that the pro version lets you use it for professional use (ie: you get paid for such). Like you could use it to stream or for youtube if you aren't getting paid for your content with the standard version, but if you want to use it for things that generate revinue, then you have to pay a bit more.

A studio version will be available next year supposedly which makes it actually useful for generating revinue, however, so I'd suggest holding out for that. In theory, the studio version will allow for recording animations, then exporting the animation files into programs like Maya to tidy up the animation curves and make it look professional, which would make it the cheapest quality motion capture option out there, really. Well, short of ""free"" stuff which largely sucks, to be blunt.

For those with modeling experience, you don't technically need to own the program to build a model and rig it for use in facerig, and you can even sell your models without owning the software, but you wouldn't be able to test to verify that it works properly with facerig, so make of that as you will. It's still a nice policy, though.

For the moment, facerig has some issues, but promises to be updated with patches to add new features and tighten up the quality of the features that exist, and that's well worth looking into.

As a whole, it works fairly well. It's not the highest quality motion capture program out there, but considering those run into the thousands of dollars, and this is $10 and works pretty much out of the box almost with only a few setting tweaks which are easy to make, it's a good option for the average person, and those with 3D design experience will find it even more useful since you can add your own models in as well.
-------------------
June 18th, 2015 update:

A few new features have been added since this review was added originally, and an updated GUI has been thrown in as well. It's a little more confusing than before, but a fair bit more powerful in terms of what you can do with it. The average user will probably find themselves playing with settings for an hour or more when they first start out before getting it to do exactly what they want, but once you've got it down, it's not that bad.

The ability to record videos has been added, and these are exported as .webm files. With a fair bit of tinkering, I was able to get facerig to work well enough for youtube. Another nice benefit is that the audio files are saved separately as well as .mp3's so you can edit the audio individually in something like soundforge. Premiere will need a bit of help to figure out what to do with .webm's though.

If you run into technical problems, feel free to ask them on the steam forum! I've had a few issues I've run into and every time I've asked, within 12 hours I had a very detailed and well-explained answer, with full follow-up, not just copy/pasting from a text file. Like they actually took the time to understand the issues I had and did actual troubleshooting. Seriously, I haven't seen a company with customer service this good before. They are literally #1 by far in this department, so that's a major bonus in their favour!

There is currently an issue with the recording aspect where slower computers (my poor piece of junk for example =P ) can run into a video/audio desync. There's not much that can be done to fix this as of this update, short of re-recording the clip again, but when I ran into the issue I was given a list of ways to mitigate the issue, and that they're aware of this issue and a patch fix is in the works. There's definitely continually updated support, so it will keep on getting better with time!

Again, this is not the greatest motion capture software in the business - but anything better out there costs $30,000 for the liscence, so that should give you an idea of what you're looking at.

If we are to talk specifically about the audio based lipsync, we trust your experience is most likely related to not knowing (or mis-using) the lip-sync options put at your disposal.

If the sound is properly routed through FaceRig and a sound delay setting is customized, quite good results can be obtained in regard to audio-based lipsync (user video links below).
 
We have had users who have been able to create lipsync videos that are a lot more than just decent, and it is important to remember these are completely automated results generated by analysing the input sound in real time, without any touch-ups done manually by animators like they do in movies and games.

https://youtu.be/DnqD1sip1Vw?t=1m4s
https://youtu.be/N5eXcWN6MKA
https://youtu.be/0I1jbQcWa3s?t=19s ( this last one is actually created by us when facering was not even released yet, by running a saved input facecam video & audio  received from one of our amazing users who also writes poetry.) 

We trust there are very few (if any) automated sound based lipsync systems out there that work this well in real time ( on consumer level hardware and at consumer level prices)  without manual user intervention on the output data.

I would also like to see an import model for custom content, and the software then self rigs it; be nice to have some options to tell it, whats an eye or mouth kinda thing.
Im an inde game developer, and this would work great for my dialog screens with NPC's through the game.
You guys should team up with FUSE, or something. I just don't like Maximo, they cost way too much and the animations are sub parr.

99,15238505,english,"Ok, so this review will cover the basics on what you will find, like, not like, etc. Be in mind this review is set for when the software is still being updated, i will try and also cover what new comes to it.


Ok so first off before you buy this be warned, it is still in development as stated on the software page, I did expect some bugs and glitches, maybe even some crashes but I haven't got one yet, only bugs and glitches.


[h1]Downloading the software[/h1]
Once you buy the software, you will have probably the longest first time setup list on steam yet. This will download things such as some players and a few other things. [i]I still haven't figured out two of the downloads and their purpose.[/i] After the first time setup, it is a really fast start up, It only took me about 30 seconds to load and for it to give a character to me.

[h1]Inside the software/Using the camera for motion[/h1]

Ok, I will say 1 thing I am upset with, is that the demo they gave on the page, for cameras such as a built in Laptop one, or one simular to it, does not work well with this software. They showed smooth usage of the software no lag nothing. Granted i just stated earlier that this was still being worked on and is early access, but that irritated me a little.

Now when you load up an avatar you want to use these are some of the issues you will see in the program.

[b]Laggy video

Issues with eye, tongue, and head movment

Must have constant eye contact with computer camera, or it loses focus[/b]

After those issues I know some people are going to say either, ""You're lying that doesn't happen!"" or ""Ok, I think I might pass on buying this.""

Be in mind these are issues [b]I[/b] have had, I am not saying multiple people had the same issues with this.


[h1]Using this on Skype, Google Hangouts, etc.[/h1]
Now, I have not delved into this part of the program yet, from what I've seen in the videos it looks promising. I have a friend that has tried it on Skype, but never could figure out how to do it, so there may be some issues figuring that out.
If I can figure it out I think I could surprise a few of my friends with it :/.


[h1]Things I would like to see added/updated[/h1]

What I would like to see wth this is more character skins, currently there are only a few, just in different forms, to list a few there are I believe 2 anime characters, a space commander, a dragon, an anthro wolf, a regular wolf, and elvish princess along with a few others. Now that might be a lot for some people, but it really doesn't bring out a level of selection, I want to be like ""Wow there's a lot to choose from, I can be this... NO this, no this, no this, no this uugh I don't know what to choose."" But i know it will be years before that.. reaction, will happen.

I also want to see more of a community for this, This is not really known to the world or many places at all, the more of a community that the makers have the more helpful info to fix, bugs/crashes/glitches/freezes etc.

I would also love to see this due to as I said earlier, the program doesn't work really well on laptops or built in cameras. I would love to see an update that fixes that to where I don't have to keep total eye contact with the camera, where I can turn my head completely away from the camera and it still detect me.


[h1]Final Verdict/Rating[/h1]

The program is very good, I would recommend buying it due to there is a lot currently, but as far as characters go, it's limited.
Would I recommend you get this for the main price? Yes!... For something like this, a mear $10-20 is a steal.

In all, I give this a 9.2/10

When looking at practical and long-term use I can't really see any use for this tool at all. I tried to see how it looks with twitch and honestly it really looks silly and unproffessional. Not to mention that the ‚Ç¨10 license has some holes when it comes to public broadcasting and monetesation (you need the 'DLC' package for that).

Using FaceRig with Skype when you call your friends and family overseas would be fun as well, but after one or two calls with each and every avatar I wouldn't use it anymore and instead drop my own face there.

I do have to comment on the developer that he surely supports FaceRig very well. He helped me out with some issues I had and he immediately knew where the issue I had came from. BIG THANKS there!

Bottom line, if you're in for pranks and use the 'silly avatars' from FaceRig to call friends and family overseas and such, then FaceRig is for you.

http://steamcommunity.com/app/274920/discussions/2/613935404221058577/#c34096318931030378 or this one: http://steamcommunity.com/app/274920/discussions/2/616198623975827188/

It is highly possible that the redistributables (VS2010 or VS2008) did not install correctly so I suggest re-installing them. Just go to <steamInstallDir>\SteamApps\common\FaceRig\_CommonRedist\ to find them.

Also, you should make sure that the AV installed on your system (if any) is not blocking FaceRig or did not let the full installation (there have been reports of FaceRig.exe missing from the install directory). Check by browsing to <steamInstallDir>\SteamApps\common\FaceRig\Bin\FaceRig.exe.

I would also suggest verifying data integrity (from Steam, go to FaceRig, right click, go to Properties, go to LOCAL FILES tab then click on VERIFY INTEGRITY OF APPLICATION FILES)."

We've personally tested it with a wide range of webcams (from the Logitech c920 to cheap no-brand Chinese webcams.)
Cheap webcams are able to get 30 fps with no problem nowadays. Tracking will work with less than that, but higher fps does mean better tracking quality.
Your camera does NOT need to be 720p for tracking to work properly. It is, however, preferred that you have decent lighting (so that the tracker can SEE your face)
While it is still in development, as most features, lip sync works pretty well. If you calibrate your sound settings to adjust the noise level in your environment and set a slight delay between the sound and the lip movements (very small delay - miliseconds), that significantly improves your results. See this video for a sample of what can be achieved with the lip sync feature :) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iUQSHZ4lmxY"

using a custom picture as a backround also a bit buggy, somtimes itll be foggy or blurry, and you cant see it clearly.

To answer your question: no, you will not be required to pay anything extra for the Classic version of FaceRig when it is officially released or at a later date. Anything you buy in Beta (DLCs/Pro Upgrade) will also transfer to live version.

As for the bugs, I'd like to ask you to please make a post  on our Bugs&Troubleshooting discussion boards http://steamcommunity.com/app/274920/discussions/2/ about the issue of the colors being slightly off.

For the blurriness issue, if you are using DX11, this issue might be already solved in our ""nextversion"" branch update. 

How to get this ""nextversion"" : 
-Open Steam Client. Go to Library -> Software 
-Right mouse click on FaceRig -> Properties 
-Go to BETAS tab, click in the ""Select the beta you would like to opt into:"" drop down, select ""nextversion"" 
-Close window. The FaceRig program will update to the ""nextversion"" branch.

If this doesn't solve the issue, please include it in your post on our discussion boards.

Thank you for using FaceRig and helping us make it better for everyone!"

The application could be used to have fun with friends and family over Skype or for doing a business webinar.

As of this writing, it's still in beta. I just ran some quick tests to see if it would work well for students and teachers.

The only show-stopper for actually using it in a business environment would be that the tracking needs to be a little faster for speech (it's hard to see the lips moving if you talk at normal speed). This probably just requires the developers to nail down sensativity to lip movement.

This is really a very polished and useable product, and I think most people, depending upon their reasons for buying it, will be more than satisfied with their purchase.

USABILITY:  The interface is a little daunting at first, with so very many options for tweaking things, but the documentation is very good and the community is pretty good at answering questions.  This interface ends up being one of the big selling parts of this software because the flexibility (once you've figured out what you are doing) is just amazing.  Here's an example:  At first I was having problems with the avatar keeping it's eyes closed, but between the documentation and forums, I was able to fairly quickly diagnose the problem and fix it.  Basically, I set it to blink automatically.

Also, I was having difficulty getting the program to track my movements, but the documentation clearly showed what I needed to do to my webcam to improve that and now it works like a charm.

EXPRESSIVENESS:  This is my one area of complaint, but it's only a partial complaint.  I should state right away that I haven't tried all the avatars, but I have tried a few including all of the Halloween pack.  I basically found the Halloween pack to not meet my expectations.  I recorded a couple of videos, one with the pumpkin and one with the mummy, and neither one really was expressive enough to let my viewers know what I was feeling.  On the other hand, some of the avatars are incredible, most notably the hamburger.  I did a recording of myself playing ""I am Bread"" and thought that having facerig really made the video better.  Very noticeable expressions and kind of funny too.

I don't have an example of what I was talking about with the Halloween videos because I deleted those, but I can show you what I mean with the other one.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQF9BkR8LnM&index=2&list=PLV8i2f0l80BnmUYGrynMKOyvVcD8ujWT4

You can do it without the black borders on the edges.  I used the wrong recording size because it was my first attempt and I didn't know what I was doing.  But it just looks amazing.  If you forget all the other crap that's going on in the video and just watch the bread, you can almost read it's lips.  Just amazing.  That did take a little work, though, to sync up the sound with the video.

So overall, I say this is a buy, but don't get your heart necessarily set on one particular avatar unless you've already seen someone else using it.

   One thing I can recommend to potential buyers is that you do not try to use it with a cheap camera/eye.   As far as I can tell, not actually being a programmer, the program needs an accurate, not hazy, image and keep those quality camera images flowing at, at least, the specified frame rate to reach its proper capacity of accuracy and ability to keep up as shown in the promotional video.   I say this because I tried it with a cheap $5-ish dollar camera/eye and had poor results from it, but I do not think it was necessarily the program's fault.

Long story short, you definitely need a quality camera/eye to use FaceRig right.

Nice product, they still havent fixed the facial recognition with facial hair but they did fix the big logo from showing up. With Facerig I have noticed that you have to open your mouth and widen your eyes as far as possible for it to be able to imitate you on screen, even then it isnt well detected. If you open your mouth wide while you talk and widen your eyes to the craziest look ever then the program will barely open its eyes and move its mouth in small amounts. It might be good to have some lower level form of voice detection also paired with mouth detection, maybe use them in tandem.

(on a side not there is a typo on the word ""threshold"" for the camera)

pros-
 play as several funny avatars
cool concept

cons-
the expac costs more than the product
the facial recognition doesnt work well with beards (not sure if it works without)

28,12002386,english,"FaceRig lets you take on the looks of many unique characters, and move, blink, talk, and rotate to make the experience even more realistic. 

I see that it's about 1/2 and 1/2 on reviews here, saying it doesn't work or what not. I'll try my best to clear this up. Also, this is NOT a troll review, I see too many of those, and it worries me that people won't get an honest review.

Face tracking works about 90% of the time, as long as you set up your camera in a very precise way, either directly below your monitor in the center, or directly above your monitor at eye level in the center. I feel like people are giving this software bad reviews because they do not take the time to adjust the camera to a precise way, (Which to me is a small price to pay to experience this next generation software) and even so, it still is in beta. 


NOTE: I would also like to say that this doesn't require some fancy camera to track your facial expressions and body movements precisely, I have a 10$ 2MP autofocus Logitec camera, and the tracking works perfectly, if, like i said before, the camera is in the right angle. Also, it is very sensitive when it comes to blurriness, if your webcame is blurry it will NOT, let me emphasize, NOT pick up your movement and facial features.

The details in FaceRig are very noticable, the standard backgrounds are fitting with the character models offered, such as a lava baron in a Volcano, dragon on a mountaintop etc... You can also upload your own backrgrounds.

You can surprise your friends on skype, omeagle, and such with facerig, however it is semi-complicated to do so at the moment, but it is still possible, and to me, very much worth it. 

If you are having trouble with facerig and skype, here is a tutorial on how to use skype with facerig
http://steamcommunity.com/app/274920/discussions/0/34096318834663165/

The customization in FaceRig is still under development, but it is still existant. There are also customizations that have already been ""grouped"" by the facerig team, like instead of Danny (A wolf with clothing) having a brown jacket and a red bandana, there are presets that you can choose to make him have a white bandana and a black jacket.

NOTE: You can upload your own models, but the facerig team has stated that it is almost unususable at the moment, but like i said, still in beta. Also, if you customize the character you are playing as, it will not save when you close out and re-launch FaceRig!

Overall: Great potential, good tracking, and great customization features. 9/10, was very satisfied with the results; I highly reccomend this to anyone with a camera

In all seriousness I'm pretty impressed with how well this works. I just loaded it up with my basic-ass Logitech C270 webcam and it's up and running out of the box. I didn't have to screw with lighting, heck as I type this it's midnight, the only light is that coming off my monitor, and it STILL works surprisingly well. Have not tried it with glasses yet, though.

As far as the quality of the tracking goes, it's far from professional but probably at least $10 worth of fun to record making silly faces or crank calling your Skype friends. The lip synching can be done either from video or from mic input and automatically prioritizes the video if the mic is currently quiet. There's definitely a bit of lag, you're not going to get it to look as good as the guy narrating the trailer, but the lady silently making the faces seems about on par with my experience. The eye tracking is actually really impressive, it picks up my blinking, squinting, and looking around very well.

The avatars that seem to work best are the hamburger and Octodad, because when you inhabit the more human ones the odd bits of twitchy tracking stand out far more. And then there's the nightmarishly unappealing furry avatars, this coming from a guy who's OK with furries. Honestly, my biggest gripe about the program at this point is that it doesn't seem to save ANY of the configurations on exit presently.

Easy to master, initial set of avatars is sufficient, and since the program emulates a webcam it will integrate with virtually every piece of software. 
Even though in beta, no crashes so far, and a Ton-load of instant fun: when my daughter skyped she went: Dad, there's no video.. Respons: wait, I know what's wrong and I'll fix it. And then she was greeted by Fluffo - and melted :)
You can surprise anyone with this - and have some laughs.

There are a few area's of improvement, logical since it's beta, it will be interesting to see how these are adressed:
- props need manual adjustment before they are correctly in place - not everyone is familiar with 3D coordinates.
  (the viking helmet looks great on Fluffo though :) )
- glasses interfere with the detection of the eyes. (Ofcourse this is a challenge to all face-tracking software) 
- I had to use Morphvox pro to change the voice to something fitting for Fluffo. 
- shoulder activity can not be turned on. In stead, when clicking on the corresponding checkbox, the dialog jumped a number of pixels down. Let's hope that gets fixed soon.

But all in all, this piece of software may well become a very big hit - and rightfully so.

The face recognition is a tad touchy and I have a gotee so the characters always seem to smirk even when I try to force a frown- I'm not sure yet if that's on me or if that's the software... I'll have to have a few friends try it to be sure but for the life of me I can't get the one cheek to respond correctly.

Additionally, the software is great and easy to use- it takes the place of a camera so when you have any application that uses video feed you can use that ""camera"" instead to call people on skype, record video, so on and so forth.

One of the biggest complaints I have is the watermark on the software- I understand that I purchased the normal version but I did pay money for it and as shallow of a complaint as it is, when I chat with my friends I don't want a watermark giving away my ""secret"" before I choose to. I hope the developers choose to remove this but I hightly doubt they will. Keep in mind that you can purchase the license software as well and the watermark will still be there.

9,12061838,english,"-- EARLY ACCESS REVIEW! Current review from 13/09/14 --

FaceRig is a program that lets you transcribe your face (over webcam) onto a virtual character on-screen.
It works well in the sense that it works well on any webcam. I have a fairly low-end Logitech C270, which is the benchmark to low-mid level webcams, and it works fine. Only very occasionally have I had weird glitches, like the following: 

http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=312617743 

But they are quickly reset and a more high-end webcam with a better refresh rate shouldn't suffer from this.
As shown in the screenshot, I have noticed a few problems with eyelid tracking, in the sense that one of the eyes either never blinks or appears to be half open, giving your character a ""derpy"" look. I don't hold this against the software however as it makes the characters look cute.

Speaking of characters, they have a wide range of facial expressions but they seem to be incapable of displaying anger. The most you can do to show frustration is to raise your upper lip over your teeth which gives the impression of growling. This is something that the devs could do to add some major credit in my eyes.

It includes the shibe ""Doge"" as well as a anthropomorphised wolf called Danny, etc. There are tons more and you will probably find at least one that you really like. There has already been some modifiability already into the game but it will be some time before furry 3D modellers find this and start making their own models, but I can see a healthy commission market for this ahead.

There aren't really any things I can compare FaceRig to; it's utterly unique in its position and it has a very good deal of potential for the future. I hope that the dev team will quickly move to eliminate the remaining bugs and then start adding some of the promised features as shown in the trailer,
From 13/09/14 (European dating, obviously) the software already appears to be finished.

If you like this, and have a decent webcam, I say go for it!",1410439353,1410637528,True,24,1,0.666734576225280762,0,True,False,False,76561198029111608,427,73,395,0,388,1440357667,,

Here's a quick pros and cons list.

PROS:
Easy to use right after installing (if you have the right light and webcam)
Fun as ****. 
Very nice HD look to the characters. 
Wonderful interface. 

CONS:
Over all just very buggy.(It IS in beta though)
If you have glasses, your eyes don't get picked up as much, if at all.
Lip-syncing is off sometimes. 
Crashes while fixing settings, rarely. 
No skype integration (To my knowledge)

So I would give this beta release a solid 7/10. If you feel like seeing my video, here it is.

-It's hard to set it up like for example: making it look like you are in your room -> it actually needs a photo as a backgroud - setting it up - well - welcome to hell. you need a tutorial. google it lots of times.

Face rig is a cute little program that enables avatar based webcam chat. The avatars provided range from the cuteness of doge to the nightmare fuel that is lord burgore the floating cheese burger. The number of avatars avialble along with customization options  of each is a tad limited currently but agian this is an early release product. I'm hoping for steam workshop support as thist will greatly increase the users possible selection of avatars, props and backgrounds. 

Speaking of backgrounds the program comes with a small selection of stock backgrounds for your avatar to inhabit. 
A dark hallway, a scenic green forest, a futuristic backdrop, and a couple more i haven't tried yet. Course you can also just go with your own room but where is the fun in that?

 The avatar lipsyncs with your words and some facial expressions ( depending on the avatar and expression) ,
the tracking, while decent still needs a touch more work to better help the avatar project facial motions made.
for example the midori-chan (anime based) avatar kept doing a weird half scowl half smirk expression when i was in a neutral expression. 

Facerig sports recording and broadcasting features giving it some ambition in hopes to appeal to people wanting to use the program for the production of videos for youtube or other such sites.  It also takes the need to hunt for third party programs 
out of the picture, though only if it caan match the quaility of the ever popular open broadcast, or ffsplit.

Do note, however, that having a decent microphone and video card is important. the video card because this does do quite a bit of fancy-pantsrendering. The microphone because lipsync is largely based on the sound that goes through it.

If you have a complete **** built-in microphone like I do, you can turn up the sensitivity settings in the software, but my reccommendation is that you just get a better mic.

A microphone is not required for mouth movements to work, however, without it, the software will only reproduce broad mouth shapes, and less of the finer ones.

Also, be aware that there IS a watermark on the video, even if you've bought it. A bit of a nuisance, but, hopefully, it will be removed/ made less annoying in future.

What is truly amazing about this is that normally, to achieve the same results as FaceRig achieves, you will need to have either a special suit on or to stick your face full of tracking orbs. FaceRig just analyzes your face through the webcam, and measures all the points of it without all these expensive Hollywood thingos.

The flaws are minor ones, like if you have a bad webcam, the program will likely not work as you would expect. If your face is blurry, it won't be able to recognize you. The same problem occurs when you move too fast, but that is the same reason.
Sometimes, frowning doesn't completely work, but with the reactions on your friends' faces, I doubt you would ever frown anyway.

Even though I use this for video calls it also has record functionality and a bunch of other features in case you just want to have fun or mess around, my niece and I spent a while messing around with this software too.

This is basically a piece of face-tracking software that superimposes your facial movements onto a variety of avatars and animal-characters.  There are some realistic fantasy/sci-fi type characters and even some that people who are into 'furry' or 'yiffy' might like, and the graphics are absolutely outstanding.  Not to mention you can actually customize the avatar in a huge number of ways.

The game is in beta still so there's some tweaks to be made but as it is there are several advanced options so you can tune the software more to how your face moves to make it look more natural, not that it looks bad in default.  You will need at least a decent webcam for this to work and you need good lighting because shadows on your eyes may make your avatar blink rapidly.

One downside for me is that the software, probably because of my lighting, seems to think my mustache is part of my mouth which has hilarious results.  Also, if you wear glasses, beware of screen glare because that will make your avatar's eyes twitch too, but none of it's bad enough to ruin the fun you'll have with this software.

The software itself is very intuitive and the GUI is very easy to learn quickly and use like a pro, though there are some tedious details if you want to do a lot of facial customizing so the game is more uniform to your actual face.  Also, yes, you have to sit with your webcam directly on your face and keep it there, so if you are animated and make a lot of gestures be aware it would mess with the face-tracking.

Definitely recommend it to anyone who uses Skype Calls or Google Hangouts or Twitch or anything like that, it's a lot of fun and the big list of avatars you can use will keep you and your friends entertained for a while.  At this point I don't think they have voice modulation implemented but I am under the impression that voice modulation will be part of this program later on.

so far, it's still in beta version, and hopes to be in full release by about December 2014. from how often updates are applied and the current wide variety, i would see this as becoming an extremely widely used program, especially if it gets graphical optimisations, as I have heard rumours that it can chew memory.

I'm thrilled with this purchace and believe the price is very generous for what the software offers.",1409278589,1409278589,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198007900013,129,7,188,0,186,1411775119,,
