2018-01-07,0,0,238,False,Recommended,PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds. Battle Royale. Jumping out of planes parachuting into a vast empty state with many great loot and weapon options everywhere. Claiming loot before the 100 other players just like you. Sharing attachments with friends or hording them all for yourself just in case you get that Kar 98k. What's not to like?The physics of PUBG are amazing. Without a doubt the best FPS/TPS experience I have had among the genre recently. Occasionally the vehicles glitch but I'm sure that will be fixed soon. My biggest request recently would be adding an offline play mode with AI as your opponents. This would be great for playing when the servers are down or when you are just trying to figure some basic things out.The biggest issue I've had with the game is the amount of cheaters who have surfaced with the official release of the game. Until the game was officially released it was great fun to hop into a game with friends or by yourself and fight shoot and claw your way to getting that Chicken Dinner. However recently I have not had a single death by someone who wasnt across the map shooting through walls hills trees and cars to headshot me 4 times in a row with a fully automatic rifle.With that problem in mind I am hopeful it is swiftly remedied and I can head back in and enjoy my murderous rampage. All in all definitely worth the $40.00 purchase. Especially should they add in an offline mode and get rid of the aimbot/cheat/hacks.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-06-30,0,0,340,False,Not Recommended,"Game is being ruined by hackers and poor servers. These can be easily fixed with regionlock and such but no they just use our money to release an even work console version. I originally recommended this game but the hackers and worsening performance has flipped me. If the devs atleast put region lock into the game then i'll adjust my review with recommendation but I can't recommend this ""Get ed by Hackers Simulator""(Original Review Below)So much fun especially with friends. It can be an adjustment when you start playing the game if you havent played games like ARMA or H1Z1. If not you'll have no problem with controls. This game and the community constantly throw new experiences at you even if you drop in the same general area at the beginning of matches.

2017-04-11,0,0,122,True,Recommended,i think you should put more time between the areas to close also render the game a little bit better i have a nice computer but i cant afford having the quality in very high and high i think you should to that but in generall is very good,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-04-03,0,0,254,True,Recommended,"Update 5/13/17Optimization has gotten a lot better. Haven't noticed any frame skipping anymore or rubberbanding. In general things have gotten a lot smoother.Still not a huge fan of the circle speed/timings...but I think I can live with it since everything else in the game has become a lot more playable. Also Devs have added cool things like custom matches. Started playing this game more in Duos than Solo and having a lot more fun that way. So I've changed my recommendation from a No to a Yes.Pre 5/13/17Can't recommend this game in its current state. Optimization is insanely bad frame skipping with a top of the line rig... combine that with rubberbanding servers and you sometimes have games where it's near impossible to hit anybody consistently. Audio cues in general are pretty bad as well. The circle timings seem really poorly thought out. So many games I've played running simulator for the entire game. You don't have time to engage in any fights in between phases or you risk dying very quickly in the ""gas"".I know optimization updates and other changes are in the pipeline... so I can revise my recommendation if those prove to improve quality of life across the board. The Battle Royale genre has such potential... but I think PUBG misses the mark just like H1Z1. Looking forward to what Islands of Nyne can bring to the table. This genre really needs a AAA developer polish. If only Valve or Blizzard would pick it up.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

You can choose your playstyle although camping seems to work best atm Small variety of weapons to find that are fairly balancedRoom for improvement Performance rubber banding lag fps Third person view. Why third person view i really dont understand it. I would like it so much to actually not know what is around the corner.

Shut it down and come back when you have a proper product and not something you devs scraped your a$$ with on a keyboard and called it PUBG. All pathetic.

2017-12-20,0,0,7,True,Recommended,It took me a long time to finally give this game a chance and buy it. But I am glad I did as it is extremely fun to play and quite an adrenaline rush at the same time. I was very worried about the bugs that I always hear about and while there might be a few minor ones I wasn't hampered by any. My only gripe is that the game punishes anyone with a computer powerful enough to run it on ultra as the framerate and graphics are fine but my visibility is terrible compared to players with low settings and no foliage. Which means in order to have less of a disadvantage in the game I have to play on reduced settings making the game look worse than I would like.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-01-01,0,0,353,False,Recommended,I just recently changed my review since improvements have been made to the game. The game is now better optimised additional features have been added and the rampid cheating problem has been limited (so far). This is honestly an amazing game. A well deserved win is one of the most rewarding and exhilarating moments in any game I have played. My previous review is listed below to reference my frustration from before. My friends and I started to enjoy this game for a few days until we started getting killed by cheating players. The community seems to believe its Chinese hackers and idgaf who it is this game is not playable if u consider yourself a somewhat competitive player and actually want to try and win the game. Getting shot from 300 yards away by a full auto AR in hip fire happens to frequently for me. Now that kill cams are visible it seems we get killed by blatant hackers about 50% of the time. Also you'll see these hackers with crazy numbers letters or Chinese BS names. So if youre stupid enough to buy the game at its current state (like I was) than look out for that. Have fun taking this game serious with the intent on enjoying a win.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-06-17,0,0,390,False,Not Recommended,ORIGINAL EARLY ACCESS REVIEW Like DayZ on steroids. I can play this and DayZ and get very similar but completely distinct experiences. DayZ is good for the slow burn 4 hours on one constant match 2 hour long battles this is lock n load fast paced action you could be deep in action in 2 minutes. Similar adrenaline rush but far easier to get a payoff. 10/10 for me and i'm looking forward to where this is going. UPDATED REVIEW Probably the best most fun online multiplayer game ever invented.Really really really bad problem with hackers. I am now unhappy because they do not seem to care much about fixing it as a hacker banned is another copy purchased and they LOVE getting points to trade all those lucrative loot items.Until they fix the exponentially growing problem with hackers my review will be marked as negative.

2018-01-07,0,0,570,False,Not Recommended,This is a great game however it is completely ruined by the sheer volume of cheaters. Right now I just queue'd up in squads on North American servers and I had to rejoin 8 different games to get a single teammate that spoke English or Spanish. Every single game is filled with Chinese hackers right now. The game is also incredibly communication dependent and even if by some miracle your Chinese teammates aren't cheating they have such high ping they are completely useless and are unable to communicate any relevent information. That being said the gameplay is extremely fun but its ruined by no region locking and a terrible anti cheat.

2017-05-14,0,0,523,True,Recommended,"So I am very new to pc gaming (xbox guy) so take this review for what it's worth.I'll go ahead and start with the cons.There are some minor bugs.Things like being dead spectating your friends and your friend is shooting someone but there is no gun in his hand. The game will on occasion crash and you have to hit up the task manager to reset it. These bugs have been very far and few between for me and my group of friends that play the game. They are not worth of your consideration unless you want your ""early access"" game to be perfect.The Pros are outstanding.The map is huge and very detailed. It's very refreshing to play a game that isnt ""run and gun"". The guns are real life guns. The sounds of the guns firing are some of the best I've heard. This game is GREAT if you have 3 other friends to play it with.I've read a few negative reviews that peg the game as boring. To me it's one of the more intense games I've played. Any door you open could be someone waiting for you to enter so you always have to be on gaurd. Attacking someone and seeing their teammate start to flank you is nerve racking. This game is one of the best games I've played in a long time.

2018-07-05,0,0,78,False,Not Recommended,"Considering how big this game got in 2017 even with all the negative feedback/reviews I was expecting something half decent. 10 hours in... fairly disappointed. Not from the gameplay balance or anything like that the performance of the game is just horrible. This is clearly a rushed piece of nothing. This game is barely animated the physics are beyond horrible I've only been playing it for a couple of days and the issues are already getting on my nerves. Can't connect to the servers for hours now with what seems to be a typical ""servers are too busy"" error. Not sure how that works seeing as this game's population is a fraction of what it was last year. Honestly not worth the $20 (that's on sale). Gameplay's fun and at least the guns are cartoonish or inaccurate which at least fits my preferences but the issues are ridiculous for a game that's been our for ages (midway through 2018 now). Save yourself the money wait for a better battle royale. Also the studio seems to be more busy with making DLC nonsense other games ""mobile"" or trying to sue Fortnite. Based on what I've seen and read it's highly unlikely this game will ever get significantly better.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-12-25,0,0,19,False,Recommended,So.. PUBG to make a good start yes it is a good game fun and freaking big (which is very nice) but it also has its downsides. First of all the lag and no it is not my fault. I have a steady connection of 200mbps 25mb/s and still just after landing at the map I can't open a door without lagging for 5 seconds which is exactly the time for an enemy to grab a weapon and shoot me. Further more some kills from players in the game are very. very. doubtful getting shot at from 50m and while watching back the deathcam you can't even see your own persona like HOW DID YOU HIT ME??Conclusion It could've been better optimised although I know i dont have the latest hardware some kills are doubtful BUT The map is so beautiful has a lot of detail is huge and with a lot of players check your corners!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-11-06,0,0,1320,False,Not Recommended,well Bluehole has done awesome at ruining a game before release and what they have released for a out of a box game has been horrifiic. Still ended up dealing with hackers quite often. Dont feel like it is as bad as it was before but is still pretty prevelant. The Game play seems extremely Laggy compared to what it was before. On top of it they have changed the gun mechanics so much that it has become beyond to try and kill anyone on top of the lag that happens constantly. I littlerly just finished a game where I was on the inside of a open door enemy came up the stairs to the other side of the door. I stepped into the door way and blasted him square on( hell the barrel was in his stomach) before he had a chance to pull the trigger. Lets face it video game or not that close with a sawed off shotgun should leave a gaping hole in his stomach. But no he was able to let off a couple rounds off a S12 kill me and continue like nothing even happened. I know I hit him cause he did use a health kit after but seriously bluehole figure out your gun mechanics already cause that situation alone was beyond and its not the only one. I realize this isnt real life but seriously a full shotgun round at less then a foot away doesnt kill someone. Give your heads a shake and fix your broken game. youve made enough sales now you should be able to get someone who know what the hell they are actually doing on the job. will try to keep this updated as bluehole fixes some issues but lately it seems like they have broken more then they have fixed and called it a official release. Sad but unfortunatly the way gaming has gone. People dont care just get it out there. COD has been a prime example of this since around 2007 or so. Im not going to look up actual time frames so take that as you will. Unfortunatly we are the poor saps on the other end that hope companys will finally get it right and end up supporting companys that have no business being where they are. Unfortunatly bluehole is falling into this category so I have very little hope this game will get better then it was at certain stages in alpha/beta.

2017-04-12,0,0,91,False,Not Recommended,"This is the first review I have ever given for a title even more so an early access title. I had been seeing a lot online about this game and never thought much of it. ""Its just another king of the hill style game."" Boy was I wrong. This game is something to be appreciated. The combat is fun the gunplay is fun the scavanging to get the gear to find a gun to last is fun. The game looks really good graphically the game plays even better. Granted there are some issues with lag and some very questionable kills. But all in all I kept wanting to dive back in try and make it to the last one alive. Closest I have got is #2. If you are on the fence about the game understand this its King of the Hill nitty gritty plain and simple but theres something to it that makes it unique that draws you in. The future for this game is bright I look forward to what is in store for it. For $29.99 its well worth the money it is arguably more enjoyable than some AAA titles at $59.99. Give it a chance you wont be disappointed.(UPDATE AFTER PATCH 1.0)This game was a good solid game plagued by ridiculous issues however it was still challenging and fun to play. After the 1.0 patch its unplayable. I have tried 4 times now to get into a match. All are met by me being stuck staring at the damn logo while I hear my character being active and the game running.

2017-05-15,0,0,52,True,Recommended,Product received for free. At first I wasn't going to buy this game. I thought it was just a clone of King of the Kill and since I already had that...I didn't feel the need to actually purchace it. But friends were getting into it and raving about how good it was. So I wanted it too. So a friend gifted it to me on easter and I must say...It's way better than h1z1. Here's why Pros Lower tier weapons don't feel utterly useless like h1z1. That's not to say you shouldn't try to get better weapons when you find them but I've found that I could kill someone who has a better weapon without feeling like I'm getting outgunned.The map feels a lot more dynamic. In h1z1 I felt like I was looking at the same stuff over and over and over but in PUBG It always feels new when I go in. That's not to say you won't visit parts look familiar. It's not that dynamic...But it feels nice compared to the map in h1z1. You will get weather changes like rain once in a blue moon. It's nice but can be a bit distracting sometimes or slow your pc down a bit if you have a poopy cpu like me. Vehicles are done right. You don't have to worry about keys or hotwiring cause they are right there. And there are a lot more of them scattered about on the map. You will probably do a lot better in PUBG than in H1Z1. I don't know why but you will. The game feels...polished even though it still has stuff that needs to be worked on. I might just be bad in h1z1 cause I can't make it no where nears the top 10 but I've made it in the top 3 in PUBG. It feels balanced to say the least.There is an actual map. Not a page with red squares to indicate where you are. You can actually see where you're going and even set up waypoints. It's a breath of fresh air.More interactive than H!Z!. You don't get bomb zones when you go near pacakges unless it's in a red zone. Red zones and package drops are seperate and you could get a red zone at any time.Cons Optimization is pretty eh. Then again I have a really computer...So that might be more me? But I do have friends that have more than exceptional pcs and yet they have to run it with the settings lowered. They did come out with a patch for optimzation though. So if your computer is lowwerish end. You can run the game somewhat well with a few stutters and pauses. Hasn't really gotten me killed yet.Small bit of hackers. They're pretty rare and you shouldn't assume you died to one. But they're there.A few glitches. Not anything gamebreaking like H1Z1. You might not even get them.You can get bad drop spwns in certain games.Campers but that's personally me. It's to be expected in this game and you're probably going to need to camp. But it can feel unsatisfying to be on a killing spree and close to winning until you're just offed by a camper. I give it 9/10. It has a extremley small portion of stuff that needs to be fixed but it feels complete for an early access game. You can tell the devs actually care about it and it gives you a better run for your money than H1Z1. So far it's only the game getting prioritized and not a bunch of skins.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-11,0,0,568,False,Recommended,This game is VERY hard to give a score to so as of the 'official release' of PUBG (coming out of early access a.k.a PC version 1.0) this is my review.What did they do right?In the grand scheme of things Bluehole did a PHENOMENAL job in marketing by incorporating Twitch (much better than H1Z1) and the viewablity of this game makes this excellent for streamers and therefore free advertising for their game hence why it is the most played game on steam in less than 10 months. The gameplay (when it works) is also VERY nice to play with and losing a game doesn't feel as bad as you can just hop back into a game within a minute and get right back into the action. It is addicting but they shouldn't excuse of them of...What is wrong with the game?This should of NEVER left early access at this state this game is still a unpolished disaster that has a ridiculous amount of bugs and glitches for a out of early access game. Without a doubt they did this so they could fulfill their promise of coming out of early access within the year. The game is littered with cheaters but they have banned many of them so credit where credit is due.In conclusion this game is fun hell it's addicting as hell BUT lack of paying attention to game breaking bugs and them STILL being there in the 'released' out of early access version is horrid. If they can improve this game by optimizing it as well as paying attention to game breaking bugs PUBG can go VERY far in terms of popularity within the community.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-01-11,0,0,733,False,Not Recommended,Nearly 300hrs played and I love this game. The Battle Royal concept is awsome!! I am overall happy with the update at launch.Unfortunately the fun is all but gone for me and here's a few reasons why#1 I Can't play TPP random duo or squad on NA server unless you basically want to play a round of solo squad with people from anywhere but NA. The number of none NA players on NA servers is just unacceptable. I bet I wouldn't need all ten fingers to count how many NA english speaking matches I have had in random TPP in my 300hrs played.FPP is much better but me personally FPP just doesn't compare to this game in TPP.#2 Solo has really been the only thing that got me to 300hrs but frankly it's a big stinky pile to. I drop in fight for a good loot spot. Get geared out make it to the end just to get hacked or try to shoot a guy thats not there because he's got 200 300ping.(I'd say 6 7 out of every ten replays either show hacking or sever lagging) I'll probably continue to play and stay hopeful that they will work to fix the issues and make this game the Battle Royal King it was meant to be but I know in my heart they will likely drive this game into the dirt as a huge wave of Battle Royal tittles crashes over just in time to fill our empty hearts with more sadness.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-06-18,0,0,237,True,Recommended,"Fun when it works but it rarely works. Seems like every time either PUBG updates or windows updates the game is rendered unplayable until the next patch. It's just another generic ""battle royale"" game honestly. If you've played H1Z1 KOTK you've played this. PUBG just has shinier graphics. Problem is that you can't play with the great graphics because then it puts you at a disadvantage from the other players (including most streamers) playing on low with the brightness cranked up. Things like that will eventually kill off the ""battle royale"" genre even though it's fairly new. I'd suggest waiting for the alpha to be over before throwing away $30 on this.EDIT I found out that my crashing issues have actually been caused by a conflict between PUBG and Bitdefender. I can now reccommend this game simply because it works and is a grerat time despite all the flaws listed above.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

They teleport around and bullets do't hit basically. I enjoy playing this game with friends but the charm is wearing off due to this very poor performance. I hope the developers sort this out soon and it works for release however I am not optimistic it seems that these days developers are happy leaving a game half finished as they have made so much money in early access. I imagine there is a team of 1 or 2 developers working in this now and there will be no real improvements to the PC game they are just popping out small updates so the concolse gamers aren't completely put off.

Those pacthes while be monthly and are all based off the data and feedback of he fans and in my opinion i beleive the devs are truly showing how an early access game should be done.

2017-04-17,0,0,10,True,Recommended,A really fun game that will get better with development! My first 10 games were interesting to say the least..8 deaths by headshot...one death by a guy steping through a wall and one clean game where I made it to number 4 and died from a shot from behind...a headshot lol! Lastest word is they are going to clean up the game by punishing cheaters. My best guess is that about 25% are using aimbots and or map cheats! Still its fun to see the different ways its possible to die!Recommended for a fun play...though if you can't stand cheaters...don't buy!Oh and did I say headshot headshot headshot again and again!!!!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-11-21,0,0,755,True,Recommended,This game is far from perfect but well worth its money for the enjoyment you get.Having played the original PlayerUnknown's Battle Royale Arma III Mod for quite some time I was impressed by just how much better the standalone felt. The gameplay is unique exciting and strategic with all kinds of humor and intensity to be experienced.Surprisingly the game runs quite well on my laptop (A Dell 7559 w/ an i5 6300HQ 8gb of RAM and a GTX960m). I'm able to play at medium settings on average (some high some low) and get smooth competetive performance. Unfortunately there are still a lot of bugs and glitches from time to time but nothing game breaking.I haven't noticed as many hackers as others seem to have but for some reason most of the people on Squad NA servers don't know how to speak English. It's obviously frustrating when you can't communicate with your teammates so I highly suggest plaing with friends or joining a clan for squad and duo matches.In conclusion even in the relatively small amount of time I've played the game I've gotten more than my money's worth of good times. The game has a great pace and (almost) every match is exciting and different. There are cetainly drawback and many things to fix and improve but it'll be a great game!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Wait until a competent developer pushes out another tactical battle royale game on a real engine (frostbite snowdrop idk) that's already built for large maps high player count higher tick rate servers and real anti cheat. Maybe they could have 2 modes a ranked ping locked competetive mode that pays out the currency with some kind of progression system and an unranked open mode that doesn't pay out. Just spit balling here.Honestly I had fun with this game when it was new and fresh but all I see now are its flaws. Rather than doing something about the state of the game the devs seem content to push out content nobody asked for rebalances that break everything and new cosmetics that require the purchase of keys and encourange an influx of cheaters and bots in the game. Whatever new content they put out just isn't fast enough to save this game they simply cannot innovate at the pace of its competitors and they wouldn't have to if the foundation of the game was solid.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I'd be so happy if we could finally get a BattleRoyale without the disgusting ArmA bugs and glitches. Without the disgusting jumping. With proper weapon sounds. With a decent inventory. With a neat control without 4 different running modes. With proper weaponry. Without that silly ""oh it's got to be realistic.""

Netcode is still terrible bugs are everywhere. The fact that PUBGCorp still haven't hired skilled developers to improve the core elements of the game is sad. PREVIOUS REVIEW This is a fantastic game featuring Last Man (or Team) Standing Battle Royale that has been seen in Arma 3 and H1Z1 KOTK. You can go solo or team up against others to fight to the death across a unique map with various weapons &amp pickups. Even though this is early access it has lots of potential for expansion and improvement. Pros Very quick matchmakingLarge but not too sparse mapVariety of weaponsLots of potential for competitive playWell balancedHours of playabilityInventory management is fantasticEasy to learn controlsGood balance between arcade run 'n' gun and slower paced tactical play Cons Occasional sound glitches/stutteringMay require mid to high range graphics card to run optimallyOccasional game crashesNot a whole lot of initial character customizationOverall I would highly recommend this game. The developers are actively updating it to make it a smoother better experience. I've run the game on both a slightly below minimum requirements meeting computer and a higher end rig and they are both playable. However I would recommend having a better than average GPU for optimal gameplay. There is plenty of potential for updates optimization new maps/weapons/vehicles and overall improvements but as it is the game provides hours of fun.

2017-11-10,0,0,271,True,Not Recommended,PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds is a fresh newer survival game that has taken the Steam store by storm. It has really been an enjoyable game and a fresh new experience in which i have spent over 200 hrs on. Originally Battlegrounds was a fun to play early access game which millions of people have participated in it being the top in survival genre. However ever since the weekly and monthly patches has stopped I am sad to say the game has quickly gotten stale. While I appreciate that the devs put a lot of time and work into pushing new content I am concerned that the XBOX version of PUBG has taken priority over say optimization which affects most of the community seeing as the majority of players are on PC. So while I am glad to see PUBG on other consoles I would prefer they fix optimizations and glitches in the game first before starting a venture into XBOX. Overall I would recommend PUBG to people who are looking for a fun enjoyable time with friends That being said since optimization for the game is taking so ridiculously long I have not been enjoying the experience recently so I would not recommend the game as of now.All in All 4/10,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I have no problem playing with people from another country but its hard to win and gets confusing when you cant understand someone. As of right now those are my only complaints.

2018-02-07,0,0,718,False,Recommended,"This game was meant to be the chosen one....I'm so sad about this game. I still recommend it its still really good buuuuuuuttttttttt its a shadow of what it could have been and everyone knows it. Pros Fun for anyone new its exciting addictive fairly well designed progression to high skill cap involves improvisation and decision making. Realism combat. Built upon the foundations of Arma 3 and Arma 2 DayZ mod a good sign for anyone who liked either of those games.Cons Proper progression systems dont exist a proper ranked system doesn't exist hacking is rife every update is ""too little too late"" and the damage is done at this point. Devs suffer from the problem most other ""sudden success"" devs suffer from. Blinded by their success they lose sight forget the core of whats good ruin their own game with ""fixes"" miss every opportunity fail to listen to the community and inevitably kill their own game. It wasnt fortnight bluehole it was you.Dev seemed focused on attacking community at one point. Rather than intelligently mitigating the issues they were screaming to fix they gaslit the communities concerns ney they straight up insulted the community. In fact the hacking issues were the devs fault. This is because in a bid to get some steam market transaction action they added crates with the ONLY cosmetics/progression pathway in the game game cosmetics which players paid a lot for which MASSIVELY incentivised hackers as winning was the fastest way to make money. The anticheat engine failed to meet the demands the game fluctuated in price around the world (making it cheap for hackers to buy) and simple decisions such as region locking could have isolated and contained the hacking whilst anti cheat was developed.Some better community modding could maybe bring the game back to life but really this game needs some serious sudden anti cheat measures and a massive out of nowhere update of maps guns progression systems and mechanics an update that doesnt take 6 months too long to arrive to return to its glory. The most recent update has brought a spark back but it needs more (or maybe it really is too late) and the progression system still has a paywall behind it.9/10 that could have become a near perfect 10 forever but became a disappointing 8.5/10.

2017-04-21,0,0,426,True,Recommended,This is by far the best player v player game since counter strike. The setup the loot the map the tension of getting into the last 100 is extreme. It is early access so expect bugs but having been totally disappointed by DAYZ this has now brought hope to the survival genre. The aim is simple 100 people jump out of a plane you loot stuff and then the circle space starts closing in forcing you all together for a battle to the last player. Its a great concept that has been really well executed and hopefully will just continue to improve.I swear you wont pump as much adrenaline as when you get to last 10 on this its worth it just for that buzz,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-11-12,0,0,319,True,Not Recommended,So let me start by saying that this game is Esports ready means that the game is optimized and runs well enough on mid level systems.This game is still in early access and has reached a level what other games only dream of.The goal in early access is to optimize the game and remove bugs and stuff however the devs just keep making new content and delay the release date.Without a ranking system in place this game is just for casual fun thus making it NOT Esports ready.The game runs well only on high tier systems.Low framerate is common issue along with major bugs.It is fun when you buy it but overall after sometime this game becomes really boring and you switch to Counter Strike.So my opinion.Donot buy this game why? because it is Save the money and buy it another day if it becomes good enough.Thank You for reading the review.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-01-12,0,0,94,False,Not Recommended,Avoid buying this game. It can be fun but there are serious issues with the developers which will ruin the experience for any players looking to have fun. In short any complaints users have or express are dismissed for whatever reason. I tend to avoid this drama but I can't help but notice how ready they are to dismiss and denegrate half of their userbase. If you don't know what I'm talking about then do some research but the essential issue is the developers are conflating geographical complains (distance of users from servers causing serious ping and network issues) with ones based on other factors. I don't want to discuss the details in this review but it is pretty simple to find articles or commentary on it so I would recommend referring to those.Largely though it is seriously odd when developers of a game gloat about how many users they have banned. It is kind of ridiculous when users ask for a mechanism by which users with higher pings be prevented from playing and they are met with hostility by their team.Look the issues never plagued me much mostly because I'm terrible at the game but I cannot support a developer would cannot understand and separate the legitimate complaints from illegitimate ones.These complaints too avoid the shady business practices made by this company wherein they are trying to supress any competition through frivolous legal means or the terrible attitude they have to the regular users compared to the streamer elites. They aren't on the normal users' sides.TL DR It's a pretty good game but the developers are not on their userbase's side. Don't give money to this company.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-03-29,0,0,619,True,Recommended,I want to give this game my recommendation.... I really do because i see it's potential and it will kill any battle royale game that comes out. But as of right now the game is very very very very very poorly optimized. Any encounter you come across will result in FPS drops thus leading to your quick death that you can't even control. Forget picking up items with any kind of ease because you have to wait a full second for it to register to even get anything. So if you are an F key spammer your going to get boned. This game will get my recommendation once they fix those optimization issues. 30 bucks for an early access game with those bugs is ridiculous. Look to pick it up cheaper.If this game was 15 or 20 then it'd be recommended but not for 30.Review Update 4/22/2017Recently added a patch to improve play and it definitely has improved. Would recommend now!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-04-22,0,0,198,True,Recommended,This is my review of PBUG thank you for reading!First let me say..I have not played H1Z1 KOTH Ark SOF or any Battle Royale at all before this review is not influenced by comparisons to what I just stated nor influenced by any expectation I may have had when buying the game cause I did not have any.Now over to the review..Playerunknown's Battlegrounds or PBUG for shorts is a great game for anyone who likes shooting games. This is Battle Royale nothing more nothing less. It is as simple as that and that's one of the reasons why this game is amazing. Second reason? Well matchmaking. It just swoops you into a match on the second no waiting! As I am writing this it is still Early Access but it honestly feels like a complete game (minus the bugs here and there I barely notice them though) hadn't it been for the developers high expectations of their own product. The community also seems to be nice I just registered on the forum and there is a lot of activity discussions and good vibes going around.I like how the game looks the graphics are decent (although I have tweaked them a lot for performance) and the game runs well for a pretty old computer arguably (mine is 3 years old) but as mentioned in the brackets I did tweak a lot of settings and installed ReShade (which is allowed) to get better performance and thus an advantage on the battlefield.I must say the game looks a bit washed out with my current configuration but nothing is more enjoyable than having a game that runs smoothly. Highly recommend you check out the tweak guides for PUBG on Steam!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

It just makes you want to win so bad and when you finally do win you feel incredibly accomplished. Incredible game and it's only going to get better!

Shooting and graphics are EXCELLENT and this game all over H1Z1 though. Music is ok the community is sometimes quite toxic which is really funny to me. There's two maps one in Mexico and one in modern day Romania (not sure if I'm joking). Verdict It's a Mexico/Romania simulator. You run around in a poor empty country stealing to survive and kill everyone in your way while stealing their possessions. Excellent! Also there's a Dacia 1300 in it which is why I think it's set in Romania.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-02-03,0,0,23,False,Not Recommended,Region Lock China does not help in respect of any point. As a Chinese player I quite believe this company would not to do this until the Tencent successfully obtain Chinese gov's operating permission. I know it sounds a little bit ridiculous that most of cheating tools will not functioning after its Chinese Tencent version start operating but we have some examples. Leagues of legends is still meeting cheating and script problems in OC region but marjority of Chinese servers do not have such problems coz Tencent has created its special monitoring addons.I do admitt most of hackers of PUBG are from China and I hate them so much as you guys. Not all Chinese players are hackers and believe me cheating tools are so expensive that 99.9% of players could not afford it (More than 1000USD/mth). So there is the problem who are using cheating tools? In China there are a lot of platform doing the same thing as Twitch. Those guys earn millions of dollars a month by acting as a professional player. Some of them are respected LOL players some are swithched from CS and OW. In just no more than half a year all those players become quite professional and some of them had never played FPS or TPS before! Amazing isnt it?It does not means they are all cheaters one posibility might be that they have some team mates who are using cheating tools to give them directions. As for those solo players on Chinese platforms we should ask Bluehole company Why they had never got banned? Some of operations are not from human clearly! 4 times scope without any vibration? What the are these? Bluehole do you really think they are making ads for you? They are just teaching their audiences to buy cheating tools they are making ads for cheating tools company!!!!Conclusions are quite clear these cheaters are not using any wise or high tech tools. I quite believe there are some business behind the public. You may not agree with me but this is the turth I saw in China.Again not all Chinese players are cheaters. We love this game so much. Locking Chinese region only shows how irresponsible and incompetent the Bluehole is. And those who calling for region lock China do not argue with Chinese players they are not the ones who should be blamed. I can completly understand your feeling coz last week when I nerved myself play one more round PUBG and quickly killed by cheaters I finally uninstall this game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-03-24,0,0,685,False,Not Recommended,"So I originally gave this game a big fat thumbs up due to how amazing the gameplay was and devs seemed at the time... this was around a year ago when Early Access was still here I look at this game now in 2018 and am absolutely appauled by the business decisions and practices made by Blueballs. While the gameplay is still exceptionally fun intense and even down right scary at times everything else has got down hill.First let me get the general positives out of the way The gameplay is very fun if not addicting the graphics are fairly alright... and that's about it. Just because the gameplay is good doesn't make for a good game and I'll explain why.Now the negatives. First of all the sound design in this game is ing awful. Many of the gun shots sound in one direciton even though the person is the total opposite direction. Also apparently your game is only able to pick up a certain amount of gun shots at the same time and so audio will just cheaply cut out on one of the people just so it can load in the audio for other gun shots... in 2018 this is mind ery on how this even exists.Now the REAL negatives for this game (yah as if the issue with the game above wasn't enough). While the gameplay is good... the development team not so much. They have been makng choice after choice for like the last year now. Here is a comprised list of many of the horrible/shady stuff the team has done within the last year. They catered to twitch streamers by locking off custom servers only to them The first real problems arose in August of 2017 when Blueballs was banning non stream snipers due to essentially being on a twitch streamer's stream. After the stream sniping controversy in a bold and move they added paid and locked off crates while STILL in early access They then pushed the game out of early access at least A YEAR if not two early The Miramar map was rushed out of the door and was generally negatively recieved due to being optimized for only long range play styles. The rough terrains and overall ugly look and emptiness of the map led many to try and avoid the new map at all costs. Speaking of miramar the playerbase demanded that a map selection were to be added... after 4 MONTHS they finally released a map selection but then essentially ROLLED IT BACK due to three maps now existing. The devs have not yet fixed many of the cheating problems optimzation or bugs in the game. BUGS GALORE by the way. And finally the icing on the cake... a ing $10.00 season pass. I literally don't have to say anymore comments than that.Final notes As much as I don't even like Fortnite it's clear that Fortnite at least has a dev team thats passionate about their work unlike Blueballs corporation. The MANY poor choices they have made during development and release is essentially what made be thumb this down. On top of that optimization (while slightly improved) is still a problem hacking STILL remains a HUGE problem and there are so many bugs that are not even being resolved due to the dev team spending their ""precious"" time on E SPORTS microtransaction crates and LOCKED OFF CONTENT due to a season pass. It's an absolute shame what is happening to this game and is upsetting to see a once giant fall to its knees during its final days. If the devs decided to actually do something to fix many of these problems I almost gurantee much of the playerbase would come back. Unfortunately its been made clear that the dev team was never meant to develop such a huge and demanding project.PS The Sanhok map is actually really good but unfortunately was almost completely ruined by the season pass that was added in the very same update",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Game runs poorly I was forgiving of the issues because it was in Early Access however that is no longer the case and has not been since Decmber. And since official launch my opinion of this game continues to decline. Poor netcode Poor optimization Poor hit detection Continued loot crate support and unnecessary added content no one asked for (except for Sanhok that map is admittedly really good) while the community begs for actual fixes to the gameFor reference I'm running the game on these specs NVIDIA GTX 1060 6GB VRAM16GB RAM1TB HDD + 256GB SDDIntel i7 7800HQ 2.8GHzIt's not top of the line but it should not be having issues on the graphics settings I have which are Very Low save for Ultra Render Distance Medium Post Processing and Anti Aliasing.The devs clearly don't care about this game only the profits they could make. And it's because of that they are losing to Fortnite. I don't enjoy Fortnite as I feel the building mechanic makes the game imbalanced and too random (also I'm just not good at it). And I'm certainly not the best at PUBG but there are very clear issues that many players have been screaming in BlueHoles face asking to fix please.Players Optimize the game.Bluehole Hmm loot crates?Players No optimize and fix.Bluehole Gun skins?Players Noo.

2018-01-12,0,0,46,False,Recommended,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS is a battle royale game. Yeah that is essentially it. It is crazy fun but if you have Arma III you already have the original PUBG. The only thing you are getting is one game mode that has already been around for 15 years. You also get 2 nice 8x8 km maps but I do not think that is worth $30. However I loved getting back into battle royales and I REALLY like the maps. They feel like they were designed for a battle royale. This is an arma mod standalone done right (I am looking at you DayZ) but it seems like the millions of people who bought the game don't know that you can get ARMA III for $40 with tons of other game modes with 3 cool maps for battle royale. I would recommend getting ARMA III before PUBG I would only recommend PUBG if you have $30 lying around and want to get back into battle royale. I will still recommend it overall because I am judging how fun it is.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-04-22,0,0,44,False,Not Recommended,The game is great and awesome when it works but unfortuantely at least half the time you'll lag at the worst possible moment or crash. My rig can handle the game at high settings I dumbed it down to medium on purpose but it still doesn't help much. My internet is more than plenty as well so hopefully they can get the servers fixed. As of now I feel that 75% of my deaths are just based on lagging or some sort of delay issue. This game was gifted to me but I wouldn't buy it in it's current state for more than $20 though $15 would be my target price.UPDATE It seems the devs have decided to follow a free to play model by charging for things like a battle pass and keys for lootboxes when we already paid for the game. Not to mention that the game still isn't completely optimized it runs a lot better than it did when it first came out but it is not worth spending more money on in its current form.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2018-07-09,0,0,76,False,Not Recommended,This game had such a good potential made a new game with some bugs no big deal and turned in to a multy billion game now you would think they would invest some of that in fixing the somewhat annoying bugs in the game or improving the graphics or something like that what do they actually do ? try to reach their hand out to grab your money as they bang your wife.With all their money they have not invested almost any of it in actually improving the game I liked this game I wanted it to evolve and be better but its own greed was its downfall. I personally don t like fornite that much because I like more realistic shooters like arma or PUBG but their developers are not a bunch of monkeys like PUBGs are they actually care have developer integrity put out frequent updates are just 1000 times more creative and original and the game is free. The normal thing to do when you get a competitor would be to try to improve your products so your customers don t go to the competition well PUBG had a different idea the idea of losing their mind and I just cant express how frustrated I am I cant play this game anymore even if I like it because I despise what they have done and the integrity of the developers.

2018-07-09,0,0,70,False,Not Recommended,"I got this game long before it's release. In fact when it released I only played around 5 games before not touching it again. Maybe I got my fill of the game wile it was still in early access but even so I didn't really play it that much in early access. I returned to the game when it released because I wanted to see how the game was in a (apparent) finished version.The most obvious feature to bash on is the poor optimisation. While the game was going through its development it did feel like that was improving. I noticed less and less frame drops as the game came closer to it's official release. When it actually did release the game actually felt like it was in a playable state in terms of optimisation. However a patch update not long after release suddenly reversed the progress made on the optimization. It's no lie when every one says you need a computer that you would have to break the bank in order to acquire in order to play this game . Even so you could still experience poor performance due to no fault of your computer. The game just isn't optimised for the engine in runs on. From what I hear since that patch that reduced the performance (some how) I hear it still lingers. So I don't know what's happening there.Gameplay wise it's actually pretty sound. It's basic for shooters and works well enough. But most players came to this game for the experience the premise offers. It can keep you entertained for a bit however once you feel you've experienced it all you're almost ready to move on to the next thing. Well at least I was.But probably the biggest turn off for me was it's reward system. Now this might be the common bash on loot boxes however I never really liked the loot boxes even before the game was fully released and started adding paid loot boxes. The loot boxes in this game are the grindiest ones you will ever find in any video game. I almost dare you to find worse (Hold my beer). The odds are stacked so much against you 99 times out of 100 you're going to unlock the same pair of blue skinny jeans each time you open a loot box. Even though I never opened them that many times the reason I strongly believe that was the case was because ever time I was in the lobby before a game started I didn't see players trying to draw attention to themselves because they wanted to show off their cool cosmetics. No I saw every one either wearing the exact same top and trousers or just going naked. Simply because it was loads more interesting then the ""rewards"" the loot boxes gave you.There are probably more interesting items in their paid line up of lootboxes but given loot boxes reputation I reckon most people would avoid them. Plus the amount of reward you get for finishing a game in 1st place isn't even enough to unlock two loot boxes. adding to that there is very little reward for doing more things then just surviving for a long time. If you kill another player it only gives you 20 of the in game currency. Considering you need 700 in order to unlock the first lootbox (and it double with each unlock) There is no point risking killing other players and potentially getting killed yourself when you're better off just surviving. That gives you loads more in game currency and it's easier. But as a consequence it's also loads more boring.In that regard the game does a terrible job in encouraging the player to try and better themselves. Because the rewards for being better is next to nothing. Sure you can try and improve through personal resolve but considering most players don't have that resolve the game will only be able to hold onto those players who do. As a consiquence to that the player base will drop and soon those players who do have the resolve will leave as well. Because there arn't as many players to play against. (battleborne any body? Though I'll give you battleborne happened faster and had more going against it) I've always thought (aside the optimisation) one element the game desperately needs to improve is it's reward system. But that has not changed since I first bought it.Over all I'd say in it's current state this game is a bit more miss then hit. Many of it's early players had high hopes for this game while it was still in early access. But it seems many of the features plays have pretty much demanded be improved hasn't been improved. Laughably the mobile version plays much better and many players who still play PUBG and getting an emulator and are playing that version because it runs better. But this game lost me before that. So I'm likely to never touch this game again. And if I do it's probably because something happened that made every one still playing say ""look they've improved something"" (And I don't think adding new maps count). So far I've only been hearing negatives with what blue hole has been adding to the game. So we'll see on that regard.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Not like we have to survive zombie apocalypse in near future anyway.+ Thx for Price optimization in every region.Cons Optimization. I mean I knew it still in EA but it doesn't have to be this bad. The problem wasn't in FPS though lastest update made it flow already but in rendering. The feels when you have to wait the game to render the door and you have no weapon than your punch. **This is what made me refund.For anyone curious my pc could run GTA V in High 40fps and Watch dogs 2 in High 30 fps. No Render problem. Some Cheated player. Just like CS GO. For SEA Player it's painful to play on AS server which located at HK. You've to deal with that lag and ""China Numba Wan"".

They have shown that the majority of them take money&gt the community and its really disheartning to see. For a game that really brought the battle royale genre to the forefront it has slowly faded with its business practices while other equally good games (ie fortnite i dont enjoy but it is a good game effectively) have passed it MOSTLY because of the difference in devlopers.

2018-01-13,0,0,25,False,Not Recommended,"This game is not worth playing.It fails technically graphically and gameplay wise.Servers are full of people who are incapable of communicating with eachother. If you play in squad you better have 3 mates to play with or else you'll be stuck with chinese players who'll teamkill you. And don't forget if you have to kill them to protect yourself then you're a nasty teamkiller and get banned.Region lock is a necessity for this game but for whatever reason it's not implemented.There are dedicated servers for chinese players but instead they invade western and australian servers and make the game unplayable. The lag on the servers is already stupid but couple in that you get killed by people who're already dead and it's borderline unplayable. Scratch that it should NOT be played.Furthermore this game and its creators should not be supported. They dismiss all criticisms I laid above with ""You're just racist"" and refuse to fix the problems because US and AU players just need to stop hating chinese people who just can't stop cheating and all seem to play in internet cafes. It's not OUR problem that the game is like this and we refuse to fix it no no it's YOUR problem for being a disgusting evil racist. All for not liking people who micspam cheat and teamkill.Any developer that treats the playerbase like this should not be tolerated or funded. The game is buggy broken and in its current state it is closer to a pre alpha release rather than a full game. The creators refuse to fix technical problems with their games refuse to improve their dedicated servers for the game (even after implementing microtransactions and selling over 30 million copies) and then ferry players from those servers over to western servers which are now full of people with ping well over 300. There is no reason why any of this should be taking place and by now we should all assume that it will *NEVER* be fixed and will remain an utter mess until the day they turn off servers.Which I'm predicting to be in 3 years after they release a sequel with even ier optimization and crappier servers.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The developers are unable to provide optimization that they have promised to deliver since the launch of the game. When facing the competition from Fortnite and other battleroyle titles instead of providing better content and optimization to keep playerbases the developer decides to sue Epic games which only shows that Bluehole is a short sighted and short term profit orientated firm. 不建议购买 如果真的想玩大逃杀类型的游戏 今年下半年有很多新游戏会推出 等半年也浪费这98块好 Wouldn't recommand anyone to buy this game because the game is poorly supported and lack of constant content update.

2018-02-14,0,0,489,False,Recommended,Excellent FPS game but is let down by constant game crashes and lots and I relly mean lots of cheaters/hackers!!!Graphics and sound are above average nothing special and there is still some bugs and unbalcened aspects such as red zone boms sounds effects being WAY too loud floating scenery and at times bad sync which can lead to undair deaths.The multiplayer is really the most fun but expect some matches to be very uneventful until the last few circles especially on the Desert map as it is just too big with so many small bits of scenery you can get stuck on while mid gun fight which is downright annoying. There is lots of fun to be had and to be had and nothing beats that sense of achievment after winning your first solo chicken dinner took me over 250 hours and I rate myself as a very average player.8 out of 10.

Mostly claiming that the game is not worth it even though they spent half the price of a tripple A title and played it for a fair amount of time to say 'they got their bang for the buck'.Like in every game that includes a ranking system you will reach a elo that will match u against other good players so at some point you will meet better players that might stomp you.My conclusion If you enjoy BR games and dont like the cartoonish show that is so popular right now then buy this game instead. Especially playing in squads will make the game much more fun to play.

2018-04-17,0,0,2414,False,Recommended,A solid FPS with some faults..Severs are very unreliable as well as the UI. There's tons of RNG involved as well as reaction times and lots of luck. The game has seen tons of changes over the last year and continues to produce lots of content. Very much a good time with friends or even just by yourself. If you enjoy FPS this is a must have. You choose if you want to play agressive or passive. It truely leaves you with many different apporaches in game therefore giving you a very diverse and rich experince in every game.I hope for the continued development and content. I do believe the game was released too early for 1.0 however they seem to be constantly implimenting new content to which I don't think a release ready game should be.Overall I'd recommend this game to anyone who enjoys shooters and survival games.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2018-04-17,0,0,64,False,Recommended,Yes I recommend this game but ONLY when you make the War Mode permanent. Don't have many hours with the game but lets just say about 40hrs was during the public testing for the new mode.Regular mode is very boring in my opinion. Everyone mostly camps and prone with 4x or 8x. Too afraid to come out and play. Thing I like most about War Mode is constant action. 15min games. 200 points. Respawns. I love it! Tired of long dull matches that go to the Top 10 or Top 5 just to get sniped from 200 300m out.Bottom line is War Mode is very addictive and fast paced. If they're really pushing for eSports then this is the ticket. Regular Mode 6/10 Due to slow gameplay through most of the game except when you first land loot and get your first kills.War Mode 10/10 Perfect concept and with more polish within the game I see this as being the new mode to play,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

In my case it was the more i played.The game still has major issues with server stablity and latacy along with tons of minor bugs that could be easily fixed. I'd refer this game to anyone that wants a good rush and don't care about quality (and i mean bear bones quality).this game could in the future become a amazing game but atm it needs lots of work to make it bearable to play. what im basicly getting at is if you want a game that crashes a lot don't load in building and have most of you shots not hit due to bad coding then get this game but if you're not about that life then take you money elsewhere.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-06-10,0,0,636,False,Not Recommended,I really wish I could write a better review of this game. I want to like this game so much more than I actually do. The core concept is fantastic but the developers can't seem to get out of their own way. It seems like each patch that's released fixes one issue and simultaneously breaks three other things. To be fair technical issues are much more noticeable in a game like this due to the higher stakes. When you've been playing for 20 minutes then get killed by someone after you're completely behind cover it stands out. Other times I've been killed by someone who was just peaking out around a corner. Then when I watch the killcam they were sitting there staring at me for 2 3 seconds but never showed up on my screen. There are definitely looting strategy and maneuvering aspects to this game. However this game at its core is a shooter. Over the past year the shooting mechanics have been broken fixed broken fixed and broken again. I'm out of patience for a product that fails to deliver a consistent experience on its core game mechanics. I've actually evangelized several people for this game. I keep telling people to wait it out and that things will get better. At patch #15 common sense has to start playing in a role in my opion.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

And God agreed again. On the fourth day God created man. God said ""Eat sleep play marry and enjoy your life. I'll give you twenty years.""Man said ""What? Only twenty years? Tell you what I'll take my twenty and the forty the cow gave back and the ten the monkey gave back and the ten the dog gave back that makes eighty okay?"" Okay "" said God ""You've got a deal."" So that is why the first twenty years we eat sleep play and enjoy ourselves the next forty years we slave in the sun to support our family the next ten years we do monkey tricks to entertain the grandchildren and the last ten years we sit on the front porch and bark at everyone.

2017-11-17,0,0,657,False,Recommended,"NEW REVIEWHaving gotten back into the game after a considerable break I think I can finally reccomend it. Some things I've learned that will make the game more enjoyable 1. Play with friends (or other people) the solo rounds can be quite boring after a while2. Don't always play to win change up your play style to keep things fresh (go for kills airdrops etc.)3. Don't drop into an area where you won't see anyone. This negates my previous issues of not seeing anyone the whole game and getting killed from out of nowhere. OLD REVIEW I am very unsure of how to feel about this game. Right now hacking poor opimization and server lag makes many matches very frustrating. But I can't help but feel like fixing these current issues will make it THAT much more enjoyable. I've found that once the initial novelty of the game wears off it becomes very tedious. Most of the time spent in the game will be looting and running to stay within the blue circle. When you are repeatedly only seeing 3 5 people a match (if you're lucky) the adrenaline rush you get from the firefights or making it to the top 10 becomes outweighed by the tedium. The worst is when you make it to the top 10 haven't seen a single person and then get sneak attacked out of nowhere. People will say ""git gud"" but I don't care how good you are you cannot watch 360* around you 24/7 it's literally impossible. So while I will probably still play this game in small doses I am disappointed in it overall. It's not a horrible game but it's really not all that enjoyable at this point either.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-03-26,0,0,16,False,Recommended,Now for those chaps who recently started playing this game after starting with the PUBG Mobile game and thought 'hey if the Android game was so much fun maybe the PC game is worth the hype ?' you aren't wrong. It is much harder compared to the mobile game and to be honest one has to practice umpteen times before getting any kills in. Sure there are some kills that make you believe that it can only be the work of a hacker but there are many games where I genuinely had fun coming in the last 8 for a change and understanding the ins and outs of survival in each map. As an added bonus it helps that my GTX 1060 did justice to the graphical prowess of the Unreal Engine and I felt I was in the vast expanse of Far Cry 4 instead of a 8 8 Battle Royale map. A must play for all you fans of this gaming genre and I hope the developers deal with the biggest problem I have noticed in the game hackers. Instead of customizing the skins and the exterior it would be better to hit the problem in it's core so this game can go back to No. 1 again. Sincerely A loyal fan.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-03-25,0,0,90,False,Not Recommended,This game first released as a buggy poorly optimized mess...about a year later things have changed. Now its a poorly optimized mess with microtransactions and an even worse console port. It's only redeeming factor is that RIGHT NOW on 1/14/17 you can sell a certain crate for like $5. Once this hype dies however I see no point to playing this game anymore due to my pros cons list.Also I've noticed that most of the positive reviews of this game are kind of joke reviews where the person makes fun of the games terrible quality but still gives it a positive review for some reason... I guess its like one of those jokes where its soo bad that its funny in its own way.Pros Never takes more than 2 seconds to find a gameGives you a nice shot of adreneline when you get into fights and get close to end gameCons Looks pretty terrible (some may try to defend it but in all honesty everyone know this game looks like crap)microtransactions (also there is currently no way to choose which case to buy. Microtransactions wouldnt be a problem if I could just choose to buy the crates that dont require actual money to open. Its common sense really I dont want to have to spend 3 4 games worth of BP to buy a crate I can't even open period.)Unless you have top teir guns everyone feels like a tankPoorly optomized (fps should scale to your GPU I have a 1080 ti and I only get around 5 8+ fps when compared to my other computer that has a 1070 when they are on the same settings looking at the same view. If the game were optomized I would expect to see at least a 20% frame jump)BIGGEST COMPLAINT There is no progression system. No reward for spending time on this game other then maybe some good highlight reels of you winning or something. Bluehole...give me a reason to play your game....thats all I'm asking. Crates don't count unless you follow in H1Z1's footsteps and make almost every skin from crates look really good. I havent spent a dime on H1Z1 and my character still looks frekin awesome where on PUBG you'd be lucky to get a hat instead of another pair of plane jeans or something stupid like that.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-01-14,0,0,8,False,Recommended,Product received for free. Pros It's a pretty nice game which is built from the ground up compared to it's origins.Solid gameplay which is rather fun as long as you're in a group from my experience. Co op feels very rewarding and even when you lose it's pretty okay. A large array of strategies you can take from running over people with vehicles to hiding away until the roster of enemies dwindles enough. The level of strategy is interesting and doesn't get old very fast from what I've seen. Cons When playing solo it can get pretty bitter from time to time. The requirements to obtain lootboxes is pretty steep for beginners with 700 BP being well over 15 matches at least if you don't get lucky and score higher rankings. Makes customization rather annoying especially when you're playing 15+ matches for something you probably don't want. If you play to win expect to have an unpleasant experience. On that topic there seems to be a lotta trolls and hackers in the game. I had to mute public voice chat because people would blair loud music and make rude statements 95% of the time. Additionally aimbot is SUPER common with random cases where there'll be 20 left after the first circle and just a list of people some random guy with an Uzi headshotted in 3 seconds. I'd say the game is okay. There are plenty of better games but if you want a nice team game PUBG is a good title.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Do you like getting shot when you've been behind cover for 2 seconds? Neither do I. Beyond that this was a great game with a great feel ruined by disgusting microtransactions.

2017-11-04,0,0,432,True,Not Recommended,Cheaters are ruining this game and the devs are doing nothing about it. There is at least one cheater in every game I've played today. Someone that works at Bluehole is probably selling aimbots to make more money. They do not care about the quality of the game. Vaulting was suppose to come into the game 4 months ago but they've delayed it yet again. They didn't do a Halloween special because they were working on the cheater problem but it has only gotten worse. If this issue isn't fixed when the full game releases PUBG will be dead in a matter of months. Fortnite is doing so much better in the month or so it has been out and is doing a much better job at satisfying the community.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-03-17,0,0,459,False,Not Recommended,"Original Comment Summary of the GamePlayerUnknown BattleGrounds or otherwise known as PubG is one of the most explosive games to come of all time. The Battle Royale genre has never been so enthusiastic about a game so large and free. The game that came out in Mid December of 2017 is a great game everyone should at least play a few times over. The shooting is done fantastic and could not be better with the current variety of weapons and the new scopes that came earlier this week as of March 2018. Their roadmap is fantastic and gives the players a resource to speculate the upcoming updates. The game is exciting at parts and dull at others but that was the intent for the design of the map. As well as the other 2 new maps coming in mid late 2018 and maybe in early 2019 from my speculation I am excited to see how this game will come through development in the coming years.Before 7/16/18 Rating7/10P.S.(If there are any typos please tell me. Thank you!)Didn't mean to make this a long review but sorry if it ended up being one. Had to go through all the major points in this game that I think are the most critical.More Critical Thoughts as of 7/16/18 Note Before whining in the comments below this is suprisingly my own opinionAs of late PubG has been by far one of the worst experiences for an avid gamer such as myself. Deciding on taking the route of EA PubG Corp wants to focus more on money than their own playerbase.Pros Sanhok This has easily been one of the most enjoyable maps I've played since the release of the game. This breathes a new feeling into the game in which every drop you do is a hotdrop or is filled with players. Not only does the map feel unique the devs actually listened to how the players wanted the map and enjoyed the feedback from the map. Lets hope the Winter Map does the same thing.Cons Battle Pass One of the largest disappointing ""content"" updates was the addition of the battle pass. Much like Fortnite's Battle Pass PubG offers less content and less cosmetics than what Fortnite's System does for a heavier price tag. The Battle Pass has had more issues than their own servers at this point and when it releases for the second time later down the road we can only HOPE for better. Desync I don't know how but god damn it PubG you sure ed up this time. Desync was an issue back when the gun changes released. Eventually they fixed it but boy o' boy do they sure hate their customers. I don't know which dev thought it was a great idea to add this back into the game but you obviously love shooting players behind walls you cheeky . Hit Registration Oh what to say what to say. This great peice of artwork is what happens when the devs are lazy enough to add the most simple mechanics from the UE into their own game. If you've played this game for more than 10 hours you'll know that hit registration in this game is utter t. Not only can you hit players in the hand and do mediocre amounts of damage but tihs can happen multiple times over the course of you just trying to win a gunfight. Bullet Blocking A system that was never introduced to this game even though they wanted to fix it over 6 months ago. I don't know why this system has yet to be tested or even made but if you want a balanced game you sure aren't doing it right. SMG Buff/b The weapon before the buff was already pretty good but now you want to add no recoil to the UMP and give it more damage? I thought the weapon balancing update was supposed to reduce overpowered weapons. Warmode This gamemode shows how out of touch the PubG devs are with their community by adding the same garbage gamemode back into the next week of ""content"". Just a sorry excuse for trying players to rejoin their game to give it another shot. Latency Server Sided Issue that I know can't be fixed instantly but this has been a problem since I've started playing back in December. Its unreal that they can let a problem go on for so long and have yet to be fixed. FPS/Stuttering This game is by far not for lower end systems. Hell I can barley play on a 1060 6GB. The FPS issue has been there since the beginning but has declined in the recent March update in which I hope they continue to improve as it can still be a problem here and there but overall it needs to be one of their number 1 priorities besides cheaters.After 7/16/18 Rating4/10As much as I enjoy this game for newer players coming into the game wait until the devs get their together and fix their game. As much as I love this game the devs break the game with every update and don't even attempt to fix the bugs anymore. These hotpatches that are half a gigabyte in size is an absolute joke and the way the PubG team is handling this game makes me sick. They imply they care but they are just slowly letting their game die off while Fortnite is actually trying new stuff even though I'm not into it. As much as PubG hates the customers this will still be one of the best experiences of a game before the Desync happened.(I will change my recommendation if they fix this game)",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-05-23,0,0,1364,False,Not Recommended,The idea behind the game is great but almost nothing works as intended. Each patch they push out has microtransactions but very few bug fixes. If your character is turning in any way it is very difficult to tell where sounds are coming from. There is frequent desync and the hit registration is inconsistent at best. Although this game is a Full Release it is actually still an early access title. Once they have added their intended content hopefully they will start working on a sequel with an entirely different engine. Until then play this game only if you are willing to accept one out of three games to be ended early by an unintended game mechanic.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-03-23,0,0,92,True,Recommended,I almost never post reviews but this game is worth it. Many people think this game is overpriced well in its current state it is. But once this game has mod support and there are multiple maps it will be underpriced and could easily be worth $40 $60.Many people complain about performance and they rightly should but it is early access. Some people have lower end computers and play it fine while others with higher end computers struggle at 20 fps. This game will keep getting optimized until release and it is one of the main points on the dev's plate. Personally I have a mid level computer and have a fairly consistent 50 80fps.GAMEPLAY The gameplay is great a perfect mix between h1z1's arcade feel with Arma 3's realistic approach and gunplay. If you like Arma 3 s battle royal I highly suggest this game if you are sick of h1z1 I would suggest this game. Coming from Arma 3 the gunplay feels exactly the same and many of the same mechanics but without all of the random BS you can live without for a battle royal game. The queue is almost instant (for me a big selling point). The gameplay is a bit difficult to explain if you haven t played Arma so before making a decision I would suggest watching a match to better understand the game as a whole.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

If you purchase this game willing to assist the devs in reporting issues so they can better fix this game then here ya go. Welcome to Early Access.I've noticed when I first got in there was some interesting ""Hiccups"" as far as graphics. This was mainly when I got into the lobby. Sometimes it would happen during game play. Speaking of game play it is enjoyable. Unlike KoTK I can at least 1 kill almost every match (yea yea I suck). There is some ""Lag"" when I go to pick up equipment and weapons which in a situation of being RIGHT next to someone makes things almost yell worthy. People seem to complain about the price. $30 is worth this game. Seriously if you help the Dev's who have ties in Arma Battleroyal building this is truely worth each and every penny thus far. I'm looking forward to seeing this game improve and get better.In closing as of right now.

There is no addiction story.In reallity I have spent more than 100hrs killing people and for argument sake i will consider myself a subject matter expert. During my 100hrs i learned a few lessons and for you (a perspective buyer) i will list them! Lesson 1. Never underestimate the pan. This tool is often overlooked but can be used to kill protect and make a cool ""thoink!' sound. Lesson 2. ""Nehow"" It is no secret that there are literally tons of chinese players but that is not always a bad thing.They can be pretty cool (even if you can't understand them) and they usually know where all the good stuff is so if you run into some of these players just say ""Nehow"" and let them do their thing. Lesson 3. Headshots This one is obvious headshots... you get it?... Yeah you get it. Lesson 4. Be the Legend. Any time you are playing with people you dont know it is your time to shine. These matches don't really matter so just run out do some crazy S %! and revel in how your teamates freak out. Worst case senario you die but in the end being a legend is more important. Lesson 5. Hackers!!.exe Lets be honest there are very few hackers on this game and if you are unfortunate enough to run into one well that sucks tough the ods are somewhere in the ballpark of 1/715 562. If you think you were killed by a hacker just report it after death otherwise you are probably just less skilled than the guy who got a headshot on you from 600m away behind a wall with a revolver. it happens! Lesson 6. Fun In the end this game was intended for recreation. There are some who dedicate their entire life to being number one on the leader board (power to them) but if thats not you just have fun.

However due to issues' like how servers run and how the game engine has a bit of a rought time it makes us forget about all these good aspects as we cant actually enjoy them. Personally id rather Bluehole made improvements to the mechanics of the game rather than make another map right now. Its better to keep people playing on the same old maps then add news ones because at the end of the day no one will care about the new map as it will have the same server issues' as the other ones.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-02-19,0,0,297,False,Not Recommended,"Great game but it has its downsides. The game play is fun because it can go from 0 100 in a few seconds but the real issue is the consistent cheating especially from the Chinese and the developers have openly admitted that 98% of the cheaters are Chinese but it would be considered ""xenophobic"" to region lock the servers. Personally I think this game is fun especially if you play with friends but if you don't have any friends you'll just spend hours frustrated with the cheating. Lobby chat though is probably the only reason why I'm going to give this game a positive review. It's like listening to the greatest display of mental illness.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-05-31,0,0,276,True,Recommended,I love this game.I REALLY love this game. I have a ton of fun on this game.It's incredibly fun dropping in on the military base finding a shotgun and then gunning down 4 people getting to end game and getting snipped in the head as you have to run across an open field because you got RNG screwed by the ever collapsing circle. Honestly that's fun! It's that little rush of adrenaline that you have knowing that IF you can get across that field you are going to obliterate that Sniper with your UMP9.With all of that said there are issues.The servers are a hot mess right now you will get a great server that responds really well and then the next server you drop 5 shotgun hits on a guy only to be killed by a hip fire headshot from the same guy who should be dead.The game isn't optimized at all and honestly that's not a huge deal. I get about 30 FPS and 22 27 FPS in large towns. I've never noticed this affecting my game play though.So buy at your own risk. But so far the devs contrary to some reviews actually do seem very responsive. There are weekly patches to clean small things up and monthly patches to fix bigger issues. End of June is when they are targeting a server fix to clean up some of the lag issues. If you're questioning if you should buy this game and you're on the fence you may just want to wait until the end of June.However I still enjoy it.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-05-31,0,0,564,True,Recommended,So let me start by saying that this game is awesome. Just so you understand my state of mind I came from another BR game and this one has everything I was looking for. Stealthy tactical violence of action tense battles oh crap moments and not to mention is effin battle royale!Please keep in mind the game is still early access and bugs will still exist. That said I am going to proceed with this review as it being early access.My friend tried to play this game and had a hard time. I suspect it was due to his rig and not the game.My Rig i5 6600k16GB 1600 RAMSSDGTX 980 Ti 6GB RAMMy computer plays the game just fine on Ultra. I get about 60 80 FPS with this setting. I have not changed anything in the settings. The game crashes every now and again but for the most part no crashing.My other rigFX 835016GB 1600 RAMSSDR9 390 4GBThe game plays just fine on High settings (was auto set that way). Although I had some trouble after I adjusted everything to medium and changed a couple other settings to low. After the change my game crashes alot. This isn't really that much of an issue. I know someone else with the same video card (R9 390) and they have alot of crashes as well. Now for the Gameplay The last round I played was nothing but running away from the blue circle (don't know what that is? It slowly kills you) and using all my meds to stay alive. I crossed into the good zone and ran into someone camping it waiting for people to cross. I was pretty much instantly killed. This does happen alot on this game but don't let it discourage you. Just click play again and keep it moving.Majority of my games are fairly eventful and I get at least 2 4 kills. I would say most of the kills in the game are opportunistic in nature and from people not checking behind them or their surroundings. The best part of this game is playing in Squads. Squad play goes alot like solo but its way more fun. Lots of teamwork and strategy going on. Nothing like taking out a hole squad by yourself and then reviving your hole team!Summary buy this game if you think your computer will run it. I would seek out forums to see how other similar computers do on this game before taking the plunge. Thanks JimminieCrikets,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Now I hop on today only to get a crate that is locked!!!!!!!!! now you have to buy keys to unlock creates???? WTF is up with that. Not only did I buy the game twice now i have to buy keys to unlock certain crates. This is not a free to play game no one should have to buy anything unless its DLC with new maps or characters. Little about that. Not our faults you decided to sell the game for 30 and ended up not having money in the end so now you guys are finding a way to raw dog us with no lube.

As always the #3 is very overpowerd. It's also badly optimized and a lot (fps). There's a lot of t factors like you clearly aim above the ground or ledge but still the bullets go into the object infront of you(DickShots). Bullets travel at a speed up to 900km/h and still you have to ""lead"" your shots quite a bit at just 100meters. Do not buy this game unless you want to get aids and cancer at the same time.

Not only Chinese people from China but just hackers in general there are too many of them for someone to enjoy a match 3.5/5 times I get a hacker in the match.2nd problem The Lag. Yes it is bearable but there are some moments where you pick up items and it doesnt go into your inventory causing a player to die cause they did not pick up a weapon or something else.3rd problem Fps. Yes it has been better optimized but I still get really horrible fps spikes from time to time ( Even more so after Patch 1.0) &lt I am not sure whether this is due to my PC or something else. Feel free to give your review about it in the comments&gt I also feel that the game can be opitimized to be even better for better fps.Final Notes I don't think we should region lock any country from playing but instead improve on the banning and anti cheating system (Make it harsh or something along those lines)(Please rate the review if you find it helpful so we can help other players or people wanting to buy this game and ADD ON to this review in the comments I would love to see everyones opinion),PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

BUT not only were no bugs fixed old bugs suddenly came back with new once as well. I have now been on their forum and twitter and tried to get someone who can confirm that they know about the bugs and that they are working on them to no avail.The game worked better in beta than it does now and the day the game got its full release the PUBG team went silent. I belive they know what storm they made and just want to make another porly made game to earn money and just jump on to the next project at hand. But first they have to release the OH so precious ""pay to get"" loot crate so they can milk even more money from us.Thank you for being SO responsive when players document bugs.

It feels like you are tied down to the ground and every move you make something just feels off. I will say so far out of all other BR games this is still king I just wish some things were fixed. This is a game that is an insult to its fans and player base they promise optimazation and tons of content but all they can do is be greedy and ad expensive and ugly camos. This game is still borderline unplayable on a vega 64 and optimazation has never come. They took something great and imediatly ruined it.

2017-11-11,0,0,586,True,Not Recommended,I do not ever write reviews but recently I have felt the urge to do so this game is without a doubt a unique experience in terms of gameplay however there are a great amount of issues that need to be addressed The amount of hackers/cheaters on servers is laughable It is so unoptimized that playing on a computer with the highest calibre still doesn't cut it An influx of chinese players migrating to OCE NA &amp EU servers (most hackers i've seen are chinese) The lobby menu is unresponsive 65% of times Bizzare game mechanics (on certain terrains vehicles etc) Infrequent updates and maintainence for servers and issuesThere are more but I can't think of it on the top of my head. This game used to be so much fun but now I feel as though it is dying out which is upsetting due to the fact of the of the fundamental gameplay design being unique It feels like Bluehole is not paying enough attention to the major issues but instead adding microtransactions and maps. To conclude blueballs get your ing together and fix it other than that I would not bother wasting money on this game until those issues have been fixed.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-11-24,0,0,73,True,Not Recommended,The game itself is awesome. The idea has been done before but there's something that draws you to play this. I do have some issue with it though. There is no region lock so most of the time you get some other region players (like China). Most of the time its ok but sometimes they do kill me for my gears. Another problem is the aiming (to me it seems). Sometimes you can unload a whole entire clip of bullets and not hit them at close range. And I'm talking about within the same house. Another one is the clothes spawn. Clothes does nothing for the most part so why not limit them and increase weapon spawn. I wish there was more maps. It gets tiring playing the same one over and over again.Overall if you can get past these few issues then get it. I believe its more fun with friends than going solo.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

At least 5 15 AFKs in every game instead of 100 Alive per game it's more like 80 90 Alive. Requires an Above Average PC to run 60 FPS at decent resolution / quality.Counter Attack To CONS Overall if you wanna have a great time playing this game. Just play with your friends you'll enjoy the game WAY more and usually the cons that are in this game fade away while playing with your friends. It may not seem like much but when you're playing with a squad full of friends that actually speak English and can communicate you tend to look away from the cons a lot more.

It's hard to master but easy to learn (basically drop loot and kill). Getting a chicken dinner is probably the best achievement you'll get in this game.

Between lag inconsistent hit registration and the general buggy nature of the game there is almost no desire left for me to play this game after the initial novelty wore off. And instead of fixing bugs this developer is more concerned with adding more micro transactions an obvious money grab given that their game still feels like a beta or worse. The in game friends list and invite system doesn't even work right. I can be in a party with my friends and they still show up as offline in my list. I can still buy ""random crates"" with battlepoints though. Granted practically every other case requires a $2.50 key to open....thankfully there are no bugs in the game where there is money to be made.

2017-09-16,0,0,92,False,Not Recommended,The game is rampant with cheaters and really toxic players in matchmaking you have no chance with being paired with an english speaking player but hey that happens in online games the devs went on banning runs through out the early days banning people for steam sniping or team killing but now they don't even lift a finger to try and ease the hacking if you live in OC or AS then you're pretty much done for due to the huge ammount of hackers from china (not saying they all do it but there has been a huge bump in cheating since its release there) the new map Miramar takes three times longer to load then the old one does there are loot crates that require keys in them and some that don't but for real the second they become a bit less sought after that free one will become worthless.There are some good points about this game the rush you get when you're pinned down or when you're crawling around at the #10 spot the guns are also pretty satisfying and when you play with friends it is extremely fun but the cheaters and the useless anti cheat just makes it so un fun.I don't hate this game I don't think anyone who put more then 50 hours into this really does its just that these new problems that PUBG Corp won't fix really drags down this legitimatly fun game which is a shame since the new fixes to the hit detection and BP system seem to be pretty legit but the cheating really needs to be dealt with and china needs their own server not saying region lock but I think their own server would really bring this problem down since the sheer ammount of players there need their own space that the AS and OC servers can't give them.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-01-15,0,0,590,False,Not Recommended,I love this game but there is no way I can moraly endorse it. There are so many problems and what encouraged me to write this review is not what I've seen in other reviews about cheating and desync and lag and other BS. Those issues have been made aware of and if the devs arent already trying to fix them they probably never will. But two days ago halfway through a match all game audio for me disapeared and no the game is not muted and I've looked through my computer settings for the audio output and mixer says its not sending any noise so in gam settings are not muted and reinstalling hasnt done anything and well I've played a few games without audio since then and it is very difficult but not unplayable what is unacceptable though is that this can happen at all and not be fixable. I looked on forums and there have been multiple cases some caused by ignorance and other cases like mine unsolved and I will continue to play the game when I feel like it untill it miraculously works at some point because thats how all the other probles ive had went away they didn't.I cannot ecomend this game for $30 because I don't think its worth that much and honesty should still be in beta.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

There is still lots of server lag (plane goes forward and back etc) and the game stutters often. For a while the buggy nature of this game was part of the charm but given the sales numbers and amount of time on the market its becoming unacceptable. Adding on to that every update seems to be just a cash grab. Every single crate needs a key the event pass was worthless and its becoming clear that all they care about is money. I really liked this game but unfortunately without the devs giving more TLC to how the game runs I think I'm out. ORIGINAL REVIEW This game keeps getting better. It seems they've cut down on the cheaters a bit I'm not seeing nearly as much as I have in the past.

2017-05-26,0,0,201,False,Not Recommended,In early access this game showed a lot of promise. It was the first BR game my friends and I tried and we loved it. Unfortunately there have always been some pretty poor hit registration and netcode. The game is buggy with people killing you around corners or soaking up several shotgun spreads to the face being a frequent occurrence. This isn't helped by the mechanics being generally quite clunky with not a lot being done about that (they added the vaulting stuff which helps) and the performance being patchy at best.Rather than fix this the developers have constantly released crates and cosmetic items to milk more cash out of people.Overall I don't feel compelled to keep playing and would recommend you look for alternative BRs that care about maintaining the game rather than adding more rubbish to try and make a quick buck.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Also a reduction in looting time or at least some optimisation i.e. if you play in a squad of 4 have more loot available as people won't be killing each other as much (4 times less...). finally have a chill mode and a competitive mode I'm not sure this has been implemented yet but a ladder would be nice.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-04-14,0,0,70,False,Recommended,This game has a lot of ups and downs but the developers have been really pushing to make this game better and better with every update they've released lately and it's been working in my opinion.

2018-04-14,0,0,273,False,Recommended,"Lemme get this out of the way. I love PUBG. It's a wonderful way to meet people learn new phrases like ""ur mum gay"" and check that your blood pressure medication is working.The gunplay is phenomenal and quite realistic. Just like in an actual combat setting 9/10 times I die from a suppressed sniper two counties over and the other time is because I went flying first into a tree after my motorcycle hit a 0.00001mm pebble and went from 100km/h to a dead stop instantly. It's quite true to life.The circle also represents the fact that on any given day 1/100th of the people are going to come out on top because they start where they need to end up and they coast through on easy mode with the game literally handing them everything they need in a cloud of red smoke occasionally placing a boot print on someone's face when they get too near. Meanwhile everyone else has to scratch for the barest of essentials and fight over the single spot where they can contend with Fate's Chosen One.My only complaint is these two guys who follow me everywhere. Sometimes they're in a big team rarely they're solo but usually they're in a group of about four in solo mode. Their usernames always change but I can tell it's the same two people because they're always talking to one another. They're apparently called ""Cow Knee Ma"" and ""Chai Nanum Bawun"" or something close. They're in roughly 3/4 of my games and they must have some secret DLC because sometimes they move like greased lightning or have Superman style X Ray vision scopes.Anyway PUBG is a great game so long as you can get past the few small issues.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-01-21,0,0,286,False,Recommended,"I am updating my review since I returned to the game recently and many of my issues with this game have been cleared up. This by no means states that they have done EVERYTHING but they have done enough that I believe I can recommend this game now.The early game issues stated in my previous review have been lessened. I am now able to load in land and am much more likely to consider landing aggressively now that I can fight early on (most of the time).The circle has become signifanctly less of an overbearing problem with it's previous high speed short timer and heavy damage. The travel speed of the circle has been reduced significantly early on so it doesnt feel (as much) like you are just getting eternally f**ked by the circle. The timers have been altered somewhat as well. The damage is still as heavy as it was before but I am fine with that personally.I am very happy that the developers took the time needed in order to fix the vast majority of issues when it comes to cheating. I feel this has helped the health of the game in far many more ways than I believe the developers realized.This game feels far more like it is a released game especially with the recent addition with the ""event"" game modes which I absolutely love as a concept. I hope that this rotating game mode is constantly active and rotating between different modes rather than how some other games do their special modes. Example of this 'A special game mode but only on weekends'. I would much rather see each event mode be constantly available until a new/rotated event replaces it.I still have a few concerns and complaints however. The biggest complaint at the moment being the implementation of ""Teaming"" being a reportable offense. While I can somewhat understand this being implemented for pros and streamers. I find that this takes away from what makes PUBG organic. If 2 squads of people meet in the battlegrounds and instead of instantly shooting eachother decide to make a peace and work together until the final battle I believe they should be able to. The threat of betrayal is always present and they will have to fight eachother eventually. Added on top of the extremely low chance of 2 groups have friends happening to be in the same game together. This seems like a negative aspect on something that would make the game far more interesting all because of the very few.Lastly something I didn't consider but am pleasently surprised about. With the rise of other games taking away some of PUBG's spotlight this game has started developing an interesting lax and fun community. I have been having a lot more fun playing this game with random people rather than just my friends. I believe this is the shining point for me to enjoy playing this game again.Overall I believe this game is now worth buying. I just hope the continue to improve and fix the issues I have that have yet to be addressed.I left my previous review intact below.Previous Review(""I love this game. I honestly do. I really want this game to do well but it first needs to do better. There are more bugs and issues with this game than modern day Triple A titles.""""The early game being one of the most painful experiences you can have.First you get stuck because the parachute fails to register that you landed. Then wait there for 3 5 seconds until the game decides to give you mercy and allow you to cut the line. After is a rapid run to grab guns that the game is unable to register being picked up. There is nothing more frustrating than being on a time restraint and clicking 17 times to pick up a gun that only appears in your inventory after death. Not to mention the intense latency that occurs in any early game combat.""""General issues such as randomly dying while walking and the game claiming you ""died by falling"" and being randomly ejected from a moving vehicle.""""I also have several issues with things like the circle but that is much more understandable and necessary.""""I don't feel like going too deep into the loot boxes but I do feel like the latest 'key required' box heavily pushes a cash grab image.""""This game should not be released from early access in its current state. All praise from people that are happy that it came out of early access are people that just have a bad taste for the title ""Early Access"".""""Bottomline I can not recommend this game at this time. Not until some of these blatant problems are solved in at least some capacity.""""Side note there are still many issues that I don't have on my mind at the time of writing this review but I will be interested in updating this when something significant occurs."")",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I opened PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS and it gave me an option to join the same game again. Yes! I was very excited. When I loaded into the game I saw something strange. I was stuck underwater.

The game becomes a running simulator until you run across a guy camping who originally parachuted within the circle who has had time to arm himself well. Basically I was the camper guy and the unequipped person charging me in the house fleeing the forcefield only had a smoke grenade and his fists. We stood face to face knowing what was about to happen. I dropped my weapons and raised my hands he tossed his smoke to fill the room and we settled things like men. Blind men but men nonetheless. After the smoke cleared his body was laying on the floor and my health was low as the forcefield was now way past my position and my health was bleeding out. I starting looting him just to find out there was a skillet on the ground by his body then I was killed by a stray bullet to the that originated from a dispute I could hear going on several houses down through the balcony door.0/10 should've equipped the pan to cover my faster.Meh kinda fun sometimes...,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The game can be slow but thats just like H1Z1 and any game in this category. It has a full range of weapons to use rather than H1Z1 for example where it mainly is one or two. I'd also say the community is much better and the game is updated regularly to keep the game on top level. I purchased the game ages ago and actually got a refund just becuase it was unplayable for me at the start but like i said the devs listen and work with the players to get the best the game has come on massively over the past months. You can play Solo Duo or Squads and i'd honestly say you get so much more enjoyment out of it playing as a squad with mates who you can communicate with and coming up with ways to win the game and kill players.Solo is also good but can get boring over time as you're just on your own.

2017-06-10,0,0,901,True,Recommended,This game is addictive. However the early access has a lot to improve. Controls are bad huge difficulties breaching/climbing walls cannot escape out windows etc. Everyone familiar with BF know how it should be. The sound allows you to hear a person walk on the floor inside a building miles away which is unlikely but you dont hear someone driving behind you and kill you in the last minute. Sound in not 3D and is important in a game like this that it is accurate and just right. You often die due to a bug or strange thing in the game. So the developers should focus on improving sound and making the character move better.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

NOTE THIS GAME IS AMAZING IM JUST LETTING YOU KNOW OF A FEW ISSUES1. I am playing on a 2011 GPU at 30 fps so any newer system 'should' easly hit 60fps2. There are a few bugs they can be irritating but they dont happen too often so they are not game breaking as many reviews say3. Cheaters are present but the issue is not as big as it is layed out to be in my 400 hours i have seen 6 cheaters 4 where in a squad and we downed 3 of them before loosing (was kinda fun tbh) but bluehole and battleeye are putting effort into solving these issues. 4. in getting this game you have to be prepared to loose a fight by not finding a gun it happens but it also happens the other way alot too many people complain about not getting a gun but then laugh when they do and the other doesnt over multiple games it is close enough to fair.5. there are a few server issues near the start of the game but again not game breaking you might just have to press f on an item 2 3 times instead of once to get it.Be prepared to go into the game and experiance a few odd things with glitches e.t.c but you cant expect perfection no game is glitchless for example csgo still has odd things found by the community regually.

Now is definately not a good time. Hackers have recently INVADED the game.Pros Addictive and satisfying gunplay Looting adds to the thrill Map design is good Vehicles are fun to operate Micortransactions are strictly cosmetic When the match is clean the game is really entertainingCons Optimalization Lags issues Desync Door Hackers Terrible net code Intercontinental connections make the net code break completely Chinese player base is taking over North American servers and most of them are hacking (fact) Devs are not focusing on the most crucial aspects of the game like the ban system/anti cheat/net codeNever before have I seen a game thrust into the lime light like this one when it's so obviously broken. It's popular because it's fun......when it's working properly. Unfortunately right now it's a hot f***ing mess. The devs seem to be focusing on the least important parts of the game and it's severely obvious like a turd on a concrete sidewalk. Instead when they should be fixing these issues they are pushing for the esports arena because of how popular it has gotten and they want to capitalize on that I get it!! But this is one thing that baffles me in it's current condition it is NO WHERE NEAR qualified for esports. It's still in alpha for Christ's sakes. How is it ready for a leap into pro competitions?As of today the servers are over run with hackers. When I first started playing it wasn't so bad but now it's every match. The leaderboards make that fact crystal clear. Even though over 150 000 bans have been handed out it's not stopping the epidemic. It's now said that around 42 000 bans are made each day. It makes you think at that rate how many legit players are actually playing? 42 000 a day? So technically I guess you could chalk up it's popularity to cheating/hacking f**cks who wish only to ruin your experience. Also if you think about this as well some of these people are repurchasing the game just to hack it again. Sounds like money in the bank for Bluehole to me. UPDATE 11/7/17 PUBG Corp. has vowed to make good on the hacking situation but whether they do so remains to be seen. I for one am not going to hold my breath and neither should you. My initial review opinions remain the same. Give this game more time to develope.PUBG is fun and addictive when it's a clean match but the net code and hacking are tearing it down. Bluehole er excuse me PUBG CORP. for some ungodly reason saw fit to allow foreign connections as well for example Asia to North America in a game where the net code is already bad enough with NA to NA connections. Because of this the hacking epidemic is not only affecting Asian servers but every other server North America being the hardest hit. Expect lag at the beginning of the game expect lag when a foreign connector enters your network bubble expect lag when the moment is most crucial. Broken. Simply put PUBG is spiraling the drain at the moment. If you like the abuse of frustrating games then go ahead and give them your money if you prefer a clean gaming experience then I would honestly steer clear right now until Bluehole gets their sh*t together. If these critical issues are resolved then and ONLY then would I rewrite my review and give it a thumbs up because it really deserves it. It's a fun game all quarrels aside. I have more of an issue with the degenerates hacking it than I do with the devs making it. Without this plague it would be on track to major success.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-12,0,0,298,False,Recommended,"ATTENTION! This review is most likely dated and will not be changed out of laziness. I will put notes of things at the bottom and the new 4x4 island update for PUBG will be my last edit on this review unless another map is released or a big issue is created etc. Game is back to well optimization with big add ons to the game such as the Desert map which isn't being chosen as much as it did before. It's fine but I think players should decide what map(s) they want since I still do prefer the original. Not that I dislike the Desert map it's just preference. One thing with this new map though is that it is still laggy and buggy sometimes in the beginning of the round. The pop in/go through walls glitch is still evident for me though and I even killed someone to save a friend running through the walls. One thing the devs are doing that is not good at all is they just take a streamers word and PERMAbanning people for ""streamsniping"" because (some not all) are whiny and can't take a death. Anyways the system was guilty until innocent which is stupid. There should be a csgo ban system for teamkills where it's a timely thing. If this review is sort of off point it's just my thoughts on the game. 7/10 January 2018As of March 29th 2018 New 4x4km map has not been released I think the stream sniping issue is over Region Locked is considered or already done Hacks are pretty bad atm Weapon skins are out in 2 new crates",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-06,0,0,905,False,Recommended,Player Unknown's Battleground is a fantasitc game.I have played enough to understand the mechanics and basics of this game as I am nearing 400 hours. Recently It might just be me but I have noticed a decline in hackers. This may be due to the devs' efforts or something else. NA servers used to be riddled with Asian players and I simply want them gone from NA. This is not 'xenephobic' or 'racist' as devs have previously described It's just me and thousands of other NA players who don't want our gameplay hindered by Chinese hackers and trust me when I say the vast majority of hackers are Chinese. The recent additions of event modes have added an exhilirating twist to the game and offers us new content to explore and enjoy.The new map in development 'Savage' will be a great addition to PUBG as I find myself bored often of the repetitiveness of current maps. I played it on experimental servers and it proved to be great the new map offers a shorter game time allowing for more frequent gunfights between players and an overall faster game.I do enjoy new skins being introduced ect but by adding crates and skins the devs are creating a new source of income and thus inviting more hackers who will make a profit off of these items. I am mixed on my opinion of skins and cosmetics but I know many players feel negatively about it. devs have also hinted an M416 and and other AR rifles nerf. I do not think they should nerf such guns and aswell as removing the level 3 helmet from spawns and putting it in crates. This is just unnecesary. Instead of nerfing guns why not tackle the hacking problem haunting PUBG servers? PUBG will stay a popular game for a while as long as new maps and event modes keep on coming and the hacking problem is fixed. The experiences I have had on PUBG have been very fun and I enjoy playing this game alot. Note Mostly whenever I play games with randoms I get friendly/co operative teamates which Is something I appreciate alot about PUBG. I do not like it however when I am paired with an Asian who lacks the ability to speak English. Thank you PUBG for bringing me so many thrilling and worthy hours of gameplay. Keep on imrpoving the game devs and your playerbase will be thankful. (,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-02-20,0,0,456,False,Recommended,Having logged over 400 hours and going through many cycles of excitement and disappointment with this game I completely understand why other BR games are growing while PUBG is fading.Over the last few patches my overall game performance has somehow gotten worse despite the devs proudly announcing optimizations and other performance fixes. It s getting harder and harder to win fire fights bc my game chunks out whenever a close quarters battle breaks out. This is almost a game breaking issue for me and it s shocking that it s actually getting worse with each patch.In comparison with other BR games the wait time to get into a game in PUBG is dreadfully long. Add in plane and parachuting time and the wait between periods of action is way too long. This makes dying even more of a punishment so it discourages aggressive play. Other BR games have already learned from this by incentivizing players to actually seek out and engage enemy players.Unlike many people I actually like Miramar but agree the map needs more prime looting areas and more vehicles. Otherwise it is very much a running simulator.I feel that PUBG is at a cross roads. They are trying to give us more content but at it is coming at the cost of other essential fixes that should ve been made long ago.

2018-01-16,0,0,6,False,Not Recommended,I don't have to mention Region LockThat is an issue for experienced players that somehow enjoyed this mess...This isn't a good game. And i mean it. I have a friend who pratically me off to play this game to the point he bought the game himself and shipped off to my account. And I hope he reads this. You'll spend about 2 minutes to get into the game. Then after you land down you'l walk and walk and walk and walk and walk looting weapons armor backpacks and all kinds of things. Then after minutes of endless walking/looting you'll come across a single player. You will either kill him while he is looting stuff or the other way arround.... then back to lobby back to queue and it starts all over again. Run loot and ocasionaly get a kill from someone that can't see you. I know they had a bold and realist idea for the game concept but it is just not fun. Good ideas don't make the game by itself. it is required more than that...The map could suport about 1000 players and it would be still a low demographic situation.... For a shooting game there isn't much shooting. There's a lot of looting. That's about 80% of what you do in a shooting game.... And there are many games with massive number of players on huge maps with vehicles (like battlefield for instance) with much more action fun and playablilityThere are also a lot of features that make the game much more complicated than it shold really be for instance having a buttong to switch the fire type (can't we just pick weapons and shoot? have these dudes played counter strike? call of duty?) multiple amuniton types scopes and add ons that are randomly spawned multi level kevlar backpack and helms (really? what for?) that really make up for the true nature of this game bad programingI played the last game and after 5 minutes of loneliness i was harassed by misterious shots. I'm not an shooting expertise but when something hits me from behind or anyother direction (like a stone or a slap) i know where it came from. Well not in this game. You'll be totally lost about where the shots are coming either it hit you or not. then i forced the auto run and rotated the camera (with alt button) 360º twice and slow and still couldn't find the shooter till he finaly had me. I turn on the death cam and guess what. the dude was visible from a point that i checked like twice. i could even see my avatar facing his direction before dying. So you'll need a top GPU if you hope to even find the enemy. I have a GeForce GTX650 Ti 1GB. I know it isn't much nowadays but that GPU allows me to play OVERWATCH Call Of Duty Need for Speed and other games at medium/low graphics at top performance. Well for PUBG i've set the graphics to very low and the game still crashes ticks freezes and don't render the enemies b4 they kill me. I'm about to install Fortnite to see how bad this game really isDON'T BUY IT. NOT WORTH IT at least for PC.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

It doesn't matter if you're new you'll soon find your own playstyle whether it's jumping head first into a firefight or tailing someone to wait for the perfect opportunity to off them or whatever.

2017-05-06,0,0,437,True,Recommended,got this as a gift from a friend and it quickly became my most played game on steam! 100% worth it!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-06-26,0,0,234,True,Recommended,"So I originally picked this game up when it first launched on Steam. It was riddled with bugs. Game crashed on my first 2 matches other 2 had horrible hit registration. Leveled a shotgun at a dude as he walked through the door fired and the pellets just warped through him and hit the wall on the otherside of this person. Obviously I winded up dying shortly after even though I shouldn't have been the one that died. Winded up refunding it.Fast forward to last week and I got a coupon for GMG to buy the game for 22 bucks. Asked a couple of friends madly in love with the game if I should grab it and each time it was met with a resounding "" YES. GIT IT""Game got better. Game got much much better. Plugged in 17 hours over the past few days I've only had one crash and zero issues with hit reg. With those issues solved the game is just fun. Like nothing is game breakingly new but the mixture of loot craze from years of CRPGS tense firefights the joy of getting the drop on someone since you heard them walking around a corner or hill it's that perfect cocktail of fun. Plus there are some vistas in the game that are just gorgeous to look at and consequently camp at. From the group of houses in some swamp lake the ruins of a castle to the multitude of rolling hills to duck in.My only complaint as of now is that the foilage just cuts off. For both a tactical reason and a ""ooo this pretty"" reason. Seeing the cornfields and cornucopia of colours that come with the abundance of nature in this game would be great to look at from a distance. But after a certain distance even on ultra it just stops. Takes you out of a game that's usually very immersive. Also no one likes to seem completely hidden in a field of wheat from their POV just for some jackass with an 8x scope noticing someone just laying down with zero cover. I know it'd be hard to fix due to optimization issues that would crop up which they're definitely hard at work at optimization this game but it's my only real grievance with the game. Just let me be hidden in my wheat fields like a Hobbit worthy of the name Took.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-10-10,0,0,1050,False,Not Recommended,Let me get this out there. I enjoy this game it is really fun when everything works properly there is a nice challenge and the pacing from the zones is just right.Now I am going to state why exactly I cannot reccommend this game to anyone at this point in time.Cheating. There is such a large amount of people cheating. What I mean by this is that it is not even about how many individuals just how many squads have a designated cheater (exaggerating a little but not too much.) People use anything from an aimbot to a program that removes certain aspects of the game to gain an advantage (and by this I mean removing things trees rain or fog and other environmental factors that make the game more challenging.)Servers. When playing PUBG you can randomly disconnect from the server and not be allowed back into a game. This problem happens in both solo and team matches.Disconnecting is obviously more destructive when you play in team games due to leaving your friends/pubs with one less member. In my experince there also is an issue that arises when server connectivity is somewhat spotty assets. During periods of connection problems there seems to also be an issue of some assets not loading in. Weather this is a vehicle or character model it does not matter the fact is that it extremly hampers the enjoyment and playability of the game.Fun update If you like playing in North American servers with nothing but chinese players this is the game for you! You want a game that prioritzes the input of Asian players we got you. You want a game where you get shot through a wall because of lag? We got ya fam!With 1.0 being released you can tell how much of shill Greene is. He and the team rushed out the game so fast and is trying to include as many people in as few servers as possible. Do you want to chug along in a game for the first few minutes while the servers slowly hemorage? Great glad you like PUBGs newest feature! The only issues that actually are addressed by the developers are so minor that they do not even warrent mentioning. It is all just a cash grab.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The game is fun to play solo but the game's full glory is shown when you play with your friends in duo/squad modes. The game is buggy and physics are broken at this point but it's okay for an Early Access game. The reason I'm giving this game a thumb's down is that the developers are not focusing on fixing the game's problems and instead they are trying to add more content and e sport features to it. This is not what I paid Bluhole (now PUBG corp.) my money. When I pay for an Early Access title I expect devs to use my money to fix the game and then add extra content and features after the release or at least when the game became stable enough. The cheaters are flourishing and that's because many incidents in the game don't have server side checks. If you have a decent rig and don't mind to die from game's problems from time to time then buy it. If you can't take dev's neglections save your time and nerve and wait to see how this turns out.EDIT so after getting out of early access the game have seen some love on the performance front although it's not enough it made the game playable for me so i'll now give this game a tumbs up.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-03-30,0,0,373,False,Not Recommended,I like the game a lot sometimes. I had awsome fun in Solo and with my mates. But it is a mess and you might just be better off to go with something similar and a studio behind it that can actually support such a game. Connection issues Cheaters overall clunkyness new bugs every patch just take a lot of fun out of it.The addition of lootcrates (for some you have to pay to open) and lazy ugly weapon skins just make all of this more annoying. I can understand that all those graphics staff need to get to do something while the rest of the team messes up the game even more but some of the skins look like a really untalented three year old had an fieldday with paint.Id advise to fo to another game if you can drag your mates away from this thing. It is addicitve fun once in a while but it might just not be worth the bitterness and frustration over how much this potentially ingenious game is handled.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-11-23,0,0,299,False,Not Recommended,"Product received for free. I think that this is one of the greatest game of its kind but i have 4 cons 1. Cheaters This is the first game what I've played with so many cheaters there were approx 4 cheaters in 5 games. It's really demotivational when you try to chase ken dinner.2. English keyboard I am from Czech republic so I am using czech keyboard. In every game I have never had a problem with keyboards but this is the one. When I have czech keyboard I can't switch weapons on 12345...Yea you can simply shift + alt to change on english keyboard but when you play the game you often running with shift and looking around with alt so you change it back to czech and when you are in close fight and try to switch your weapon you are dead..3. Sound system A lot of time in this game I've got shot from nowhere in some situation you are not able to recognize""where the fu** is he shooting from""..sound of shooter is spread all around you and not on specific location. Sometimes I here it behind me but they are in front of me and it really pis**s me off. Another problem with sound is that I would like to have balanced sound I always must mute my sound in airplane or where airplane flyes around me or when redzone comes. I would appreciete in this situation lower down master volume to not destroy my ears.4. Bluezone balance This is the most game influencing and most rng element in this game between lose and win. I really don't like this randomness. I would like to win(or lose) my game on skill no on random zone. It would really help if you invent some algorithm to balance zone. Something like compromise between position of players possition on maps loot number of players etc etc.Please focus on these problems and make this game the best!Thanks but FOR NOW NO (",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-07,0,0,455,False,Recommended,At this point in time it is hard for me to recommend the game. Hear me out though.With over 450 hours (I have 40 hours on test server as well) and around 65 wins... It's safe to say there's a huge love/hate relationship with this game. No other game has made me feel this way in a long time.The game is great nobody can deny that. Although there are many aspects that draw in a lot of negativity towards the game for example No recoil hacks are still kind of around. I see them every now and again on OC FPP in top 500. Desync still plays a major factor in many deaths that I have gotten e.g. Aiming around a corner really quick on your screen but on the server (Killcam) you are staring around the corner for more than 2 seconds. Red zones can be a huge problem due to how RNG they are. In my personal opinion they should be removed. Lootboxes are quite ridiculous at the moment and it pretty much forces you to buy what clothing item or weapon skin you desire through the expensive marketplace. They could fix this by implementing a system similar to Call of Duty or Battlefield where you can unlock new cosmetics by completing challenges.Suggestions Please get rid of clothing items in game. It's quite annoying when you pick up some boots instead of a rifle. Add a practice range/custom maps. FIX THE THREE SEATER PLS. Chicken dinner rewards A rare clothing item or skin. Add the ability to spectate after you have been killed. Reduce the time in pre game lobbies I don't want to wait 3 minutes for another game to start. Lastly WE WOULD LOVE A MAP SELECTION BLUEHOLE!Anyway there's just a couple of my thoughts at this current time. The game has so much potential it's just a matter of how the devs treat it. Right now I would probably give the game a 6.5/10 Slighty above average.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Its not abandoned by any means but eventually the magic fades when you get killed by a uzi at long range or you get stuck and die or you get killed by a hacker after getting your dream loadout. Bugs are reasonable since its early access but lack of something new makes it hard to enjoy. The new map and vaulting and guns should fix it for a while but if there doesnt become a goal for the game like a rank system or progression that is more permenent unlike the leaderboards it will be bland.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-21,0,0,86,False,Recommended,I've been waiting for the final release to buy this game. So the game runs really smooth on my system (GTX1080ti and i7 3770k) at around 100fps (min 80fps max 120fps) on Ultra settings 2560x1440 resolution. The craphics look nice nothing too special tho. I like the game scenes I just thing that it needs some work with the draw distance (long distances look too empty because of this also its really easy to spot enemies) and fill the game field with more details and stuff.The guns look nice and real they sound quite good and they are deadly enough (I would prefer them a bit more hardcore buts its ok).I haven't experience any bugs and glitches or performance issues that I head were common in pre release versions.The servers run perfect so far no lag.I haven't met any hacker so far (playing on Europen servers) but many people are companing so something should be done about that by the devs.One thing they need to fix ASAP is the grass draw distance.

2017-10-17,0,0,140,True,Not Recommended,"The game is a decent early access battle royal game. With that being said it is early access and is plagued with issues still from performance to not being finished. Make sure to read rules of conduct before getting game if you enjoy stream sniping don't get game as it is bannable offense and they aren't afraid to bad at the drop of a hat.The ""mininum"" requirements are not accurate to get the game to run on systems with those settings I have had to help people go into settings files to cap FPS as it isn't an in game option. If you have a very hi end computer the game does look good but you will also see performance dips. Next has to do with the genre that this game doesn't do well currently to combat. RNG chance at loot and sometimes spending 25 minutes of your 30 minute game just running/driving to circle not having action can get old after a few games. Some other battle royales have done tweaks to map size/safe zone size/and spawn rates of vehicles to help combat this this game has not and could benefit from it.Finally early access not finished. This means all the previous issues could be fixed in coming months. The developer is pretty good about updates and releases. Hopefully it is a game that doesn't end up staying in early access and is actually fully released before the hype dies down and people no longer interested in game.I wouldn't buy this game on my own only reason I got was to play with friends as they got it because of hype. Fun game with friends for a few games but for me the game isn't flushed out enough to be excited to play solo or even push friends to hop on and play with me.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-05-16,0,0,410,True,Not Recommended,I never played any of the other Battle Royal games that were out until now (H1Z1 the Culling etc.) but I have always been interested in these type of games. After I finally bought it I was not disappointed I was instantly hooked into the game. Sure there are a lot of bugs but it's in early access so that is to be expected and I immediately saw them working on these problems in updates which is where I understand where the other games failed. Another thing that I really enjoyed about this game compared to the others was how well optimized it is. The game renders a distance rather than the entire map and buildings do not cause a massive lag spike. Even the beginning area where there is up to 100 people only drops like 15 fps and that is with all the explosions smoke fire and shooting going on.UPDATE Latest updates completely ed this game and now the servers are utter garbage do not get this game in it's current state. Maybe later they will fix this or maybe they will just screw us over take the money and run who knows? Never had a game this good go to utter this fast. Literally one unnecessary update screwed the game and people are leaving and refunding left and right.

Stormy map Sniper suppresor is rarer than the actual sniper Sometimes there can be trash in supply drops orwhatever you want to call themOverall PUBG is a very good game definently a better alternative to H1Z1 i recommend this over that any day however due to the game being in dev stages it is lacking a lot of content and has a lot of bugs but if you can get over those facts it is very enjoyable especially with friends hovever friendly fire is still on when you're with friends or randoms and the chances that they might betray you are high oh and lots of the reviews im seeing are all HACKERS HAKCERS EVERYWHERE but so far i have not encountered a single hacker so dont pay attention to themOverall i give this game a 8/10 STILL CANT FIND THE APPLE THO PROBABLY REMOVED,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-21,0,0,239,False,Recommended,PubG is a game that you should be playing with people. It is a lot of fun when you and your squad go through inconveniences and plan out your movements. The game has a First person and a Third person view. Third person is quite annoying when the enemy has an unfair advantage behind an object the can see all around them. First person is very balanced but driving vehicles is a very difficult thing to control. People do hack occasionally but it is hardly an issue. The amount of Asians on the NA servers is really annoying because they mic spam a lot and they have their own server which bugs me if you search for a squad you will probably find a good one because people don't like to team kill. The Game starts off with you flying in a plane and finding where you want to drop. The game pretty much is turtling a lump of dump through the first 60 seconds of landing and you cannot pick up anything or you can but you lag backwards 60 times. The game does crash sometimes (Even the crash report crashes) but it is probably a 1/100 issue hardly happens. The game should probably punish shooting macro users (even though i am one of them) because you can make a gun fire faster than it would in automatic mode. Lots of the vehicles are great The Uaaz Dacia Buggy Bike Pickup. but the Van is the worst thing in the history of games. I recommend the AKM UMP strategy because it works and an AKM can pretty much be a sniper and the UMP is a balanced close range weapon. I love this game and i think if you have friends and enjoy a challenge you should buy it too.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-11-25,0,0,63,True,Recommended,"Really good game potential just lacking optimization which I can understand since the game is in Early Access. You get thrown into a match with approx 99 players and need to gather resources such as guns ammo and vests to survive from enemy players. Solo Duo Squad modes are available. No DLC's!!!(love games like this) now when I play squads people with other languages(chinese mostly) come up in our North American servers and that is really hard to deal with since we can't understand them so when you need ammo you have to say it like ""ammo 9mm! ammo 9mm!"" and most of the time I am ignored since they don't know english I don't blame them. They should make a option when you play the game for the first time to ask you your region and language so this doesn't happen. Optimization needs to be improved heavily we need a post processing option to turn it off completely so it doesn't lag I get a few network lag detected messages here and there so I end up getting shot and there is nothing I can do about it even thought my internet is good. Complaints aside really good potential as a multiplayer game. Just remember please don't introduce microtransactions for guns and stuff. Thank you Devs.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-01-01,0,0,440,False,Not Recommended,This game is unique in the sense that it has amazing gameplay but it's not optimized well enough for you to actually play it smoothly. There are so many bugs glitches rubberbanding and the occasional hacker that after the initial hype fades you find yourself with little motivation to start it up and play any rounds. I had hoped the 1.0 release would fix most of the these issues but it seems to have exacerbated the issues. If anything it plays the same as beta if not slightly worse. Even the main menu interface is extremely laggy and this is independant of what type of drive you use (HDD/SSD) or what your computer specs are seems to happen to almost everyone.It's not fun waiting around 5 minutes just going through post game lag screen and then having to deal with menu lag to only THEN be able to queue up for another game. This game really needs an option to reque right from the death screen. The game is very fun (albeit sometimes dull with long gaps of little to no action but that's something to be expected with the Battle Royale genre) when it plays well but at its current state I would highly recommend waiting for optimization patches before purchasing or else you're going to find yourself constantly frustrated.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-20,0,0,127,True,Recommended,PUBG is an amazing game... if you dont mind dying a lot.PUBG is an RNG (Random Number Generator) game where loot is very randomized on what you're going to get. Firstly You parachute from a plane after a small lobby island where no one can die with every player in the match a few people will be shooting at nearly every other player since there are tables that have one of every gun in the game this is also where i recomend muting player chat ince a lot of people like to 1. Scream into their mic2. Chant isis music 3. Scream racist homophobic hurtful things into their micsand 4. (which i have only encountered once) Literally sing the USSR national anthemNow once you have survived the toxic lobby island you will be teleported into a plane that flies over the map in a straight line either diagonally from corner to corner or vertically from top to bottom or side to side which also varies depending on the match once you have selected a good place from the map you jump and skydive to your selected location manually here is where the RNG come in depending on the place you have jumped to you could find anything from 1 peice of level 1 armour/ rubbish melee to an amazing level 3 peice of armour along with a lovely selection of assault rifles smgs pistols and a holy sniper rifle. Now this is why PUBG requires experience and tactics because you either hope that there is an unpopulated Meh area where you can find an AK with some level 2 stuff or choose to go with half of the match population to the military base or a city.First things first before you go into PUBG EXPECT TO DIE! Honestly there are some really sweaty tryhards that will always pop out of nowhere and blast you out of existance that or youll die by being outside of the blue area a glitch STUPID BIKE PHYSICS or your own silly little mistakes.PROS + Good graphics + Good Physics (except for the bikes(especially the three seater))+ Amazing gun play where you can attatch and detatch any compatible attatchment+ Alive devs+ Wide Range of guns+ Cool Dude Clothes+ Minor character customisationCONS Some glitches (being patched all the time) Tryhards and cancerous people RNG will let you down a lot (BUT that is kind of the point)Overall PUBG IS a good game (but you have to remember that you will die but it is worth it when you experience your first win) however i do recommend watching a few videos first.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I play at about 40fps which isnt great but its workable. As for hackers I have ran into very few over the past 8 months.

2017-12-27,0,0,1162,False,Recommended,"So i have a few hundred hours on the game and figured i would write a review now that its fully released. Love the game first and foremost. Game is great while there are a few technical issues with it its a fun play and the sense of enjoyment when you win is amazing. the few technical issues i have with the game are the random crashes during matching or during a game. No where as bad as before 1.0 but it still happensServers I feel the ""tick"" rate is not low enough for a FPS as numerous times you can get shot around corners and you hear your shot go off but you die without that headshot that looked like it hit on your screen. when you first drop into the game depending on the server your in (not region just the physical server) the rubberbanding is unbearable then once about 20 30 people die it stops and you dont get it the rest of the game. I could be wrong but it seems to be a server issue not being able to handle the capacity of players and scale of the map. Since i cant really see how loot spawns im not sure if thats part of the issue too. Reccommendations are just get better servers with better tick rates and higher capacities. All in all great job on the game you guys have made amazing improvments in the last year and i congratulate you on that. Amazing work.

2017-07-20,0,0,158,True,Recommended,Incredibly fun and intense game that keeps you on edge the entire duration of the match. Battlegrounds has managed to find a balance between the realism of Arma and the silliness of H1Z1 which I believe makes it significantly superior to the aforementioned games. I cannot wait for the new update that's going to add vaulting and climbing mechanics which brings me to my next point This game is insanely good considering it's only in early access and the developers have a goal of releasing it by the end of 2017 giving them plenty of time to work with. The only improvement that I can genuinely suggest that doesn't have anything to do with the actual gameplay is a fix for the network optimization as well as the game's resource intensive nature. It by no means requires a high end PC yet it tends to have poor FPS at times. The lag in the game is unbearable at times even going as far as not letting you enter buildings because you simply get teleported back out once you're in due to network issues. But both these issues can easily be overlooked due to the development status of the game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Don't bother watching the kill cams half the time because it will make no sense to you as to how they killed you. The game isn't even out of early acces and yes they are holding tourneys and have micro tansactions? I forsee this game being like that of King of the Kill. It will never leave early access. Let's not forget about the hackers as well. Though nothing upset me more than the coding of the game. I keep going back to this game to give it another go and play with friends but I just can't help but I can't recommend this game. Fix the game and fully launch it before you do ANYTHING else.

2018-04-10,0,0,22,False,Not Recommended,My gameplay goes one of two ways 1. Drop in get into a firefight and get killed straight away. Spend more time in the queue than in game2. Drop away from the action loot for 30 minutes make it to the top 10 seeing nobody and then die shamefully.I don't have 5 10 years of shooter experiene to be competitve in this game. This makes the game unejoyable for me as I will predominantly lose to anyone I come against (after looting for some time). The game has too much looting and not enough action to be fun. It is unforgiving to noobs espicailly in solo. The game is fun to play with friends (particularily with ones who can carry). If you have a lot of active friends who play the game I would actually recommend it. However my overall experience has been depressing and I no longer have any desire to play this game.Pros Realistic Graphics Is fun when you're good Has very intense moments Enjoyable with friendsCons Long periods of no action Not 0ptimised at all Glitchy and laggy Play for 30 mins and see nobody then get one shot from 200m away No fun for noobs,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-07-21,0,0,90,True,Recommended,ProsEndless amounts of RNG to make every game different. Large range of guns to choose from. Semi accurate to accurate fire depending on how long you spend learning the weapons. When you find a good team games are super fun. SS (Solo squads) is a great challenge. Devs communicate with the community often and listen. ConsPerformance is still a little rocky but improving daily. (GTX 970 and a FX 8750 w/ 32 gigs of ram I average 60 FPS on very low unless I'm in towns.)Server desync still exists there are times where you are firing directly on a person standing close and the bullets don't seem to register. Playerbase really deserves to go in both Pros and Cons for every good game you get with a team you'll get a troll in another. More often than not it's a good team though (RNG again). Overall I give this game a solid 8/10 for the replayability. You can get hours of fun out of it for a great price. Definitely worth picking up!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-02-06,0,0,621,False,Recommended,Allow me to Make this clear This Game is GOOD. The problems lie in little things the core of the game feels good. The shooting feels tight the movment feels ok at best graphics are alright and i find the parachutes to be finicky at best cars feel like garbage. This game is like the fun parts of ARMA or Dayz when the shooting gets real. Problems begin to stem out from balancing issues with some of the guns the optimization and hackers and the map spots that get you stuck. Dont be fooled by most reviews This game is no mere shooter this is a TACTICAL SHOOTER meaning that gun fighting ain't your primary objective and if your not willing to wait up to 10 minutes for a fight to start look elsewhere. personal player issues involve how some guns feel the map zones while largely are ok i take issue with the final zones closing up in the middle of no where with no cover or anything and the zones that are often set in the dead center of the maps are common place while maps that are in any of the corners feel quite rare.On both maps this issue is prevalent its not the lack of cars i find that cover while traveling long distances is both rare and when you find it is bad.Hackers arent actually much an issue to me as to be HONEST i have only found a handful of hacker.Loot boxes ARE GARBAGE GARBAGE i hate skin economy's of any variety but here they serve an advantage! albeit not much but black clothing on the Forrest map (erangle) make a hell of a difference also to make myself more clear there exists CAMO CLOTHING while the rare clothing would have you sticking out to a sore thubClothing spawns before guns and other stuff Annoying as hell but honestly not an issue if you dont land 2 meters away from someone hitting the F button as opposed to dragging things in to your inventory is honestly a matter of situation If you need a gun hit F and you might pick it up if you open the invetory screen to pick stuff up your gonna grab it with no issue this is more time consuming tho. i find the issue lies with the pick up animation. Shooting as i said pravious no real issue here but what becomes an issue is when shooting near a wall your character has a tendency to point your gun Either up or down with a indicator that tells you if your gonna do that ( faint Red bubble) and what becomes an issue is when you crouch to shoot out of a window as you seem to be too tall to go all the way below the window but too short to fire out of the ing thing this annoys the hell out of me sure its a little better on the desert map(Miramar) but on Erangle is Un bearable.Guns The lack of a shooting range really annoys me as i lack the sufficient shooting experience with most of the crate stuff also i find the Kar98 is in a space where its too good for what it is aside from that everything is alright with the Pistols and Shotguns Pistols while good in a pinch lack variety to little to pick from. shotguns spread does have the chance to Miss the whole target with out a choke attachment. AR's are choice weapon nothing wrong here LMG's only 2 and both feel ok. Snipers Lordy these things are annoying as YOU CANT TRACK YOUR SHOT CAUSE THE GUY MOVES AWAY FROM THE SCOPE WHEN YOU SHOOT! Unless your running an SKS or Mini14 wich are free from this issue. SMG's Short to mid range they arent AR's but they can do the job until you get one no issues hereMap unique guns the Sawed off is pretty ok Rex pistol is a way better revolver DP28 When theres no AKM essentially Winchester Good gun 7.62 revolver good but bad shooting interval. Also the button to get out of the car is also the same as canceling stuff if your as reflexive as i am when it comes to cancling stuff you might end up dying when you hit the ground Crates as far as they go my only complaint is probably for them to have the camo item's match the map and for them to always have snipers bundled with high power scopes All in all Id Give PubG a solid 8/10With all the little things comes a hell of a good core that honestly makes me overlook everthing and a feeling of victory that is satisfying beyond words considering that for me anyway i take almost 100 losses before i get 1 win of any variety Oh yea also the networking is br&gt 5/8/2018Game hasnt changed much Crates are still Twisting my Nipples also Runs less assy and Plays a little bit better and sniper rifles are more annoying due to the removal of lvl 3 helmets from the overworld. Sanhook was Cool the event was basically just fortnites battlepass But worse alot worst actually it was downright terrible. Also the unshakeable feeling that this game is pretty much in late beta remains. also Guns seem to give off a little more recoil then i remember while Smg's seem to be basically lasers now with a high fire rate and way more range then i remeber them being able to shoot at.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The game concept is fun though it does have very limited replayability. The game play performance is just too inconsistent to be fun. The DEV team is too worried about monetizing the game than addressing major performance issues. The sad part is the mobile game is better optimized and has more features than PC (Mobile has better HUD and minimap) which is absolutely sad. I don't understand why I would build up Battle Points (BP) to purchase a crate that I can only open if I pay real money. That is complete BS. I can see if they want to have some unique skins etc for people who want to pay for them but making me pay to open a crate that I bought with in game currency is ridiculous.

I daresay another experience as communally important to streaming/gaming audiences is a long way off. Its not polished like Halo its not full of story like Halo but it is pervasive. Gameplay is both intense and relaxing and that mixture is important. It can be hilarious it can be serious. The breadth of the emotions and experiences of this game are insane. This was an accident this game wasnt meant to be played by millions so early. And regardless of the call of hackers galore or performance issues Bluehole is taking the game into a state where it will be played by millions.

2018-02-15,0,0,2395,False,Recommended,I have over 2000 hours in game so ive been here for the whole ride. The game is fun and intense and has a good competitive feel to combat especially near the final circle. However while the game is great when things go right it can be horrible when they dont. The biggest problem in the game right now would be hackers. I have played 6 NA squad games today so far and in 5 of them my whole team died to a guy with a asian name that had a aimbot insta downing us at 500 meters... adding a simple region lock would solve the issue of people with 300 ping that kill you behind trees due to latency and the hackers that are mostly from Asia countries. Now i know that not all asian players are hackers but anyone that has played the game for even a while knows that a vast majority of hackers are from Asian countires if the region lock doesnt become a thing then at least work on your anti cheat. There is nothing more annoying then playing a full game getting into the top 5 to just die to a hacker with a aimbot. So while i do recommend the game i will admit that it needs alot of work done.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-06-22,0,0,492,True,Recommended,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS is a fantastic entry into the battle royale genre that has been gaining followers in recent years. Overall I would give the game in its current state an 8/10.Despite being in Early Access PUBG has wonderfully exceeded my expectations and provided hours upon hours worth of content. Though with the dev team being as committed as they are (weekly updates community interaction active social media a laid out schedule for new features etc) I can easily predict hundreds more hours of content and playtime. Though as with any Early Access title there are a few problems. For instance most lower tier rigs from two years ago may not be able to run the game adequately FPS drops in large towns are common and there is usually server down time once a month. Though this is not meant to scare you as I said before the dev team is fully committed to making sure these problems are fixed.If you are on the edge about buying this game I say commit to it afterall you can refund it if you don't like it. I wasn't a battle royale type of gamer but after buying PUBG I cannot say I regret the purchase.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-09-06,0,0,24,True,Recommended,"PUBG one of the most fun games I've ever played. I'll explain the game as best I can before giving my personal review on it.To start off about 100 players are in a single game which makes victory that much harder. You begin on a plane (as do all other players) and can choose where on the massive island you wish to parachute to. Upon landing you have to make a quick dash to the nearest house to find a weapon(s) among other things. Each player can have 2 primary guns a secondary pistol a melee weapon and a grenade. There are weapons that are more effective than others so try to find those. For example I usually go with a shotgun (for entering houses) a rifle (for long range engagements) and a pan. (because pans can literally deflect bullets) There are also weapon attachments (for the guns not grenades or melee) such as scopes or quickdraw mags. At a certain point in the match the ""circle"" will appear you must get to it quickly for anyone outside of it will eventually die due to a death barrier that slowly closes in. At this point you want to start looking for a car which could help you later in the long run. Assuming you've sayed alive this long and you made it to the safe zone you'll probably start meeting some resistance. As the match goes on (and you hopefully survive) the safe zone will get smaller and smaller until the final person standing is declared winner. BUT WAIT you dont have to take 100 people on by yourself because there are more game modes to choose from that allow you so have a partner or a team of 4 but be careful because if you choose one of these game modes everyone else has a team to. Don't forget matches that you play give you coins to purchase in game loot crates to customize your character.My opinion on the game holy moly its amazing. I play a lot of 4 person team mode and I can't get enough! The competition is fierce so i have yet to win a game but i really dont care! I'm having so much fun beating people with a frying pan that victory is just a side thought. Plus the full game isn't even out yet! I can't wait to see what the devs do next!",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-23,0,0,945,False,Recommended,This is the saddest official release of a game that i have ever witnessed seriously. Here are my issues with it First you get no option to pick the map you want. Second When landing the lag is horrible especially for someone who looks for early kills like going to school and trying to pick up a weapon fast its bad in early access such things like early game lag rarely happened (at least to me). Third the map choosing is stupid idk how but for the last 6 games i had miramar at least make it 2 games one map 2 games another this random choosing part is bad i want to play erangel not miramar if i at least knew when it will be it would've been better but having to play this wasteland for 6 consecutive matches is stupid and i hate it call me a cry baby if you want but i was having fun going to school to get destroyed 5 rounds in a row and then win the 6th. Everything else aside from that i like in the game but its really sad that after the official release it became even more broken ... I hope this changes and that the game will be stabilized because before this happened i had lots of fun with this game now it just bacame frustrating.UPDATE seems like most problems i had changed to good so i appvote the game tnx for listening to community &lt 3,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

New MAPS Weapons cars and the beloved new vaulting system. This game has finally left early access! If you play safe you would definitely reach top ten but most of the game you would be either hiding scavenging and running. In my opinion the way it should be played is hunting.

There are times of silence where you are just sitting there contemplating your next move. And that gets boring as man! Alot of the times you just sit there running around for 4/5 of the game or more endlessl. But that time where your in that firefight makes it all ing worth it.

Second i cant play more than one or two games before becoming infuriated at a very few particular mechanics that entirely ruin it for me.take for example the kill circle. in the early game it entirely moves too quickly. many people argue that it adds excitement to the game and the game never plays the same one more than once which i can understand. however when you drop to a chosen loot location and have to immediately start running to the opposite side of the map due to a bad circle. it just strait ruins the game for me. especially when for the first time you actually get decent luck with loot and the second cirlce jumps across the map from you. and ofcourse due to the terrible airstrike system every vehicle within 5km of you is destroyed. better hope you picked up a ton of boosters.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-06-17,0,0,530,False,Not Recommended,"1.0 Review. Desert map is really cool. A combination of Joshua Tree and Mexican/Texan desert. No vegetation means more FPS and more visibility to get shot from long distance. Very different playstyle from Russian map. Cool addition and a refreshing change.It has recently come out that PUBG runs at 17hz tick rate on the server.So regardless of you 120FPS you're still getting a rate below 60ms from the server. It is actually 8hz at the beginning of the game. This may be ok for online chess or poker but not for FPS.This explain the inability to pick up items and general unresponsiveness. It feels like molasses compared to CS.If you're ok with it go play TF2 which runs at 66hz (15ms update rate) on the server. You'll know what ""e sports"" experience is supposed to feel like.This is a generally a crappy corporate decision by bluehole to own their server network. This prevents individual users from running high performance dedicated servers like TF2 or CS and creates an environment of penny pinching cloud fee dependant lowest cost wins infrastructure. There is little reason for this aside from just corporate greed. And that is standard with money first companies which bluehole obviously is. PUBG isn't WOW just let people play on their own servers which they can run without concern for the cost of it because they love the game.I still cannot recommend this game. Wait for 2018 to see AAA studios release their versions of Battle Royale with much more optimized experience. With the rate and overall direction PUBG has been going it is paced to be the mega hit that DayZ was in the beginning followed shortly by titanic collapse into obscurity.Just like DayZ creator who luckyly stumbled on a winning formula and immediately proceeded to mess everything up with additions and gameplay changes no one cared about ignoring crucial server performance and user experience PUBG is going in the exactly the same direction. But that is ok bluehole already made their $.UI has easily fixable problems that have been ignored for months. Why doesn't it remember that I selected FPP and switches to TPP between games? Are you bluehole guys familiar with UE4 system of saving to config files? Its really easy. Look it up. It will take 2 hours of research and development time by a junior dev.LOD is still glitchy and weird.Server matches are still across continent. So if you're in California you'll end up playing in NY. You might get better ping to Asia.I have to take a break from games for 2 3 days after playing TF2 because this game is virtually unplayable in comparison.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-08-14,0,0,107,False,Not Recommended,"I've got 94 hours on Battlegrounds so I feel I can write an accurate review.So much potential last year Pros Deep weapon mechanics and realistic gunplay. One of the deepest rushes of adreniline at the moment and their are few other multiplayer experiences as intense and satisfying as getting a chicken dinner with your friends. Intresting weapons which all have a unique feel. Combat flows and is intresting. Frequent updates adding weapons.Cons No matter what type of PC you've got and no matter the internet speed 1/10 games crash lag out or give you a cryptic error code. The afformentioned intresting and rich combat experience only shows in 2/5 engagments. Often times the only kills you get are A You sit in a house and someone stumbles in and immediatly gets sprayed by a splurge of 7.62's from your erect AKM. B You see someone sitting behind a tree and melt them with steaming hot lead. The intresting gourmet pubg combat only REALLY takes place at 75 100 meters away with each party having either a bush rock or a tree to shoot from. Vehicle physics are completely Bull**** with people getting killed by a car rolling .0001 mph.However the biggest most glaring issue is its hilariously bad progression system. Ok say you just spent 27 minutes playing a full match of pubg winning through skill and stratedgy. You excitedly return to the main menu to claim your spoils. Using the the 1200 coins the game awarded you you purchase 2 randomized crates. Thinking of all the intresting colthing and skins you can get you attempt to open them. However the crates require 2.99 dollars to buy a COMPLETELY SEPERATE KEY. You are not deterred. You are not going to waste the 27 minutes of your life you spent in a video game. You pay 6 dollars. You open the case and you eagerly await your prize! Ahh could it be a bandana or gold weapon skin you could sell?. It shows your reward. A RED SHIRT. 1 COMMON RED SHIRT. See? This is what the game pulls ALL. THE. TIME. Or you could spend 8 bucks on the games insulting ""Sanhok Pass"" Which is a shameless and poorly done ripoff of Fortnite Battle Royales ""Battle Pass"".

2017-11-24,0,0,344,False,Not Recommended,"This was a really great game at first and I used to love playing it. Sadly that's not the case anymore at this point the game is next to unplayable. Bluehole priotized in game cosmetics and a port to Xbox over fixing and completing their game. They allowed a Chinese company (tencent) to buy a 5% stake in the company and now they sell cheats to Chinese players off the back end and Bluehole does nothing about it. They spend their time banning people for ""stream sniping"" (though they were more just banning people who killed streamers than actual stream snipers) and team killing or being ""mean"". They allow hackers to run the game and now and this is no exaggeration at least 8/10 if not more games have hackers in them. Add to it the fact that Tencent now has devolopment rights for PUBG in China and says that they will be working on game development to help bring the game more in line with socialist core values I'm afraid to see what this game is going to turn into. Save your $30 play a finished game that have devs that are present and care because you won't find them in PUBG. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.UPDATE Allow me to add to this review. I just played a game today where I shot a kid 4 times from 5 feet away with a shotgun while he had no armor and no helmet he lived through it all looted an AR and killed me in two shots while I had a level one vest. You'd think if you were going to sell a game you would atleast TRY to make a half decent game but not Bluehole because the only thing that matters them is their bottomline and ripping off their community in order to increase their income.

2017-08-03,0,0,364,False,Not Recommended,First off the people complaining about the paid crate system are blowing things out of proportion. Sure the devs said there'd be no micro transactions during early access but I doubt anyone was ready for the sheer number of players that would flock to this game and maintaining servers for such a large player base would need a steady flow of income. The current system is to insure it'll have all issues ironed out before release.As for the game review itself the game is a gem honestly. I haven't enjoyed a game this much in so long.The devs release updates and patches very regularly. Some of the physics can be janky at times but it's to be expected but the base gameplay and mechanics is excellent. Shooting is realistic while avoiding being cumbersome and the entire game is very easy to get used to. The highlight of this game is the fact that you're free to chose everything from where you land where you position yourself in fights and where you loot and these choices will either lead you to victory or have you melt away trying deperately to reach the play zone. It makes each match completely different and fresh.

2018-08-13,0,0,97,False,Not Recommended,"I may not have the most hours into this game but I have played sporadically since early access. While the game has come a long way in terms of content and fixes since release it has hit a wall of unbearable and has clearly been surpassed by Fortnite. There are they typical gripes you see all over the place (framerates rendering ping server issues etc....) but the worst thing has to be there is no sense of progression of accomplishment. Sure if you win a match you get a nice ""WINNER WINNER CHICKEN DINNER!"" and a sizable amount of BP tokens. But your only option is to spend those tokens on crates which is layers upon layers of gamble. It is randomized what crate you will receive and further a random loot drop out of that crate. But worst of all is now so many loot crates are LOCKED by a micro transaction key! So not only are you paying to play the game in the first place but if you want to unlock anything for the crate you earned you must spend more money. I can get games having a micro transaction system it adds revenue that can be used to better the game but when you make it a requirement to get nearly anything you earn and add that it is a random drop as well there is officially no point to play other than do your best to win and end up dying and earning squat for points. This was the standard for battle royal gameplay but has sadly taken a major downward spiral and is no longer worth playing. I do not recommend this game even if on sale. Just go play Fortnite if you want a Battle Royal experience. At least its free and you can earn your goodies or at least if you buy them you know what you are getting.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I played it about 3 hours and I get bored. The game was awful and a bit of grind.there was no fun for me in that game . after that when PUBG released at first I said this game is similar to that and you should do repetitive stuff again and gain nothing instead.months were gone and PUBG got more and more popular and by the time I became interested in it. again another of my friends gifted PUBG for me this time. I played it and I get addicted to it . its a ing hell of out a game.I never imagined someday I will enjoy this types of games ( Battle Royale ) but it's interesting and it's even getting more interesting with friends. The game has a decent gameplay with a lot of details and full of potential for future. Devs are responsive and the community is good. there are a bit of hacker but against CS GO it's nothing to compare. that's why CS GO is kinda dead.even the other popular valve production Dota 2 is going to be dead ( The Game already beats Dota 2 in players in just 6 months ). and it shows how it will go when you answer to the community and the gamers .and not just thinking about earning more money from Skins and Sets and microtransactions.there is no toxic community because they care about even 1 report it's an amazing thing that you will never find out in Dota 2 Or CS GO ( strangers will make you sick in both )I hope the Devs keep doing it and don't get lost themselves for more money.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-04-12,0,0,608,True,Recommended,As a person who has put 70 hours in 4 days I can easily say this game is great. Pros The gunplay is good. The hitboxes can be improved slightly but over all it has a very solid combat system almost comparable to ARMA 3. The Teamplay is great. If you have a group of 4 friends this game is an absolute gem as teamwork is essential to winning and when you do win it feels very gratifying. If you do not have anyone to play with you can easily head to the PUBG Discord and you'll find hundreds of people to play with. You can also queue up for matchmaking and be put into a squad with random people. The Graphics are very decent compared to other Battle Royal/Early Access games. The game is stunning when the graphic settings are turned up. If your PC is not strong enough to run the game comfortably you can used the SM4 launch command to degrade the graphics/shaders to make the game run slightly better netting you more fps. The Map is fantastic. As an avid ARMA player having a good map is everything and this game delivers well. The map is well balanced has everything from small cities to big ones open fields to tight corridors and CQC beaches and mountains and most importantly loot. Going to military bases shooting ranges unground bunkers is very risky but is also very rewarding getting you all the high grade weapons attachments and equipment. The element of surprise reward and excitement is very strong. This game is packed with action especially in the early and late game. You are never guaranteed safety in risky situations but if you do them correctly you will be rewarded well with loot positioning vehicles and maybe even winning the game. High risk High reward. The DEVs are actually good. Most Early Access games' DEVs are very money hungry charging money for skins by the first update. This is not the case here !So Far!. It's quoted by the DEVs that there will be daily patches for server/client optimisation weekly patches for client/game optimisation and bug fixing and monthly patches for new content and weapon/equipment/vehicle/gameplay balancing. Cons The optimisation is really bad. the fact that a friend of mine with an i5 and a GTX 1070 has the same performance as me with an i7 and a GTX 960 shouldn't really be valid as he clearly has the superior rig when it comes to gaming. In short it seems the game is CPU heavy From my experience . You can do a couple of things to make the game work better like optimising your own settings and used Steam launch commands but there really shouldn't be a need to do all these things. The midgame is very boring. Unlike the action packed early and late game the mid game is uninteresting and stale. You will spend most of the time either just looting or simply camping in a building waiting for the next circle update. Rarely you'd be able to fight another person/squad but with the circles being so big in the early stages it is very uncommon unless there is a high amount of people alive. Some of the car physics are a bit over the top. You can flip your car really easily from the slightlest bump if you're going anything over 40KPH. This point is very subjective because some of the people I play with think otherwise. Their counter argument is that it makes it less forgiving when you hit max speeds without any caution. The Servers aren't the greatest. Now this like the optimisation is probably going to be temporary as the game is already being patched. In the early game there is A LOT and I mean a lot of lagging and rubber banding due to the 100 player count. The lag will decrease as players die and will eventually stablise at around 50/60 players. This makes the early game slightly difficult to handle.All in all I would definitely recommend this game to anyone who enjoys action games and/or has played ARMA/H1Z1. The game is definitely flawed albiet not as flawed as other early access games but it sure is fun and competitive. I will rate this game a solid 8/10 in its current stage.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-06-23,0,0,232,True,Recommended,Decided to pick up this game a few days back. I didn't come accross any bugs until last night. Many people complained about not seeing buildings etc on landing however that was not my problem. Allow me to tell the story of the eating rock. It was saturday morning roughly 3 AM when me and my norwegian friend were under some heavy fire near the airfield. The barrier was closing in on us so we had to travel towards the zone. After 2 minutes of sprinting we made it only to be shot at by a kar98k. The guy was a half decent shot and hit me a few times but backed off once the next zone started to come inwards. We made another run for it and in doing so we killed a few more people. We came under some more heavy fire near the bridge and my friend got knocked out. He decided to get behind a rock to where i could revive him however we didn't realise it was a trap. As i picked him up i began to run towards the next area but realised something was holding me back. It was a rock. I did everything i could to get out of its grips. My friend even shot me in an attempt to revive me outside the rock. This was not the case. The rock had a firm grip on my assh*le and would not release me. My friend said something in norwegian as he ran off into the sunset leaving me to die. The barrier slowly came inwards and took my life. A not so amazing way to end a game. Unfortunate to say the least. Best of luck to anyone who also finds themselves stuck inside this rock. Tugg Speedman,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-09,0,0,4,True,Not Recommended,If you can get a game started and actually start playing the game is great. It's a lot of fun.The problem is that's nearly impossible. In my 90 minutes of playing I've had maybe 20 minute of gameplay. I've joined maybe 6 games and have gotten to the ground 3 times. The other 3 times I've been disconnected or my game crashed while in the lobby or plane. 2 times I got to the ground all the buildings weren't loaded properly and didn't have any textures so I couldn't see doors or anything on the ground. I got inside a building one of these times by seemingly walking through a wall. My game froze and when it was working again I was dead.I did get to actually play one time. I landed on a roof and 2 minutes later the buildings started working properly. so I could actually walk through them and find stuff. I was in a squad of 4 and we were in the watery town. I found a shotgun and pistol. Me and another guy were walking through town when an enemy walked right in front of us. I downed him in the water and we couldn't shoot him after that because bullets apparently don't go through 2 inches of water. We had to wait until he bled out to loot him. After that the game worked perfectly and we actually ended up in 4th place. It was a fun experience but not worth the pain of trying to find a decent game.If they fix this I'll edit my review.

2018-08-02,0,0,1428,False,Recommended,I have been playing PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS from early access. I know there are lots of negative reviews out there and I do understand why. This game did not start off as a polished game. Even after version 1.0 came out it has been like a beta. But you have to take into accont that this game is not expensive you are not forking out over $100 like you would for Battlefield 4 etcWhats great about this game is the level of competativeness that comes with the battleroyal format. You need to take this game with a level of seriouness otherwise you will just die round afrer round with little to no reward.Even with all it's faults (which slowly get fixed with every update) I find this game way more challenging than the average FPS. Working your way to the top 10 is very exciting and rewarding in itsself. Something you just can't get from spawn &amp die spawn &amp die type of games.Keep in mind it can be hard to match a game in some regions like OC if you want to play Solo or duo in FPP which is extreemly disapointing. I wish this game never came out with TPP.If you can spare the money give this game a try.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-08-02,0,0,732,False,Not Recommended,I definately wouldn't recommend this game when everything works as it should it can be very fun even in solo. The main reason i won't recommend it is because of the guys who run the game they seem to only have interest in money these days but thats just my opinion. I had a long break from the game and only came back to it yesterday and played roughly 8 10 games i think and encountered someone using aimbot i was spectating because i came top 10 and thought id just see who wins and the dude in question was shooting from the hip with a AK and whilst the gun was recoiling it would snap back on to the target then just earlier i was on Sanhok solo and 2 dudes appear at a window trying to shoot me (and failing as well which was amusing) obviously teaming but still somehow killed them both xD. This game has a tendency of leaving a sour taste in my mouth.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I can play 1 game every time and then as soon as i finish one game crashes.

Just starting up and keeping going.I'll crash every once in a blue moon during a game then of course... have to try to start it up again multiple times hopefully getting back in on time before dying.Game runs like on the xbox one as well so ... not sure why i expected different on here.

But please fix your BIGGEST problems first before you update it anymore.I'll give you a hint of what it is your server.I don't know anything about developing games. But i do know that if you want this game to keep being this popular you'll at least need a strong enough server to contain your massively growing player base because your server right now sometimes suck. However many updates you guys bring to pubg however good the game will be once you give it more content it'll all be pointless if the players can't even play the game because too many logins or the server is closed. Like when you want to build a skycraper you will need a strong foundation.

2018-01-28,0,0,9,False,Not Recommended,This is a crap game. Don't believe the trailer that Steam has up. You will NEVER experience gameplay like that. It's only #1 played because a game can last 30 minutes. Player interaction is what makes a game. In that 30 minutes you may not even see ANY other players until you die and you still may not see them. A typical game consists of 98% alone time where you're scavenging for weapons and accessories. It's completely up to chance whether the person you run into has a better weapon than you. I strongly dislike that luck determines the outcome in what is seemingly advertised as a tactical game. If you don't like snipers or people who don't play the obj in battlefield you won't like this game because it rewards that type of play. There is no obj. You basically hide until you're forced into a small area by the blue kill zone. So it's 25 minutes of trying to scavenge a good weapon only to be shot in the back of the head by someone who's already camping under a tree. The game mechanics are very poor. No precision. To me it's pretty much like being the victim of lag all the time. There is realism and then there's just poor game making this is the ladder. If you're a battlefield sniper who isn't a team player and never goes for the obj and camps 100% of the time then you will love this game. Also no one likes you.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-07,0,0,45,True,Recommended,After 24 hours of playing I can safely say this is one of the best Battle Royale games I have played! When you join a game you must jump from a plane land and gather supplies to stay alive and win the illusive 'Chicken Dinner' The game has a lot of In Game Customisation You are able to attach sights and other gadgets to your weapons at any time and you can find armour and helmets to keep you from harm The vehicles are fun to drive around in but most of the time you will be driving away from the barrier that is slowly coming towards you The game keeps the match progressing by using the barrier like all battle royale games and if your lucky you can try grabbing loot from an airdrop but its a risky challenge.The game is at it's best when you are playing with friends in a squad match using teamwork and coordination to survive.To wrap up this review I would recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of the FPS genre and Battle Royale games.Good luck And see you on the battlefield.CHICKEN DINNER FTW,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-23,0,0,146,False,Not Recommended,I'll preface this by saying I really like the game in general. The dealbreaker for me and maybe for you is the gunplay if you've ever played Arma and the sluggish and odd gunplay is not for you then don't buy this game. The game mechanics are sound it's an interesting game the circle adds tons of tension during late game and everything seems to be decently balanced the only problem is how strange the gunplay feels. Weapons are sluggish bullet spray from hipfire is completely and totally random (no patterns) so it can be extremely hard to hipfire while ADS is not reliable either against a moving target because of how strange and jerky the movement can be. It's very much arcade style movement and Arma style gunplay with very low tolerance for mistakes. At the moment with how cruddy the gunplay tends to be and the weirdness of the movement that's a dead breaker. You'll die more often in close quarters gunfights to wonky gunplay than you will to an enemy with more skill than you.Edit 5/10/2018 gunplay still sucks I've played a lot because my friends play but gunplay is seriously ing terrible.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

When near the school proceed to eject regardless even if there are more than 20 people also going to the school which is a highly likely possibility.3. Land on the roof of the school and hope there is a gun around. (RNG at its finest)4. Proceed to murdering more than 3 people in a span of 10 seconds.However you will die 99% of the time so try again. Try until you able to massacre everyone like the hidden psychopathic maniac you are in real life and have the school to yourself. This will guarantee you to be placed in the top 5.However again you proceed to lose and come 6th and you blame it on luck. No it's just that you are bad at aiming you already have all the loot from the school what more could you ask for?*Disclaimer* When solo queueing 80% of the game is RNG 15% is skill and 5% is you hoping the game doesn't ing teleport you even though you have perfectly stable internet connection randomly drop 100 fps to like 30 fps and miss a point blank headshot because of some ing t hit registration issue however you ain't lucky and you proceed to get 360 noscoped which ends up in you uninstalling the game.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Kinda like a lot of survival games that have come out and either failed or did okay for a while. But PUBG has something I haven't found in any other and that's suspense. It's the will he see me? Will he hear me? Can I make a run for it? Is this an ambush? Moments that make you come back again and again. It's those moments that make your heart race as you stay alive while so many others have fallen it's those moments that make you wake up early from sweet dreams of PUBG ready for more PUBG!

2017-07-16,0,0,267,True,Not Recommended,This game has taken concepts from other games such as Dayz and H1Z1 and polished it a tiny bit to make it playable. The game falls short in most areas in terms of playability. Moving around objects is a hassle. You can't climb small objects. The aiming can go crazy sometime resulting in a player who is looking out a window shooting directly down and hitting the window instead of shooting straight. You can't lay down in places that more than enough space for you to lay down on. You can't even pistole whip with your weapon for some reason. Now the life of this game is heavily dependant on the community...which is bad. The lobbies are filled with kids screaming the N word or just screaming into the mic. When you join a squad game most of the time they just betray you and take your items because there is 3 of them and only one of you. The game doesn't have a punish or report system for teamkilling so you are screwed. Unless you want to play solo on the same map with a unposlished shooter wait till they fix the game if they ever do.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-07-16,0,0,102,True,Recommended,Still some work needed to be done to the game but other than that it is becomming a great game,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-07-16,0,0,92,True,Not Recommended,It's a terrible game in it's current state. The hint counters are still not accurate. The death screen tells me I received a headshot by someone while the only thing he could hit me were my feet. Not to mention that a SCAR is supposed to insta kill you when on full health with level 1 armor when someone hits your feet. And regardless of the complaints on the forums the developers do not give a damn about it.The gameplay is just plain boring in my opinion especially if your computer is running at the minimum requirements to play the game and all your settings are low. Close quarters combat 9/10 times you're dead before firing a single shot because your enemies see you before you see them due to the FPS difference I would assume. Sometimes it's possible to just get killed without seeing the guy who shot you.The recent 25 000 player banwave the devs did doesn't seem to really help. Or my computer stopped loading in players (?) considering I've had multiple occasions where someone ran up to me in an open area I hear their footsteps hear them firing at me but they do not show up till the last second.Overall game has potential if you have a high end gaming computer. For homegrown potato computers this game is trash. Rich kids will have an advantage over you and unless you're playing with friends who can carry you you probably won't win because every single game eventually ends in close quarter combat. The fact that you die early game isn't that bad but it becomes bad when you die five times over because you end up in close quarter combat with someone with a much better computer than you.Although I'm aware that this game obviously states Battlegrounds. And is made for Battle Royale I'd much prefer to see some kind of survival mod or game mode in this game that'd atleast make it a bit more fun for me personally because there'd be less PvP and rather PvE content with a survival aspect where hopefully you have the feeling of progressing somewhere. As the current clothing system doesn't feel very progressive. (Keep getting the same items).,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-10-17,0,0,269,True,Not Recommended,This game is so flawed that its so frustrating. Sure I'll still play it but there are so many broken features they need to fix. First off the hit registration. This game's hit boxes are so inconsistent that it is infuriatingSecond the vehicles. This game's physics is the most demented thing i've seen. You drive straight on a cornfield and then randomly do a flip and instantly die. Not only that if you try to fit some cars through small gaps 40% of the time they get stuck 20% of the time they actually get through and the other 40% they just randomly blow up.Third (this isn't the game's fault) is the community. Every player in this game abuses the third person perspective so much that it makes it simply not fun. About 90% of the deaths by players in this game will because the person who killed you saw you the whole time while hiding behind a wall so they're not visible to you. Personally if you want to keep your sanity i reccomend either have friends to play with or just don't install this game. At least not until they fix the hit registration and the physics. Oh and also making it so that North American players don't default into the Asian servers would be nice too,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-04-08,0,0,54,False,Not Recommended,Is this game fun and addicting? yes yes it is. But there are a few times I've looked back on some deaths and have seen people shoot me without even having me in sight....at all...so yes there are hackers and hopefully the devs care enough to fix that I don't even know why people hack in the first place it's not a hard game really. AND if it is a cause of let's say lag then there are ways to fix that like any other game has done. If you don't want to kick players off because obviously that would suck you could still add a lag meter to determine it and help you fix your development issues. STILL this is fixable and regular lag is usual a delay or phantom bulling. However back to the other point shooting in a game is NOT impossible or hard..so what's the fun in not even trying when it feels way better to do it all on your own?

That is a massive improvement compared to before when everything looked like Play Doh and buildings never appeared.But this cheating problem which I'm guessing has started because China wants to prove that ""They are number 1."" is really hurting the game and experience for many players. If the majority of cheaters are from China then region lock them (and other regions tbh) so they can see whose cheats are better who has the better programming skills or the fattest wallet if you're not going to fix the Anti Cheat.Other than that the game is still as addictive and fun as ever with each update polishing the mechanics to make the game better.

Mostly nightmares.But I've never played a game with such great interest. Typically I play a competitive game for 150 hours &amp it gets boring to me but this game never changes. It's always something new EVERY single game. It's had its ups and downs and still has a few bugs. But the development team has been very consistant at fixing whatever has been thrown at them. The graphics are pretty well a little more optimization wouldn't hurt at all. When you first start playing the game you should really expect to play like for the first couple hours until you get the mechanics down. The game runs smooth around 50 FPS however my machine runs it at about 110FPS (i5 6500 &amp GTX 1060 ultra settings). This game has so much potential and I think it is a must have for every steam library.

It just hangs at the background and I have to End Task. The other is lagging out. I think the servers may be crashing out because in twos it happens to both of us. It starts lagging bad then kicks us out.Guns like everything so far but haven't had enough time to fully get a feel. Attachments are awesomeCars love all the vehicle spawns... easy to find and not OP.Loot Balance in KOTK I can loot 5 houses in the time I can loot one or two in PUBG. Sometimes I will go to 4 before I find a backpack and/or helmet. It would be nice if the loot was tweaked. I feel like KOTK is more geared around giving an advantage to who gets good stuff and PUBG is more geared to give advantage to those that are more tactical and cautious. I don't thing RNG has a place in this gameGameplay everything is smooth... I love it. Looting feels natural and weapons/attachments are cool. I get very bored mid game however. Everyone just goes in a building and hides. In two games I drove all over the circle twice and never seen anyone or got shot out. Eventually I seen a person in a window. They hid once I stopped. I've only made it to the end twice because I get bored and start rushing houses.I don't know how to solve my major complaint... I don't want any major rule changes... maybe some sort of incentive to get out and about but not necessarily any kind of penalty. I don't like penalizing a play style but it would be cool if there was a reason that made u want to get out.It's easy to say ""don't go in houses mid game"" but damn I get bored after sitting around a few minutes.

2018-08-06,0,0,724,False,Recommended,PUBG was one the first ever Battle Royale game i've ever played had lots of laughs great times and an amazing gaming experience. But over the past few months i got very bored of it and the content coming out wasn't sparking my interest.Would i recommend buying this game? Yes and no Yes because it is a realistic shooter and alot of players like myself love realism. No because of the price and the content that the devs are producing it just isn't tasteful and gets really stale even though the gun fights are amazing and alot of factors such as the vehicles and the healing system gives it such a realistic feel i'm still very Iffy on prefering this game over other games. Maybe if the price came down yes but bascially 30 bucks for a game that has gone down the drain isn't worth it in its past days yes but with all the other Battle Royales coming out and with the pre exisiting game Fortnite that is skyrocketting in perfomance and player base and great content PUBG is struggling at the moment and there reviews aren't getting any better if you wanna try the game do so YES IT IS VERY POSSIBLE TO STILL HAVE FUN ON THIS GAME it's still one of my favorite games on steam just it got kinda boring and is in a rut will i come back to it? Yeah some day but not too soon.

2018-05-26,0,0,334,False,Not Recommended,"Should have seen this one coming when I broke my common rule of not buying games that are in Early Access. This game is a complete joke at this point. I don't regret buying the game when it was new and interesting I regret that my money helped cement in the devs' minds that they can let their game go to and still make a profit. You may as well be spending your money on a game like Goat Sim if you want a game as buggy and unfinished as this. In Goat Sim that was intentional but here it's just lazy. All you'll find here is unreliable mechanics mixed with grabage optimization and a team of devs who realized a long time ago that they dont have to actually improve the game for it to do well. This game just feels like and emptier buggier version of any other Battle Royale on the market. It's a shame this BR game came out before the others because the unique appeal of the game when it was first available actually made the game sell well. Now that every other verison of this kind of game feels just about finished you're left with what is pretty much DayZ Battle Royale. Saying this game isn't early access is the worst part of the whole game. Just admit your game isn't ready yet and work to improve it instead of rushing it out as a ""finished game"" and never adding neccessary changes again. What happened to PUBG is an example of why you should wait to buy any new popular game. The success can often cause the game improvement to stagnate and then all the copy cat games end up being 10x better in the end. The only reason this game has any playtime on my account anymore is that I continue to let other people play the game on my account. Personally I've drifted away to other games and the shiny new toy that once was the Battle Royale Genre is now a smoldering pile of garabage.Just stop giving these people money. Please. I no longer care about PUBG or its development but I really do hope this review can help someone save $30 dollars. So what else could you spend that $30 on? Here's just a few suggestions. If you're a fan of large world exploration games that aren't linear and have some challenge behind hack n' slash mechanics look into Hyper Light Drifter . It's a really great game and it's soundtrack is just wonderful.Did you enjoy Super Mario 64 Banjo Kazooie Psychonauts and other 3D open world platformers of the sort? A Hat in Time is a great modern game that fits right into that category. It's also got a great soundtrack as well as fun and polished mechanics that envoke the best parts of classic platformers. There's some really passion behind the game. Celeste was a pretty big game for a while and if you enjoy 2D platformers of any kind you'll likely enjoy it. It never feels too hard or too easy and there are plenty of ways to get through the game no matter how skilled you are. If you enjoy simple mechanics but difficult games Getting Over It with Bennett Foddy is a great. Your first time playing through the game will take many hours and will challenge you a lot but once you play through the game you want to go again. I've fully beaten the game 109 times and now take roughly 5 minutes to play all the way through. For just $8 dollars this game provides plenty of entertainment. And to end all this Yeah Fortnite has cartoony graphics and minecraft style building but at least it's free runs well is fast paced and ACTUALLY WORKS most of the time. It's basically everything this game lacks. If you are really so turned off by the visuals and typically younger community of Fortnite that you won't even try it I don't see why you'd settle for a game in its Alpha build that claims to be a finished product. I think Fortnite is objectively a better experience than PUBG and I'm not even a huge fan of their game in the first place.Not gonna proofread this. I just had to get the salt out.//End Pointless Rant//",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-05-26,0,0,443,False,Recommended,The game is good not perfect. For every two steps forward they take one step back. So while they are improving on the game it is taking a long time but it has gotten significantly better since the beginning. I experience some FPS drops and net code issues (not a ton) but everyone's experience seems to be subjective. Anyone who plays this thinking it will run as smooth Fortnite is in for a bad surprise.I like this game because it seems to be the only option out there that has gun/bullet physics. Bullet drop and recoil are real and if you can't properly adjust to them you will shoot like a potato.Cons Bad optimization Bad netcode Quality of life changes seem to take forever and some bugs/glitches seem to still be in the game The team seems to be more focused on loot boxes Communication has been mediocre overall but has been getting better recently.Pros Gun play requires skill and is very satisfying Slowly but steadily improving Once the new map is released (Sanhok) they will have three maps with very distinct enviornments.In conclusion I have fun playing the game but if another developer comes out with a BR game that runs smoother and has gun/bullet physics I will jump ship.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-18,0,0,920,True,Recommended,"After 150 hours played I feel confident enough in my opinion of this game.Is it a perfect game? No it is not but as of right now it is the best existing game for the battle royale genre which much better netcode and gunplay core mechanics than H1Z1 and more depth than others. The gunplay is quite realistic the guns sound exactly as they should sound adjusts itself dynamically to the distance it has been fired from. The bullet drop takes a very important place in the game and is consistent along with a gun given effective range. The gunplay mechanics overall are pretty consistent avoiding the frustrations of a bug related loss.The gun variety is definitely there you will rarely end up with the same weaponry every game unless looting multiple bodies. This forces the player to adjust to the loot and is exactly what makes the charm of this game. In PUBG everything is about adapting to the situation the zone shrink cannot be predicted to an exact perimeter the loot cannot be predicted the outward movements of other players can be anticipated but not predicted. This whole makes for a unique and different experience every single game.The community is fairly great so far toxicity levels are low compared to most multiplayer pvp games I have played I have very rarely assisted to team killing even in random teams nobody will T Bag your body.While graphics and optimization are not at their best yet the gamer did make some major improvements over time with developpers being transparent about their work releasing weekly patch notes with bug fixes new features etc. Obviously for those looking for the best graphics and the best performance then this game is definitely not for you. Surround sound implementation is ""fine"" as of right now. While it may not be the best I have ever seen you are still able to tell roughly where a close enemy is moving from around you using surround sound as well as hear vehicules and shots from afar.Overall for it's price you are getting a lot of hours of gun it is only fair that I would recommend this game.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-05,0,0,3,False,Not Recommended,"Nothing special about this game. I've seen better with the same price tag. Frankly I'm disappointed. I only bought it due to my friends having it and wanting me to play with them. I feel scammed out of my money. To start off the game logs you into a lobby full of 99 other people. This is probably where you will get the most fun out of the game. Not only do you get the priveledge of hearing 12 year olds advertise their twitch streams to everybody on the server. But you also get to hear third world baboons scream obscenities and racial slures every five seconds on a North American server no less. Why Brazilians and Russians will never stick to their own servers? I'll never know. After a minute or so. Everybody teleports into what it appears to me to be an AC130 where you are forced to parachute and jump down onto a remote island and where you want to jump and where you want to land is up to you.When you hit the ground one or two things will happen to you. You will either fight other people over a pair of pants and a red bull or you will land so far away from everyone else that you spend the entire game running to a mark location on the map without getting your handed to you by some kind of invisible geo storm hoping the enemie doesn't shoot you in the back of the ing head. There is nothing fun or amazing about parachuting into a deserted town and ransacking a two story building only to find a frying pan and a pair of boots when the guy in the house 30 feet away from you already has a level 2 helment backpack bullet proof vest shot gun ak and a revolver. Oh and he happens to get every med kit that happens to spawn within a mile radius. I guess to some people the scavenging for this is fun. To me it's not. Luck should not be part of any shooting game. And if you happen to land too far off from the ""circle of death"" I like to call it. Well kid you will need to put your running shoes on or you will be killed in this circle of death that forces people out of camping and into the center of the map. I played for 2 hours and only saw one vehicle and when I finally did get to ride it it handled like an air boat from half life 2. When it comes to guns. The only time you can actually practice with them is in the ing lobby. How the hell are you suppose to get good at shooting if you can't practice in the game without giving away your position instantly? So when the game gets to a point when everyone is in the middle of the map because of the death circle forcing them to. Everyone is just lying prone on the ground hiding or behind a tree camping waiting for someone else to pop up. That isn't fun. None of this is fun. All you do in this game is scavenge for items and run to a generated spot on the map while you try to avoid getting killed. And it's the same thing. Each and every time. After I played my fourth game I realized I wasn't going to experience anything new. The only reason why people would play this game is because they are either trying to be the next twich celebrity or they just have horrible taste in video games and are ok with playing this years game of running through an open field and getting shot in the back of the ing head simulator.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The company ended up prioritsing cashing in on the game by trying to release as much content as possible without double checking if it was release ready. This meant two new maps and multiple different platform ports before they decided it time to actually focus on fixing the game and optimizing it. Even the Xbox version was unplayable with rendering being below 30 fps. Now after all this time after the population hit approx 600k they decide to launch a ""lets fix the game guise"" campaign.

2018-01-21,0,0,102,False,Not Recommended,This game runs way better than it used to looks great and is generally a great experience if you like multiplayer short burst shooting action. HOWEVER If you speak English (which Im sure you do) dont expect to be able to play squad or duos without friends filling the lobby. If you dont you will ALWAYS get a Chinese person or 3 in your team. Along with that theres hackers that seem to be a Chinese players a majority of the timeThere is no Region Lock and thats sad for a game of this size. In my opinion the lack of Region Lock ruined this game. It was very fun even addicting up until a few months ago. Now you cant even take the game seriously. If I could refund this game I would have already. Very dissappointing. If you want to have some Battle Royale fun play Fortnite its free and theres a lot less hackers and you can expect to at least have English speaking teammates. If they update the game with Region Lock and better anti hacks then I would highly recommend this game to any FPS fan.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I think that this is an incredibly foolish step for Bluehole to take as this game is not nearly as finished as they think it is. It's still very VERY buggy. It isn't optimised at all I have a GTX 1060 6GB and this game very rarely gets a constant 60 fps. In fact I don't think I've EVER gotten a stable 60 fps it's just 40fps and sometimes 30. And for the love of god it's not ing eSport ready. Theres one hundred people in one server how can the casters possibly be keeping track of everything that goes on?Bluehole please this game isn't ready for release and it certainly isn't ing ready for eSports. Delay it and fix all of it's problems before you release this hot garbage (but fun hot garbage) of a game.That was my original review.The game has now released and my opinion has changed. They have mostly fixed the optimisation issues and polished the game to the point where its now an enjoyable experience to play with friends. I do recommend buying and playing this game.There is one issue however. There are many asian players in Oceania which have access to hacks and have other issues. Why there are asian players on an Oceania server is beyond me and while this wouldn't really be much of an issue if they didn't hack and lag and whatnot it is an issue.

Also the inventory screen is not as efficient as it really could be and takes too damn long to equip stuff with the whole drag and drop thing...It's somewhat fun and had a lot of potential but really think this game NEEDS more work to make it more interesting (especially with aiming and reloading).

The ing aim is so bad once again i was with my friends and he sot at point blank range with an akm and missed all 6 shots while the enemy and him were standing still (it also wasnt rapid firing either)7) If you do NOT have friends to play this game with then you will be so ing bored Anyways thats all that i can remember but if i were to rate this game id rate it... 8.631/10 Good game,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-01-19,0,0,42,False,Not Recommended,Its a highly controversal game and now I understand why. I was bored and wanted to try a new shooter. I bought this and played for a couple of hours both in duo and solo games. Its very difficult shooter to get into for new comers and will punish you in many ways. Dont have high expectations for this game I know I didnt and I dont regret buying it as much and the low price tag. Dont expect to win or get over 5 kills either. Youre matched against 100 players all surviving to get that chicken dinner the odds are really stacked against you. Its an okay shooter but dont fall into the hype. Either try to have fun with the game for what it is or save your money for something else. Here are my criticisms of the game.The gun play is alright but the hit reg/connection is horrible. Probably one of the worst since DayZ. There should be another game mode besides the battle royale.They should work on region locking which I dont think they are going to do no matter how many complain.The sound isnt optimized right very hard to pinpoint where the sound of gunfire is coming from even if you do turn up the volume. You are only damaging your ears. This game shouldnt be out of early access dont know why they took it out to begin with. The game is still very flawed.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Why don't you just buy more servers with your money? Or just buy a better game? And HOW ING DARE YOU ADD MICROTRANSACTIONS made of cosmetics TO HELP FUND A TOURNAMENT! I havn't been this mad since Valve did that for X number of years with DOTA and CS GO. Don't they know they should just put in all the money we gave them to fund things that require event staff location broadcasting etc. when all it REQUIRES is the game. GAAWWWWWWWWWWWWWDDDDDDDDDD!That's basically what you get from most of these bad reviews. Granted PR and responding/cattering to streamers is kind of trash. But that is the only fault I have found with the game as I am a level headed individual who understands you can't just reboot a game in a matter of months.Do you have mates to play with?Are you okay with 1/100 1/50 or 1/25 odds with a flat denominator assuming you are on the same level as everyone else?Do you like FPS?Then it is a good game.

There are too many instances where you get screwed over by the parachute getting ""caught"" on something (or not at all) and you take fall damage. Remove fall damage while the parachute is still attached to the player. 2 Fix the vehicles spinning out of control for no realson and doing ridiculous crap while driving. Players die way too often from a motorcycle hitting the smallest of micro terrain and the bike going Evel Knievel on them and killing the person.

The concept will let you keep playing as you battle for first in the best battle royale available on pc. You can also bring your buddy along with the whole squad to fight for number 1. Just remember to record each wacky moment ). On the other hand the devs just introduced a payed system in which you can by keys to open specific boxes. However there are free boxes for you to earn too. Personally I didn't like this new idea as it will milk the game just like csgo. I do recommend this game for you and your friends.

The other worst problem is the Chinese hacking problem....since the unlock of the Chinese into the European and US servers the hacking problem has increased 10fold. Majority of players in any game are Chinese majority use the same weapons (UMP) and are usually at the top of the leaderboards. If u can tell that I am salty about the Chinese problem its because I am. The rampant cheating that goes ignored by the chinese playerbase in US and European servers is the biggest problem with this game atm and is what has soured my enjoyement of the game.

Yes they do release new content and fix bugs but they forget about the most important thing. ASIAN HACKERS I know not all asians are hackers but it is annoying to be playing and make it into the top 10 and get killed by hackers. It is so bad that I got into a squad match and it was a chinese person I asked if he was hacking and he said yes... we ended up winning because he got a double kill hacking. Also the chinese people do not know how to speak english so have fun communicated. Until the devs region lock the game I may decide to quit. It's not about being racist and taking their rights away to play in the U.S it's about making the game a fair playing field.

2018-01-22,0,0,625,False,Recommended,"This is one of my most played games on Steam. I enjoy this game a lot because of the overall gameplay. To me the looting is satisfying as is killing people. However getting a chicken dinner is probably one of the best feelings in the world. Because in the end you bested 96 to 99 other people and you're just like ""heck yeah man let's go my dude"". Then you get coins and buy crates and hope to get good stuff but you usually don't. That is probably one of my only complaints about this game is the RNG with getting aesthetic items from the crates. I have spent over four hundred hours in game and do not have much to show for it. I guess I take off my clothes anyways to help me not stick out but idk man. I play this game on my garbage computer on ultra low settings and manage to win still so you can too probably. Bluehole is currently working on combatting aimbotters but they are still very apparent and losing to one is pretty horrible. Once aimbotters get taken care of it won't be nearly as infuriating. $29.99 might seem like a high price tag which is what my initial thought was but after putting in quite a bit of time to H1Z1 I am very glad I got this game and started to play it more than the other.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Obviously my opinion means nothing to these guys because theyve made millions thanks to twitch but this is a game. Its fun on occassion dont get me wrong. Had some fun moments but its issues are absolutely out doing anything positive about this game.If theyd have kept ot FTP optimised it made it run smooth with less issues and add basic mechanics like vaulting (took nearly 12 months to add the upmost basic mechanic in 2017 btw lol) THEN when its all good release it at a full priced game done. Absolutely great job take my money. Any skins? Sweet ill buy some of them too. But no. As it shouldnt suprise any consumer money bags filled where their passion should be.

The game has gone to total now more than ever and as if problems were bad back then and still in a fixing stage they got progressively worse and more came on board as well as the lack of performance development and other strategies generally taken by good game devolping companies...key word ""good.""The streamers are a big issue and devs. should not base their opinions nor focus on them because they are not the soul for the games nor the true ""real"" money behind them either...in fact if a study were to be made the game would still have been bought by a ton more gamers whom wouldn't have needed to watch streams of this game or any sort of streaming just plain want to play a game hands down guaran****ingteed.The bans oh my have the bans sucked. Banning for the wrong reason no true replay system involved no really needed bans being done its plain horrible. The average amount of hacking in this game has sky rocketed in the past 6 months and again progressively getting worse.Let's talk about my previous review real quick server integration good or bad? It's good for when trying to maximize the server populations for games to start and the bloodshed/carnage begin but horrible for team comms strategy all across the board when you can't speak another language or have to bust out a translator. Being able to pick and choose your domain of gaming such as EU NA KO etc...still smart but integrating them...nah.Mr.Grinch I mean Green..........Get off your actually run a good dev. team and give some orders for once to fix your broken game that is still well in a premature state and not even ready.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Glitch and bug fixes? No way. Event pass for sale? Sure. Invitational tournament tickets for sale? Sure. New locked loot crates that you have to buy keys for? Absolutely. Literally every day when I log onto steam the newest steam news article about PUBG is something they're launching or rolling out that Blue Hole can try to make money off of.Is the game worth $30? Yeah frankly it is. I've logged enough game time to more than say that I've recouped my money invested. However at this stage in the game it's already feeling old and phased out due to Blue Hole's lack of urgency in fixing issues and prioritization of profit.

Although the physics especially when driving any kind of vehicle are literally garbage this also leads to a lot of hilarious moments! So when you start the game for the first time and you get into the first couple of games you'll be REALLY disappointed as you'll probably loose your first 50 60 games without getting any kills if you are coming from games like Battlefield 4 or even CS GO. This game has a steep learning curve and is heavily reliant on team work and knowing the map the game physics the different types of guns etc. but once you know all of this you'll have an awesome time and easily get into the top 10 or even win a game every now and then.The steam market is also actually a lot of fun in this game! You can earn crates for free by playing matches and surviving them for as long as possible (""battle points"" as they are called are being calculated by some other things like amount of kills hitpoints etc. as well!) so if you are clever about it you can even earn some cents by playing the game! During the gamescom time i even got so many gamescom crates that i was able to buy PUBG for another friend of mine just from the revenue of the crates! Also none of the items on the steam market are necessary for the game they are like in overwatch purely cosmetical (yet awesome!)So if you like games that are hard as hell are 100% focused on team work look graphically pleasing and you have an i7 6700k and maybe something like a GTX 960 4GB version lying around as well as 16GB of ram (the game uses 10GB on my pc with medium settings on 1080p!) then this game is definitley for you.

2017-08-13,0,0,201,False,Recommended,ever since 1.0 update (which the game is not optimized to even be considered out of early access) my game won't even START UP now. I've uninstalled and redownloaded and it still won't even start up. I can't tell why it is doing this when it worked fine for the 100+ hours I've put in the game before this update but now I payed 30 dollars for a poorly optimized hacker overrun unable to boot game. Would not recommend as the developers are just uncohesive are completely clueless as to what they are doing as I'm positive they are well endowed to fix the issues PUBG presents. 4/10 would not recommend for the current price.Edit I found a fix for the startup issue.

(Messing around) Although the game does has it's flukes it's nothing that they aren't working on. It's a lot better now than it used to be. You'll come across a lot of things that is very funny. We've experienced my friend running at two unaware players and asking if they wanted to have a taco. (We were only playing this round with pans) Yet they were still oblivious. Then to knock one out with the pan and the rest of us go to rush the teammate. Or when my friend Jake was laying in the grass and two guys walked right past him and the third gets stuck on him. Then jumped over his body and kept running. With all of this I can say that it is a blast to mess around and have fun but then also play serious. I can not wait for this game to be so smooth and better in the future. 10/10 Would Pan again.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-26,0,0,61,False,Recommended,Release 1.0 fixed for me server lags/desyncs when shooting which I had during whole early access period and it was gamebreaking now it is finally ok. Overal performance seems also little bit better now.But I think it is kind of a lotery how your PC will handle it and how good or bad will the server performance be for you depending on your region and internet connection. For europe it seems ok now at least for me.It is a very fun concept (battle royale) game engine is still a bit clunky but it is rather good match for this kind of gameplay.If you can play with one or 2 friends than PUBG shines and it can bring really intens gaming moments.So far thumbs up ) I hope they will still work on it and fix technical issues for all players eventually also game engine could still get a little bit more polished.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-05-29,0,0,567,False,Recommended,Im going to start of first and foremost If you're here to play this game competitively to want to tryhard every game and get as many wins and kills as possible you're in for a bad time. because every little bug or issue or slight random thing that happens will just cause you to get angry. This game doesn't do that. this game as an Esport or a competitive game does not work. At least very much not in its current state. Many games can be one or lost purely by the luck of where the final few zones spawn often forcing one team in a good position to move through the open to get into the zone and thus get killed by the team that had the zone spawn on them. HOWEVER! if you're in to have some fun. have a good high tension time get some kills and maybe get lucky and win a few games you'll have a blast. This game excells at heart racing action good teamplay and tactics tense moments and exciting firefights with a little bit of Micheal Bay ness thrown in for good measure. That is what PUBG excells at. I have played with friends who are super serious and tryhard. they hate it they rage. they call the game trash. I then go and play with friends who just play to have fun and we have a blast. That is what this game is best at.There is also this Hackers. yep. there are a lot of them. HOWEVER a good 90% of hackers in this game play in Third person mode only. I can play a week of first person games without meeting a hacker or a cheater on any server. But the second I play third person Its hacker after hacker after hacker. Along with this third person tactics of hide behind walls looking over them and whoever tries to poke or push first loses is legitimately terrible and completely unfun. First person is MUCH better for gameplay overall Which is unfortunate seeing as most people play third person anyway and I honestly don't know why.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-09-20,0,0,845,False,Not Recommended,The game started out with several issues but remained fun to play. Over time the developers have become incredibly greedy. They push more and more locked crates so you need to buy keys to get anything decent in the game. Then they made it so that you can get locked crates using your coins at random so you're not even guaranteed free items after spending dozens of hours playing the game. They fix minor issues and leave the glaring major ones in the game. They have yet to implement any decent anti cheat measures so you will watch replays of getting killed by someone on the other end of the map aiming nearly straight up to compensate for bullet drop and then watching the bullet travel across the entire map to headshot you through bars. I had fun with it every so often but it's become so much of a headache and crashes a lot despite having a really good gaming rig. The servers have hours long maintenance every so often that ends up taking several hours more than estimated because the patches always break something else. There's a reason the playerbase has dropped so sharply so they're selling the game at a discount for the summer sale in the hopes of getting more people to drain money from while pumping out even more locked content and releasing a new map to pretend it isn't all just to get more money. Honestly unless you're absolutely DYING to play a battle royale game I'd avoid this piece of trash that just keeps getting worse over time instead of better.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-06-14,0,0,256,True,Not Recommended,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLECODEThat would be a better title for this horribly coded mess of a game that every round some type of outside force in the code cheats you.This game is full of buggy code and buggy gameplay. Buildings are built so horribly in this game that you can barely shoot out any of the windows in any building crouched or standing without hitting something on the window fully blocking your shot while you are able to get headshotted by the person you're firing at. Also to touch on the scale of objects in the game and why it's so horribly built. I finally figured it out. Its becuase these blueball South Korean 3ft developers didn't know that barrels and other objects placed in the game should be twice the size of your character other than all of its horribly written code that breaks everytime they push an update and getting cheated by horrible map design it's actually a decent game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-28,0,0,171,True,Recommended,It is a really fun game to play worth buying if u wanna have fun and play with your friends. But there are some thing that have to be fixed 1) Performance on good PCs (for the graphics this game has it runs really bad on good PCs it will be fixed I'm pretty sure cuz the game is in early access)2) Crashes the game tends to crash sometimes with no reason.3) Loading time even when using fast SSD sometimes textures load slow and it rly kills the gameplay when you are off the parachute but can't do much4) Banning for ''sniping streamers'' it is such a bs many people get banned of this game when streamers report him for sniping or something that never happened. Such a shame they have privileges over other players when it comes to this. Banning people who randomly kill those streamers is even worse than those salty twitchers reporting them cuz they've got killed... You also can get banned for using a car horn when passing near the streamer... LolThat's it from me...

The game has improved SO MUCH it's almost like a new game at this point and it makes me happy because now I can finally truly enjoy playing it. (Ignoring the occasional aids I acquire from overly sweaty try hards my only complaint is that there isnt a queue for ranked seperate from normal games I play this game with my friends always to win but we dont have the time to practice it enough to be top tier players so when you encounter them in game its slightly unfair and it makes the game not fun momentarily im sure we've all been there.

Does the game have optimization issues? I can run this game with everything at ultra except for shadows and view distance (which aren't needed at ultra)and get a respectable 70+fps stable.So why does this game have so many negative reviews? Most of the community try running this on potato hardware and expect to be pushing high/ultra settings The community is somewhat a bunch of idiots who troll about fortnite and other battle royale gamesIs this game dying? lol absolutely not. over 2 million players daily that's just on PC servers. I never have issues looking for a game. So should you buy it? IF YOU HAVE POTATO HARDWARE NOIF YOU HAVE A WEAK INTERNET CONNECTION NOIf those 2 do NOT apply to you go ahead and pick it up on another gaming site like gee two aye or simply catch it on sale. It's one of the only games since I got it I never put it down over a year ago and the game has seen MAJOR improvements in performance and also gameplay wise with constant new items such as GunsMapsNew items New attachementsNew lootboxes (cosmetic ONLY)and event passes to get special drops. usually a new patch with all new things happen every few months and you can check it out on their facebook page for updates.

2017-04-18,0,0,94,True,Not Recommended,"Edit My original review is below but I'm changing this to ""not recommended"" because the devs are spending their time adding ""micro"" transactions instead of adding new content or fixing the many many bugs and performance issues that plague the game. Also frankly I've kind of gotten bored of the game at this point. There are so many other games I could be playing where I don't have to spend half an hour sneaking around a giant map and tediously looting everything. This game is buggy as and runs like even though I've got 2 GTX 980s in SLI a Core i5 6600K and 16GB of DDR4 memory. There are frequent issues with server lag occassional server crashes and sometimes you'll fall through the ground or find items spawned in weird locations where they can't be picked up....and yet I've already played for 40 hours. Simply put even though the game has a lot of issues in this early state it's so much fun that the issues are easy to overlook. It provides a gameplay experience and a level of engagement that most other titles can't come near even during their most elaborate scripted set pieces. It's one thing to breach a door and execute several enemies in a dramatic slow motion sequence in Call of Duty but it's another thing entirely when you and your squad actually coordinate to pull of the same thing in an open world multiplayer game against a competing group of players.There are two caveats first if you have a low spec system you should probably wait until more optimizations have been made. Second the game isn't nearly as fun when playing solo. You can queue up for squad mode as a solo player but it's much more fun to get a squad of friends in Discord/Steam voice chat so that you can really coordinate. Other than that PUBG is definitely worth playing.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

This game is also highly unstable and crashes pretty often. The developers also just want you to waste your money as most cosmetic items you will need to pay for not only that they ain't cheap $2.99 for a key to open a crate?? And $10.00 for a gun skin and royale pass?? Overall don't waste your money on this game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-07-18,0,0,112,False,Not Recommended,This is one of those thngs where I want to say that I can reccomend a game but I can't which is a shame because the gameplay of PUBG is actually legitimately alot of fun. It's a different experience to your traditonal shooter and gets the pulse up considerbaly more. It can be a little frustrating but that's fine. The reason I can't reccomend it is because Bluehole is probably the single worst example of a company who see's their playerbase as cash cows who they can milk for every last cent rather than as valued customers. I don't have (that much of) a problem with microtransactions but what Bluehole thinks their microtransactions are worth is just straight up offensive. After playing the game to earn ingame currency to purchase a crate they then expect you to pay $2.50 USD for a key to open that crate and receive a random item. $2.50 per crate I'm sorry no. That's just a joke. Bl uehole your pixels are not worth that much. I'de pay a dollar for a pack of 10 keys maybe I'll certainly never pay $2.50 for one. Of course the blatant rip off's dont stop there. COD WWII may be using their events to peddle lootboxes using limited time but at least they have the decency to make the vent free. Not Bluehole though if you even want to participate in tge event you have to dish out another $10 for a ticket for the POSSIBILITY of earning rewards. I didn't pay for this game (a freind bought it for me thanks Adam _ ) but I still feel like I'm being ripped off every time I play it as I wade through the barrage of locked crates Twitch Prime exclusives and MLG event advertisments before I even make it to the game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-04,0,0,89,True,Recommended,Where do I begin? The mechanics feel so fluid and nice. Aiming shooting even moving around is just pleasant to do. The game flows well the vehicles handle decently I could go on. It really is just an upgraded h1z1 which is well worth the extra money. Though the optimization is rather bad with stutters and frame drops occuring literally more often than not. I will uprade my rig soon but I know the stutters should not be so often. However I am not going to go out of my way to give it a negative review over optimization due to me having optimism that it will improve as it leaves early access to invite more players as many steam users do not have the strongest gaming rigs. Not to mention it would be difficult to since it has such fantastic gameplay at its core. As of the moment for users with mid range to low end AMD cards I would not recommend it until it is further improved perhaps after early access. As for Nvidia users I would recommend it as long as you have a mid range build or higher. I do not own both types of cards so don't take my word for it but I have heard stutters were much more common with AMD. As of now 7.5/10. It's difficult to give such a game a lower score than such due to the fantastic gameplay that will leave you glued to your chair for hours as long as you're patient and have had experience with this type of game before.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-04-27,0,0,452,True,Not Recommended,"Synopsis of current patch Loot screwed up Banning 25k cheaters doesn't mean there aren't already brand new cheats for sale. Endgame circles spawn/move so fast that tactical play is essentially non existant after the first three circles. (either you get to camp or you have to run all the time) ""Preventing that the server sends the client too much info"" ( to reduce lag) essentially means invisible people spawned near you. Devs claim there are no cheats in the game and actively lock/remove threads stating otherwise. Third review.Each consecutive patch messes the game up more and more. Inconsistency seeps in at every turn. Either it becomes nigh unplayable due to poor optimization and server lag issues or the combat becomes highly inconsistent. An example After a recent patch I shoot people multiple times with assualt rifles ( 4 7 times) without downing them after more hits than should be required according to the damage statistics of the weapons. In turn I get downed by 1 2 shots max from the opposing end not even receiving a headshot. I'm not recommending this game until the devs learn to code properly.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-30,0,0,220,True,Recommended,I've pumped a decent amount of hours into this game even if it's not a streamer's level of hours... (72 at time of post).It really doesn't take long to pick up this game and be playing like a pro. The hardest part for me has been the fact that the game isn't quite optimized out yet leaving my more than passable system to suffer struggling through low graphics settings and only getting 60 frames max. I'm not ready to upgrade to the top of the line hardware on the market so I just deal with it in this game. It will be much better once it's optimized.The game does not take long at all to pick up if you're already familiar with First Person Shooters. The most difficult part will simply be Positioning and making sure you pick your fights well. Even if you have the best guns and gear never get caught out in the open because a player behind a solid wall can peak around a corner and easily pick you off even if they have only a 9mm handgun.You will need to find a playstyle that suits you. I'm more of a passive player and I will run circles around other players until I have the advantage I need to take them down. Then there are the aggressive players who drop for School building every game and get 6 or 7 kills before the first playzone circle even shows on the map. Or you could be the camper that just hides and waits until there's one other player left.Yes I recommend this game. It's a lot of fun. Maybe too much fun...

2017-08-20,0,0,735,True,Recommended,"This is a really fun game when it works. i know it's beta but it shouldn't be this laggy at times. Everyone plays this game on the lowest graphics setting possible b/c it gives a slight advantage to see enemies and b/c it is laggy as f#*k on high settings. the game looks great on high settings but is unplayable and you are at too bad at a disadvantage on high graphic settings. Too many times i've been killed just waiting for the buildings to load. Now it is not b/c i have a low end computer i can play rift cs go wow wolfenstein rocket league etc on ultra/ max graphics while listening to podcast on itunes and downloading videos with no problem. but with PUBG i can't even run 1 podcast in the background without this game freezing up my computer. its so freaking weird. anyway this is a really fun game when it works but when it doesn't this game is just a power point slideshow. hope they fix this.on a positive the servers all went down today and almost immediately the devs were communicating on social media saying "" we are aware of the server issues and are working to fix"" less then 30 mins later they had fixed the issue. so they dev team is really on the ball and communicate with the community fast. so hopefully they will optimize this game soon because it is good when it works properly.side note if you buy this game watch some youtube vids on first time playing b/c there is NO tutorial and tons of stuff you would never know if someone didnt tell you. really weird for a 2017 game.Edit also a complaint this game does not like blutooth headphones. no idea why everything else i play works perfectly with bluetooth.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Honestly the glitches dont get to me but... HACKERS. CHEATERS EVERYWHERE. I've had the game for awhile and the problem with cheaters only gets worse. Its the best shooter to come out in years and yet I would say DO NO BUY! Until the cheathing problem has been fixed this game is not worth playing. I have been on vacation and haven't played in awhile but played again today. I hav eplayed around 12 games today and 10 of them have been games with excessive amounts of hackers. Withing minutes of the game starting there will be 10 people left due to players getting head shots on targets moving in vehicls with pistols from 700+ meters away. Additionally this game might make you racist. 98% of the cheaters I play with in the NA server are from Asia. You can tell when they kill your squad with one clip of a 1911 pistol and T bag you while yelling at your in Chinese every game. A simple fix of only letting people of a continent playing on their own server would fix most of the hacking issues.

I watched him approach me from far away and despite being next to a tree was able to drive his car into me from behind it somehow. There is NO WAY he saw me from as far as he was.

2017-11-14,0,0,288,True,Recommended,One of the greatest games I've ever played. This game is still rough around the edges but worth the cost all day! This game puts you in directly life or death firefights with only found objects. It encourages multiple fights throughout the game by decreasing the play area size and forcing people into close quarters. Game play and game mechanics are still lacking but I'm sure those things will be straightened out eventually.Many of the game shortfalls can be overcome by tweeking the video settings. Everything should be set to lowest with the exception of Anti Aliasing and view distance. Make those changes and you can see people from much further away without lagging.I highly recommend this game!60 hours in and I'm still pretty terrible. It takes a lot of practice so log in daily to get better. Team up with your friends and play in duo mode or as a squad of 4.

I have never in my entire life and across hundreds of games played anything so poorly optimized and buggy. As long as they can keep pumping out new crates to scam kids out of their christmas money why would they focus on the quality of the content right?

Only problem is the development team can't figure out how to implement a single patch without ing the game. After every single patch the devs implement they break way more than what few bug fixes they bring. At times this game is simply unplayable due to the poor server connectivity. I've had rubber banding and lag in other games but this games lag issues has caused me so much frustration due to its competitive nature. Nothing is worse than entering a fire fight with a tree for cover with this kind of lag you rubber band and completely pop out of cover without noticing whilst your enemy is teleporting on your screen and is nearly impossible to hit. I have to admit this game is fun and a good chicken dinner gets my heart going. But in its current state I can't reccomend this laggy buggy over hyped mess to anyone.

2017-03-28,0,0,114,True,Recommended,This game is really good at it's core. It could easily be the BEST Battle Royale game in the coming months. However the one massive thing that is holding it back AS OF 28/03/2017 is the optimisation.Jesus Christ I have a i5 3570K Quad Core Processor 4.4Ghz 16GB of RAM and a GTX 1060 6 GB. Considering this I have to run the game on very low graphic settings.Of course I understand that this game is in Early Access and I have a lot of hope that the development team will be on top of this problem in the coming months or maybe even weeks if we are lucky enough.As I have said it has a fantastic foundation for a game that has massive potential.The review will be updated if the optimisation is corrected.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-09-07,0,0,31,True,Recommended,Its quite fun although i don t see what the rave is all about. Its not the next Counter strike or Minecraft or anything. People seem to like it tho. Its a game version of the Movie Battle Royale and based on DayZ game but without the zombies. Grab a weapon run and camp! Theres a lot of tension and waiting bits so its not so full on action all the time a few pops in the distance and youre basically dead out of nowhere sometimes. Its avoidable by scanning your surroundings somewhat.I dunno what to say negatively only IMO its a bit bland and the gameplay rewards camping a lot thats what i dont like about it. Basically avoid all contact until youre in the top 10 thats the recipe for winning parachute away from the player horde and wait and thats easily a top 50 place right there for avoiding contact and camping.

I'd be able to live with some of the bugs if I could consistently do something as simple as move in a straightline.

2018-05-14,0,0,486,False,Not Recommended,Here's the thing with PUBG It's a game that is very fun to play. The problem is the developers don't tend to care too much about it's user base' concerns. The game lacks so much small things to make it perfect and instead of doing those things it releases uneeded things like taking/adding items to producing a mobile version over small things like creating more ways to earn BP (ingame currency). Again great game but can be MUCH better.Edit I haven't played since this brought this Battle pass garbage out. They went after Epic Games (Fortnite) for copyright issues and then completely copied their battle pass platform. Never seen a company so blatant for trying to suck all of its players' money. On top if it all game still runs like trash hackers run rampant and regions aren't locked so asian players can get away playing on NA servers with 999999 ping.

2018-06-23,0,0,214,False,Not Recommended,"I loved the concept and gameplay of PubG since I found out about it and when I got it even though I was regularly frustrated at times I had a lot of fun and thoroughly enjoyed myself often. This game and I however have a love/hate relationship. I couldn't tell you how many times I have died when I shouldn't have and how many times I experienced glitches and such and this includes the game and the UI where they are abundant. However this isn't what's making me write my review instead it's the development and business decisions of the company behind the game Bluehole or PubG Corp. or whoever is responsible for the terrible decisions being made. Not long after I got this game locked crates were released which really wasn't a big deal to me at the time since I could sell them anyways and still get my profit. BUT one wasn't enough and several locked crates later the entire market was horribly devalued leaving no crate above the $0.50 margin and most below $0.15 meaning selling the crates is almost not worth it at this point especially considering most locked crates are valued at $0.03 the bare minimum. The keys aren't though. They're $2.50. I don't know why they felt it necessary after all the money they raked in from the conglomerate of game purchases and partial income from steam market sales to demand money from players in order for them to reap the benefits of playing the game which they should be able to do with no tax. All of this still hadn't tipped my breaking point however because the developers were still using the money to seek out things they saw fit for fixing and throwing patches on them i.e. the overuse of assault rifles which are still the majority preferred weapon anyways and redoing grenades buffing and nerfing both as they saw needed and asked for. They still added some new content and they made a drastic effort to improve Miramar so more players found it enjoyable which I think worked because I like it more and my friends don't mind it as much. But now after the long sought after release of Sanghok originally Savage (way cooler name by the way) instead of recieving a polished map that we waited for the devs to work on for two months we find out what they were using their development money on instead which was a blatant equivalent to the battle pass of Fortnite. I absolutely could not believe my eyes when I saw that in the top right corner. On top of this the event pass blares in your face every time you open the store insisting you pay an extra $10 for a game you've already assumedly payed $27 $30 for depending on where you got it and it's not permanent DLC either. You might get certain fancy clothes or bonuses alongside it and these might just total to sell for about $10 or more but I wouldn't care. No fixes other than graphics and the insides of buildings were changed in Sanhok whatsoever since I last played on it. It still runs like hot and I've got a 1050ti but if you think that isn't a strong enough GPU my friend has the same exact frame issues and he has a 1080. They made no effort to actually fix the map they just made the buildings a little prettier inside and out and though I am thankful that they seem to have added more cover inside and out again they added loads of unnecessary objects and graphics everywhere without optimizing anything. All in all even though I really want to love PubG since I see it having so much potential these money whoring Koreans make it impossible for me to do so. They still haven't overhauled many bugged or unbalanced functions of the game inside or outside of combat and I figure the rest of that money we gave them ran towards ""fixing the UI "" which in my opinion even though it's not terrible is inferior to the previous one that they used which i thought was the best yet. You can't even choose between Erangel and Miramar anymore you have to play with both in your queue. I am very disappointed with the team responsible for the development in this game and until they pull themselves up by the bootstraps and start making important changes this review will remain negative. EDIT After some ""hotfixes"" I reopened PubG and went at it for a few games. Annoyed at the new map I went to the original Erangel and Miramar. Signs and banners have been put in place to notify players of the upcoming Global Invitational in Berlin and nothing else seems to have been changed. I noticed no other problems I didn't like what they did here because it shows where production on their dev team goes but I was relatively indifferent. Not long after this however another 6GB update comes along and supposedly various bugs performance issues and glitches as well as cheating has either been helped or fixed. I was on Erangel again today July 14 and I was having consistent frame tearing at the center of my screen which was very noticeable and annoying alongside this I could not run the map at more than 50 FPS with constant drops below 40 FPS and without regular terrible frame stutters if my graphics were held any higher than near absolute minimum (very low). This is despite the fact that even in February before various optimizations were made to the game I could still run both maps available at the time at 60 FPS consistently usually almost the whole game. The development team has not only made the UI and market worse but now they're actually tearing into the gameplay itself.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-02-24,0,0,1684,False,Recommended,"PUBG is probably one of the most frustrating yet most adictive shooter games I've ever played. The intencity of close quarters battle within a city or the nervousness when you run through an open field just waiting for the bullets to start flying towards you from an enemy you have not spotted in the distance. That strange puffing sound in the ground beside you and then seconds later the sound of a sniper rifle in the distance before you desperatly start looking around for cover and trying to figure out where the shots are coming from. The king of the hill concept is quite fun and nerve wrecking. You start off by being flown in over a area of 8x8 km of terrain with clusters of buildings you have to search for guns ammo and armour to defend yourself towards up to 99 other players (if you play solo). When you hang in the parachute looking around you can get shocked of the amount of other chutes around you or find yourself almost alone in the nearby sky. When you get geared up you will get pushed towards a random point on the map by ever shrinking circles of death and end up in a small circle in the end with a lot of other players all wanting to win the game by being the last to stand. You hear gunshots all around you while you see the player counter up in the corner slowly decreasing. You might die almost instantly after touching ground or you can be skilled enough to eliminate other players that cross your path to get to those final circles. Lots of rounds you will not get there but when you do its very satisfying to get that ""winner winner chicken dinner"" message at the end. And when you've been there once you want to be there again and again and again...Suit up and join this frustrating but excellent game. Biffinator a.k.a BiffsterB",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Like for example i just ran into this problem where my textures dont load and by the time I even get into the game the amount of time that it takes to load. Ill be in the plain already Ill hear the footsteps running as if I were in the waiting lobby but im in the plane. I had this problem before but it wasnt bad the textures wouldnt load and i had to wait about 4 seconds now im waiting miniutes.

At Gamescom they had an invitational and focused on that along with the Xbox version but no real changes have taken place in the past month. It seems like a cash grab at this point because if you see their Bluehost profits they have more than enough people to pay to add more content and features especially since it's using UE4 which is a relatively simple industry standard. So the vote has been changed to a downvote. I get it care about making more money but that seems like all it's been the original idea was 6 months in EA not an eternity.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-02-18,0,0,420,False,Not Recommended,"An awful game with an exciting concept. I played during ""early access"" and while there were a lot of bugs desync and overall issues then patches and hotfixes were frequent and it looked like the game was headed the right way. Ever since the official release of 1.0 though everything has turned to Updates stopped desync has gotten a lot worse more and more bugs appear and more and more hackers as well. It's gotten painfully hard to enjoy playing anymore and today I'm uninstalling until updates and fixes are being done.Hackers are present in probably every game whether you notice them or not. Some are blatant like headshotting half the server from across the map others like no recoil scripts you might not even realize or at least can't be certain cause of the buggy and unreliable replay/death cam system.By latest info that I could find PUBG has sold over 30 million copies. A few weeks ago there was a post that said there had been one million accoutns banned for cheating. ONE MILLION. If we say that all of those 30 million copies are active players which of course they're not then on average that is 3 cheaters per game. Every lobby you join hoping for a fair and fun game there are 3 cheaters on average and that is just being modest.But cheaters aren't even the biggest issue for me what's even more annoying is the ridiculous amount of bugs that are simply not being addressed. Let me list some of them on top of my head Bullets ignoring armor. Cars exploding from touching something at 1kmph. Bikes flipping from the smallest random bump on the road. Shots vanishing into thin air. Completely random damage on some weapons(shotguns(I blasted someone in the face from 1m 2/3 of his health not one shot another guy shoots me from across the yard from hipfire one shot dead)) Landing from your parachute you flip a coin whether or not you'll take damage. The air above the trees on Miramar is impenetrable you see someone's full body and shoot but your bullets hit the air around the tree. Grass and other objects not being rendered from a big distance making people that seem in cover fully standing out. Grenades damage randomly getting negated by an object on a table. DESYNC. My God the desync... You see someone in the open you go in a building close the door go in another room and BAM you get shot by the guy two walls and a door away from you. Game freezes and connection issues. ALL of my friends experience this at least once a day when joining a game where they hear sound but see just the PUBG logo on the screen and the game loads for them when the plane dumps the last people. It's even worse for me because the game doesn't load at all for me and I have to close it from task manager start it again and reconnect.All of the above issues have been in the game for MONTHS and nothing has been done to fix or even address them. Don't waste your time and nerves on this game.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-06-08,0,0,26,True,Not Recommended,"Changing this to a thumbs down. First thing is the game is unplayable for me now. I bought this game a while back and it used to run really well even on higher settings. My system is aging but it easily surpasses minimum requirements and I can still run some pretty hefty games with medium/some high settings like Witcher 3 GTA V etc... But now a problem that used to happen once and a while has happened on the last 10 or so matches I've tried to play. EVERYTHING loads in fine except for the buildings. They look like PS1 buildings loading in and none of the doors or anything work so I'm stuck there helpless until they either load in at some point the game slows to a crawl and I have to open up task manager to quit or I get killed. Since it used to run well not sure if updates have made it even LESS compatible with my AMD card or if it's because the servers are now swamped with so many new players.The streamers getting people banned is part of the issue too. First off how about all the people who are forced to be included in these streams? Maybe it's not ok to ME if I'm included without asking. Secondly if a streamer is in a match and that causes people to either have to play differently or have less fun...BAN/SUSPEND THE STREAMER! Don't you see you have it backwards here...What's worse a handful of streamers whining like little girls...or the general gaming public who's game is effected? My guess is you're catering to the streamers because you don't want them talking negatively about your game??? But look now you have an amazing game with ""mixed"" review on Steam because of what you're doing....kudos I guess. You've created a problem where you're essentially randomly banning people since they can't even ""see"" who's a streamer. Then you actually made the game run WORSE over time for lots of people instead of you know optimizing it... How is it this close to release with still so terrible support for AMD cards?",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-03-28,0,0,152,False,Not Recommended,PUBG is finally seeing some improvements but I doubt they will keep up this pace. I can only hope. They have finally made the servers acceptable though I wouldn't call the servers competetive it's atleast playable now.There are still some issues I have with the game There is no point in a redzone I assume they just copied what others did.Weapon spawns are bad (very low weapon count and not a lot of spawns).Other players with a high ping can give you a bad experience since they can shoot you while you are unable to see them (in some cases).If they will improve the servers/netcode further and adress the mentioned issues than I will recommend the game. But atm I can't it took them way too long to see what's wrong. I doubt they will go in the competetive direction and try to make this a good game.

2018-08-10,0,0,85,False,Not Recommended,I have played this game since Early Access and have stuck with it just to see where it goes. I was supposed to be part of the group of Early Access players that would have gotten some keys and BP just for playing in Early Access. Never saw any of that. Now I want to know... what the hell is the point of playing and earning BP if you can't use the BP to buy keys?Since realeased I have gotten about 8 crates (I don't often have time to play so I don't play this game as much) that are just sitting there in my inventory asking me to pay money to unlock them even though I already played to get the BP to even get the damn things. What the hell is that? There should be an option that let's you use your BP to either buy keys (I feel like 1000 BP each is reasonable) or to use BP to buy ONLY the free crates. Why am I bothering collecting my damn points for if I have to spend over 5000 of them to then not even get something for the time I've already put into the game? Just this alone is grounds for not recommending this game. It falls under unfair land where you see cool skins and stuff online but can't get them unless you pay (think ARMA III if you will). I've already given you my money and my support PUBG Corps let me at least feel rewarded for playing your game.Currently this game feels like it is excerting a predatory system and I stand against such systems. I may continue to play the game since I already have it but I can't recommended it to new comers on the grounds of basic ethical sense.

I hope someone comes along and does this right.Insurgency Sandstorm is coming soon. I'll wait for that.When I play other fps games like Insurgency and the BF series it's a fun experience. I choose my weapon I spawn in I see an enemy I raise my weapon and fire and an amazing thing happens... They die. Somehow Bluehole can't make this happen. They can't even figure out how to make grenades go where you point them. That's how broken this game is.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

If its not fixed soon there wont be anyone playing but the chinese but i guess thats fine with the developers because the chinese playerbase is so huge that its bigger than all playerbases combined. i payed money for this game to enjoy it but i cant enjoy a game with people screaming chinese i cant even understand english and im not gonna get google translate to just play a game its ridiculous. no one is racist for wanting people to stick to their own server. i dont play on chinese servers cause i dont speak chinese so why would i go to their server just lock everyone to their region not just china its annoying and im done playing until the issue is fixed. used to be a fun game but not anymore it became ruined i dont recommend anyone buy this youll be wasting your money casue the company doesnt care about its playerbase they only care how much money they get from us...,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-06-22,0,0,24,False,Not Recommended,When I first bought this game for almost $40 Canadian I knew what to expect. I was going into an early access game but it was very fun in the beginning. It was fun to experience the janky glitches with friends. But now after so much time this game has remained broken janky slow and disconnected for too long. I won't get into the politics of Blue Hole and other things as I am only interested in gameplay alone. Here are some pros and cons Pros Great atmosphere to sneak around be careful and tactical Shooting is alright but there are cons to how it feels. Cons Poor graphics Bad optimization and consistency Movement is broken completely unclean and difficult to act quickly Opening doors is broken Picking up loot is slow awkward and gets you killed Map is too big sometimes too long before you see action and you may get killedThe game would be better with lots of gameplay mechanics fixed as well as maybe smaller maps to keep rounds smaller and more exciting. The maps also feel too open with not many features. Very unfinished and it is crazy to think it's been like this for over a year.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-06-22,0,0,18,False,Not Recommended,Absolute bundle of greed. It was fun for a while and then it gets really repetitive. The same walking on the same textured grass whilst carrying the same weapons with the same tactics. This may have been alright if the servers were actually usable but sometimes it really isn't great. The amount of hackers in this game is astonishing in just under 19 hours i've seen some really dodgy plays far too many in fact.Then there's the skins paid DLC etc. It tarnishes the image for the game far too much to the point where I can say this game deserves mostly negative reviews on Steam. I hate to say this really I do but if you want a good battle royale play Fortnite or even Minecraft Hunger Games as while a lot of gameplay is great here the lack of updates and variation really suck the game dry of joy.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-09-05,0,0,210,True,Recommended,"TLDR Stream sniping is against TOS its a fun glitchy broken intense as hilarious blast of a game.This game is amazing. It get its hype from all the highlight reels and streamers/pros doing insanely well. You dont have to be good at this game at all to enjoy it. If you are a terrible shot the game can still be a blast simply from the intensity of running around and trying to not die and make it into top 10 at the very least (which is not hard to do with no kills). And to all the reviews ing about getting banned for ""harassment"" they legitimently harassed streamers. Stream sniping alone is against TOS if im not mistaken but then to stream snipe and spam car horns around the streamers so they literally cant hear anything and have a bad time is harassment. You will not get banned for honking your horn you will get banned for stream sniping and being a jackass just to get on stream. The people that got banned did not do it once twice or even just three times but were regualr enough that the streamers KNEW THEIR NAMES.Something does need to be said about the game. its a horrible glitchy mess where you are bound to get stuck in a wall or have a car explode for no reason but when the game is playing finew which is most of the time its very fun. Part of it being a glitchy mess is what makes it so fun to play or watch because it just adds so many WTF moments. As long as people keep submitting clips to youtube and as long as streamers keep playing the game will remain the huge monster that it is in terms of playerbase. I dont see it dying off anytime soon.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-09-05,0,0,172,True,Recommended,It is Early Access but still better than a lot of games that have launched and the devs are actually actively improving the game. Fixing the game is going to take time (and there are problems current state) but for $30 you can't beat the deal.ProsFun game is extremely fun and it drops you right in on the action. No turtorial no hand holding its straight up go from the start. I love this aspect.Fast starts squad get wiped? Queue times are almost non existent most of the time. Dev updates while the Devs are no longer doing a set update schedule it is fairly fast and there are a lot of things they are working on like fixing bullet physics more vaulting fixing the grenades adding new maps etc. Price $30 is a great deal on this game EA or not. And its very likely to be selling for $60 when the game officially launchesConsOptimization Game isn't optimized (as of writing this review) so you need a pretty beefy computer to run it on high settings. Bugs Again early access so this is to be expected (some people don't understand what Early Access means though) but they are getting better. Streamers Some streamers are getting people banned for really stupid reasons like honking their horns or claiming to be stream sniped even if the odds of being on the server with a streamer is pretty low. Community the community has some great people but the idiots and the whiners seem to be the most vocal in it and it can really hurt the drive to playCommunity part 2 really wish they'd do more to limit someone from Asia being on the NA and other servers because its frustrating constantly being put in groups with people who don't speak English at all or don't have a mic at all. Even though there are more cons listed they aren't a huge deal for the most part.

2018-07-25,0,0,80,False,Not Recommended,"I've followed this game since beta and also played the mod and such relevant to its creation. And the game itself its gameplay is alright gradually becoming more varied however there is an issue when it comes to cost.The game itself is 26.99(GBP) That in itself isn't too expensive however you then discover how littered this game has become with micro transactions. Which I was hoping it wouldn't be. Perhaps it is the influx of Twitch Streamers perhaps its the fact that this game has become a contender for the Esports scene. I don't know.When I used to play this before you got BattlePoints or BP to spend on a crate you then opened it for free and got some cosmetics. That was fine.Now I shall give you a list of the microtransactions I have seen ONLY FROM THE STORE. Whether there is any others available I don't know this is PURELY from the STORE section in game.ALL PRICES ARE IN GBP.A collection of Cosmetic Hoodies and Weapon skins. 7.62 Each. EACH.Keys to open 5 of the 10 available crates. 1.91 EACH.Now the in game system for crates is an amount of BattlePoints that scales up per crate you buy (resets every week still as far as I'm aware.) Starting at 700 BP. You'll notice it says ""A RANDOM CRATE"" underneath. This is not a lie if you preview the random crate it shows 10 Crates and their potenital items. 5 of which have keys for in the store. Which means presumably the other 5 are free to unlock. Pretty generous you might say but that boils down to each time you open a random crate you have a 50% Chance to get a crate that requires a key. Fabulous.The gameplay itself is alright I'll often find myself wanting a more diverse system but then you could argue that it does what it was intended to well be a Battle Royale game. The mechanics are fairly polished now much more so than when I last played and the core gameplay is alright nothing spectacular. So in review of my review If you want a game that is a decent Battle Royale game is semi realistic in it's graphics and gameplay this is probably the better Battle Royale game on the market. However it is laden with Micro transactions. So if you have a tendency to buy them you might want to keep your aching wallet which has just had 26.99 GBP Deducted from it for the games purchase far away from reach. I wouldn't mind if it was F2P. Yet it is not. And it's not even that cheap.""Decent game. However a micro transaction laden hell hole.""",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

There is the refund thing but I guarantee you will not use it.I bought this game a while ago and now I can review it better than before. I didn't played any battle royale games other than PUBG. This was a new thing for me. The best thing was when I started playing the game and got to top 10. My heart rate was in the skies and when I won that match... Oh man that was a damn good feeling. Of course it's not that big of a deal after near 200 hours but it's still really intense and much more entertaining than e.g. CS GO or some older and better known games. At least for me. The developers do care about the players and they do their jobs as they can. After all the game is awesome. I can only recommend to buy it!

Movement feels like your character is carrying 400 pounds of radishes in a wicker basket on his head. He has to slow down gradualy think Arma 2 but worse in every possible way. There are micro stutters everywhere and im on low settings on a 970 at 1080P. Sluggish not sure how to describe it its not the gameplay itself thats slow it just feels slow. Connection wise the game is lack luster in that as well people teleport and studder all throughout the map even if you have a good ping. I honestally didnt want to get the game at first because all the gameplay i saw of it was well bad and seemed not very well optimized. I was unfortunetaly correct. I honetally would just say to wait either untill the developer finally addresses the elaphant in the room and fixes this rather than releasing CSGO style cases and keys that you have to pay for.

PubG Corp has ZERO interest in fixing ANY game bugs or performance issues. They only care about selling more lootbox keys. MORE COSMETICS. On all 3 maps 90% of your games you either spend first 15 20 min trying to find a weapon or dive in a hot zone to fight for 1 pistol between 20 players. Game is getting worse and worse with every patch and all that is getting fixed every time is doors. Honestpy. Not a single gamebreaking bug fix but there was 7 8 door bug fixes. There are not enought weapons on a map. That's why in first 2 min of the game up to 70% of players die. No weapons crashes and freezes no vehicles to traverse distances extreamly poor hit registration cheaters in every single game and many many more gamebreaking problems.Trust me. DON'T waste your money on it. I've wasted money and over 500 hours of my life hoping that the game will improve with time. It only getting worse.

WTF?3) Most chests you get require a $2.50 key to unlock where you get an ugly useless item.4) If you get a chest that does not require a key you still get ugly useless items.5) They don't care about NA players. Maintenance is always during prime time NA hours (9pm EST)6) Hackers love this game.7) Desync is a major issue when trying to shoot someone and trying to avoid being shot.I enjoy this game and it is fun to play with other people.

2017-11-07,0,0,27,True,Recommended,Hello.I find this game in it's current state to be very addictive the downside is the randomness of the White Zones. Sometimes you drop into a location and there are no vehicles around and the white zone is like 50000miles away and the only way to compete is to find a vehicle/weps/ammo and get there asap. What i would suggest to the developement team is in squad mode duo and higher allow teams to spawn a vehicle on their location like maybe send a vehicle plane your spawn to drop the vehicle there or something this will help to prevent deaths by blue zone.Gameplay wise i find this game to be fairly decent there's plenty of gun choices and gear options find a seek aspect can be win or lose depending on your spawn location and just in general the map.This is coming from the OCEANIC server.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-09-08,0,0,252,True,Recommended,Battle Royale games have potential PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds has potential. From buying this game to playing it I haven't stopped playing it since. I always have that need to play games like this. But of course this is a review and reviews need to be compiled of constructive criticism. Korean developers Bluehole have done a good job of simulating a different unique type of game combining forms of group tactical play to the fast paced get out and survive thrill.The mechanics of shortening safe zones really does give off a tense vibe and I can see it was designed for that but also to stop campers! These mechanics of shortening safe zones has become the heart of PUBG and is what makes the game function. Dropping from the plane descending from the air and scouting out your drop zone makes you feel more in control of your surroundings and gives that extra feel of relief to find that SKS on the floor or a level 3 helmet. Playing within your own group of friends really does make the game more exciting and satisfying. Without taking it seriously we can run on the fields near butt naked one with his afro bouncing around like a rabbit on heroin. The tense feeling being held up in a building with your friends hearing a jeep or a bike louring near you really can give you some sense of fear or even the unknown footsteps that grow nearer and nearer to which could be your imminent end.All of these moments experienced is what makes a good game succeed. But of course the time to be critical is now.Never mind my over zealous descriptions of this game as with any 'Early Access' game problems will arise bugs will be found and unfairness will exist. Now i quote 'Early Access' for a reason from my experience i haven't come across major issues in conjunction to bugs or unfairness. The game has been incredibly smooth with hardly any issues now of course that can be down to my mad setup that i run on however it is very difficult to maintain a smooth experience when releasing games under the Early Access banner. And for that i do applause Bluehole Inc.The one thing that frustrates me more is paying for cosmetics. Saving money to buy the game and attempting to reach top 10 out of 100 is hard enough. Of course you may just say they're cosmetics however cosmetics that give some form of camouflage within the map can lead to an advantage over others. I've always disliked the 'Pay to Win' marketing strategies that nearly all major game developers force in our faces. I'd feel happier to pay a Monthly Fee if everything i get within the game is available to me. Content is important and limiting content for customers will always shed a bigger negative impact within the gaming community and it's something that needs to be considered and thought about regularly. If what Chris Roberts does with Star Citizen succeeds you can rest assure that many gaming companies like Bluehole Inc will go bust. It's important to develop in the eyes of a consumer rather than develop in the eyes of a developer!On the topic of cosmetics I can roam the world and find Gas masks and Protective goggles. Now I admit on the cosmetic side they look pretty bad however if certain clothing like Gas masks and protective goggles are to be shown within the game they should present more meaning rather than 'look cool'. I'd want to be able to defend myself from flash bangs with protective goggles or if poisonous gases were added defend myself using a gas mask. This would ensure a more tactical and survival thrill to when you hit that top 5 in a Squad.Overall I have to say despite some negatives the game itself as an 'Early Access' game has proven to deliver in the majority of it's goals. The tense combat and tactical elements Bluehole Inc wanted to achieve have been achieved the Safe Zone and Dead Zone features is what adds brings the game together alongside anticipating your perfect Skydive for the best tools to do the job. If BlueHole continue to deliver an exhilarating and fun experience to PUBG then i will be excited to see what the finished and continued updates this product has to deliver.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I'm playing this trash game since the BETA and the whole thing's going in a wrong direction. You had the opportunity to create a world wide known competitive game and already 7months after publishing the game on Steam the whole world is laughing about your product. If you're only in business for the money you should know that a working competitive game would bring you way more profit on a longer timeline than a highly sold game in the beginning.And last but not least don't forget that your game will be a one hit wonder and more projects won't bring you those amounts of orders.

Now the game is riddled with bugs and crazy latency issues. Bluehole needs to stop copying Fortnite and actually use their energy to optimize the game. The last 50 hours of gameplay I put into this were unbearable. Sad to see such a good concept go to waste. Get your together and stop worrying about your competitors..,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

No I won't the game is full of hackers legitimate players have fallen due to the hackers the recent update has somehow made the number drop significantly me and friends played a session earlier for 4 5 hours and most games we encountered some kind of hacker the game is just not enjoyable anymore and for that reason I cannot recommend this game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The controls are kinda confusing when the first time I played this but after 1 hour of gameplay I'm already over it.I've already submit a refund mainly because I don't really have and want to spend my time on this game then why'd I bought it? Because it's not as fun as I thought going to be (I repeat It's my opinion).Do I recommend this? Of course!

2018-07-02,0,0,748,False,Not Recommended,PUBG is stale. The developers focus more time and effort on ways to monetize the game rather than produce solid updates and optimization. The whole new map and $10 Event pass was nail in the coffin for me. There are still too many bugs performance/network issues hackers and cheaters. There are however plenty of paid crates for you to choose from and you will probably get a worthless white shirt. PUBG was fun and exciting at first even with the bugs I had a lot of fun. Development since its 'official release' has been painfully slow and inadequate in order to keep the larger player base interested. I got my $30 worth with this game I feel good about that. However given its progress since I started playing in June 2017 I would advise you to save your money and give it to a developer who won't try to bleed its player base for every dollar they can think of.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2018-07-02,0,0,679,False,Recommended,I don't know why there is so much hate for this game... I know that it sucks to pay a bunch of money for a couple of pixels on the screen (skins etc.) I think it's about the experience with the people u play with as a squad and the skill that you build up to get that first chicken dinner. I think it is not a pay to play but a game that gives everyone a chance to win based on skill not loot or skins... I give this game a 5 out of 5 no matter what due to the many fun and frushtrating times I've had online. Either way this game gave me memories that I will never forget it is the only game that stands out for me in my giant steam library.

2018-01-15,0,0,182,False,Recommended,To those of you who have refunded the game or simply uninstalled because it ran like trash I suggest getting it again and giving it another shot. Ever since full release the game has been optimized to a degree so that low end pc's like mine can run it properly. You still have a few bugs and glitches sometimes it still dosn't load but it is super rare now. The game still feels kinda early access having only 2 maps and you cant even pick which one you want to play but the gameplay is and always has been great. Game is as balanced as an rng sh*tshow can get and with friends it can be a huge blast and even solo this game is great. Not the best game ever but it is the best battle royal game to date imo.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-05-12,0,0,126,False,Recommended,Product received for free. Its a good game. I enjoy playing it. Guns feel great to use and actually take time kinda getting used to. It is these things that drag the general experience down. Limb penetration is non existant and I have died many times to opponents blocking shots fired from my point blank shotgun blast with their arms. I feel hit reg could do with some tweaking The game still doesn't run as well as it could (low FPS) The game is poorly coded and there are some interesting *things* that do occur because of this There is a hacker problem (apparently? I don't see them that often)Even though the game faces these many issues I still enjoy the game a lot. I do not believe that Bluehole/PUGB corp will just abondon their game after all the money they have made Instead I believe that they will eventally fix these issues in the coming months/years/decades/centuries.Thank you for taking the time to read my review,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-10-07,0,0,64,False,Not Recommended,This game is a reminder to everyone of the potential that battle royale had in the early 2018. When it was on Beta everyone lost their minds over how potent and exhilarating the game was.When it was released the realism of the game mixed with its glitches provided surreal and decent experience.But now after a year and a half despite the fame and the popularity the game never really changed. The bugs are still ever so present.This is just my opinion but I think this game doesn't know what it wants to be. It has grounded game mechanics and movements/settings but the cosmetics are silly and so are the events. Tonal contradiction is prominent.Even the devlopers admit the fundemental flaw of the game. And season passes for temporary cosmetics on a paid game ? PUBG please....If you like battle royale then this is THE GAME for you. If you don't like battle royale still give it a try but you won't find it entertaining after couple of hours. If you are a casual gamer who wants to try battle royale try Black Ops 4 blackout instead (they have their own flaws tho)In conclusion its a meh.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-07-27,0,0,83,False,Not Recommended,For those of you who still haven't heard of this game (I know there can't be many of you). I want you to watch the most recent trailer and notice how no one is hitting anyone. Well that sums up this game entirely. People always talk about the loot boxes or the asset flip and NON of that matters. If a game is fun then it's fun. The loot boxes are cosmetic only and I don't see any issues there. However the gunplay in this game is horrible. I understand they were going for a more realistic feel but being someone who used to train people to shoot I can tell you that is not an accurate way to portray realism. You can have your crosshairs on a stationary target burst firing and still hit nothing. I have run into situations where I had a shotgun at point blank range miss and vise versa I have had people shooting at me with a shotgun two inches from me and I was able to kill them with an m16. The gunplay in this game feels inconsistent and clunky for a game that revolves around you killing other people. Fixing the gunplay would skyrocket this game to the top and keep it there.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-07-27,0,0,1988,False,Recommended,"This game had so much potential early on. In early access there were A LOT of issues that we put up with as it was ""Early access"". Then Bluehole started milking the community for as much money as possible. They got it as players loved the game and thought they were investing in the game for the future. The money would be put back into the game we thought.Then came Mirimar a disaster of a map. This map pushed players away in their drogues. Bluehole still pushed for sales of crates and inventory items. Very little bugs were fixed and the hackers were a nuisance. There were hackers / exploiters in every games. Bluehole did not cure the hacker issue but instead milked the community for more money.On full release the game was a disaster. A game with more bugs than the opening scene from Starship troupers and more cheaters than a Nigerian car boot sale. They wanted money thats all they cared about. Not the community only money.Now Sanhok came along. A nice little map with a totally different game play and tactics from the other two. It gave thje community a boost and the players inevitably followed. Bluehole foreseen this and introduced the even pass. They gave us a month of gaming at an additional cost. The should have went to jail for that. Its robbery!Nearly 1500 hours later and my thoughts are Give us free stuff that we can keep use and trade. Fix the bugs hackers and sack the management of Bluehole. They are running the game into the ground. If a good company had developed this game it would be a world beater.

2017-08-11,0,0,608,False,Recommended,*edit 2* 7 27 18This game finally feels like a game to lose yourself in. The graphics are more clean the weapons more realistic and the combat doesn't drop to 10 fps. This game is fun and is a must buy for a steam collection. Hacking even in TPP does not seem as much an issue.*Edit*Region lock china or figure out how to stop their cheating because it is killng a fun game. If you are excited by the possibility of being shot in the head from 400 Meters out by a guy who doesnt aim then this is the game for you. TerribleHaving considered the promises of the developer and the ludacrous amount of money they have earned since this game has come out ( 30$ a game and at the least 4 million copies sold) nearly 120 million dollars... It does seem absurd that they would seek funding for a tournament they could readily put on themselves. If this company seeks to continue with a strong fan base in the future they should consider the ramifications of their new position and financial leverage understanding that it is possible for all that to be gone with a few poor decisions leading to a lost fan base and distrust of any future developments.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

It just hangs at the background and I have to End Task. The other is lagging out. I think the servers may be crashing out because in twos it happens to both of us. It starts lagging bad then kicks us out.Guns like everything so far but haven't had enough time to fully get a feel. Attachments are awesomeCars love all the vehicle spawns... easy to find and not OP.Loot Balance in KOTK I can loot 5 houses in the time I can loot one or two in PUBG. Sometimes I will go to 4 before I find a backpack and/or helmet. It would be nice if the loot was tweaked. I feel like KOTK is more geared around giving an advantage to who gets good stuff and PUBG is more geared to give advantage to those that are more tactical and cautious. I don't thing RNG has a place in this gameGameplay everything is smooth... I love it. Looting feels natural and weapons/attachments are cool. I get very bored mid game however. Everyone just goes in a building and hides. In two games I drove all over the circle twice and never seen anyone or got shot out. Eventually I seen a person in a window. They hid once I stopped. I've only made it to the end twice because I get bored and start rushing houses.I don't know how to solve my major complaint... I don't want any major rule changes... maybe some sort of incentive to get out and about but not necessarily any kind of penalty. I don't like penalizing a play style but it would be cool if there was a reason that made u want to get out.It's easy to say ""don't go in houses mid game"" but damn I get bored after sitting around a few minutes.

But out of all the the buggy clunky and menotinious games that do this concept and similar styles this game manages to be the least of all of those things. It's by no means a finished product by many standards but I still enjoy this game 10x more than any of the other one's before it Lets hope the developeres stick with this one and get all the moniez that this genre is fortold to hold.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-11-10,0,0,627,True,Recommended,The gameplay is pretty known for those who have played Battle Royale games such as H1Z1 or DayZ this game is better than these in terms of realism. The price of the game is worth it.I have played over 30 games where you have to wait for a match to start no one of them can compete with PUBG's matching algorithm it finds a match for you with up to 100 players within seconds and sometimes immediatly. The playerbase is pretty big and most of the times you get a nice random teammate with microphone.Lately there have been a tons of hackers/cheaters in game using aimbot and speedhacks which makes some matches hard to win or even impossible to play. Cheats are not something devs can fix in few minutes and i'm sure they're already working on patches to prevent people from using hacks. If you happen to get in a match without a hacker you'll have tons of fun.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-11-10,0,0,63,True,Not Recommended,Although this game is fun with friends there is no excuse for delayed updates. Players can't even jump over simple obstacles within the map. Some battles are ridiculous as well having you dead within seconds even when fully geared. The most annoying part is the indication of where you are getting shot from. The shot indicator is just trash. Also why are guns automatically set to Sem Automatic? If the weapon is an Automatic that should be it's default... I may be nit picking but these are some annoyances.Lastly this game is still buggy some glitches and performance issues with online servers. Wait a few months or so until the stability has been fixed and to be able to jump over obstacles not to mention weapon balancing.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

BEWARE THERE ARE ALOT OF BUGS CURRENTLY!!! One friend was not even able to open up the game and every time he tried his gaphic settings on his PC would act very strange and would require recalibrating or even a reset. One game I jumped from the plane to see that none of the buildings had loaded. I was able to kill people through walls and see any player despite them hiding in a house.

2017-09-04,0,0,316,True,Recommended,I wanted to be funny but only politically incorrect jokes comes in my mind.It's a nicely balanced game full of bugs but from an early access game less than a year old it's totally forgivable. Unreal engine rapes your GPU just as you would expect the physics are a bit clunky but overall the user experience is pretty good. I can totally recommend this game it really worths that 30 bucks and with a couple of friends it can provide endless amount of fun. Oh and about the micro transactions I really don't understand the whining about it. Skins does not give you any advantages and I see no problem with the current situation where rich people can spend thousands of dollars for worthless clothes they will throw away anyway on the battlefield by accident or put on bulletproof vest on the top of them.P.S.

It is very restricted first person shooter games have such kind of restrictions. But at least sliding at the moment of run vault to avoid bullet. This kind of basic move can be incorporated. We can see this move in Medal of Honor. Also the game is buggy.

2018-07-26,0,0,571,False,Not Recommended,I have spent quite some time playing this game. That being said I have never left a review for a game before this. Now to the review... I find it quite amazing and frankly disturbing how this game can have so much potential and at the same time have so many issues that persist since the first day I bought the game. I have had a tremendous amount of understanding and even defended the game in regards to the persisting issues however by now its become clear to me that the developers have absolutely no f****** intention of fixing the basic aspects of this game in order to generate a persistingly fun experience. Physics bugs lag issues and a staggering amount of nonsensical bugs and cheaters in this game simply make the game unplayable and frustrating more than not. So to all future players as much at it pains me to say go with fortnite (I havent played it but I guarantee its gonna be more fun than this pile of .

2017-09-21,0,0,111,True,Recommended,"This game really has a lot to show for an Early Access.Although there are hints of validity in some of these negative comments I think this game is profoundly impressive for its current state. Honestly I think this game is impressive period regardless of it being an Early Access.The Graphics 8/10On ultra graphics PUBG is visually appealing. Not stunning but again its not a finished game. The character textures are sharp although the hair modeling could use some work. Weapon and item textures are perfect in my opinion and don't realistically call for much improvement. Environment textures and modeling are decent but could improve. +1 for FOV adjustment!The Gameplay 10/10Having never played a ""Battle Royale"" type shooter before I have to say I'm quite pleased with the experience that Playerunknown's Battlegrounds offers. Even if I die before making it to the top 10 I still can't deny that I was killed fairly. From the beginning of the game when all 100 players can jump from the plane at their own timing each player is faced with the same disadvantage as the rest. No weapons no armor no medical supplies... sometimes no clothing... a perfectly even playing field. Players only possess the tactical wherewithal they've trained themselves to have and the instincts to make good decisions. This at the end of the game is what sets the player apart. No matter what you do to win or lose a particular game you can always walk away with a laundry list of things to improve upon. This game provokes the use of tactical decision making like no other shooter I've ever played. Every move you make every direction you turn every weapon you equip will be the difference between chicken dinner and death.The Performance 6/10Speaking of laundry lists PUBG has one when it comes to improving this game's performance. I have a machine that can run this game and other games at ULTRA graphics and still maintain at least an average 60FPS. However even with a high speed hard wired ethernet connection and graphics at VERY LOW I still drop occasional frames during certain parts of the game. (Especially the matchmaking island before the game starts and right after touch down when the game is loading up all its assets for the first time that session). For the most part the performance I experience during main gameplay is reasonably good. I'll still drop frames every once in a while and sometimes even right at the cusp of a fire fight depriving me of that glorious Chicken Dinner. Just remember this game is early access and can't be expected to perform like a AAA Title. For an early access game the performance is actually really good considering everything that's going on in game.OVERALL 8/10 GAMEcHInA nUmbR OnE!1!",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

One of the best games I have ever played and highly recommend.Edit Yikes.. Had a lot of hope for this game and I still do have hope. However it's been over a year now and the game still has just as much frame drop and desync as when it just came out. They are just releasing skins and what not to make more money since it appears thats all they care about. That being said I currently no longer recommend this game to people who dont yet own it. All BlueHole has to do is fix their servers and optimize the game better and they will literally have the greatest BR that people will willingly throw cash at.. but I guess some people just got overwhelmed with the amount of initial cash and are scared to put some of it back into the game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-15,0,0,207,False,Recommended,"Update 26.07.2018 (recommended)I kinda don't know how to start this...After I've reinstalled Pubg the graphics settings have been preset to high/ultra (in 1080p) and I haven't experienced low Fps while in game. The new map Sanhok (which I already played on the experimental servers) is nice and feels good to play on. Even though the map is four times smaller in size the map felt well balanced and I didn't felt like I'm being overrun by thousands and thousands of players.But there's still that one thing that bothers me a lot the selection of the maps. On the one hand I really like playing on Erangel but on the other hand I 'hate' Miramar and I was satisfied with the map selection field which was available for a limited time. This field was replaced and now I'm only able to decide between Erangel/Miramar or Sanhok and that's the only reason I'm only playing Sanhok for now.

2018-02-27,0,0,371,False,Recommended,Product received for free. PUBG is a game that i have been playing for a few months now and i would have to say that i do recomend this game. they have very much improved on the optimization and server lag and they have fixed the scopes as well. the game will be worth your 30 bucks if you like games that are fun with friends involve tactics and games that are quite big. they have also improved on the pacing of the game from the past few months with the circle timings and what not so i think that we have seen a lot of improvments since the launch of the game and after seeing the dev roadmap for 2018. i am very excited for all of the upcoming content of the game. also fortnite is EDIT ive played the new map and i think that it is really great if you havent already pickup the game,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-08-11,0,0,104,False,Not Recommended,At 26.99 for an Early Access game for what you get it is in my opinion not really worth it. In saying that I have had my moneys worth in hours of game play. However since I have been playing I have not seen any improvement in game play optimisation or quality. Desync plauges this game You'll move behind a tree and a second or two later you'll be dead from bullets that hit you earlier this becomes frustrating very quickly. Optimisation is poor at present granted this is an early access game so this is to be expected however as I have said no improvements have been made yet to this that have had any benefit to my gameplay. I average around 40 50fps playing this. I'm sure optimisation will come eventually but make this consideration when deciding to buy.The main tactic in this game is loot at the begining of the game and try stay clear of any conflict grab a car get to the centre of the incoming circle or roughly estimate where it will be camp until the very last stages of the game and then have a shoot out or whatever else comes of it. Once in a building and you're fully looted up just sit in a corner with a gun when someone comes simply shoot. The game will obviously develop however they're also putting focus on xbox version now so maybe some of the PC resources will go to them and PC development drop off?Overall in its current state I wouldn't recommend it the game has been fueled by streamer and youtuber hype which is the only reasons it has become so popular. Early access titles are always a risk especially at such a high price which this game is. You'll be more frustrated playing this game more than you will enjoy it in my opinion. Maybe by December it'll be worth it but to be honest keep a watch out for updates to optimisation when you see big optimisation updates and fixing of server/dsync issues then go ahead and purchase as I'm sure the fun will outweigh the issues eventually.Update 26/07/2018 8 Months on has anything changed. No game is still terrible. There have been some improvements to optimisation. It is now easy to achieve 60FPS although the game does not feel smooth. Everything else pretty much remains the same. Death cam is useless as it shows a different representation to what you as the player actually saw and did. A game with so much potential so it is a shame to see it still be so poor.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Legit the first game since Quake 3 that I have poured alot of hours into and plan on never quiting til the servers go down. 180 hours played in a little over a month is $30 well spent. Granted it has its obvious issues seeing how it is an early access game but even in this early state its leagues beyond what others are attempting in this genre.....also do not let the minimum requirments scare you away I fall below the specs with only 4 gigs of ram and using a Nvidia 650 Ti Boost with only 1 gig of memory and the game runs a solid 50 FPS on low settings.

2017-09-22,0,0,23,True,Recommended,Product received for free. PUBG is hands down one of the most fun games you can play today. I wrote a small list of pros and cons that will hopefully help out those deciding whether or not to buy this game. ______________________________________________________________ Pros Strategic gameplay that creates interesting skill gaps but nothing new players cant go up against. Satisfying learning dynamic. Huge map that puts you in different situations each game. Wide variety of guns to choose from. Great character customization through crate drops bought with in game credit system. Cons Somewhat poor optimization (but updates are released weekly to fix that!) You can't shoot through water which makes players who are swimming invincible. The Super Man style punching is overpowered and is a one hit kill. (Although in some ways it's understandable. It gives players without a gun a fighting chance against those that do).______________________________________________________________Keep in mind that PUBG is an early access game and isn't perfect. You will run into odd bugs every now and then and you will find some mechanics to work against you every now and then (I'm looking at you jumping over small walls!). The devs are amazing and listen to the community on such an admirable level. The gunplay is pretty great and definitely something that will take getting used to if you arent accustomed to bullet travel/drop. This creates a really fun learning dynamic that keeps you coming back to the game as well as the extreme satisfaction from eliminating up to 100 other players and being the last man standing ultimately winning a nice Chicken Dinner.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I can think of few other games where every kill (or every encounter for that matter) feels so rewarding. Would I like to see more content/maps/weapons/bug fixes? Absolutely. More variety would give PUBG some serious staying power in a world flooded with survival crafting clones and AAA first person shooters. As it stands it is still an absolute blast though and I do hope that the future of this game isn't muddled by pay to win content and developer abandonment.

2017-04-26,0,0,296,True,Recommended,Let me start out by saying this is a fun game and has really great potential if they fix a few problems. 1st off the constant loading error where it just stays on the loading screen you can hear all of the sounds and everything but it never leaves the loading screen so you have to exit the game and you are forced to sit through another lobby hoping it works. Sometimes the buildings dont load for 5 minutes or so and you pretty much just have to run around until they do. Also there are tons of invisible rocks that you either get glitched into and take fall damage or you run into them with your vehicle and take damage. There is a horrible loop that needs to be fixed with the airdrops. Me and a buddy were playing and we were both going up the stairs we somehow managed to get stuck on each other and it just showed the animation of constantly falling until we both were knocked out from the fall. I feel like instead of working on releasing some new content so soon they need to fix some of these problems. That being said it is a very addicting game and a good time killer and will be very good if they fix those few things.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-09-22,0,0,115,True,Recommended,The game is excellent. If you liked King of the Kill you're gonna love Player Unknown's Battlegrounds. It's more of the same just better. Smoother graphics more realism overall. The game was a culmination of all the good ideas put together in a close to flawless attempt at good gameplay mechanics. This game is not for low end computers. You will not enjoy this game if your system can't handle it. Seems to be made for the pc enthusiast who's willing to shell out the bucks on a 1000+ system. If you have one you're gonna want this game. It's high anxiety the moment your feet hit the ground. Heart racing interactive and ridiculously thought out.

2017-09-06,0,0,212,True,Recommended,I love this game.I was a H1Z1 player before I jumped on the PUBG train and the main problem I had with H1Z1 was the lack of anything but iron sights (aside from the sniper rifle) and the horrible weapon balancing. Never in my life have I won a game of H1Z1 the closest I've come was a 1v1 where I was gunned down instantly.However it's a different story in PUBG.I love the fact that you can find attachments during the game and mix and match them on your weapons especially because you can get suppressors for your guns.It feels a lot better to have anything from a red dot sight to a 15x scope instead of being forced to use iron sights only across long distances.To me the guns feel quite balanced right now.PUBG feels like anyone has a chance of winning mainly because it comes down to luck with looting and safezone placement but also requires basic gun skill and good judgement. You could hide for most of the game and still end up within the top 10.Not only is the gameplay decent but this game is semi playable on terrible hardware. Before I bought a gaming desktop I used to game on a 5 year old Dell laptop. When I played PUBG on the lowest settings (Which looks decent for low) I was still about to pull about 40+ FPS on a Geforce 840m 1GB with 8GB of RAM and a pretty terrible CPU. I did have trouble with buildings loading in slowly and I'm pretty sure I cut that laptop's lifetime down by playing the game but it was playable and it's where I got my first squad win (On the day I bought the game).Overall I've had a lot of positive experiences in this game but I've also had experiences where my friend thinks it's hilarious to smack me with a pan it usually ends with him on the ground at the end of my gun or with me having to use a first aid kit but I'd do it all again because we get some great laughs out of our misadventures and a lot of funny/crazy stories that we recount.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

There is essentially one island however there are so many buildings and the way that the borders close in over time creates a really fun environment. Great game!Agree with other reviewers claiming that the reward system is pointless but I think that's because we are in early access at least I hope so. I don't think they could start anyone off with a gun however there should be rewards that make more sense than just clothing.I have read of a few reviewers getting bans for certain activities.

2018-03-19,0,0,264,False,Not Recommended,I like this game but the company cares more about adding loot crates to get people spending more money (after they already paid for the game) than actually fixing things. I have a very good PC setup and can run this game at 144 FPS capped with a mix of Ultra and Low settings but it crashes quite often since the last patch there are issues with ping when Asian players are in the NA servers and it has a ton of glitches that they fail to fix such as how buggy the parachutes are. Also since the last patch I have once teleported from one side of the map to another. It was on the map Myanmar and I teleported from close to Impala all the way to Prison after I landed. Overall I'd give this game a 6.5/10 potential to be a really good game and I still enjoy it but they need to clean up their act and fix the issues the community is talking about.Edit I've since stopped playing the game due to ongoing bugs and terrible optimization almost completely ruining the game and experience.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-06-22,0,0,493,False,Not Recommended,Product received for free. I've followed PUBG since the very beginning. This game could have been the next TOP hit in the gaming industry. It all went downhill with the lack of optimization updates and the many hackers each match has. It seems the devs only want to take the money and throw the game and their supporters away. They don't seem to be working on fixing the many bugs the game has or getting rid of the hackers at all. The competion (Fortnite) has been doing an amazing job on keeping hackers away from the game and are frequently updating the game with new stuff to try. Take it from a guy who has 400+ hrs on record I used to hate Fortnite and loved PUBG but I realized who was doing the better job. Hope the devs make something about it.

I Really dont ing know why people still cryes because of bugs and they talking about optimization. OK optimization was a really big problem when game released as early access but now it's good but still has some bad things and i think that if u dont have a graphic card from RX series or GTX 790 or better i don't think that you can complain about this cuz your system sucks. Anyways i've been in top 20 in NA server for a while and these times were ing funny and i still recommend this game to anyone cuz it's ing brilliant.

They are trying hard to keep up with demand but it doesn't seem their willing to expand their team to handle the strain. Graphical issues such as lighting render distance grass and textures are just hard to look at. Vehicles feel like the map turns into a treadmil and the vehicles just stay in place while the map rolls under them very stiff controls and the cars glide on rough terrain as if it's an ice ring. There's a specific moment when you start the game and everyone is loading in a SOUND BUG that literally earrapes you unless you take off your headset completely. The sound of every gun shot and explosion just loops into an infinite static this has been around since launch and they couldnt give 2 f ucks to fix it yet even though its the most annoying thing in the game!! &gt &lt ! Voice chats Unless you're on steam chat with your buddies dont bother with the in game chat. THE MAIN MENU &gt &lt ! The Main menu UI and the Matching Lobby are so badly done For some reason its a MUST to download the Main menu textures and UI EVERY. F#CKING. TIME At the end of every match its like the game restarts from the developer logo cutscenes its annoying just dont!Good things about the game It can be fun with a friend or two. Guns and combat is actually fun atleast they have that going for them. Attachments and obtainable items are pretty cool and work well.What it still needs A better incentive to keep playing maybe a level system that allows you to drop faster to the ground at start run faster or even hold your breath longer while aiming. Gathering points to open an RNG crate that gives you randomly colored clothing is just flat out ret rded i'd like to know who thought that was a good idea. 2006 called they want their graphics back. Seriously the ""High"" settings are a joke it still looks like everything was made from Lamberts phongs and blinns with 100% glossiness and reflectivity get your updated please. Better main menu. Vehicles feel like their flying on ground add bobbing to them ffs. day / night time cycles (i've played almost 8 hours and its only been day time unless there is night time but ive never seen it) Attack dogs let players send out their dog to scout. traps A better incentive then airdrops a supply truck that leaves point A and gets to point B in the process you can try loot it on the move.

2018-01-31,0,0,212,False,Not Recommended,Worst gaming experience I've had in a very long time. This game suffers from so many issues that it is not worth playing. Too many hackers too much server lag too many glitches. Two small maps with the same dozen copy&amp pasted buildings not comparable to something like the maps from Arma 2 OA. Inbuild VPN for no good reason you can choose the servers you want to play on. No region or ping lock. Way too much RNG in form of bad loot and zone luck. The sound engine is trash. Quality and intensity of the sound fluctuates way too much. Sound sources are sometimes off their actual positions by several meters Definitely not something I can tolerate in a game where I fully need to rely on my ears to find out where exactly the enemy is.shiny shiny graphics but i would so much rather play arma 2 again. too bad that it's practically dead since 2014 and the successor doesn't live up to the expectations.Update 31.03.2018 This game is still a ing joke. Despite having a good computer by modern standards the game laggs for no apparent reason when someone nearby starts shooting. Half of my shots that hit the enemy don't get registered blood sprays all over the place but no damage is dealt. Motorcycles are death traps which put you into the matrix before you fall of and hit the ground at 100 km/h on flat surfaces. More than the half of my deaths can be assigned to bugs glitches and a ton of cheaters. The aimbots and no recoil mods are so ing obvious in the deathcam. Sometimes the cam doesn't load due to 'unusual movements which have been detected' as you try to review the footage.Oh and I should mention that I need 20 30 shots fired from the AK47 or M416 to knock out and kill a player from a distance less than 5 meters. This is in the full auto mod and 80% of the bullets hitting. yeah no that's t especially when considering that at least 5 of those shots go straight into the head. Meanwhile the cheaters can kill me with their Kar98k with a heatshot through a level 3 helmet. This game is rigged as hell.Instead of addressing the real issues with the game awful hitscan due to clientside detection inbuild VPN allowing chinese cheaters to join wherever they please cheats in general unbearable server lag making bullet leading next to impossible predetermined safe zones no map selection broken vehicle physics and tons of other stuff I'm too lazy to list they keep adding game mods items a new map and now also weapon skins similar to the stuff known from CS GO. Nothing of real value is done the developers are only on their mission to get as much money out of this crap as possible.Update 20 minutes later After reading a few reviews I can safely say that this simply isn't worth my time. I played 11 games today blatantly obvious cheaters killed me at least 4 times. We won a single game as a 4 men squad. This game isn't fun it's only addictive and something I thought was great to play with my friends as everyone had bought it.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I guess I got my money's worth but I feel sorely short changed after my experience over the past 150 hours. The developers of this game do not know what they are doing. Developing a working bypass cannot be as difficult as they are making it out to be. Millions of people are playing this game which means Bluehole has enormous revenues more than they know what to do with clearly.This evening I queued into duos 8 times with a friend and save for the two games in which we died almost immediately we were killed by hackers each time.

2017-12-21,0,0,106,False,Recommended,It's a really fun game especially with friends. This is the game that you will get hooked on 100%. There are some bugs where you don't see your friends who are online in the game this makes it hard to actually get into a lobby with teammates. In addition there are some unfortunate areas in the new map where your car just randomly flips. This happens rarily in the first map but my friend and I randomly flipped on our motorcycle and the bike actually landed on us and killed us. This doesn't happen that often though as long as you drive properly. I give this game a 8/10. 2 points because of the bugs lobby making and the fact that you mainly play on the new map.

2018-07-28,0,0,207,False,Not Recommended,"WELL AIN'T THIS A PIECE OF CRAP. Yesterday i was playing this game then suddenly it crashed and it says unauthorized steam? When i already bought this game a couple of months back and most of everytime i restart the game and play it it says i'm already in the game like wtf dude seriously? I thought backing up the game to steam and unistalling it to reinstall it only to come up with a piece of thing the devs just did. After getting to the last point of restore backup game file i come up with an error saying i can't continue the update since its content lock and there is this ""WindowsnoEditor.apk"" that won't allow me too. Like are you serious? Because of a crash i cant play the game now because it thinks im illegally playing the game? WTF bring me my money back dude i'm already bad at the game and just play for the and giggle by playing hide and seek with the enemies and i cant do that anymore? THIS GAME ALREADY SUFFERS FROM GUN RECOIL Apparently using the the uzi gives you perfect shot to your enemy from like close to lets say accross the road with like zero gun vertical recoil than an assault rifle with complete set of attachment to increase weapon stability. It even shows that the m4a1 has better recoil management than uzi but the uzi has perfect recoil than an assault rifle with grips and Trust me an uzi is suppose to have the iest recoil manage management than an assault rifle in full spray with complete recoil reduction attachments. Well guess its time to say goodbye to it anyway I was just using it to gain money buy selling cheap crates in the steam market anyways. If you have this game and you love it i hope you dont come accross this bug cause it'll make it unplayable. I've tried to log out and log in again only to see that it says the game is running when its cleary not also if you think i've gave free access of my account to other users then i'll tell you that i dont because that risks my account not being returned to me 2nd restarting the computer doesnt fix the issue with the steam getting this bug where it thinks im in the game when i'm not it doesnt show in the steam that i'm playing it but when i click the game and get to the main screen it says ""unauthorized access to steam"" which clearly thinks my account is in the game and log in and thinks that a 2nd computer is trying to log in to the game and the steam then gives unauthorization to it which results to the situation i am in it's not something that i can fix with reinstalling steam or the game since its a server bs or steam bs either its not something a user can fix. 3rd reinstalling the game will result with you being unable to completely install it because of this data inside the game files which doesnt allow the game to be edited which means its a data for stopping editing of the game which has a connection to cheating i assure i've never done cheating on any games connected to online gameplay because getting banned in a game i payed is really as it means i just wasted my money for something stupid. It results in content lock since the bug of the steam/pubg server thinking im in the game when i'm not results in me not being able to install/play the game. If it gets fixed then thats nice but if itsn't then i guess im not returning to a game or community that doesn't see me as a relevent person though if i was a person who advertise the game lets say shroud then it gives high chance of this situation getting an attention but i guess not. Well bye anyways i probably look like a toxic player cheater or some person who just wants to complain but i assure you i'm not the toxic player and cheater but i did complain in this review My main purpose though is to let everyone know of this new issue that has just arised and hope noone ends up in the same situation as i do.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2018-01-04,0,0,776,False,Recommended,I constantly change my review as the game evolves to match the current state of the game. As of now I still reccommend it because as it stands the past almost 800 hours of PUBG have been some of the best worst and most hilarious moments in gamin I have had with my friends and I wouldn't trade that for anything. The core game is still good old PUBG and if you want to experience this game like we have then it's best to dive right in and do just that.HOWEVER. Beyond good old PUBG this battle pass is trash the game is still buggy which is a good and bad thing (Good for the fun of the game) and although the hacking has been quelled the Chinese are still strung far and wide throughout the US servers. It's by far more common to find asians than americans on our own servers which is very aggravating when the community makes up 60% of the reason to play this game. The battlepass was a HUGE MISTAKE overall. You spend $10 so that you can stop playing good regular fun PUBG and instead do stupid chores like drive for hours on Miramar (The worst map it's a fact) and try and waste your time challenge running to pray that you can kill someone with your fists or wind up cheesing it with your friends.

Unfortunately this game is still very buggy glitchy and filled with hackers which ruins the experience for me. I could overlook all of these things if I knew that the devs were genuinely working towards solutions for these problems. However that does not seem to be the case here. I absolutely one hundred percent will not support or recommend a game in which the developers continually push microtransactions or lootboxes or ""event passes"" or whatever you fancy instead of stabilizing the engine working out shoddy vehicle physics fixing microstutter lag and of course the icing on the cake the rampant hacking. I'm not confident that this will ever be resolved. I think the devs are going to milk this cashcow until she kills over. In summary PLEASE don't waste your money on this game.

2017-09-01,0,0,439,False,Not Recommended,"PUBG's premise (the battle royale game mode where a number of equally equipped players are dropped into an ever shrinking play zone and must scavange for resources weapons and the like) is ingenious in its entertainment potential. However no name developer Bunghole is... what? It's Bluehole? ...are you sure? Well I'll be you're right. As I was saying Bunghole's execution of Battle Royale is flawed beyond repair so as to attain the previously unattainable title that I've never once deemed upon any game before it in my 30+ years of gaming. And that is ""The only game to be scored a 0/10"". Congrats Bunghole you've earned it in spades.You're a warfare simulator and yet you couldn't program a hitbox (or the subsequent application of damage from it) if your life (or my digital life) depended on it. PUBG is consistently inconsistent in this regard. Flawless shots at point blank ranges or ones well within the area of effectiveness are constantly rendered as misses even on stationary targets yet the enemy is constantly able to acquire headshots on moving targets and completes 90% of their kills within the first 2 bullets each and every time.But if hitboxes aren't your thing (cause they sure aren't Bunghole's thing) what about the fact that here we are in 2018 and we have a game whose audio seems to only officially support 2.1. Audio I've taken you for granted never truly understanding your value as the other half of the coin in video games that looked great (which PUBG is not). But audio truly plays a pivotal role in determining enemy position and the geniuses at Bung spared no expense in supporting left and right channels just nothing more than that. I cannot count how many times I've just heard gunshots to the left or right and had to turn to attain additional information about front/rear only to be left in an audible hell where I cannot discern any useful information from the muddled sounds and take my hands off the controls out of pure frustration and fighting against the game more times than an enemy.To boot the UI and graphics are not localized well. ""YOU died finally""? And the shills at Bunghole have made it painfully obvious that they're more interested in making content than fixing bugs. How do they reward players? With a 10% chance to earn a crate that ISN'T behind a paywall which has a 99.9% chance to drop duplicate useless cosmetics. Throw in the fact that service reliability is still alpha stage often having services go down for no apparent reason nor having a patched server environment at the ready whenever updates are pushed. You're often left without the ability to play the game for 1 4+ hours.And cheats. Wow. Even after tons of lip service from this no name no skilled developer they have done next to nothing (beyond providing false hope that they've done anything to put a dent in the online cheating) in fact PUBG is synonymous with cheating. To say it's rampant is an understatement. The deathcam (poorly) shows people track you through terrain and just snap the cursor to your head making all shots register as 1 hit kills. They can say they've banned X millions of players but there's always X million more cheats that their countermeasures are effectively missing. The game is on the way out they don't have the skill to take on dealing with this issue and the forever nickel and dimed community is the one paying for it.This all culminates in a game that I am ONLY playing because no other Co Op exists. But mark my words when even a subpar game comes out I will flush this turd of a game off my machine once and for all confident in the fact that ""You don't have to make a quality product for it to be popular."" Is PUBG popular? Absolutely. Heck PlayerUnknown cries like a baby each time someone talks about doing Battle Royale better (and that won't be hard giving how low the bar he set the mode). But is it quality? All different types of HELL. NO. This game is garbage and so are the devs who pander it.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

You will quickly learn that most items and weapons are useless though. You will constantly visit the same areas because those places provide beat gear and you need best gear to have any chance of winning.The game ends up being repetitive and boring. Every game is the same. You can't play how you want to play. The bad weapons are so much worse than the few (maybe 4) good ones that you will completely ignore them. The player has no option to try going it with SMGs or one of the bad sniper rifles. You will die because the good weapons will kill you in as few as one shots or kill you much quicker than you can kill the enemy. Be prepared to pass up or drop supposedly uncommon weapons as they give you no chance at winning.Everything in the game screams developed and created by amateurs. It constantly crashes. The replay feature does not represent what just occurred. Hackers abound. Vehicles try to kill you and often succeed. ""Loot"" is poorly distributed around the map you can end up with two of the best weapons and no helmet or go through several buildings without finding any weapon.Only certain special streamers get private servers so prepare to play the same game over and over again.

The inclusion of the Death Cam feature is welcome and really drives home how many cheaters there are which is really disheartening and as a result means I can't recommend this game.Before you purchase definitely keep this in mind and read forums to see if they have cleaned it up at all.

2017-07-26,0,0,83,True,Not Recommended,Be aware PLAYERUNKOWN has broken promises to not include paid for DLC while in Early Access. Additionally they will be removing all cosmetic items when the game leaves early access where you can only obtain items via micro transactions. Just know you can't take them for their word.In terms of the game it can be fun but you have one map and theres lag often in the beginning of every round.Update 9/22/17 Now in the devs wisdom they are suing a different developer for developing a game in the same genre as PUBG. I can't in good conscience recommend this game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-09-22,0,0,4,True,Recommended,Good but would be better if you could jump straight into a new game straight from the end screen. Did find it quite buggy but might just be my setup. Got a lot of texture pop and jerkiness also kept defaulting to Australian servers. Might jump back in post launch when the experience is a little more polished.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-09-22,0,0,37,True,Not Recommended,Seemed ok at first but i have not seen any real development of the game. Just more and more items. It also does not seem to run very well compared to many other games I play online.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-07-25,0,0,781,False,Not Recommended,I've played this game for more than a year now and it's my most played game on steam. This game gave me feelings and excitement in games that I've never yet experienced before in any other game! The rush of adrenalin when you get top 10 (especially your first few times) is just awesome!Although I play it most days still it's infuriating and has become just a money grab right now. Devs constant promises of fixing the servers and desync etc (or just completely ignoring it) has become too much for many. This game had such promise and to be honest still does if the devs work on the core issues rather than releasing new cosmetics and crates (that you need to pay for a key to open the crates in most cases!!). In summary Yes I've had some of my best gaming moments ever playing this game it is truly special experience. The game is well optimized in terms of FPS and smoothness compared to last year when it got a lot of (deserved) hate. But I cannot whole heatedly recommend it unless you have money to throw away. Not to mention the desync and server issues (dying behind a wall because your opponents still see you peeking etc.) Here's to hoping the devs can transform the game and restore it to it's former glory as there will never be another BR quite like this one.TLDR Buy it if you want a crazy adrenalin rush and have money to throw away but otherwise it's not worth the money in it's current state.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-08-17,0,0,258,False,Not Recommended,I used to say every update makes this game better but it doesn't anymore. It's just at the same point it has been for the last month only some gameplay changes but the game is not optimized at all.And now they are introducing more microtransactions battle passes crates you have to buy keys for and that's on top of the 30 price.They also removed proper map selection because some of the maps just didn't get picked enough. What a silly reason fix your game instead of removing a feature that confronts you with the hard truth.PUBG has been fun but it's become more stale every update. If you want to buy it now don't. Wait for some new games that'll do it better.So why am I still playing? It's the only game that scratches the itch I have.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-23,0,0,68,True,Recommended,Just buy it. Its in your cart RIGHT NOW! Buy the game and be happy with your new found human hunting skills. PUBG is a stright forward BR game. The idea is that you survive to be number 1 in a match. I made it to #2 yesterday but was killed in a amazingly stressfull fire fight ( Many new players will be slightly confused when they enter the match lobby. Its a great way to wait for the start of the game since you can run around and shoot people while they are in a queue. When the match starts you'll find your self in a flying c 130 with 100 other people waiting to parachute out. Once you've figured out where to jump out you'll get a nice view of the map and other players at 20 000 ft. Once you hit the ground you must find ANYthing that you think can help you win.

2017-06-27,0,0,62,True,Recommended,At first I hated this game the amount of t firefights I got into where I was just shot in the back or shot from someone I couldn't even see was ridiculous 9/10 fights I got into I didn't even get to fire a single shot back that is because third person makes the game extremely RNG and unfair. I counteracted this by playing the game with friends that way we would either spot the person shooting at us or if one of us got downed we could get eachother back up and actually have a chance at shooting back. I believe that if they added in a first person only gamemode not only would it make it much more fair and balanced but it would actually require you to have much more skill and the game would become much more competitive.Pros Fun game to play with friends Really intense at times Fun to just around in OR to be super competitive in whatever you feel like at the timeCons Parachuting to the ground at the start of the game is ing annoying No first person only gamemode Still a lot of bugs Eats up a LOT of RAM (uses over 8gb) Unoptimized (I get 50 100 FPS with a GTX1080 on max not good.) 9/10 fights are you just getting shot in the back or shot by someone you don't even seeOverall rating 7/10,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-23,0,0,496,True,Recommended,This game simply put is addicting. The replayability of this game paired with some mates makes it one of the best games I have played. Yet this game is still in early acces and has a bright future ahead included with some of the most dedicated devs I have ever seen. That said even if you dont have the specs to run the game optimization is constantly being updated and improved so in my opinion this game is a must buy.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-23,0,0,54,True,Recommended,First off would totaly recomend this game. I was instantly hooked and round after round it keeps me coming back for more. I love the reward of getting a kill and the adrenalin that the game trips in you as you never know if you are the hunter or the hunted. I have to say though I hope that as they continue to develope the game they create some game modes that are longer rounds. I love the idea of the shrinking circle to move players together and to keep the rounds short but sometimes I really wish they had a game mode that was longer and not so rushed by the circle. All in all a great game and i am excited to see what else the devs bring to the table.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Cant you ban the chinese from American servers? they inundaye them and they hack its always a chinese person that hacks..every single hack ive encountered was from a china player.Ban them from american servers why cant they stay on Asian servers? br&gt and thats why I'm changing my review from positive to negative im still playing it I still love it but its too anoying to leave positive untill something is done Original review I can't stop playing and its interfering with my sleeping schedule. Original (it may be kinda like Rust though i havent played rust) Hard (not gonna win a match any time soon but it's ok) entertaining.

2018-04-30,0,0,575,False,Not Recommended,This might be a fun game to play with friends but on its own PUBG is literally one of the worst games I've played. I can't remember a game so full of bugs and glitches and random bullsh** happening. Seeing how this is a competitive multiplayer game it stands to reason that every player should enter the match without any (dis)advantages. Of course this isn't what usually happens. Here's some of the 'features' you should expect when playing this sad game Your parachute glitching out just 'hanging' there in mid air not letting you land long enough for someone to run by and finish you off. A piece of furniture not loading properly making you stuck or unable to move until someone else runs by... A vehicle glitching out throwing you out of your seat starting to flip like mad exploding or doing something similarly unpleasant. Hearing 'ghost' noises from time to time E.g. noises of people running by despite the fact there's no one there. Endless running In its core PUBG is a running/walking simulator. Expect to spend at least 3/4 of your game time walking/running around looking for loot/cover. Random game crashes 'Bad modules' have become the modus operandi in the business of PUBG. Cheaters The game has an insanely high amount of cheaters with just a million banned in January alone. Expect to run into them regularly. Conclusion The game is absolute cancer. If you're thinking of buying it think again.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-10-31,0,0,267,False,Recommended,Update as of 12/22/2017 The game has recieved significant improvements on launch. It is still definitely flawed and suffers from a myriad of issues but I believe it's stable enough to be worth the price regardless. I'm too burned out on the game to enjoy it at this point but if I was a brand new player I'm sure it'd be fun for at least a few weeks. Hopefully I'll be able to enjoy it again personally with future updates.Previous review below Yikes what a mess lmao. I've played a decent amount of this game and I will likely play it for many more hours purely because it is something easy to play with friends. But I cannot pretend this game is good or recommend it in its current state. The optimization is terrible and the game has become increasingly unstable and frustrating to play. I know this game is in early access and the devs were (understandably) not prepared for the number of people that ended up playing it but that doesn't change the fact that the game is just an absolute mess at the moment. The transparency from the devs also leaves much to be desired imo. I'd like this game to be good. I think in time it might be. But it is not currently. I'll update my review if that ever changes.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-09-04,0,0,140,False,Recommended,This is the best game I have played in for ever the customeisation is so great the shooting and everything else is so great graphics are really good and one of my favorite things apart of the game is how big the map is there is so much to explore and there are so many cities and so game can be so slow sometimes but you always have to keep a eye out for danger and if you want the game to get hectic really fast go to a major city or a military base cause so many people go there and its so fast to find a weapon so shooting goes on instantly. Those are my thoughts for the game $29.99 may seem like a lot but I think it is worth it for how good this game is.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

My nipples could cut ice while playing this. Gunplay is great and smooth (besides shotguns but hey its only in early access) and the impending circle doom mechanic will cause tension fear and a lust for victory especially when it gets down to less than a square meter in diameter. 9/10.

2017-07-24,0,0,491,True,Recommended,"I wanted to leave a review on PUBG. This will be my first one but I just wanted to say if you enjoy FPS/TPS then you will enjoy this game. The survival aspect will get you feeling a little anxious at times but that's what will make you come back to play it. The community isn't terrible the 100 people wait at the start can be a little absurd due to the immaturity and racial callouts but none the less it's a game with quite an age range. The Devs take team killing serious which is nice ofc if it is only done on purpose. I've been killed in a squad for grabbing a sniper rifle and so on. The DEVS have done a great job at expanding the game thus far. When I first played it was nowhere near optimized ( yes still needs optimization). The game I can now play on higher settings with less lag which they've fixed the lag post parachute etc as well. Guns feel well balanced I have maybe ran into 1 2 people cheating and that's it. They have added guns vehicles and mized up vehicle spawns. They fixed crates etc as well. They are implementing better jump mechanics( before you couldn't jump over a fance etc) and adding vaulting adding sliding over cars and jumping out of windows (excited for) So needless to say if you like early access and although most really don't feel you should have to play to test a game and have people ""fix it"" when you notice everything that is wrong b/c DEVS may you..This is one game DEVS have proven they are working on it and doing well at listening to the community while mkaing a good name for themselves. 10/10. Although game is till being worked on I can only hope more positivity from the work DEVS have done. I am excited to see what customization you guys add since it's been lacking but I prefer what you've been doing game optimization etc then customization. Customization means nothing if the game blows. So keep it up thanks for the game!",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-03,0,0,135,True,Recommended,Battlegrounds wastes no time putting you right in the middle of the action as up to 100 players join a server and pick their moment to jump out of a plane and parachute onto a large 8x8 km island. Even this first act is a critical decision and must be part of your strategy jumping early lets you hit the ground first giving you a jump on the competition but may also place you farther from the center of the arena where the fighting must inevitably funnel towards. Jumping late might give you some distance from other players giving you some early breathing room before entering the fray. Jumping right into the center especially in large cities where most players drop will place you right in the middle of the action. THAT'S WHAT I ING LIKE,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-03-27,0,0,1148,False,Recommended,"Ok update as of 4 26. The latest patch massively is changing the game and it's a ton better now. NICE WORK BLUEHOLE! Also glad I can stay dedicated on Mirimar now instead of campity camp es sitting in grass and bushes in the old map. I will keep my old review below but the game is a lot better now guys. Thanks!________________________There was a 2 week period where the anti cheat patch was in effect and the game was AWESOME. Unfortunately every single N1GG3R cheater (any chinese or Twitch streamer names are guaranteed cheaters) will auto kill you. I only play FPP and the cheats are just as bad there as TPP but marginally better at least in FPP. NA region by the way. Once they rolled the anti cheat patch back to allow cheaters to re buy the game and make more money for themselves the game went back to its status. They definitely could of solved the cheater problems if they wanted to but that would lose them money from all those that re buy the game. 16% or more of the population cheats in this game that's insane considering it's not including all undetected cheaters and those that macro script cheat. Advice ADD RANDOM VERTICAL RECOIL. At least no recoil would disappear if auto spray was entirely random after shot 2 or 3. The guaranteed death AR spray will get you instantly with lvl 3 armor helm at long range. Even driving or behind walls from a split second peek they instant spam mini14 sks or any AR and you die. I kill maybe 1 or 2 every 100 times a car drives by (not talking about buggies or bikes here but trucks/buses/dacias) but hackers kill you instantly outright even in trucks or dacias at full speed while swerving. Damn shame because the content was reallly well done in this mirimar desert map was so much fun without hackers ruining it. Dead game. I gave it a few months but it is not improved. Fixes have to come before content. Anti cheat should be #1 but it's not and those that claim ""it's not easy to stop cheats"" are probably cheaters because it is easy to determine them. Over 1 million cheat bans in a month... That's insane... Better games on the way. Region lock might be coming and that wont save the situation. At least if they did that early on it would of alleviated most of the hackers out of american servers but they would lose income. Notice this folks once the new crates and skins (cosmetics you can purchase) hit the market they mention region locking. Once they replace the ""re purchasers"" (i.e. hackers who keep getting banned and return) then they MAY finally go after the hackers and I'll change my review. Money is understandable for motivation but ethics and quality should always come first. It's been a year no excuse for not exterminating most or all hacking. Worst I've seen in any game and I've been around gaming since the 80's. Beautiful game ruined by greed. If they at least re input the anti cheat patch they rolled back that would help quite a bit. Don't roll it back because you want to milk more money from cheaters. Those that complain either have awful computers and/or cheats and should not be allowed to play. NO EXCEPTIONS. Anyways better and grander BR style games are on the way and I won't be alone in dropping this game once they hit. It would be a dream to prosecute those that cheat and require gov ID to buy these kind of games but I doubt that will ever occur. Props to china gov for at least trying to combat hackers slightly. Fortnite has too many colors for me and I hate TPP (I'm very old). Hopefully I can change my review in the future but DO NOT BUY this game for the time being.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Stats are usless because of the cheaters and loot crates with anything interesting is ultra rare. The idea of this game is get in get out fun and it is until... The Asian horde invades the NA server. The amount of hackers caught now exceeds 1.5 MILLION. It is sadly only a drop in the bucket because we see blatant and suspicious activity in 1 in 3 games now. ESP / Aimbot/ No recoil/ Healt generation / no armor damage cheats are the most common. Days or weeks later battleeye places a ban they buy another game for $5 to $15 and they are back online. Lag factors are still a thing ( bullet hit registration) and optimization is still far from optimal. It's fine if you want to lower all your settings and run in 1080. I run on a GTX 1080 at 2560 or 3840 res and well it averages about 42 to 62 frames. Details RNG damage that is Hackers new hacks each week blatant and not so blatant.BugsPoor optimizationTeaming Silly physics for vehiclesEvery updated causes server side connection issues.For a shooter it has some serious issue with players being able to actually connect bullets to each other. Serious Latency issues.Guns are only visually represented but not realistically correct ( recoil ballistics ammunition general function damage to target) and bent with a Dev hammer to fit a spot on the list.Sad thing is it seems to be vastly popular even though you can see all these things on players streams and or you tube on a daily basis. Popularity might be due to it is the only decent looking massive multiplayer shooter out there. Additionally it views well on twitch so viewers are entertained by consistant player action. Redeeming value is that you can opt out any time and walk away from it.Save your money until they fix this hot mess and then buy it. Or buy it now be aggrivated and un install.

It's great fun when you aren't fighting against people with 2000+ ping from china or people that hack the games weird third person coding. If you don't want to play with cheaters play in first person. PUBG Corp implement a ping limit so that if you have higher than 150 ping for longer than 2 minutes you get kicked from the game. I don't want to be at a disadvantage because some Chinese guy can't play on his own servers so he comes to ours. To all the people who say you need a god tier rig to play the game update your I have a gtx1060 and 16 gb of ram. I have an I5 core. I have some basic case. In total it's costed me 500$ over 4 years.

Game in short is being ruined by the amount of aim no recoil and hackers there are in general..The game still has lag problems D syc issues that im sure in comming patches well be fixed.with the lauch of this last patch you can find yourself playing really only the 2nd map Desert an in game mode to be able to pick which map u can play would be really helpfully to the player base and all Still needs more guns........

2017-03-24,0,0,326,True,Not Recommended,Switched to negative. They are adding a microtransaction system for cosmetics that offers no alternatives to earning items and costs $2.50 a pop for keys to gamble on crates for a piece of clothing which isn't even guaranteed to not be a duplicate.************************************************************************************************************************************Most of the bad reviews are about performance which is dumb considering this has already been acknowledged and addressed by the dev team and that optimizations will be a major focus while in EA. Secondly with a few config tweaks and startup options which you can find under the guides section for the game on Steam I went from it not really being very playable to getting a steady 60fps.A lot of these reviews are from people who have bought the game played 1 round died in a few minutes then exited left a bad review and refunded which means their negative reviews will not change even if all of their issues are solved in the next few weeks and I believe under Steam's upcoming review changes their reviews won't even count towards the game's score soon.Aside from that the game is really fun its quite steep at the price it is (I was expecting more around 20 than 26.99 and it is more expensive for the UK than most other places) but it has a lot of potential Pros Familiar controls Low time to kill for sniper rifles only the heaviest/rarest of head armor will protect against a single headshot headshots with assault rifles on unarmored targets seem to kill instantly Cool way of distributing players (Cargo plane with all 100 players flies in a straight line across part of the island players can jump out skydive and parachute at any point over the island) Plenty of loot every building has a whole bunch of loot spawns and you rarely aren't able to find any weapons and when you start to learn certain buildings have better or more spawns than others you start to strategize while still in the plane Vehicles aren't insanely rare but they aren't literally everywhere either Nice and easy to use UI inventory management isn't a nightmare and you have to spend very little time looking at the inventory screen overall Solo duo and squad queues for teamplay Queue time is usually 5s for games and had very few server issues means you can launch up and get into a game in less than a minute.Cons Serious performance issues (Which the dev claims are a big focus right now) Sound design could use some work it can often be very hard to tell the direction noises are coming from and there doesn't seem to be any kind of sound occlusion so even if you are deep inside a house you can hear footsteps outside as though they were right next to you.

2017-08-18,0,0,136,False,Not Recommended,"Earlier review left at bottom for reference my opinion since writing the original review has since changed. Previously I found that the game was a cool concept hamstrung by a few obnoxious flaws but worth the half AAA game price for the time that you would get out of it.Unfortunately for me and for this game I feel that the devs have added to these issues instead of fixing them.I made 3 points in my original review1) when you get shot it is extremely difficult to figure out where the shots came from before you die (this has not been tweaked but is only personal preference)2)the game needed a killer POV deathcam (this has been added YAY 1/3)3) Team play offeres very little in the way of rewards (this has been made EXPONENTIALLY worse with the advent of the greediest loot box scheme I have ever seen more below)so as you can see one of my problems went almost unaddressed the most minor of my complaints (one not affecting rewards or gameplay) was fixed and the rewards system was gutted into the ground by the 1.0 patch.TO CLARIFYthe greedy loot box practice i am talking about is not the practice of the loot boxes themselves but the fact that loot boxes are now ONLY avalible through payment. the old system had loot boxes with (admittedly crappier) gear avalible to STICKER PRICE players which allowed them some level of customizability. Now the ONLY way to get loot boxes is to earn them in game THEN shell out $2.50 each for keys to open them no free option no nothing.In addition this game's cheating has gotten out of control. especially because region locking would simply fix the problem. At this point the cheaters are making enough money opening loot boxes that the expense of their accounts being banned can be easily written off as the cost of doing business we need better anti cheat on top of that they only allow players to report for snap aiming move speed hacks and other aimbots there is no option for HP hacking or other exploits.for these reasons my solid reccomendation is turned to a no go bring back free lootboxes and make the cheaters lives at least a bit harder and I will address this review again. Old review for the record I cant say much about this that everybody else has not the game is amazing with a couple caviats. it SERIOUSLY needs better indicators of where you have been shot from at least in single player. I would suggest a classic ""blood splatter points in the direction you are shot from"" system to accompany shot noises with things like flash hiders and suppressors making the indicator less clear.I would love to see a kill cam from the POV of the person who killed you at least in solos.Better rewards in team mode would also be great.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I know some people are over 60FPS &amp that would be epic but thats not happening on my iMac but I'm still happy I can finally play without buying a gaming PC.My only Complaint is after the parachute flight all the buildings take 1 4 min for them to fully load (The Tab trick doesn't work for me probably because I'm running into performance issues with Mac hardware) Once the buildings load it runs great but before they do its nothing but glitching lagging &amp me trying to do my best and gear up in the shell of buildings &amp invisible obsticals then being screwed once everything loads.

2017-09-16,0,0,654,True,Recommended,Fix the latencey issues PLEASE. Let players pick a server to join based on their individual pings like other online games do. Use an actual server lobby or whatever. If not then auto kick people from match servers when their ping is over 300ms. Its not fair for anyone when pings are so wack between players. I have 100MB internet and more than capable PC its not my hardware! Nothing more frustrating than shots that dont register on the player you are firing at. I mean point blank on full auto and no hit points at all? Next round my shots fired with an M16 and 4x scope pinpointed on a player standing still 50 meters away his body filled practically 1/2 my eyepiece and repeatedly firing single round pops and not a single shot hits? The latest update (09/14/2017) made latencey problems worse than ever game is now broken and nothing but frustratiung to play. FIX THE SERVER ISSUES BEFORE ADDING ANYTHING ELSE NEW PLEASE!!!

2017-08-25,0,0,275,True,Not Recommended,The game was great at launch and then the massive cheater wave began. The problem is how the game is monetized on the steam market. Hackers just cheese the game so much and get so many points to buy massive amounts of crates. Then they sell the rare loot on the crates on the steam market and just buy a new key. The currency system can remain but it needs to be de monitized. In addition people just mask their IPS/use VPN/etc and just change their IPs so the bans are never permanent (because again they just buy new keys). I've seen speed hacks wall hacks aimbots instant 1 shot through level three helmet with a pistol and to be honest the game is almost unplayable now because of it. I avoid PC shooters for this very reason. Perhaps when it comes to Xbox it won't be as riddled with problems but PUBG needs to get this under control because until it does I'm telling all my buddies STAY AWAY FROM THIS GAME.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-02-06,0,0,89,False,Recommended,PUBG is one of the biggest games in 2017. This game is very fun and you can play it with your friends. You can do anything in the map go to big cities kill people drive vehicles loot and much more. BUT THERE IS ONE IMPORTANT THINGthis game is hard to learn. What I mean by that is this game is not like the other games you see in the market and its mechanics and stuff is hard to learn and you learn it by playing for hours and experiencing. For example if your target is moving the bullets wont hit your target if you shoot when the aim is directly at it. You have to shoot forward. Its very complex I cant explain that but you will learn that by playing. Also I recommend buying this game if you HAVE A GOOD PC search if your PC can run this game and then buy it. The negative side of this game is the driving and cars are really buggy. The cars can get stuck through walls and explode. IN CONCLUSION if you buy this game there is a new adventure waiting for you where you fight 100 people in a island and the last one stands WINS.

2018-02-06,0,0,0,False,Not Recommended,This game is genuinly terrible. Let us start with the most obvious problem of all. Its performance issue. For a relatively simple game in terms of graphics and gameplay this game is barely playable and I use barely generously on a lightweight rig. If you don't have a good laptop or desktop that cost you at least 1k then you might as well not buy this game which is why I am really upset because this game shouldn't require that. This games graphics are almost 8 years out of date a decent $700 computer should be able to play this on the low settings but it doesn't. Hell a 1 1.2k computer will barely run it. Second lets talk about the other obvious problem with this game. It isn't fun. It is boring as hell. And to top it off it is simply a bad remake of Battlefield 3. A game that is 6 years old. The only difference is that this game sucks.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-02,0,0,311,True,Not Recommended,This Battle Royale runs choppier than most shooters has bad loot/inventory mechanics glitchy movement horrid driving poor shooting and lacks basic positional awareness tools like HUD hit direction. The chance to win is too heavily determined by RNG for guns optics and backpacks. Oh and what little character customization exists is from loot boxes crammed to the gills with duplicates of bland items.Any of these could be forgiven save that the game has brought the developer warehouses filled to the roof of money for many months now yet so little has gone back into actually improving obvious Quality of Life issues.The Battle Royale genre is great.

2017-09-26,0,0,37,True,Not Recommended,"Update2 2 months later. I wanted to give it another try after a patch. 1st game laggy as hell. 2nd game crash. 3rd game crash with message ""corrupted data verify your installation"". Can't play it after that. So far it's terrible piece of garbage.//Update1 It crashed my pc with red scren (no BSOD but RSOD) first time in my life... And my pc haven't crashed for quite some time (months). Won't run it again for quite some time....//For me personally total waste of money.I spent first few hours trying to fix their bugs with UI and controls still couldn't work around everything (I can't alt tab nor play it borderless fullscreen). All of these are easily fixable yet they remain there for quite some time. X Funny thing if you put windowed in start options it actually switches to fullscreen (in my case?) but still works better than when I set the fullscreen in UI in config menu.. I also couldn't fire in few games...Also the movement and jumping for example feels slugish and laggy a lot.I got to top 10 twice (2x 6th place) but I have it counted just once in stats. X And I haven't shot anyone for the whole time because it can happen you won't meet anyone. )I got impression from the streams that it's more shooting and less camping and laying in high grass but unless you rock 2 4 man well managed squad that's totally not the case.And then it's just dying to camping people after running to get in circle for 10 minutes... Or being constantly bombed under red zone for 3rd time (no kiding!).And maybe the most con for me is the lack of some training mode in which you could train with weaspons or vehicles (the pre match isn't enough as the weapons despawn on pickup another easily fixable thing).The other important aspect is that's too luck/random dependent your landing spot vs circle gun spawn (especially if you land in more crowded area) vehicle spawn (vehicles are more relevant than you might think).And the last optimalization I got 40fps staring into wall. ))) Even BF1 runs better and looks awesome (and is more fun).So don't expect shooter and bug free experience. And definitely don't expect them to finish it anytime soon. From uptill now development it seems more likely they will hold onto early access as long as possible. But if you like camping for 20 minutes go for it! D",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

There are tremendous issues with player movement loot loot boxes lag directional sound etc. The list could go on and on of things that should have been fixed before full release. I played this game from the beginning and I even played the original ArmA 2 Battlegrounds mod which i think had more substance and replayability than this sorry excuse for a full game.

2018-05-12,0,0,27,False,Not Recommended,"Once upon a time this was an incredibly promising game with a relatively untouched concept. based on a mod for one of the greatest mil sims of all time. But overtime Strangled by poor coding and a less than ideal engine. Bad design choices Catering to E sports over making a fun experience. An overwhelmingly poor willingness to do anything about the majority of problems. The game's ineffective multi layer anti cheat is best summed up in the immortal words of Forest Gump ""Life's like an onion. you peal it back a layer at a time...Sometimes you cry"" Well Crying is something you can expect to do a lot in this game because when you get through the layer after layer of pointless and ineffective cheat prevention You just find a rotten onion at the middle. Nothing that seems worth your time. It's potential has been squandered and it teetered on a slippery slope for some time. The most fun to be had was an event that was ended less than 24 hours after it began because said event exposed just too many flaws of the game for it to keep going. It has sadly fallen down that slippery slope and shows no signs of slowing down. Attempt after attempt to bring this game back from the brink have failed and an obvious misunderstanding of what players want mean that this game has no chance.It honestly seems like the game is just made up of hundreds of store assets chosen with little regard for their compatibility The code is made of angry spaghetti and won t be a good experience without re codding huge parts of the experience. Sadly I see PUBG going on to be the worlds most famous and successful asset flip. The developers have let us down and it is depressingIf I could go back and refund this game I would in a heartbeat. It has failed to hit it s mark and isn t just a bad game but a poor experience overall with no respect for it s players. If someone tries to convince you to play this game because at this point I doubt you would try it on your own. Stay far away it s an experience rotten to it s core with corruption cheaters bugs and a lack of any sort of development vision. Stay far away and avoid this game At any price.

However this game is smooth and easy controls but not arcadey where it just feels cheap.I haven't encountered any hackers and the devs seem competent and open with everything that they plan on doing.

2017-11-20,0,0,44,True,Not Recommended,If like me you never really played DayZ or any other battle royale style game. Your first foray into this game will be a mixed bag. When you eventually start to grasp looting and the general dos and don'ts you will start to enjoy this game. It will keep you coming back for one more go as you start to rack up some kills. But give it a month or so and when you have a few games of getting awesome loot only to be one shotted from nowhere. You will question why you bother. Add that to how poor this game plays and it can be highly infuriating. The bullet simulation is hit and miss. Some games you shoot and people die. Other times you can shoot someone who is prone and nothing happens. You can tactically outwit a player only to open fire and then they spin round one shot you and then teabag your body.It's these annoyances with the game that mean I can't recommend it. For all the great moments you have on this game you have about 3 tedious moments. I had a break and came back to it and it only seems to have got worse. Hopefully they can iron things out.

2017-09-18,0,0,189,True,Not Recommended,"104 hours into the game now. Having paid a retail price for an early access game my expectations are comiserate with the cost. In other words I'm finding the game to be sorely wanting at this point. The word ""repetitive"" doesn't do justice to the amount of one dimensional rinse and repeat gameplay this game delivers. The first 100 drops or so are fun and can be entertaining but it then goes down hill from there. One of the first frustrating elements you will notice is that the pros and the hackers have the same superhuman ability. Be it 10 feet or 1000 yards on the move or not they will not miss....ever. It's the Matrix or Dead Pool physics only you are on the receiving end. Next you'll begin to notice that in close quarters the player who is moving and shoots first will have all of his/her hits register long before you have time to shoot back or move to cover. Regardless of the armor you so painstakingly collected you will die instantly to multiple headshots before you can even pull the trigger. In tech terms they see you they move and they shoot and their shots register at the same time your client is being told by the server that they are moving and shooting. So by the time you actually see them on screen their bullets are already hitting you. This is a common problem with FPS games but there is better algorithyms out there than what is in this game. Noting this is dramatically exacerbated by the inhuman accuracy decribed above. Lastly there are a lot of cheaters in this game. Not the blatent kind but the ones who know batter than to be too obvious. I believe this because 1 in 5 games I will have an apposing player know exactly where I am and what direction I am facing without me making a sound and of course they put a full auto burst right into my noggin every time. There are other shortfalls in the game mechanics that I will simply attribute to this being early access. Like the game placing way too much emphasis on ""the circle of doom"". It feels like the devs are so proud of this construct they've made it THE centerpiece of gameplay. It is all powerful and the main opponent in every end game with the main tactic being to not get screwed (forced to make a sucide run) by the circle. Instead of ""Battlegrounds"" they should have called this game ""Battle Circle"" or ""Circle Jerk"" or some such thing. One other thing I noticed about the game. Once you win your first Chicken Dinner you get a kind of ""Lord of the Flies"" feel. Meaning the combat feels so unrewarding and luck based i.e who gets seen and who doesn't who finds good stuff and who doesn't who shoots first and who doesn't who had better ping and who doesn't and the rewards for winning are so pathetic you just don't feel any sense of achievment. This is my 2 cents ATM. It might get better but I don't see them adding different game modes anytime soon. If they are smart they will release the server to the public for private hosting very soon so players and create the variaty in game types and modes that is needed to keep this game fresh.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-09-18,0,0,208,True,Recommended,This game is fun especially with friends but personally it could benefit from two things (for me personally) at the time of writing this1) A training ground I think itd be greatly useful for players to be able to get to know how shooting works in this game without only getting the chance of one gunfight a game to get used to shooting. If you could boot up an offline server to try the weapons and work out how best to use them or maybe a tutorial it would be helpful.2) Some more scoping options I'm sure i won't be the only one but i personally like to hold down the right mouse button to scope yet there is no option for this. Instead i can only toggle or double click and hold the button which I dislike. this is a minute point but it feels somewhat major for me personally.Even without these two things solved i can have some good games and get a few good shots but it would be a bunch more fun for me if these two things were implemented.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-11-03,0,0,462,True,Not Recommended,As it stands avoid the game. I have played since June and have loved it up until about 3 4 weeks ago. One of the best games in recent years however it is over run with hackers. Aimbot/wallhack/speed hack it's all there. It is not enjoyable at the minute you either die really early due to hackers or you have a really good game but die in the last 10 players due to hackers. The hacking is obvious too there is a pattern to bullets that hit you and speed hack speaks for itself. If they manage the hackers then I would say 100% pick the game up but wait until there is more news or reviews saying it's been sorted. I fear it never will be as the hackers will now be one step ahead of each ant cheat method. I am currently NOT recommending the game based on that.I will edit my review accordingly when the time comes. I feel the game grew too big too quickly for the current studio. Another mistake was taking it to a competative level when it isn't even out of alpha stage yet. Also with the upcoming XBOX release I feel their resources were stretched too far to concentrate on the development optimisation and cheat free game that this was in early access season 1 and early access season 2.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-11-04,0,0,106,True,Not Recommended,After passing 100 hours in this game and having both good and bad times in it I thought I was qualified to give a review. Short version +concept+weapon variety optimization major server lag due to inadequate servers and excessive traffic from overseas graphics while passable at high would pass for an early 2000s game at a playable framerate if you live in a rural area chances are your internet cannot run this. Regardless of ping dependent on download and upload speeds. Personally I've had many cases where 15 20 bullets out of 30 miss at point blank range. gunplay feels incredibly clunky movement feels incredibly clunky unfixed exploits/cheats/hacks allow you to be headshotted anywhere which the overly sensitive banning system hasn't been able to fixOverall I love the concept of this game. However I think the developers haven't implemented it well enough to actually recommend this game. I may be biased as I'm used to other games but the guns feel terrible. They're unlike any other game that I've played and that's not a good thing in this case. Emptying 20 30 bullets at point blank range (aiming down sights) and hitting the enemy twice isn't exactly a hallmark of good gameplay... and that wasn't an isolated incident. It's happened with nearly every gun for me. I've played shooters for 8 10 years and this isn't a problem with most other games I've played.As much as I want to I have to recommend against getting this game. I praise those who become skilled at it but I think most people have neither the location the hardware nor the patience to get a reasonable amount of enjoyment out of it.On a final note fix the Chinese servers before doing huge updates to the game. Nearly every time I join a game there are many many overseas players... which doesn't do favours for anyone's ping serverwide.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

It is actually not so bad.Update for Jan '18The rubberbanding isnt that bad like it used to be. The game definitely progressing in a good way but still the cheaters is still all around .

2017-11-03,0,0,475,True,Recommended,"This game is fantastic. Its still early Access so it has problems but there has been some mega hate on the game for almost no reason. People complain that updates are coming to fast and so they slow it down and then people complain that the updates are to slow. you can't please them. The game has exploded so of course the servers are laggy becuase it went from 300k players in july to 2.5 million in November. It still needs work obviously becuase its early access but all these negative reviews are completely unjustified. The reviews about getting banned for stream sniping doesnt happen. I have KILLED several of the top streamers (mostly because I drop at popular places) 365 hours and never been banned despite playing against streamers quite a bit. Stream honking is also some sort of meme becuase the same people were following streamers honking every day once honking released and people got banned. There are videos of people with the names ""DrDasrespect and NinjaIsGay"" stream honking DrDisrespect and Ninja for HOURS but people still try and deny that stream sniping is a thing. Hacking has become somewhat of a problem but the claims that BH is purposely not doing anything so they can make more money is rediculous. They aren't doing anything different than anybody else with hacking. They claim that they need to be Banning Hardware or IPs but no other game banns Hardware or IPs. Also the hacks that these people are buying allow for you to change the hardware ID of your systems and they also come with VPN services so the IP ban don't work either.

2017-11-04,0,0,612,True,Not Recommended,Despite its many faults PUBG was a lot of fun for several months as the game grew. Recently however the insurgence of Chinese players across all region servers has pretty muched ruined the game due to cheating. Until Bluehole can figure out how to curtail cheating either via region lock better anti cheat tools etc. this game is an exercise in frustration.Unfortunately I wouldn't hold out hope in the short term that they actually have the organization manpower or even desire to do much about it. As with other aspects of the game that have been issues for many many months without remediation I expect Bluehole to casually make an attempt at doing something and then move on to adding more features or content instead of solidifying the base content they already have in place.In short Bluehole is completely and totally amateur. Hold off on buying until cheating is solved and the developer gets out of the growing pains stage as a company.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-11-04,0,0,1246,True,Not Recommended,"Stay away... Unfortunately this game has become plagued with hackers even before it's official release. The developers are unable to control it and it has ruined the game. Don't waste your money. Bluehole has admitted this. From the official PUBG Twitter ""We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience caused by the cheaters and promise to take stronger actions against them going forward."" The game has sold 15 million copies and BattleEye claims to have banned 350 000. That's AT LEAST 2% of all copies sold are hackers. So in a 100 player server (which all games are) that's AT LEAST 2 people with ESP speed hacks and aim bots. Terrible.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

This game is really fun especially when you play with friends/squads.Although yeah the main problem in here are the cheaters and bugs. They ruin the game and the experience and basically makes the game unplayable.Speedhackers/Aimbot/ESP/Walls. You name it it's in PUBG. It's sad how a great game (that is pricey by the way) has these much cheaters in it's early access. Yes they reached a 2 million peak of players. That's PUBG i just hope Bluehole fixes their way of banning cheaters. I appreciate their effort on banning over 500k still not enough. One more thing Servers.Servers maintainance all the time. It even happens mid game when you're about to win then you get disconnected. Takes so long to join matches sometimes.Final It's a great game really great game.

2017-10-14,0,0,281,True,Not Recommended,The concept of this game is extremely fun yet i cannot recommend this game. The game has so many issues but the last meaningful patch was 4 months ago. Pretty much everything you can think of is broken in some way and no fixes have been released for them.The devs seem to be really incompetent and just riding the hype for some extra cash. They promised weekly and monthly patches yet you are lucky to see a patch every month by now and if a patch comes out it does nothing to fix the core issues.If i still could refund this game I would....Again this game is really fun as a concept and i believe everyone wants to play the concept but its just not executed well and due to that the game is extremely frustrating due to massive FPS drops Bad hitreg and latency. The FPS drops are so bad that people pick up the useless stun grenade just for the fact that it drops people's fps to single digits. The grenade itself is useless. Just an example of how bad things are.tldr Game looks like preforms like but has a good concept. It just wont ever reach that concept with these devs,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-15,0,0,109,True,Not Recommended,Great idea for a game but ruined by a few things.Firstly the lag issue I have a pretty good set up to game on and fibre optic broadband but even if I reduce the graphics quality until it looks like the Lego movie there is still about a minute after the game starts where a whoile bunch of players are standing still and being picked off because of lag issues.Secondly the bizzare way they make players bunch together by closing an arbitrary circle on a map that everyone has to stay inside or thaey start to die. What is that? Is this a military geme or a sci fi? As a result if you do make it to the last ten there is the lucky sod who happened to land in the right spot in the only building within the playing area and the rest arriving in cars and driving in circles trying not to be the next one killed. Lastly this isn't a free early acces game in fact as they go it's a damn expensive one and on top of that they expect you to pay real money to access crates that you've already wasted 'in game' money buying. So that's cash up front game credits payed out for playing and helping to develop the game and more real world cash afterwards.

The updates are very slowly giving things people actually want and seems they're still too focused on making new crates with weapon skins and other cosmetics to suck more money out of people instead of doing things to make the game better. A huge dissapointment honestly seeing what games like Fortnite are doing and doing so much better than pubg for free. I would recommend not wasting 30$ on this game honestly.

2017-10-17,0,0,10,True,Not Recommended,I tried I tried very hard to like this game. There are many good points for example when you can play the game with friends it is quite fun. However when the first thing on the game the UI doesn't load properly you get annoyed. So you refresh and it works ok then you join a game and you get booted from the server again annoyed. Then you get into a game but it is so laggy that you can't find anything annoyed. Then you finally find a good server in a good game mode and have a few friends only to be team killed because some little wants to be the only person in a team game instead of going solo ANNOYED. There are many points that I can see this game may one day reach but for now considering the amount of money they have squeezed from people you would think they could do better.I will check back with this game in a year but for now it is not worth my time.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-11-29,0,0,161,True,Not Recommended,I find this game as a mixed flavored package. Although the game can be fun especially with friends within your squad. It is also addicting aswell but i find it to be very flawed in certain area's. I find the game to have sloppy development i know it's considered early access but for development terms it has way too many zfighting which bugs me as i see it so much within the game. Then their is the issue of poor optimization even for those using low settings its very CPU heavy. I dislike how the game determines distance with models i could physically see the shift of the model taking place and it looks completely different it's not even a low to high poly adjustment but a completely new concept altogether. As a nit picking to level development grass growing through the floors of buildings tree's and foliage being obviously above ground with some distance of levitation. It becomes irritating to look at when all you notice are these things even amongst casual gaming sessions. The only positive thing i could really talk about is it's gameplay.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-11-25,0,0,551,True,Not Recommended,2/10 would not recommend. 6 for there being hackers in every lobby. Out of 5 matches today I've ran into 5 duos with at least 1 hacker in the bunch. Witnessed a dude down/ kill 7 people with only headshots shooting only 7 bullets and then proceeded to kill me and my buddy in a split second nowhere near eachother. 2 for performance. I have an amazing computer and even in mostly lowest graphics settings (because it's easier to see people in grass like that makes sense right?)

2018-06-06,0,0,282,False,Recommended,Best Battle Royale on the market at the moment. Realistic slow paced game with lots of weapons and attachments 2 maps 3rd coming soon and pretty solid netcode at the moment. Of course it has it's faults some bugs haven't been fixed and after 200 hours it's getting boring without friends. Still one of my favourite games. Only thing I really don't like is microtransactions in paid game but it's still not even close to being as bad as in games like Battlefront 2 or sportsgames like Fifa or NHL. I rarely die to t and I feel like this game would be really good experience to all people if it was optimized better and if it had better terrain hitboxes and bit better netcode. There is enough weapons in this game and enough attachments in my opinion and I think this is like only one really good balanced BR just because first person game mode and every gun feels just really good not too much recoil on the weapons like there shouldn't be but still bit too much to be fully realistic game.I would rate 7/10 would play with friends but alone played this game is pretty boring (like 90% of other games as well).But you know everything is way funner with few friends.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I kept on playing but it got old and due to how unfinished the game was at the time I stopped playing it for awhile. But i came back and noticed a new map guns sights attachments and even achievments. I realized that even though the game came out it still was not finished. Is the game perfect? No. But they are slowly fixing gliches and expanding it making it playable. I remember back when these Gamecoms crates came out and i basically made all my money back and then some extra. It's a really fun game to play with your friends and i would recommend it. (or you could go play fortnite for free like the noob you are),PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-28,0,0,562,False,Recommended,Playerunknown's Battlegrounds is a very mixed game in terms of pro's and cons.It's an incredibly fun game IF you're planning to play with friends and is intense and rewarding when playing solo but the real fun comes when you play with friends. This game is filled with so many problems as much as the average early access game.Lots of people complain about this due to the fact they have sold over 25 million copies and took it out of early access.A large majority of the reviews here will not recommend this game due to the fact it's riddled with bugs and the developers are very slow in terms of fixing these bugs. But the pro's and the fun that comes out of this game makes it so easy to stop caring and forget about the problems at the end of the day especially when winning. But although I am recommending this game Playerunknown's can be so frustrating at some points and can make you think what s can't fix the simplest problems with the millions and millions of dollars they've recieved selling this game. You'll enjoy playing this especially if you don't take it too seriously but don't expect to be impressed the whole time you're playing this game.lets hope it doesnt die lol,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

But after seeing and reading about PUBG sueing Fortnite again for 'copyrighting'. I just have to give this game a super negative review. It's absolutely ridiculously that they re doing what they re doing. Fortnite got their games under control. I don t have a single hiccup. But after days and days for weeks to months. I still have optimization problems cheating problems and just problems after problems with this game. Don t forget about the stupid loot boxes where you have the buy every keys for every boxes. The customizing is unappealing. It s so dull and just plain out boring. PUBG is like the now of DC and Fortnite s the Marvel. Stop suing other companies when you re NOT original.

Bluehole is just a sketchy company now pretty much the epitome I only want to make money off this game instead of making a genuinely good game. Just look at the map there's ads on most of them in china there's ads in the game even lootboxes before the game is released. Hackers are also a huge issue and nothing has been done there but don't worry they added a new map to the game.

They have seperated the people when spawning and have taken away the guns so the server does not glitch at the very beginning. I think they need to make the running speed a little faster in the ""Desert"" map because it is bigger then the ""Original"" map and harder to survive the blue without a car. The SKS is also kinda weak. One thing that definitely needs change is the AKM. Its so hard to control the spray and the speed of the bullets are no where near the other AR's.

2017-07-31,0,0,143,True,Recommended,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDSThe game is created by an experienced developer in the genre. Contrary to popular belief this game is nothing like its competitor H1Z1. Yes the goal is the same. Parachute down into a dangerous map loot weapons avoid the circle and be the last man alive. However the game provides a very different experience than it's counterpart in many ways. There is a lot more customization of weapon loadouts different vehichle options and slower paced tacitcal gameplay. Some might describe PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS as the more realistic option for gamers interested in battle royale gameplay. I would find this to be an accurate statement as H1Z1 provides a much more arcade like experience. If you're looking for a more optimized version of the Arma3 battle royale mod then just plant your right here and enjoy the ride. Just remember the game is in early accesss and the Devs are constantly hard at work improving and finishing this game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

But you will have to do some tweaking in some form or another to get it running ""properly.""Gun battles feel super precise updates have been coming out weekly which they should considering how many copies this game has sold. But since the early beta I've had fun. Just gotta tweak some things to make it run better first.Out of all of the Battle Royale games this has been my favorite since it has control schemes that make sense and has been (comparatively) more stable than other games of this ilk (pre Fortnite).Also you should try Fortnite's Battle Royale if you're unsure about this. It's free more arcadey more ""user friendly."" If you like that and want more precision come back to this.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-10-16,0,0,19,True,Not Recommended,I would not pay $30 for this game. Maybe $10? There are several main problems. The first being the lag. I typically do not lag on video games while on high settings although there is a decent amount of sputtering going on in this game. SEcondly you are going to spend 20 minutes running around the map for a 20 second fight where you will die. Its very common that you will not even see your killer. Third the recoil on weapons is insane. It should be reduced drastically. Lastly there is no tutorial? how are new players suppose to learn to play when you throw them into guys who have hours and hours of game time. They do not even teach you controls? This was a sad purchase so far to say the least.Yeah this is a terrible purchase...,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-06,0,0,617,True,Recommended,UPDATE After the addition of FPP the pushing of the new map to test servers along with the included performance updates and optimization as a result of the new Engine being used for the upcoming 1.0 release I have changed my review to POSITIVE. Blueballs stepped up big after everyone gave them and rightfully so as the original PUBG was clunky and an unoptimized mess that needed a lot of work to bring out the core gameplay that had a lot of potential and that's what they've done. I congratulate the Dev team of PUBG Corp for this insane amount of work they've done in spite of all the doubt and all the problems they faced going from an indie game company practically to the BIGGEST game on steam by a longshot. WELL DONE.This game seems fun and certainly the gameplay in itself is fun I cannot lie. The premise of finding weapons and items and duking it out in a play area that's constantly shrinking is a great concept and it could definitely work and be a successful game. However due to the nature of the game players are greatly rewarded for camping (which is further enabled by third person camera angles) and greatly punished for being aggressive or taking risks. Whoever sits in one spot and waits the longest wins and it makes for very boring gameplay. I would like to see some changes be made to punish slow playstyle and reward aggressive/risk taking behavior as currently it is WAY too powerful to get a gun of any kind and sit and watch an area with third person camera to get free kills.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Some lag ive noticed latley and have met some undesirable players but im glad to hear that the devs are taking action. Im hearing some awsome features are coming down the line and am excited to check them out on live servers. Seems ALOT of Asians play on NA servers but as long as they are not cheating just more fodder for my ammo. Although the communications on team modes can be frustrating. I would like to see a way to save default server/teammode and maybe more game modes and maps. There is alot of game mechanics to learn but not too complex to pickup new and have fun. Overall i would recomend this game and hope the developers stay relevent to fanbase and inovative enough to bring in new players.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Its not enjoyable when you hope to play with a random team and they're not able to talk to you or vice versa. The U.S. servers are overwhelmed with this type of issue and its quite annoying.

2017-10-20,0,0,124,True,Not Recommended,The game principle and setup is great weapons are quite balanced and it is definately a lot of fun to play.This said at this point I cannot recommend this game at all due to incredible lags. Put aside the fact that textures take forever to load and sometimes you might not be able to enter a house because it was simply not rendered yet there is also the issue of not hitting an enemy you clearly have your crosshair on and should at small distances make a clean hit. Too often this game at it s stage right now disappoints with unaccounted hits and therefore seems quite unfair to the players.As soon as servers are reliable and processing time is minimized it will be a great game to play until now however it is okay at best.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-10-20,0,0,148,True,Recommended,"I dont really write many reviews on Steam but since this game has become very popular with the masses I felt compelled to write a very honest and impartial review.I have played this game for a few weeks now and for the most part I have extrememly enjoyed it. For me it isnt a game that you can play for hours and hours on end as its just far to repetative but I guess thats the whole nature of this game.I havent had any of the issues that other people are tlaking about with regards to being banned after being accuses of ""Stream Sniping"" and I certainly havent seen any players hacking the game to cheat. This is all after playing a total of 37.8 hours up until writing this review. This is my view obviously and this is not me saying that it doesnt happen because it obviously does. Im just saying that it hasnt been a problem for me and I always play on the EU servers for those who may be wondering.For the gameplay itself I would say that the mechanics still need a lot of improvment along with game stability. Over the past week whenever I laucnh the game for the fist time it almost always launches me right into a game where a battle is already talking place either that or it crashed completely and I have to ctrl alt + del to stop the game and restart.Within the game itself sometimes when I land after jumping from the plane the buildings havent correctly loaded and I can freely walk around without opening any doors etc and picl up weapons but again this is usually just the first time I load up the game and play the first round. It usually corrects within a minute or two .One thing very positive I will say about this game is that its amazingly addictive and frustrating at the same only Fifa has ever made me want to smash up my controller haha p The amount of times I have been within the last 10 to survive or even got to 2nd or 3rd place and been killed by a uness sniper is so damn annoying but also fun )The loot boxes that you can buy with experience points are t Ive lost count of how many red jumpers ive gotten or black jeans. I suppose when they start adding more items though that this may improve. Who knows!The negative for me has to be the price... 26.99 for a very unfinished game with relatively poor graphics is a bit of a rip off. But I guess it is what it is. If you arent desperate to play then I would recommend trying another game of the similar type until they bring down the price. It just isnt worth it for the money they are asking and I wish I had waited.Overall I give this game a 6.5/10",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Yes I've ran extended stability benchmarks with AIDA64 Prime95 and Superposition for 2 18 hours at a time and never overheat never crash and never have any problems with pushing hardware to its limits but when I play this game every single time my PC crashes.

2017-10-24,0,0,138,True,Not Recommended,I wanted to like PUBG as I thought the concept of gradually forcing players to move into smaller and smaller areas was interesting. However after spending a fair bit of time playing I ve come to the conclusion that there is not much on offer with this game. The gameplay is shallow and much of how a match turns out is based on luck. The shooting mechanics are strange and no matter what settings I changed I could not get the mouse movements to work in a manner I am comfortable with. The map is boring in design and lacks detail making it feel very empty and sparse. The weapons are arbitrary and don t behave anything like you would expect based on their calibre. The frame rate performance is pretty bad given how basic the game looks it seems to be a common theme with recent Unreal Engine based games. At this stageI simply cannot recommend PUBG to anyone. 3/10.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-05,0,0,248,True,Recommended,I love this game I have been stuck on playing nothing but league of legends for about 2 years now and i havent really had anything that made me want to play anything else other than the occasional game of HoTS. but this has really converted me ill usually play a few rounds get killed in the 20's 30s occasionally 10's then rage quit for an hour and wish i was playing this again.Pros ing intense i havent played a game in a loooong time that actually makes my heart race. You feel like an absolute savage if someone gets the jump on you and you pick up the kill. quick matchmaking you die you immediatly start a new match. Duo/squads is the most fun ive had with friends in a game in a long time. nothing beats coordinatiing with your friends when storming a small group. not sure if its a pro or a con but the gun play is actually difficult there is a real learning curve to simply just shooting.Cons its slow pace at times can be a major turn off for some players this isnt a game where most players can walk in and run n gun. early access so sometimes you get slapped with some nasty bugs (not to big a deal i mean its early access.) many are upset at microtransactions which dont really bother me much so long as its kept to purely cosmetics and not gameplay changing. RNG not sure if this is a pro or con either. On one hand i love the RNG factor because no game is going to be the same.....on the other hand nothing will make you more furious/mad/tilted/ than finding two snipers but not a single scope accept 1 red dot in 12+ houses. did i mention RNG? sometimes you will play everything as well as you could have with the information you have but just by dumbluck someone will stumble on you without you noticing and your round is up. maybe its a problem unique to myself but i have alot of trouble finding scopes which at the end game are borderline necassary (notice i said borderline because ive made it into the top 4 with nothing but a holo scope on a kar98 sniper). If you are ok with a slow paced game that you probably wont win (1v100) that requires thought/planning on every move then this is the game for you).,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-03-24,0,0,731,True,Not Recommended,this game is awesome but after playing 500+ hours i honestly say this game is after all these hackers ruined the game and the servers delay still mega the dev now only wants to make $$ by using the crates to let the players buy it. its been weeks since we had a major update with new stuff and better preformance.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-05-02,0,0,831,True,Recommended,I just wanna start off by saying that back on march I gave this game a thumbs down for outright refusing to work at all on my rig. I don't have a beast of a computer but I still run pretty much everything there is to play well enough only having to tweak options down for a handful of games that are either particularly demanding... or plainly bad optimized. And this game had that issue back then and still does big time. It's without a doubt the single most broken game I've ever played when it comes down to optimization and performance. The way I have to play it with every graphical option turned down to the bare minimum it makes it look very poorly. And still this game is definitely a thumbs up for me. Why's that? Simply put it's one of the most thrilling engaging and intense games I've ever played. The shooting feels amazing. Animations are beautiful. The driving is a good enough blend of realistic(ish) physics and plain fun. Playing solo can be tense AF and playing squad is a blast (when you don't get paired with people who play on a server they can't speak the language of). Sound is also quite impressive this game + headphones is a very immersive experience. To sum it up If you can spare the 20 bucks it's a fantastic addition to your steam library. It comes at only a fraction of the cost of some AAA titles and even on early access it's well worth it.Little side note FFS people need to get it together and review the game fairly. Reviewing a game is not about blackmailing the developer with the threat of a cascade of bad reviews if everything doesn't go exactly as you intend. I don't like many things in this game but it's undeniable that it's great fun. And the fact that some people downvote it when they're well past 100 or 200 hours into it (and still play it) is very telling.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-10-24,0,0,184,True,Not Recommended,The game is a little buggy and a lot buggy some times. With frequent server lag unable to pick up items and items not looking like what they actually are. For example picking up a white shirt on the ground then it turns out to be a black shirt when you put it on. Getting your parachute caught on nothing so I'm just stuck in the air with my finger up my butt. I don't see why the game should be as glitched out as it is. Its the number one played game on steam with a peak of 2 279 084 players according to the steamcharts website on 10/24/2017. It placed at number 5 just below CSGO on Newzoo.com The game is a lot of fun and I enjoy it a lot. But the game developers really need to step it up. PUBG is one of the top played games of all time so I think the developers should want to take care of what they have before a bigger company makes a better faster smoother battle royale game with the same play style and game principles.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

My conclusion is that 75% of the bad reveiws are either A) Angry devs who probably made H1Z1 or some other trash money grab or B) Scrubs who accuse people of cheating because they are trash. I am trash at this game but its definately worth giving a try because it really is a solid game and concept. I also haven't seen one cheater in 35 plus hours of gameplay so im very skeptical now of the negative reveiws. This game will blow up.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-10-24,0,0,117,True,Recommended,"This is a great game. It reminds us slavs of our childhood. But all jokes aside the game is really good. The thing that I am most impressed with is how the developers have been listening to the community. As of me writing this review they're adding vaulting systems and making ""the blue zone"" much deadlier. Which are two of the three main problems I had with this game. Jumping was really loud and clumsy and they are currently working on fixing it. And at one point of the game the only way you could die to a blue zone was by not being able to open the map and wee where it was. Now it is more balanced. The game currently has a great feel to it. If you loose you don't feel so bad and if you win you get the same adreneline rush you would as if you were running from a bear. The game is not too competetive. I don't get frustrated if I have to leave a match but yet it incourages you to do your best. The updates seem to just keep coming and coming. The developers release somewhat balanced guns at a very steady rate. The looting system is very good. It pushes you to get better loot by facing other players off in a city prison or military base. You don't have to go for the more popular drop points but if you do it is very awarding. I also love the map i think the graphics and environment are beautiful.I only have one major problem with this game it's the games optimization. It is horrendous and absolutely a thing that needs to be fixed in the future. I personally dont have a problem running it but anything below 12GB of ram won't get you the 60FPS you need. You also want one hell of a graphics card if you are playing it.The game is a huge blast with friends.I highly suggest this game to anyone that wants to have fun in a tactical shooter with the slight mix of survival.

2017-12-10,0,0,536,True,Not Recommended,Great concept for a game. Even though this game is alpha they are fixing to release full game PC 1.0 it is no where near ready for actual sale. Servers are trash with constant disconnects and massive lag regardless of which server you choose or internet connection. Graphics are okay at best animations are horrible at best the sounds are suppose to be getting updated and hackers run rampant throughout the game on every server and they dont even try to hide the fact that they are hacking. I have had 3 people admit to me that they are hacking and dont care because they will just buy the game again and again. Blue hole says they are fighting the hackers but yet after they patch the servers there are more hackers than ever. easiest way to spot hackers are on the test servers using the kill cam. I doubt that blue hole will ever upgrade their servers so that the game may actually run properly.

I find the perfect spot for cover so that i can heal myself and continue with the troubled yet epic journey of survival I spot a nearby rock for perfect cover then a shoots me and kills me from afar awdhjfaqwjudfaJIKUYDqwf udAWUKDAwfkiu MY LIFE and this game,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Imagine having to PAY to customize your character in any other working shooter CoD Halo Battlefield. Rediculous!

2017-10-15,0,0,248,True,Recommended,No Chinese servers okay I understand the fact that Bluehole has to have a partner in China to get their server installed in China mainland. But none of the players has seen any effort made by Bluehole to improve the poor connection condition at various time spots especially around 10pm this happens every night while nothing done to solve it. Instead Bluehole had an official net proxy app ad on front page for some time?! R u kidding me? Oh I forgot one thing u can hardly stop matching to change the server u r going to play u just cant. Click 100 times and u r still matching only restarting the game will help u do it if u remember to change the default server before u hit the ready button. fk!The game is definitely a good one so many factors to be considered if players wanna be the winner. I am looking forward to see more maps or changing maps or practice mode (singleplayer or with friends). But Bluehole has to do something to fix its servers when they r becoming rich by running this popular game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-05-16,0,0,244,True,Not Recommended,Positive Heart pounding excitement. I have been gaming for about 30 years and have never seen anything like this. In Single player you decide how you want to play...Jump into a city and go crazy and try to go for the kills or jump into a remote area and be stealthy. The choice is yours.Negatives In Duo (2 player team) you have a 50/50 chance of ending up with someone who doesn't have a mic or who speaks your language. And it's really really tough to do good that way In Squad (4 player team) your chances are a little better but you'll still probably end up with 1 out of 4 without a mic. I ended up on a team with 3 Chinese players (I speak ONLY English) only 1 of whom spoke very little English and WE WON !!!! So I guess sometimes you really don't need to understand each other. But my biggest complaint BY FAR is that IMHO there is some if not a LOT of cheating going on. I could give endless examples of why I believe there is cheating but I'll spare you. Supposedly they are beginning to crack down on the cheating so we'll see. Until I am 100% sure there is no cheating I would not recommend this game to anyone.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

But they can't change everything. I had GPU 1060 and chipset i7 6700 but i can't even reach 60fps for the whole game( low setting). And sometime my fps drop to 30 in the battle. The sever is not stable also ( SEA and ASIA ). When i was played around 100 hours. I thought that my connection was not good enough and they setup the sever far from my location. However when i played other sever i knew that my feeling was wrong. IT'S ALL ABOUT ING SEVER. And i should tell you guys that they won't change and build a new sever because it's very expensive. When you realise that everything they tell you is ing You will understand my emotion. And the time that i believe in this game is over,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-06-22,0,0,267,False,Not Recommended,PUBG is dead to me here is why. I remember being so excited about PUBG because they would update their game regularly adding new cool things and consistently making the game better. Those days are long behind it. I thought they were the ones that were gonna listen to their customers and do it differently. Instead they have been working on a pile of steaming crap lawsuit against Fortnite rather then working on their bug filled patch lacking game. Fortnite has updates every week adding new items game modes guns changes to the map that make it evolve. What happened to you PUBG. It honestly started when they added the loot crates before the game even released like they said they would NOT do. Then they released their game and nothing has really happened since. Its horrific watching my once loved game die right in front of me. Get your crap together Blue Balls you are literally going in the disastrous road DayZ went down did you just make this game for a quick payout like Dean Hall did? Sure looks like it cause now on top of the $30 game and $2.50 keys you can buy they are adding a event pass that you will have to pay for too. Fortnite does this but its not as much a slap in the face because the game is FREE TO PLAY! Seriously I am about done with this game.Im going to list just a few things they need to start doing to get this game back in the right direction again.Region lock china (That will fix most hacking issues)STOP MAKING MAPS AND FIX YOUR GAMEFix the item pickup system its laggy and complete crap.Fix connectivity issuesFix vehicle issuesAdd new itemsDrop the beyond stupid lawsuit and actually COMPETE with FortniteFix the performance issuesListen to you player baseMore communication with your player baseFix menu lag (Menu lag after 6 months of being released REALLY?)Better reward system/Better reward items,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Reminds me of how League of Legends and Dota started as a Starcraft and Warcraft 3 mod.&gt However the unreal engine was only designed for a max of 60 players so that 100 player push really does push your computer no matter what settings you play with since learning that i kept everything maxed out and realized that it played the same when I downscaled everything. So fixing that 100 man issue should be 1st priority in development before moving onto story and zombie modes. None the less i can't wait until the game itself is refined and optimized and available on Xbox so i can play with more of my friends because most of my friends including myself are console gamers.Love M2AF Gaming!

2018-01-06,0,0,325,False,Not Recommended,tThe game is great but....... ing hackers are everywhere and the lag is real. the game started out really well with just a few hackers here and there. over the past couple months hackers have become more and more frequent. i used to play this game for hours nonstop but now i play 1 game and within the first half of the match im getting shot at or killed by hackers. the people hacking are blatantly doing it too. as if they dont care if they get caught or they're just dumb and think they wont get reported and caught. the anti cheat for this game obviously isnt doing the job. most of the hackers i see are asian too when i play on US servers which is my next complaint. the servers need to be region locked or ping locked. there is nothing more frustrating than joing a US server and hearing nothing but chinese in voice chat. its also frustrating trying to play squads and picking up a random player just to find out.......they dont speak any english. as much as i dont want region locked servers because i have friends in the EU that i like to play with i believe it needs to be done. if they dont region lock servers they need to implement ping locks. for example there are some online games that the server will auto kick you if youre ping is too high to reduce the lag. bewteen this games dsync and players running around with 200+ ping over in china it makes it very miserable to play. you can say im wrong but the ratings and reviews for this game speak for itself. the reviews went from positive to mixed in a few months. i really do enjoy playing this game and im affraid if the company doesnt make a decision fast then this game will die off and become just another abandoned game on steam.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-10-26,0,0,84,True,Recommended,Going into PUBG I was hesitant. It was like no game I had played before sure it was a shooter but it has this sort of raw thrill that makes this game stand out from the rest. The game puts you on a remote island with 99 other online players in a large open world free for all style of combat that re defines 'last one standing'. As you watch the counter of players left slowly fall off as you remain the stakes grow higher as you inch your way to being the last alive. Much like Richard Connells book 'The Most Dangerous Game' players 'hunt' each other down until only the best 'hunter' survives giving the winner a satifising rush of adrenilne and pure energy as the last player falls at your feet. Although there is a lot of positives to talk about when reviewing PUBG its good to remind yourself that this is in early development there are some kinks glitches and bugs that you will find in every game at this stage. But putting that aside Bluehole developers have given us with a new genre of fast paced thrilling entertainment that is easy to drop into time and time again. 8/10.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I saw the ridiculous amounts of negative reviews recently and felt compelled to post a short review.I wouldn't complain if the servers ran a bit better (at least early on in the games) and if I never saw a hacker again. I've seen two legit hackers with aimbot/speed/kill through walls and I might have grouped with one hacker the other day (I should have clipped him earlier but it's hard not to identify someone as a hacker with 55 k/d ratio). WIth over 200 hours played I can't complain too much about the hackers.That being said I'm having a blast.

Users in China even cannot get connected to the servers unless pay additional fees to solve this problem all by themselves. So far the user number of PUGB has increased enormously in particular in China. I just wonder what has been done with this amount of money we have paid. Do not the developer team feel ashamed of themslves in regard of this incapability? Not recommended and deprecated.游戏本身还不错的 但是多人在线游戏服务器卡顿对游戏体验的影响是决定性的 在这方面 绝地求生是完全失败的 我们中国玩家连服务器都连不上 除非我们自己额外花钱解决问题 到现在这个游戏玩家增加了这么多 尤其是在中国 我就很好奇 我们付的这么多钱都拿去干啥了 游戏团队这么无能难道不会感到羞愧么 不推荐 差评,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-10-27,0,0,18,True,Recommended,"Okay this game gets a lot of flak probably because it's so immeasurably popular right now. I watched an inordinate amount of gameplay before buying this game and I still feel like it was a good purchase.If I get banned for stream sniping (which is apparently a thing) even though I don't will I be angry? Sure.Will I go and flame Bluehole for making that design choice? No.That's because when you peel away the hype and you peel away the ""It's early access therefore X"" or ""Everybody loves it and they just seem to ignore Y"" comments and just look at it as a game...It's almost bafflingly fun. In my first few matches I was shaking like a leaf and I had to stop because I felt like I was gonna get a heart attack I was so tense. Sure I'm not the kind of person who plays PVP games like this so maybe that's not surprising but it's a point in the ""engaging"" column for sure.Is it annoying how I've yet to win a game? Yeah. Does it suck to get sniped out of nowhere or get the bejesus scared out of me by a ""clever"" player? Sure does.Am I gonna rip on the game for that? No. Because it's fun. It's even tense and exciting when you're dead and you're watching your teammate trundle along to their all too probable doom.Because I don't care about the microtransactions. I don't care about the crazy odds for winning.I had fun. A lot of fun and my friends enjoy it too.It's a game and I enjoy the time I spend playing it. That's good enough for me.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

If they get better anti cheat and get everyone in line with what server they need to be on i think the game would be 9 out of 10.

On top of that blue won't region lock the game even though it would improve everyones experience purely because the Chinese players account for 30% of their revenue and its all about the money for these idiots. The creator was wanking on about a movie based on the game that would be funny to see the main charactor of the movie would probably spend 10 seconds trying to pick up a gun then he would get shot in the head from 500m away by a Chinese hacker.

2017-03-31,0,0,561,False,Not Recommended,Brilliant game and an amazing concept executed correctly. The game is crazy addictive and provides super intense moments that you are rare to find anywhere else. In comparison to other similar games (H1z1 King of the kill) it destroys it completly and does it right. The combat is far superior with gunplay feeling much more satisfying and realistic and gameplay on the whole is very satisfying balanced and enjoyable. Consdering this is newly released in early access it is off to a very good start and is easily the best battle royale style game out there.UPDATE scratch all what i said before this game is just a messy cash grab that is poorly optimised and constantly making bad decisions. i do not think the devlopers deserve support for this game and have neglected the opprutinty to have an amazing game. too many issues with the game that dont get fixed or take far too long to fix such as massive server issues poor netcode cheaters etc yet lootboxes galore and paid season passes keep coming.well done pubg corp messed up such an easy game,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Have no problem with the people just want to have the option not be teamed with them and not so oftenB) Not to anyone s surprise TOO MANY HACKERS,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2018-02-04,0,0,143,False,Recommended,Fantastic game involves a lot of strategy and skill to be successful. Contains two very large 8km X 8km maps which are full of diverse locations to loot. Lots of fun to play with friends but also fun to play by yourself. A very hardware demanding game but also beautiful on higher settings. Still a fair amount of cheaters but unlike Valve Bluehole is actually doing something about it and they are working on fixing that problem.

2017-07-12,0,0,429,True,Not Recommended,EDIT They need to fix their ing game. The optimization is absolute garbage which causes it to run like on some rigs while not all exactly. I have a above average rig yet get many problems with network lag etc. However Its Early Access so such is life. I set my rating to Not Recommended only as a warning to those that should know that it may not run well on your setup. Be wary as it takes a huge amount of the fun away from the game when it really doesn't want to work. I can have a streak of amazing no lag games and have it drop to immediate horsewallop in an instant. Second EDIT Turns out you cannot play this game with only 8gb of ram. Who knew. Still can't recommend it but get it if your friends get it because the more the merrier to be frank.Issa great ing game with a great concept behind it that can really make a Friday night with some of your boi's and some greasy cold ones to crack open. Gunplay is neat the map is rad (they probably will make more?) and the power of Russian Industry could never be more powerful (all hail the Iron Pan Gods).One thing I could completely say that is negative is that this game is poor in optimization. What could work flawlessly with no lag spikes etc on one rig could run like absolute monkey on the same exact rig that you might own. It is a fickle beast and you never know what could be ing causing it until you are like me and decide to run the numbers from the top in solutions for stable FPS (which I finally achieved after a week of trial and error). HOWEVER the devs have stated and commited to weekly updates that could very well fix the gross optimization issues while they add content monthly.Overall I'd recommend this game with your friends if you got a better than average PC. I have a 950 for example but a CPU so I have spotty results vs a compatriot with a 970 and a better CPU who has no lag at all with his rig.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

So if you are hit a few times without getting any health deductions you can make it to cover only to see you health bar go down suddenly and die.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

NOPE.I get into a game only to notice that my fps counter went from the 70 90 fps that I always got on high settings to 10 25 fps LOW SETTINGS I thought ok thats not normal but they might fix it (remember this) drop down and I see nothing but house mesh and I couldn't enter any house after like 30 seconds of wondering what the actual hell is going on they render in I go in and get loot and 10 minutes of wondering im near the ruins and I see someone sneek my way up there shoot him pretty much 10 times and he kills me turns out only 1 SHOT REGISTERED OF THAT 10 that hit him I get my bp and go to the store and to be fair I got a RARE unlocked crate and got a crappy skin but what ya gonna do right its RNG.(im just gonna skip the bulls*** crate system they have because you guys have heard that so many times and its pretty much set in stone what everyone thinks of it including me)Play a few more games see if my eyes dident deceive then I realize somthing this update made the game run like a pile of dog s*** the fact that my game went from 70 90 fps pre release to 10 25 fps post 1.0 is nothing short of BULLS*** and you know what they STILL have not fixed this crap at all (they made 700 million off this game and never bothered to fix something that NEEDS to be fixed).Now lets talk about the hackers Honestly bluehole JUST EN REGON LOCK CHINA ALREADY.YES I know there are alot of players from china and alot are not hackers but if you take a close look 99% of PUBG hackers are. from. CHINA!!!!!!..........And they have come back stronger than ever because bluehole is more obsessed with sueing Epic Games and making more loot crates instead of fixing there own problems.Now after 7 months after 1.0 update and no sign of this game getting better and STILL having HORRIBLE preformance lag issues bad hit detection D Sync and MANY hackers I can say this game had sealed its fate and is gone down the deepest hole any game had ever gone down and I give this game another year at best before it dies a very gruesome death I have lost faith in it.I wish the devs would fix the game but... at this point I dont think soSo its with the bottem of my heart that I say...I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS GAME!!!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-03,0,0,604,True,Not Recommended,Great game it has its problems of course two of the biggest for me are it seems like many of the rules/laws of the game are ...sometiming (sometimes you cant shoot between staircase railing and windows with bars (but sometimes you can) ALOT of things like that. but w/e the game is still fun. THE BIGGEST PROBLEM are the chinese players that dont stay on their own servers and the english speaking players that either dont use mics or join squad games (4 player team) with 2 3 friends and use discord leaving you without communication in a game where communication is KEY. So unless you have dedicated 3 other players to play this game with your stuck 90% of the time with chinese players who sometimes speak broken english on an english server or 10% of the time with players using discord so they dont bother communicating with you. Sure they do have 2 other modes you can play (every man for himself or groups which is just squads of 2 instead of 4) but in my opinion the games BEST and most enjoyable part is you and your squad(4 player teams) (or whats left of it)communicating and sharing items and calling out targets/threats and kills as the match winds down and the last few squads or people to kill are only a few steps away hiding at every corner struggling to survive. Ive unfortunately now have stoped playing this until they ban players to play on their own servers which is most likely never lol. Of course like most other pc game the hacking/cheating is there but i dont find it to be bad enough to where its game breaking like ahem GTA5 online. Bottom line if you got people to play with GET IT if your playing by yourself joining random squads DONT GET IT.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-03,0,0,480,True,Recommended,Battle Royal that has guns with attachments ranging from scopes magazines stocks for a M416/Tommy Gun three different muzzles and grips. They spawn all over the place along with the guns and if you find the right combo for your play style you might just take home that chicken dinner at the end of the match! I enjoy this game mostly with friends so playing duos or squads makes it a lot of fun if we all are able to communicate together! The in game mics aren't terrible and they have directional functionality but you can make it so only your team hears you if you don't want others to be listening in on your conversations. THOUGH I use 3rd party V.O.I.P. (Voice Over I.P.) and makes it so we can just mute the game com's completely. That way we can all just have a blast. Few things are a tad touchy but what do you expect from an early access game? They are updating almost weekly so you know they are on top of their game of trying to make sure everything is running smoothly. P.U.B.G. is even coming out with a new map soon!

IF YOU ARE ACCTUALLY IN ZONE. But beware because most of the time if you land in the same area as a few or even one other guy they will get a scar right off the bat whilst you have a crowbar or revolver. This game is also packed with a whopping 1 map and about 20 guns and the odd update every 4 months which gets pushed back on the day it comes out.

2017-07-30,0,0,559,True,Recommended,Great game to play alone and even more fun with friends. Solo is filled with suspense while squads and duos is a great time to just mess around or play seriously. Tons of different play styles right from the start. New updates constantly about one every month makes sure its always getting better. Will be out of early access in a couple of months confirmed. Overall definitely worth the $30 for the amount of enjoyment I got out of it.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Tons of fun and probably best battle royale out there (I've played culling h1z1 KotK ARK survival of the fittest) and I'll keep coming to this one. There are a few bugs I had but the constant updates are really working to fix them unlike some other games. Playing solos is boring to me however I enjoy playing squads and duos. It requires a lot of team work. If you have friends it is worth more than a $29.99 price.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-09-11,0,0,940,True,Recommended,I've been a gamer most of my life. I've played everything from pong to Pacman to Player Unknown Battlegrounds. I will tell you that this game is perhaps the best fps game I've ever played. I've played a fair number of fps games since Escape from Castle Wolfenstein and I've put more time in this one in a month than I've put into many others. This game has singlehandedly made me stop playing my other fps games like Fallout and Battlefield. While there are some ssues with the game it is constantly improving. My only complaint is that the game does crash often especially when exiting or loading a map. I would say that these crashes and freezes seem to occur more frequently since I started playing a couple of months ago. The in game playing is pretty good and I rarely have issues with the exception of some lag from time to time. Overall I'd recommend this game highly but would say to temper expectations of crashes since it is not a final copy.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-01-22,0,0,177,False,Not Recommended,PUBG is one of the few games that I supported during early access and returned to after its full release. There are many reasons to enjoy the game but something that has completed enraged me is the lack of response coming from community of gamers that participated in the creation of this game regarding hackers. I don't care about blue wall adjustments weapon updates or new maps. I want to be able to enjoy playing a game using the mechanics intened for the players. Due to the lack of response from the game developers coupled with the overall success of PUBG I can't help but wonder if the devs actually care about the community they originally designed for or if they are only in it to make money from hackers that get banned and rebuy the game. Until this issue is properly addressed I do not recommend this game. I'll just got back to playing Getting Over It instead.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-29,0,0,65,False,Recommended,I think the game is ok at its current stage. I did not have any lag (related to the internet) nor did I experience any fps drop (but this is due to my good gpu D). Indeed the game can be improved on the system requirements part on some aspects. The game is fun and so far I did not meet any cheaters or hackers to ruin my game (played around 8 9 matches). If you enjoyed ARMA2 like games in the past and want to play something similar and with a bit of Hunger Games ideea you should try this out. A match in this game lasts around 30 minutes (this can vary depending on how you play). It can become anyoing at times if you are not carefull with your surroundings but every match is different from the other and that makes the game enjoyable. Also you always are on the run due to the fact that the playzone map shrinks every 2 4 minutes and you have to get on your way. I will update my review if anything pops up.UPDATE So far so good still not complaining about the game at around 60h of gameplay.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I love third person shooters. I love picking different places to land. I love the scavenging and basic weapon customization. I love the teamwork and I love the shenanigians that ensue. Even some of the bad things about the game are just funny. The gun play is very good for the most part. There are problems with the game but for early access I'd say it is ahead of the curve. I will warn the sweaty try hards to either steer clear or try to chill out. You will die a lot. You will often die to some sniper on a hill or roof. You will die because you didn't find a gun right away and another player did. Here's the thing though it doesn't matter. you just requeue nearly instantly and start over. You lose absolutely nothing. Winning gets you a bit more in game credits that you can spend on that doesn't matter like hats. Just chill out and embrace whatever the game hands you.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-01-23,0,0,145,False,Recommended,"It's hard to overstate what a magnificent exploration and adventure game Subnautica is.What really stands out to me is that experience not an XP bar but the accumulation of knowledge about the game world its locations and its inhabitants is the most powerful weapon in a player's arsenal.Take Stalkers for example They're the first large predators a player will meet and initially they're annoying and seem quite threatening. An experienced player will ignore them though or at most circle and poke them with a knife to make them go away while at the same time stealing all of their scrap. It helps to have upgraded swim fins upgraded O2 and other advantages but if you took upgraded fins and O2 tanks away from experienced players they still wouldn't have any issues with Stalkers.There's a lot to find and a lot to do in this game. The need to unravel the game's central mysteries and to obtain blueprint fragments salvage and rare materials from wrecks grottoes and strange installations will force you to leave your comfort zone time and again. First you'll crawl out of the Safe Shallows then you'll creep further and deeper then you'll swim further still until one day you'll be amazed at how far away from Lifepod 5 you've gone at the readout on your depth meter and you'll wonder how you ever thought that the seaweed areas just outside of the Safe Shallows were in any way scary.Sustenance is a challenge at first and you'll scramble to get enough food and water but later on they become a matter of management and planning ahead. If you're going on a long expedition you'll want enough supplies to last for the duration but not so many that you can't haul a goodly amount of salvage back to base.As for fiddly stuff you can spend hours building and customizing your underwater habitat customize the look and module loadout of the various vehicles you can build (once you've got the complete blueprints and necessary materials) and have a lot of fun with the wide array of gadgets and Portal/Half Life style ""techno guns"" the game has to offer. There's a lot of meat there but the true meal lies in exploration.Even at the very end of the game though armed with all the technology you've spent hours pulling out of wrecks and scanning (typically while watching your O2 meter like a hawk and listening nervously to that angry predator thrashing around outside) you'll never feel completely safe or at ease. There are great dangers lying in wait and you'd better hope you spot them on your sonar before their sonar catches wind of you....",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-01-23,0,0,338,False,Recommended,honestly a really fun game but there are a couple of tweaks that need to be changed in order for it to become my main game...1. let us pick which map they said they will impliment this in a future patch but they should have done it as soon as there was more than 1 map2. let us host our own private servers. every other game lets us host out own servers to practice without becoming a partner not really sure why we cant on this game3. there are bugs where deathcam doesnt work right i think they are working on this now.4. 4x scopes are really weird to get used to especially for the ak and dp 285. car physics on the new map are really annoying. the old physics would have been much worse but it seems like every car you get into is going to tumble down evey hill dealing insane damage to both you and your car that is unavoidable. I found that the 2 person bike is insanely good on the new map because you control how the bike rotates. making this bike more common on the new map would be a really good improvement.6. boosting in some cars makes it sound like somebody is in another car chasing you7. visibility is most cars is rediculus when trying to locate air drops you need to stop the car and get out just to get your bearings8. i think they should release the specific gun stats but i guess this one isnt as important as the other oneshaving that been said there is a lot of really good things that the devs do well that you do not oftern see in other games 1. anti cheat this is huge for me and is one of the main reasons i still play this game. the devs have absolutly no tolerance for cheating. seeing them keep us updated on their anti cheat process makes me know they care about the integrity of the game. i used to play counter strike where they barely even mention their anti cheat system so this is a giant upgrade2. the server size of 100 is perfect. i tried playing h1z1 before this game came into beta and to have 150 people in a server was way too much for me to handle3. they are constantly improving the game doesnt really get stale. at least for me,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-03-19,0,0,141,False,Not Recommended,Bugs and issues with optimization are so common and expected that no one bothers to bring is up except in the form of a joke. Even though things are so bad the developers keep finding ways to make it worse and with recent attempts at anti cheat they did exactly that. A program I commonly use for the work I do from home is now prohibited by the anti cheat. VMWare Workstation creates virtual computers/machines which can be used for a number of things like setting up a web server to test your code on trying out a new operating system running an old operating system so you can use an old program that does not work well on new systems or to keep software isolated from your network and host operating system.This software is very common among IT professionals and many other programs do the same thing but from what I can tell only VMware is prohibited. Cheaters that are using vmware virtual machines to cheat could just as easily use other virtualization software like the one built into Windows 10 Pro or they could literally just use a 2nd computer!These developers are not making any real effort to fix cheating if they think this is a solution.The game does offer something unique and I'll keep playing it with friends when they want to but the quality of the game is not what I'm here for and you shouldn't have any expectations in that regard.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-03-14,0,0,582,False,Recommended,"The game PUBG is a very fun game at times. IN my near 500 hours of experience I've had many great moments with my friends and overall it isn't the worst game ever (better than fortnite). That being said it's a mess. I have died numerous times to the new ""vaulting"" added to the game. Typically I would vault over a small fence or sandbags only to fall through the ground. Speaking of falling I have also lost due to teleporting down a somewhat steep mountain and dying with no teamates near to revive me. More often then not it is very steep and is my fault but 30% of the time I am thrown down the mountain to my death. Another huge fault is hackers. I will admit to previously making false cheatong claims in many games such as Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege and other such games but this game has a genuine problem. In my last game I was head locked 3 times and my friend calmed me down seeing my death in his death cam. However my friend said and I quote ""Wait what the hell"" as I was traced by a red dot sight down a wall him being unable to see me due to the thickness of the dot. My final issue is the new map or if you're reading this later Miramar. This map is a huge wasteland of terribly designed copy paste buildings that are so repetitive that after at least 100 hours I can't name even half of the cities. If you're being shot he could either be in the mountains in front of you the mountains behind you the mountains on your left or the 19 story 72 windowed apartment complex and you'll have no idea due to the immense size and absurd blending of people and objects. Also the revolvers are sh*t but that doesn't matter.

2018-01-23,0,0,1267,False,Not Recommended,The good Shooting mechanic feel pretty good. Its a great 100 player survival deathmatch but an even better duo or squad team based tactical shooter. There is many ways to play and enjoy it. The bad Despite all the success improvements to the game have been very underwhelming and I suspect the team behind it is either very small or of questionable skill. Not only that but they are very greedy and have diverted alot of ressources to micro transaction console versions and planned mobile versions and that before the game was even out of early access. Also every second game is filled with laggers and cheaters. The NA servers are filled with high ping thirdworlders who don't speak a lick of english so you better have friends online or be ready to play nothing but solo.At this pont im just waiting for real developpers to come around and create a better battle royale so that I can jump ship.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Such things should have priority when it comes to fixing issues (instead of microtransactions (only cosmetic though but still microtransactions) Clunky interactions with objects (for example doors) Randomness (might actually be a + if you like that aspect) things are completely random when it comes to loot i was playing a couple of games searched 3 locations (houses) where at least 1 little ranged weapon should be present but no i only found ammo armor and melee weapons.I imagine that this game can be a lot of fun when you play with friends (not that much if you play solo) but currently i think there are better options on the market which can even be played for free.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-10-17,0,0,1052,True,Not Recommended,So basically since this game is still in early access dont get too much hope. I know from my play hours it says differently.About The Game The only thing that keeping me from playing this game is the gameplay. Its so much fun and the game reward when you win a game is so satisfying.The main lack of this game is basically comes from the developer sight of what is really matters. The game is so un optimized for its popularity and i see so little improvement in it by the developer. I mean for all these months we only see slightest improvement on optimization in their devblog yet they still had the time to organized a lan tournament for how dumb it is.Them telling us to upgrade our system to play this game basically mean they dont knowledge their mistake. If only they'd use the money from the income to mainly focus improvement it will do a great to its community.If you want to play a fun battle royal game and had the best rig i still recommend it. But if you only had mediocre one i wont recommend it for now since its unplayable from the game optimization side and server side things,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-03-12,0,0,359,False,Not Recommended,I am a Chinese player PUBG is a good game but I think it is a pity that it was developed by Blue Hole. I know that Chinese players are not popular in this game but I also hope that friends all over the world know that most Chinese players want to play games with foreign friends. Because the plug in rampant friends around me also started to use plug in which made me very sad I have heard that the plug in code used by Chinese players was stolen from foreign forums and sold to Chinese players after packaging. As a Chinese player I was ashamed and helpless for this kind of behavior by some Chinese players. Lock China is so popular abroad. As a Chinese player I believe it is understandable. Because the behavior of some Chinese players turns all Chinese players into people who can be discriminated against Tencent has represented this game in China. I only hope that Tencent can do anti plugging measures. I really like PUBG this game can get better and better But I don't want it to be run by a company like Blue Hole. Of course I know it's impossibleso YOU!Blue Hole,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-11-25,0,0,276,False,Recommended,This game is one of my favorite games of all time. Some people hate on it just because of Fortnite or they actually have a reason to hate it. I love the fact that they have 2 maps to choose from (3rd one coming sone hopefully) And they also have a nice character customization. I dont want to have to bring Fortnite into this review but when talking about customization Fortnite is lacking alot of this. I like how you dont have to waste real money on currency in game just to by an outfit. In this game you can play get BP (battle points) And get crates. This game does have something that you can buy though with real money which is a key which works on 2 special crates. The gameplay needs a little bit more optimization but other than that it is perfect. I think it was a good idea to remove guns from spawn island (dont hate on me for saying this) because it now doesnt lag at all for me in spawn. Random spawn locations is another good part because it might give you an idea of where you want to go. This also helps with optimization. Now getting on to gameplay I like how certain guns have certain modes (single burst full auto) and the fact that you can find ammo without the gun just stitting there. I think one thing they need to fix is how you will sometimes randomly take damage after parachuting. Its not too big of a concern but a little bit more of health would be nice. It also concerns me that you will be reloading your gun and you do something minor and it cancels the reloading process. I support the fact that it does not tell you the certain flight path of the plane so you can make choises very quickly. Overall I think this is an amazing game and even though I rage sometimes I still get sucked back into it. 9.1/10,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-10-17,0,0,2456,True,Not Recommended,I have around 1300 Hours of game play now. I really enjoied the realistic feel to the game coupled with the type of game. That being said I feel like Blue Hole is more worried about looks of the game and not the feel. Example The latest update had blue hole fixing a graphics issue at the start of the game where if a player is on fire the fire trails behind the plane as it gets reay to drop players for battle.........Meanwhile they push back the new season Leaderboards are still down and the actual gameplay itself has never felt more off. I really hope that Blue Hole rethinks their plan of operation moving forward. That way when I decided to jump back on (sometime after the 20th as thats when the new season starts) maybe I will be able to enjoy the game once again.Good luck Blue Hole and if you are a potential buyer of this game...

2018-02-25,0,0,206,False,Not Recommended,"UPDATE I am still holding strong on my belief that Bluehole should implement Region Locks. Lets expand on why they have not done this for a moment....Bluehole is a business and their main focus is making money. With that said the RAMPANT problem with cheaters in this game has been showcased and advertised as a problem by Bluehole and the company has mentioned fighting cheaters almost weekly. Yet after banning almost 3 MILLION players in the last few months sales are still flooding in at 2.4 MILLION since the last wave of bans. The ""Ban Repurchase"" scheme is Bluehole's main source of revenue. Again with that said cheating still remains a HUGE issue on PC but the same problem is non existent on the XBOX One version of the game. Why is this?The XBOX One uses a closed source OS therefore has no cheaters and MOST IMPORTANTLY does not have a public market to sell cosmetic items earned in game. This market that exists on Steam is the number one reward for cheaters and a second source of revenue for Bluehole and Steam alike. Truth can be found in the simple fact that the PC version although it is in a ""final release"" state receives an enormous amount of attention/updates/hotfixes/advertisement from the Company while the XBOX version is in a ""pre release alpha"" stage and receives almost zero attention/updates/hotfixes/advertisement from the Company. This simple fact can be explained. The XBOX version has no cheaters therefore the main source of revenue is non existent and XBOX has no market to sell/purchase in game items. Not having these two main sources of revenue on the XBOX One version means the Company's resources do not focus on this version which is clearly seen.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds takes this sentiment of natural improvement and deconstructs in a way that seems almost intentional. In the world of game development I believe there exists a naive assumption that (more $ faster improvement) and although that can be the case to a certain degree often the foundation of a game may be too rocky to fix quickly. For PUBG the highest selling game on Steam money must actually be the fuel for the Twilight Zone fire that exists at their development studio. There is no other explanation. ""How harsh you are you must be a salty consumer!"" I can hear being thought as you've made it this far into this review ""What is the point you're trying to make give me specifics.""Well let us go down the laundry list of things that BlueHole (not blue balls never utter those words) has accomplished.Since the game has been available Develop a great and interesting take on the Battle Royal Genre and become an insane best seller Add cosmetics to the game locked behind loot crates to increase revenue (reasonable if Version 1.0 was a complete game in my opinion) Refuse to region lock due to fear of ""xenophobia"" Attempt 'E sports' while changing core aspects of the game to induce better competitive play while not doing the same for the live game (removing the Red Zone from competitive that everyone loves) Mess with the gunplay net code optimization (good thing clothing is still everywhere on the map) to such a degree that I'm starting to believe that Ray Charles came back from the grave and got a degree in Game Development Rush a game to 1.0 although it is not even close to being finished Start to hemorrhage users to a free cartoon game which made a Battle Royal mode as an aside (and is actually quite fun) Push an untested update to both live and test servers that is horribly laggy for some users and makes the game literally un launchable for others (myself included) Ignore people on Reddit and Twitter voicing their concerns over not being able to play a game they paid money for and is in full release '1.0' Refuse to roll back the update because of this fantastic 'Anti Cheat' they've implemented and instead blame user's hardware and software for these issues. Honestly BlueBa...Bluehole this Anti Cheat better undo Dr. Disrespects infidelity and bring Jesus back from the grave because the level of ineptitude and brashness from a studio flush with that much cash is ing embarrassing. At this rate I expect version 2.0 to be 4fps still filled with cheaters and resemble Goldeneye 64 in terms of control and graphics (no disrespect to a great game from 20 years ago)Would I recommend? When it works absolutely.Do I trust Bluehole to stop collectively doing whippets and making the game worse with every update?

The game force closes. Sure it studdered before but at least i got to play FULL games and not get shut down either in the middle of a fight or while finding good LOOT. It never did this before and makes me want to punch the en screen with frustration. I've never had a PC game that ever forced closed like this EVER. maybe once or twice trying max settings with DOOM3 back in 2004. But never like this never every en game.

I just wish you'd come back home and work with American developers and publishers because them Korean Bluehole(s) are running your game to The game functions to the point where i cant even say its playable anymore. it literally shuts down every game. This is and was a product that should not have ever been brought out of beta. I can't play until the next patch and by then i can only hope that the bug is identified but we all know one fix may possibly break another. The previous batch of players who complained and ed before are probably enjoying a great and fun optimised game for them. I'm part of the new batch of people who can no longer play and the viscious cycle contines.

2018-01-24,0,0,228,False,Recommended,"Ah PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds. What an exciting interesting and fun game. I have clocked in almost 186 hours into this game I've had it since it was a wee little game. Now if the topic of PUBG comes up I always say ""Ya know it's a good game not a working game but a good one."" No doubt in my mind that this game is fun and almost every round my friends and I get a good fight or have an amazing laugh. With the graphics wise I've always had to keep my graphics very low (I don't know my specs all I know it's an old all in one Asus desktop) the window shrunk down and screen scale down as well. Throughout my 186 hours of playing although the developers have made great strides and a few times have almost set themselves up for failure. For low budget crappy gamers like myself the optimization for our games has from what I've found is amazing. I went from having my window of the game no smaller than my phone with everything low to pull 15 20 FPS to having it about the size of a tablet low graphics decent screen scale and around 25 30 FPS. To put that in perspective I used to not be able to fire the micro uzi in full auto otherwise I'd drop to 2 FPS now I can fire it without any drop in FPS. For me that is amazing. The introduction of new weapons was amazing and by god do I remember the thrill of vaulting over a stone wall for the first time. It changed the dynamic of fighting so vastly I remember just jumping over a wall and killing 2 people who were after me. These things are what makes me want to recommend this game. Sadly there are other issues that if weren't there would make the price so worth it. The glitches and bugs first of all can ruin a whole game due to them. Glitching a motorcycle into a fence thus blowing up only 40 meters from a nearby crate with an M249 (which I highly recommend getting cause its just &lt 3 ). The introduction of the new map was good and bad. My friends and I we were excitied for this new map because it was different and promised new this and that and oh new guns and look at this sand ooooOooOo. What we got was either going to the middle of the desert not having a gun or having a crappy one with no sight for 200 meters then getting shot by someone who looted in that Hacienda not far from you. Seriously the lack of loot in the desert map makes it barely playable it forces you to fight over the P92 which for some people that's the best part and probably what was intended but it just isn't fun sometimes. Now the most frustrating irriating almost making me racially profile people issue are the Chinese hackers and players. They are swarming our servers making it impossible to say ""Hey pal"" without someone saying something back at you in Chinese..probably telling us ""hah we hack your server get rekt"". Yes I know the anti cheat is doing its best but there's gotta be something someone can do to stop this overpopulation of Chinese hackers and hackers in general. I've seen people teleporting away having no recoil aimbot shooting a M249 through mountains to kill the last 10 people alive god mode grenade resistance speed the list could go on and I bet you that the list could go on from other stories of hackers. It's just these things that screw up gameplay ruin the whole expirence which is why that if I had to recommend this game I believe I would but obviously with the warning THIS GAME IS FULL OF HACKERS BUGS GLITCHES UNFAIR LOOT AT TIMES ETC.

Many hackers will try to cheat and some players will try to team up in solo queue. PUBG Corp. does NOT deal with these people properly and innocent people (including you) will have to endure the damages. Optimization and server problems also prevent you from enjoying the game. If your PC is not good enough it will occasionally cause lag and bugs. Since lag is fatal to playing this game it may not be possible to play smoothly if there is any server delay.

2017-04-20,0,0,772,False,Not Recommended,Playerunknown's Battleground has a lot of interesting features that makes the game very immersive. For starters if you joke about kicking someone in the mouth IRL while playing this game you might get banned. This features let's you really feel like you're a part of the game and is a whole new take on modern gaming.Vehicles is very realistic. For example if you're driving on a dirt road and hit a small pebble you have a 50/50% chance to go from 60mph to a dead stop or just randomly take damage. As looting and parachuting as of now is all skill based and no RNG is involved what so ever I feel this was a nescessary step for the developers to take just so the skill roof can be lowered a little bit.BrownHole has also been very good at balancing the game. A few patches ago there was a huuuge improvement to the very overpowered performance imbalance. Many players with good computers suddenly experienced a huge FPS boost which I guess BrownHole thought was not fair for players with not so good computers so they implemented a few new memory leaks to the maps so you could not get a stable 60fps+ so it's fair for those who is rendering the game at ultra LOW settings.All in all this game feels very smooth if you generally don't mind a game that goes from 120fps out in the field to 30fps when you are about to engage a cowering foe in the city.This game does NOT feel like it's still an Early Access title and I'm thinking the developers did a good job finishing the game before they released it.Would recommend to friends? Yes. (Not really I'd rather eat my own off).,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-20,0,0,382,True,Recommended,What can I say about this game? You can love it and then hate in a matter of minutes. Love how each kill can be very satisfying especially if you're one to fight at school and come out victorious. The other when you barely land down manage to get at least a hand gun and boom someone in full gear takes you out exaggerating but you get the point. There are a lot of things I would like to change in game like the drop rate on scopes if you're a player that likes to take it slow and stealthy in the game you sghould have that option. Instead players that are more aggressive that land at School or Military base always come out with high tier gear. I understand the reason but I go into a game with no scopes to be found even in big cities and get knocked out. This game is both based on skill and major RNG in the early game. I would still recommend this game to anyone that would like to purchase it. It is especially fun with friends and the idea of using tactics to approach your target and not mindlessly go and shoot people is a game worth playing. Now that Patch 1.0 is finally coming out we can finally get better quality of life changes in this game and cant wait to see for future changes to come.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-01-28,0,0,263,False,Recommended,"I havent really had any problems with cheaters or crowding from other regions and the optimization is pretty good now in my eyes. The changes i wish for is in game mechanics 1. when you play with other people and are a passanger i wish the character would stay in the car after it gets knocked instead of falling out trough the door actually this goes for the driver too. having the option to exit a vehicle but not enter one.2. when being a passenger i wish the player could heal while the car is in motion but the driver cannot! except if heald by a teamate in the car! wich brings me to number 3.3. teamates can heal eachother instead of swapping loot for the same purpose4.If jumping from a speeding car you currently get knocked wich is fair ish. I wish there was a rolling animation that inhabilitated you from acting a certain amount of time up to a certain speed instead of being knocked unless the speed is too great.5. Bodyparts take damage effects. When shot in the leg added to hp loss i wish there was a physical animation and impaired movement same for arms when aiming untill healed or medicated.6. I wish the vehicle physics were better..7. I wish everything weren't so clean..8. I wish when aiming in a moving vehicle the movent would be less static compared to the car. i dont mind the difficulty aiming while driving i just wish it was more fluid or ""damped"" and delayed "" you know... like more realistic P but still just as hard to aim though!!9.

2018-01-28,0,0,243,False,Not Recommended,What can I say about PUBG? the game is amazing.. hands down the best battle royale game out there. The Shooting mechanics are functional with plenty of guns to choose from all with realistic feel and various recoil patterns to get used to. Never a wait to get into a match wether it be solo duo or squad matches due to the unreal amount of players online at any given time. (usually 2mil+). Thats a nice change of pace when compared to other battle royal games out there that will have you waiting aroud 5 min or more to get into a match (H1Z1 erm...). The Graphics range from servicable to good depending on what part of the map your near and assuming you have the rediculously powered rig to play on ultra settings.. (game is still poorly optimized as of the 1.0 release leaving it unnecessarily demanding in the specs dept.) Immersion is key for this type of game and PUBG gets this rite every time. Wether your cornered in a building listening to every foot step the enemy makes to get a grip on the situation or going from compound to compound hunting players you feel like your there. Gettting that sought after chicken dinner after a hard fight feels great every time. The only major gripe i have with the game is the crazy amount of Asian players coming to the NA servers. Its to the point that i have gotten a non english speaking teamate 30/30 times when queing for a duo match. Kinda hard to stradegize with someone who doesnt speak your language. If that happened once or twice i wouldnt care but EVERY SINGLE TIME is rediculous and breaks the game for me. The only alternative is to play solo games but that gets boring real fast. Its because of this one issue that i cant reccomend this game as of now. Dont pay 30 bucks simply to be stuck playing nothing but solos because every time you join a duo or squad you get teamates that dont understand you on your own server.i7 7700k 4.2 GHZEVGA GTX 1080 8GB DDR532GB RAM1TB Samsung SSD,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-10-18,0,0,249,True,Recommended,After 200 hours in this game I feel like I can leave a decent review. This game is an awesome Battle Royale experience with each game leaving you feeling exhilerated. There are a few issues with the game but that is because it is EARLY ACCESS... something which a lot of players cannot seem to grasp. The devs are constantly working on improving the game bringing new content and creating an outstanding overall experience. There is no such thing as pay to win with PUBG you win by being the best and choosing your positioning and shots carefully. I would highly recommend this game to anyone looking for an intense but enjoyable battle royale experience. However for those of you who like pro/con lists I'll leave one of my own.Pros highly active dev team is constantly working to improve the game rounds typically only last about 20 30 minutes TOPS gameplay is fun especially when you're trying to survive with friends HUGE adrenaline rush when you get into firefights or make top 10 there is nothing quite as rewarding as Chicken DinnerCons the game IS early access so it's still got issues and bugs that need ironing out from time to time a good bit of the game can be spent sprinting/looting if you're not running into people (or choosing not to engage) if you die early in the game during a squads match you may have to watch your friends play better than you (git gud scrub!)All this being said PUBG is a very enjoyable round based game that is great to play with friends or even solo (sometimes solo queue is easier because enemies die instantly but you can't play with yo frands). I will say that since it is early access and scheduled to go into full release in the future you'd be doing your wallet a favor by getting it now since the price will most likely change upon full release.

2018-01-09,0,0,291,False,Recommended,First This game is a lot of fun it was hard at first getting over the fact that you don't have a 50% chance of winning. But even in losing you still feel accomplished often. Rarely has a game with 2 maps held my attention for this long.BUT (HUGE but) All of the North American (NA) servers are infested with Chinese players. And sadly a large proportion of the hacking/cheating seems to come from that region. Hence I can't get a squad together who I can talk to and I've lost several games in the last minutes to a random headshot from someone who was looking the other direction at 100+ meters. I do wish it was region locked for the language issue primarily. It seems cheaters are coming around faster than they can be banned so even if the developer is issuing lots of bans it feels like they aren't. And ultimately it's what we see in game that determines the amount of fun we can have. Bottom Line If I continue to see mostly chinese players and cannot communicate...I'm sure this games days are numbered for me.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-15,0,0,252,True,Recommended,So far during my 18 hours of gameplay I have really like this game. This has been my first experience with the battle royale genre but learing how to play the game wasn't that hard you eventually get the hang out it. My time with the game has overall been positive and it is enhanced when you get into a squad with friends you can have a lot of fun. Although there are some things that I gripe about this game they are very few. Rendering is sometimes really wonky but is usually only a problem for me when I barely start the game (for example in the starting zone when you wait for the match to start) optimization isn't the best but I at least get an average of 60 70fps on high settings keeping in mind that I have a pretty average pc build nothing too fancy. There are also some problems with hit detection as many people have been killed behind walls or you randomly get killed by a vehicle explosion even though you are far away from it. But even with this I overall really enjoyed the game even if it is early access I would recommend it to people who enjoy a game where you have every man for himself. I have yet to run into cheaters but I am bound to find some later on,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-29,0,0,394,False,Not Recommended,I used to love this game. It ran well on my computer and was always really tense and captivating.However recently this game has skyrocketed into a burning fire of explosive death. By that I mean it got bad. Real bad.Hackers are everywhere and I always find myself being traced through a wall at long range or being instantly aimboted with absolutely no chance to defend myself.And that's not even the worst part.The servers. EVERY SINGLE KILLCAM only the first shot I take gets registered. Just recently i gunned down someone at point blank with four shots of the sk12 shotgun and the killcam revealed that only 1 had registered. But seriously. That was the last time I died.And EVERY SINGLE KILLCAM this week 90% of my shots fired haven't registered. THIS IS NOT AN EXAGGERATION. I couln't find A SINGLE KILLCAM whereas the rit registration was not broken.I know people want to region lock china to get rid of hackers but I think this is just blame coming from the awful servers this game has.Don't waste your money because your friends say the game is cool and it looks cool. Just don't. You'll only gain rage quits and eventually quit the game itself for good because it just doesn't function.P.S. as a top 2% solo FPP player don't just say I missed and it wasn't the servers.

However the game does have it's flaws if you kill a stream you most likely will get banned for stream sniping no matter what. My friend recently was banned for stream sniping even though we were playing in a duo and he done none of the sort. Overall if you are looking for a game in which is very stratigic then buy this game otherwise it'll be a waste of money,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-10-22,0,0,505,True,Recommended,If you like a large scale battle royale game with lots of potential on the long run. I think it's safe to say PUBG is the best right now. It might not satisfy every type of gamer but it sure is fun and immersive. The game is a rough diamond which already has a large community and active gameplay. As a casual gamer I recommend to try it's versatile gameplay.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-20,0,0,41,True,Recommended,Incredible Game. Having played both the Test Server and Base Game I love this game. It's a fun mix of casual gameplay challenge and fun. The only problems I can see are the many glitches but luckily they do not happen often but a lot of them do cause you to have to exit a match or lose one early. I am hoping these glitches are gone in 1.0. The new map Miramir is an intresting mix of urban combat and vast open spaces. With the new vaulting and climbing animations being added the game is ironing itself out. Weapons are a definite mix of good and bad with luck and tactics being a massive part of finding the good weapons like a Kar98K or an M4. Overall The game is a masterpiece and is definitely (IMHO) better than Fortnite. (I have played Fortnite so I think I can make that Comparison). 9.7/10,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-02-06,0,0,357,False,Not Recommended,For a game designed to be fair and esports friendly the inconsistencies ranging from server issues to ridiculous bugs leave a bitter taste that only gets worse. You will be more upset than happy more disappointed than satisfied more outraged than pleased while playing this game. The sole reason for the player count despite negative reviews is that the alternatives are far worse than PUBG. For any type of game I would overlook things like dying instantly while climbing a ledge a bike instantly killing you while trying to make it stand or people not dying despite 2 point blank hits to the belly with a shotgun because of abysmal tick rate and server capacity but not this game. This is a battle royale game and any unfair element can not be forgiven. Working your off for 20 minutes giving your all fully focused and then dying to uncontrollable flaws in the game is frankly a common experience in this game. I used to think the bugs and lag were exaggerated and the game was still pretty playable but after 100 hours when the joy of winning your first game or getting several kills in a game disappear I see the truth now. This is a game with great potential that tries it's absolute hardest to give the players a bad experience. You can make only a fraction of money as before crate prices dropped hard I'd much rather make money trading in tf2 than this. There isn't much reason to play this game you will hate this game more than you love it. Only buy it if you are into battle royale games &gt &gt &gt AND&lt &lt &lt have friends to play it with.

But the other games never gets better Than Pubg. This game may not be so good optimized BUT everyone may not realize this game is still in Early Access The Textures are great and the servers are also great for dealing with 100 players at the same time the weapons are also realistic made meaning that suppressors dont to less damaged that others games do to balance the game.

I 100% regret this purchase. Do not fall for the hype. This is not a good time. It is a game it follows the definition of a game but it is not a healthy game. You have to care very much when you are playing this game and if you don't you're ruining the game for your team mates. And if you do you will be frustrated far more often than not with your matches.

2017-09-02,0,0,258,True,Recommended,After about 100 hours on this game I may say that this is probably on my top 3 list of games.I love the fact that there is no tutorial so you are forced to learn from your mistakes. I won some times and the adrenaline rush in the end of the game when you suddenly notice it's just you and another person left or your team and another team.All the weapons are useable but some are ofcourse a must have. Like the Kar98k or the SKS. The loot you can get from crates could be worked on. I don't think there needs to be a tommygun. I would rather like it a lot more if it could spawn somewhere around the map.Speaking of map. I really like the map in the game. If there were no zone. Where you are forced to move to somewhere in the circle the map would have felt boring. There has been comfirmed that a new map will come I hope its soon ))),PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-08,0,0,145,True,Not Recommended,Hello everyone considering to buy this I normally don't bother with steam reviews but this is one of the few I will bother writing. Honestly this game is a lot of fun and great to play with friends. The developers are pretty good about keeping things updated and adding new features to the game while failing in other areas.When this game was released I took the plunge as many others and graciously parted with money to support BlueHole. I am writing this review to warn everyone considering buying this to close up your wallet and do not support these developers. I logged in yesterday in quite a shock to find out I had a ban placed on my account. After settling down from the complete surprise/shock at this I began to think about how I possibly could have been banned as I am not a person that supports cheating and would never consider doing it in an online game. I contacted BlueHole through the forums to apply for a ban appeal. I received a reply fourteen (14) hours after my correspondence that supposedly they had found evidence of my supposed cheating? and the ban would not be repealed. Like I said before I have been playing this game since it came out and have been playing exactly the same way I have always played. The only thing unusual that has happened in a recent play experience is I was having lag issues and would keep getting those little teleport/stutterinig movements that everyone gets from time to time which I assume people thought I was speedhacking or something and so reported me.Long story short I have tried to resolve this unjust ban peacefully with BlueHole and they apparently don't seem to care. I am warning everyone that is considering buying this that to please think about what I have wrote and really consider if supporting these guys are worth it or not. They banned me without verifying any of their actual logs (which if they had they would have seen I was having latency issues) and proclaim to have seen evidence. THank you all for your time and I hope you don't end up in my same situation over no fault of your own.UPDATE Dec 20 2017So I am following up with this original post as the developers decided to remove the game ban they placed on my Steam account. Honestly how I feel about the game hasn't changed it is a good game and I will stand by it. I am also glad that the developers have at least granted my wish to remove the mark from my 10+ year steam account. You might be asking then why is this review still negative? I am reluctant to play again for the fear I might get falsely accused and banned again through no fault of my own and until this kind of treatment stops occuring to myself and others this review will stay the way it is.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-01-16,0,0,201,False,Not Recommended,Honestly this is my second account. I couldn't really suggest getting this game in the current state. I would feel comfortable saying that at least 3/10 deaths are due to hackers confirmed through death cam or replay mode. This game has literally never felt like it's gotten better only gotten worse. The new map is absolute trash you can just get on reddit and read how everyone is there isn't a map selection because a lot of people would prefer not to play that hole new map. I have 400 hours on another account plus what I have on this account and it's honestly to the point espcially with paid crates that the little bugs or quirks with the game are no longer funny. I would suggest just getting fortnite. It's cartoony but you're going to have a way better playing experience. I had a lot of high hopes for this game. I thought Greene would actually take care of his own game. After him calling the playerbase Xenophobes because we want china region locked because you can't even find a majority of english speaking players on the NA servers and the fact that most hacks are coming from china... I would say you couldn't honestly rely on greene to ever take a stance against the chinese playerbase since that is by far the largest in the community.

2018-02-07,0,0,21,False,Not Recommended,"My first day or two of playing this game was intense. It was something I'd never experienced and I quickly figured out that by being strategic with my movement spending about 50% of my game time crawling through the grass and getting a few lucky shotgun kills by surprising someone in a house I could make the top ten fairly well. In Solo FPS I ended up averaging a top 15% rating after a week. But sneaking around and waiting with baited breath for someone to eventually find me and headshot me lost it's enjoyment factor pretty quickly. I came to realize that with my setup combat was simply impossible and a purely hiding victory while possible was incredibly unlikely. I feel a big part of the problem is that this game is so incredibly poorly optimized. I have had to give up playing it. It has so many latency issues and is so incredibly demanding on your computer that if you don't have a top end system and bleeding fast internet it ends up just being incredibly frustrating. For reference I have a Dell XPS 15 16gb DDR5 Rame i7 NVIDIA 960 GTX... nothing great but above the minimum specs for sure. Yet I die time and time again to someone simply because my FPS freaks out or my lag is 100ms more than someone else. Especially frustrating is that there is no way to know in real time what your latency is. If this were possible you could at least know ""Oh my latency is 450 ms at the moment I won't bother playing till the servers are working better."" You can't even be sure whether it is actually latency or a graphics issue... Not having a high end graphics card means you end up shooting at bushes as much as people. Potentially a REALLY fun game but in reality a REALLY frustrating game if you don't have a bleeding edge gaming computer and a ridiculously fast internet connection. Got a 1080TI?

Im stuck in the loading screen for the past week and the devs dont seem to care. The updates abd fixes for this game is getting lesser by the week and instead of fixing stuff they add more broken content. Im really disappointed BlueholeUpdated Review on Dec 21 2017 ( Day one of PC 1.0 launch)The game has its ups and downs but its amazing. Almost all the bugs were addressed by the dev team and the loot box system is one of the few systems left that actually dont change the gameplay and also give us a chance to trade items on the marketplaceReview Update Jan 13 2018The massive amount of hackers in this game is just absurd either they put a region lock to china alone and let them have their fun or think of a new solution to ban cheaters.

2017-11-10,0,0,270,True,Not Recommended,I had earlier reviewed when it was in early access and gave it a thumbs up. Now that it is out of early access I am changing that. As a full release I expected a lot more. It is still poorly optimized interfaces unintuitive and buggy. Additionally there are a high amount of cheaters. Following the introduction of deathcam replays I saw for myself actual cheaters kill me. I am not talking about lucky shots through walls or something but standing on hills miles from anyone just getting headshots within seconds from each other. It seems developer is trying to do something about this but it is too little in comparison to the high amount of cheating. Additionally there is still no ability to create custom matches unless you have a server with them. Also there is no ability to choose the map that you want (i cant stand Miramar). We still only have two maps available to choose from. The only thing that has kept the game going is the gameplay which is what attarcted me in the first play. Its strategic merciless and rewarding even when you lose. After all the sales and millions of millions of dollars this game has made I would expect a more fuller experience. But it seems the developer is currently unable to adapt. If it continues this way it will only be a matter of time before a more successful battle royal comes along to take its place as 'king of the hill'. Potentially Mavericks proving grounds. Already Fortnite has been giving it a run for its money with alot of the player base moving there.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-10-03,0,0,76,True,Recommended,It is good. Exists in the space between Call of Duty and DayZ in that the gunfights are fun and satisfying like COD but the stakes are raised liked in DayZ due to the 5 10 minute looting period and not wanting to lose that progress. But it does not go to the extremes of the spectrum where the gunfights are not intense due to instant respawns or the game is a literal walking simulator where the looting period is freaking hours long. Guns are satisfying to shoot and require actual skill to wield. Great game to play with friends.

However the optimization is so bad and I can't run it smoothly even when I updated my hardware with 1070 graphics card and 7700 cpu which are more than enough for me to run other better games such as GTA Nier Automata or any other 3A games. My average FPS is over 100 before and after I updated my PUBG with the 29m patch on February 7th my average FPS now dropped to less than 60 and it brought so much bad experience on this game.

2018-01-20,0,0,109,False,Recommended,I love this game. Its fun its addicting its intense and its frusturating and its so damn satisfying. I'll go in order ) I find this game addicting because its action packed you decide your role you're the star! I also find it so intense playing it you play this and i think i see someone so i shove my face into the screen but when i decide its not someone i dont seem to move away. I enjoy having that feel that something could happen at any time anywhere. It might be confusing because youd think you dont want a game thats frusturating? Well its true when i get at this game i say i hate it and but thats because im then the next game i kill someone and am i frusturated still? No! You get frusturated so easily and that probably because you just played an hour long game to get 2nd. it happens. the same will happen to the 2nd person when you get first! ) But the fact is it happens. Accept it Move on Move foward. Win. But then its so god damn ing satisfying when you go in a fight kill someone and loot them. You just got 1/100 closer to 1st place ) then again by now 50 people are dead so your 49 closer right? Getting 2nd may be frusturating but then again.. You had a 2/100 chance to get 2nd right? So feel proud and happy that you got this far! But what i love MOST about this game is my first reason. Its addicting. For me? I love league its such a fun game for me ive always loved it for years. Recently i cant say the same and im sad to say that i want to find that love and joy for the game again to be honest. but the thing about league is.. If you get at league when your in a game.. You cant leave.. Youll get banned then be MORE When your having a bad game and you die you get and you keep dying you KEEP getting . You cant leave and your just digging a hole by being in that game.. It sucks although when you win its really nice.. But the thing about pubg is that.. you play it your way. You can decide how you play. Remember? YOU are the star of the show. You decide whether your going to play an hour long game where you play passive and get a high score.. or you decide where your having a 10 minute game where you just fight and try to survive as long as possible. This is saying your not ing shourd where you run face first into school with a pan and still come out on top. (Metaphor) In other words you decide where your going to have an action packed game or a safe game. ALSO!!!! YOU CAN LEAVE LOL So when you get Just leave!

Repeat.There's no 1 hour of walking through forests and plains to reach your destination.Relatively small map sprint without needing to rest. Lots of vechicles spawn all around the map and there's plenty of gascans if you need 'em.PROS I won't bother listing everything since there's so many positive things about this game. Just try it and refund if you dislike it.CONS You can't 1st person aim with your weapon if you're too near a tree/stone. Have to take a step back. Stiff characters. Only one map which can get a bit boring after you've sunk plenty of hours into it. I'm starting to feel it myself. A few bugs here and there graphical and sound. (Sound example had a sound bug that played the sound of ""bullets falling/dropping to the floor"" ceaselessly.

2018-01-20,0,0,46,False,Recommended,I spent a couple of months debating on if I should get this game or not. It looked really fun but some of the reviews turned me away from making the purchase. Finally I decided to just go for it. In the nearly 30 hours I have played I have not regretted that for one second. The game has flaws and issues but in my opinion it is heavily outweighed by the amount of fun I have playing this game. It is not action packed and fast like a lot of games are and there are a lot of times where you will play a 20 minute game and not see a single person only to be killed by someone you never saw. However there have been plenty of moments where my adrenaline is pumping and my heart feels like it is beating out of my chest because of how intense of a moment I am in. If you are like me and going back and forth trying to decide if you want to spend your money on this game my recommendation is to go ahead and do it. I think you will get $30 of enjoyment and entertainment from this game.Update I can confirm that Asians do in fact play this game.

Even since official launch of the game same issues remain from EA state. Such as desync server performance lag hit registration. Some other minor aspects I dislike is the size of the maps. I think it is too huge for what the gameplay is trying achieve. That result in lame game pace sometimes you just don't see opponents for 10 to 15 minutes.Briefly the overall idea and basic mechanics are great.

2018-01-30,0,0,278,False,Not Recommended,Product received for free. Garbage engine garbage game. The input lag is terrible and loading is unoptimized. Don't buy this just to hop on the bandwagon. It isn't worth the money and I doubt it ever will be. A 4th Gen i7 and RX480 should be able to run current realeases at least on medium with no stutter/input lag (hint 99% still do!). The most recent patches seem to have made things go from hardly tolerable to much worse. All evidence of a company with too much money behind their briches and no idea what they are doing. Also the Unreal Engine is at least 40% to blame for this trainwreck. Unity (even as bad as that is) would have been leagues better performance wise for early access content like this.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-11-02,0,0,3916,True,Not Recommended,It has a lot of potential but under no circumstances is it ready for an official release or a release on console. There are so many glitches it is unreal. The physics are extremely unconsistent. Driving is okay until you hit a small bump and flip your brand new car you took 5 minutes trying to find. The shooting mechanics are alright. The main thing that's bad is the optimization. You shouldn't need a 1080 graphics card to run high settings. The high settings don't even look that great compared to other games. Overall it's a fun game but the glitches and optimization need to be addressed before an official release is even thought about.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-11,0,0,20,True,Not Recommended,"Although I dislike the way the shrinking borders are implemented such that you very frequently find yourself doing nothing but sprint towards the next play area for the entire duration of a round without stopping just to keep ahead of the encroaching border until you are finally one shot by an enemy who was waiting for you to arrive hiding in a location that made it impossible for you to even see them that isn't the reason why I'm giving it a negative review.Although I dislike the degree to which your success depends on getting lucky and finding one of the more powerful weapons (english for dummies ""degree to which your success depends on luck"" is not the same as saying ""the game is entirely dependant on luck"") and also getting a vehicle and also getting some kind of optics for your gun that lets you see another player before they see you that isn't the reason why I'm giving it a negative review.Although I dislike the fact that despite the map being truly enormous the game always plays out the same and the different areas of the map don't open up the possibility for new strategies hazards rewards or gameplay that isn't the reason why I'm giving it a negative review.Although I dislike the fact that there is only one map and there aren't different environments like deserts or snow or thick forests or swamps that have unique weather effects that impact the game in different ways and there is no night time scenario and in the 20 hours I've played I have only seen rain ONCE that isn't the reason why I'm giving it a negative review.And although I dislike the fact that in any given encounter between two players the third person perspective gives one of them a massive advantage over the other like how the player who is opening a door can see the player inside the room when that player can't see them or how positioning the camera correctly lets you see someone through a window who can't see you that isn't the reason why I'm giving it a negative review.No the reason I'm giving it a negative review is because this game has already sold over 5.5 million copies. This game is such a massive game changing phenomenon that it doesn't matter if I or even the entire userbase of Steam join in the chorus of negative reviews complaining about micro transactions and warning people not to buy it. It's like reviewing the Half Life series 20 years later and saying ""Don't buy these games because Valve still hasn't made Half Life 3 and probably never will"". You're a little late it's already a massive success. The people who are the type of gamer who would be interested in this game appear to have already bought it and any review at this point whether it is positive or negative is just whispers in the wind.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

As a competitive game it's incredibly important to make sure everyone sees the same things and has the same advantages and disadvantages. However PUBG allows players with Low and Very Low settings a MASSIVE advantage by removing grass cover. More than once my screen (set to high detail) has shown me in tall deep grass that would obscure me completely and then I'm shot dead. I watch the kill cam and the other player is using low settings and his screen SHOWS NO GRASS OR COVER AROUND MY CHARACTER. After spending 30 minutes carefully beating 95 other people I loose to a developers poor choice. If I could get a refund I would.

The second issue is people from other regions playing on servers on the other side of the world.

2017-12-31,0,0,364,False,Not Recommended,After 224 hrs spent on this game I cannot recommend it to anybody. The game is in a very poor state. Most of the issues come from BlueHole's decision to utilize client side processing for practically everything fundamental to this game. Guys with technical know how can come bash me all they want about it but all i know is this. This game is ripe full of hackers and bugs that people exploit and ruin the gaming experience for everybody else almost exclusively due to the client side aspects of this game. For me i could care less about vaulting new maps new guns or graphical updates when the fundamental FPS aspect of this game is soo unwieldy and clumsy. From dying behind cover to out of region desyncers taking 4 5 shots on your screen only to turn around and two shot you. This game finds soo many ways to be completely abysmal even tho the underlying premise of the game has soo much potential. Maybe in the future I'll consider returning to this game when Bluehole decides to be a responsible game developer and focus on fixing current broken fundamental game mechanics instead of pushing out microtransactions superficial updates and claiming this game is ready for the Pro scene.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-01-01,0,0,308,False,Not Recommended,PUBG is a massive battle arena featuring 100 players who drop from an airplane at a time of their choosing on one of two massive maps. Once on the ground you must search houses police stations barns etc to find weapons armor ammunition first aid supplies and weapon attachments. As time goes on the play area continually shrinks until only a few hundred square meters of the tens of square kilometers map is available for play.Players can play in squads duos or solo in either first or third person perspective. The name of the game is survival you have one life and once it's gone it's back to the lobby. Permadeath and a massive world with countless hiding places creates unbelieveable tension. When the game is functioning properly it's a ton of fun!Lately this game has become overrun with cheaters (using OBVIOUS and BLATANT hacks) and people from distant regions which gain an advantage due to their higher ping. Aimbots ESP speed hacks etc abound. This game is a ton of fun but dying to someone who is obviously cheating every fifth game or so is not. Bluehole needs to fix this ASAP or I forsee that their meteoric rise will lead to a meteoric crash. Player numbers have already taken a dip and with problems like this it's not difficult to see the dip becoming a precipitious decline.Fix your game or there will be a mass exodus when someone like DICE gets their act together creates a less buggy and cheating infested battle arena game and blows you out of the water.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-05-10,0,0,610,False,Recommended,Gameplay 10/10Mechanics 3/10After playing this game for well over 500 hours I can safely say that this game depends a lot more on luck and experience than aiming. You could have the greatest aim in the world and still lose fights to people like me who don't have good aim but have a lot of experience game sense and most importantly luck. This game has a ing huge luck factor whether it is safe zones gun spawns or just positioning in general. This combined with the shooting mechanics and a horrendous D Sync issue just makes the game unplayable at times. Onto the less important more in depth stuff Hackers have always been a problem for this game but recently the amount of hackers just ing skyrocketed. Thankfully the team behind the game actually care about reports and even ban hackers from the footage you send them through their forums. Another issue I personally have is the balancing of some weapons if you get annoyed easily just don't read from this point on because it will be me ing. AKM is ing unplayable because of the recoil and isn't even worth mastering since it almost has the same DPS as the m4 and has less DPS than the m16.

I will say once the developers put more focus on response and stability to play (think of it as Battlefield 4 stability and smoothness needed) this will be a great game. I dont play it because everything i do is either glitchy the way i move feels weird or is problems with the game that cause it to crash all the time. Now let me clarify im not saying this isnt a title i wouldnt buy i DID buy it because my friends have it and so do my co workers and the times i looked passed all the bugs and glitches and performance issues i really did enjoy it but i feel if this game is going to truely succeed they need to make it more responsive.... a good example is when i walk up on a door and press E or a controller button (depending on how you play) it sometimes will fly open sometimes wont open at all or sometimes will open then close. This isnt a big issue but still i would like this game to have the ""fluidness"" of playing some big title like Battlefield 4 or COD. Those games you feel smooth when running and walking the game balances well with large numbers of players and it doesnt crash often...... so without furher gripe on my end i would say get the game the developers will probably fix all of these eventually and this has been one of the biggest games of 2017 so get it. be warned though its not the most fluid game out there but its still enjoyable with friends.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-12,0,0,635,True,Not Recommended,Update to my original review (which was positive) My original review was done with the hopes that the developers would get their stride following their overwhelming success. I hoped they would prioritize the bugs and hackers. Instead they implemented fog added a new weapon.... and thats it.In the time I've owned this game BlueBalls has become a $4B company and their development speed has slowed to a snail's pace.This is quickly turning into a prime example of why early access screws the consumer. Pubg is as popular now as it will ever be the amount of money that BlueBalls stands to make off Pubg by releasing it fully will be miniscule compared to what they could make if they say.... made another game and just leave pubg to rot.I have been sorely disappointed with the development of this game. Optimization is terrible there are so many bugs that you can go on youtube and find thousands of hilarious videos of people finding bugs in the game. Hackers... my god. In the past month alone BlueBalls has banned an excess of 300 000 accounts! Let that sink in... They have banned that many people and it still is completely unplayable from hackers. This coming from a game that wants to become an esport.. lmfao. I've consistently ranked top 1 000 in every ladder since the ladder systems first were implemented. The hacking has never been worse than it is now. Prior to about a month and a half ago I never accused anyone of cheating. Now I can't go a single game without feeling like I was screwed because of a hacker.Don't worry guys... vault will MAYBE be in the game before release.Too bad the servers will be empty cause people don't have time to deal with bugs and hackers waiting for a feature that should have been implemented 2 months ago.Positives A ton of fun to play with your friends (seriously the option to not queue with randoms in a competitive game and play at a disadvantage is something that every competitive game should consider) Lots of replayability Twitch was fun to watchCons Sells itself as a competitive game when you literally can't play two games in a row without running into a hacker Months after release simple bugs are still in the game. For example it took them a full month to fix the bug where NA players defaulted to Asia servers at the main menu Cross continent gameplay hackers galore Every other game is either fog or rain. What this means is that a game where there are 100 people before the first bullet is fired there will be less than 60 people in the game (because everyone leaves these games). Vehicle mechanics are hilariously bad Armor needs to be normalized or removed entirely. There will be game after game where you literally stop shooting people because you assume they can't possibly still be alive... and then they shoot you in the back. Shotguns are completely unreliable half the time I will shoot someone from 50 feet away and kill them instantly. The other half of the time I will point blank someone in the throat and there will be zero hit recognition. The game is an FPS yet its shooting system is mediocre at best flat out unplayable at worst The garbage servers... I won't even Early access cash grabOld Review For the love of God when is a AAA company going to make one of these games? Is the game fun? YeaShould you buy it to play with friends?

And if the developer wishes you to do it professionally and press tab and select items individually why the would you have a pickup key to begin with? Also I reloaded the gun for a double barrel shotgun but then it would take another full ing seconds to actually register that the bullets are in. 4 body shots with a pistol with no armor but the guy still lives. I would be aiming across the window but the bullet would actually take half a second to shoot out of the ing gun at which point I'm already moving to cover which will then result in shooting the window sill. Just the overall connection is a mess and the mechanics are complete senseless. Plus why would you not give an option where we can just zero in instead of hipfire when pushing right mouse key? Give an OPTION so that we can play as we see fit.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-24,0,0,494,False,Recommended,Based on 1.0Ok this Game has great graphic and the sound is just amazing. Like echoes silencer sounds and engines now with the new 1.0 update the horn of cars tho hopefully gets an update DThe best thing that really creates a good atmosphere is the sound and with it all around it like the new second map now that is huge and i like much better then the first one ( does not mean the first one is ). I love the vaulting feature where you can climb up things jump into buildings through windows you have more tactical choices in building battles then before.Now as it goes with those type of games finding good weapons and choosing your strategy accordingly is important but often it comes down to who has the ranged weapons in the end especially when it is an open field you have to run through to get to the safe zone. But thats part of the game and choosing the right terrain to go through is as important as positions to defend and luck sometimes with the zone especially towards the end.Now everybody plays this game differently most are for engangement others like to play safe to get to the end. You just have to find a way that works for you and when you get to #1 it feels like a good rush because in the end in a small area is hitting the fan and choices/no reaction will get you killed or not. From early access to now the game has just gotten better and with the new additions to it i will play more now then in ea because i like the new additions a lot.I can absolutely recommend this game especially when you have people to play it with.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-26,0,0,353,False,Not Recommended,The biggest issue with this game is currently being ignored which is a slap in the face to their fan base. Almost everyone I know wants Bluehole to region lock china for three legit reasons 1) They bring high ping into otherwise stable servers. 2) 99% of hackers on this game are chinese. 3) you cannot communicate effectively with someone who only speaks chinese. Instead of properly addressing these issues the developer is just claiming that the people demanding the region lock are Xenophobic which is an insult to his own intellect. Until China is region locked I give this game a well deserving 1/10 if and when China is region locked my review will turn positive and my enjoyment of the game will return. Failure to listen to your fans is the worst thing you can do as a game developer.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

There are some issues with the regions and a ton of problems with hackers but it's still a great game if you have friends who are willing to play with you.

2017-09-26,0,0,138,True,Not Recommended,Concept wise this is the best battle royale game out there but if we look at everything else this game is the worst. I enjoyed it at first but the more you play the more you resent this game. It has endless graphics bugs sometimes you start the game with wallhack and no clip and you have an unfair advantage over other players. And theres even more ways to cheat your way through the game like removing fog so you can see further removing terrain textures so you can see better around trees and rocks.Furthermore the games engine is awfully unoptimized and you cannot run it on a decent gaming computer. I've got a high end gaming laptop and all i can squeeze is 40 fps at best with all settings on low and even some extra changes in my video card settings. If you want to run this smoothly on medium graphics youre laptop should be in the 1 5k 2k euro/dollar price range and for desktops it should be somewhere around 1k.Developer wise it seems that all they care about is making profit because they are rolling out these alpha at best game copies for 30 euros ( not including micro transactions for in game items that give you advantage in game) full of bugs. The game is worse now than it was 2 3 weeks ago. When i first bought this game i could run it kind of smoothly on 40 fps right now the average fps i get is 25 30. It seems that theyre breaking the game even more. Not to mention the game stutters that occur between updates. With one update they fix some stuff but they break something else. Theres endless audio/ voice glitches too. If you want to use the ingame communication you're out of luck. Your microphone sometimes stops working mid game and you have to restart it just to get it back going. Also the sound of the game cuts out but it usually comes back within couple of seconds.I WOULD NOT recommend you buying this game at the current state. Because this is the worst 30 euros i have spent on a game EVER! I really enjoyed playing this game at first but the bugs cheaters and developer attitude towards customers are making us furious. Hopefully something changes in the near future if not this game will die in a couple of months,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

This game is early access so expect bugs here and there. This game is still going through optimization upgrades so a strong computer is heavily recomended. I have a decent cpu and gpu and get between 50 70fps with an fps pack. the UI is decent and gunplay is alright solid but not the best.this game to me is20% skill 10% tactics 10%RNG(while looting)60% luckDue to the large map and large amount of players in a server literaly anything can happen in a split second that can kill you between walking into traps camping or getting sniped. That being said when you are the one doing the killing the kills feel very very rewarding.

2017-09-27,0,0,209,True,Recommended,"A lot of games try to do the battle royale style thing this one just does it better 600% better. With a lot of things that add a bit of realism while not doing so annoyingly to its own detriment. Right now a lot of people are getting into the streamer politics nonsense and I won't delve into that. This is based on the game and associated content.Pros +Customizable weaponry (increasing combat effectiveness without getting annoying to the point of weapon skins like CS GO did)+Vehicles done mostly right (Tires can be popped people can be hit by shooting the vehicles. Thus your soviet era sedan is not the equivelent of an M1 Abrams.)+Bullet drop so you won't be headshotted from across the map by some kid who thinks this is COD who will then tell you to ""get gud""+Hella fun to play in a squad with friends+Serious advantage given to players who actually communicate to accomplish specific objectives in an attack (As such going rambo because you don't think the team thing is gonna go your way likely won't work out.)+Rushing into a building and spraying everyone who is likely better equipped than you won't work out you have to behave like a person actually would in order to win.+Developers are absolutely dedicated and just plain awesome.+Second pro on the developers.+And a Third.+Seriously I've seen so many games abuse the ""Early Access Game"" title. They sell a metric ton of copies on empty promises then abandon the game. PUBG is an example of an Early Access Title progressing exactly as it's supposed to. It was extremely fun and playable upon initial release and it's only gotten better since then. The Developers seem to be pretty forward with the community and continue to improve and add content between large updates. This keeps the game from getting stale from the ""same old same old"" problem that games with a tri monthly update that crams all new content big and small into one load. Tl DR Dev's are upfront with the community and regularly add little things between big updates to keep the game fresh. They also don't abuse the ""Early Access Game"" title that so many other Developers have.Cons Randoms in matches both squad and solo are generally the purest and most refined forms of cancer known to man. (Don't get me wrong the're not all bad. But the good community members generaly aren't the ones you hear because they aren't spamming the mic.) The Vaulting animation has yet to come but it's in development so this con is essentially going to not be relevant when that particular update hits. Difficult to tell what content will be coming when. (Not complaining guns are being added. There are rumors of new maps and perhaps even a single player campaign. These things just aren't located on a standardized roadmap like with a lot of early access games.) Lobby takes A LONG FREAKIN' TIME TO LOAD ALWAYS. This has been improved 7 000 000%Final Verdict Fun solo or with friends. Better with friends though Well worth the money either way. Highly reccommended if you've got friends that play the game and you're looking for something to fill that void in your schedule.

2017-08-21,0,0,273,True,Recommended,A day before the full game v1.0 officially releases on steam. I have to say I am very impressed with this game and especially the most recent updates. Sure there's quite a bit of glitches unregistered hits and LOTS of rubberbanding (Right when you land goes away after the first minute) in the test servers which will hopefully be fixed when it is on the official servers. Past those temporary problems this game is a near perfect Battle Royale experience. It can be a little slow paced at times but it always keeps you on your toes waiting to hear shots or to get shot when you are running in the open desert. No other game gives the same experience as this one and I highly recommend it in it's current state.

Nothing has been done about region locking the game except for PlayerUnknown calling his playerbase racist for wanting to be able to communicate with one another. Cheating is rampant. The game still runs like garbage. Rather than taking the obscene fortune they have amassed from the millions of sales and using it to fix the game they implement a horrid new loot box system to milk even more money from players.

It is one thing to enforce players to fight when they have gear such as with Archeage in high loot gear areas but it is another thing to play loot tag for a half an hour while praying on RNG to even give you simple items. It is simply not fun. There is a reason people rage quite easily in this game.Anarchy Reigns had a superior Battle Royale but it relied on Japanese sales so there were very few people to play with.I also take issue with this game stating they invented this genre. Sorry it's been out for years in varying formats all the way back to PS2 when one could connect it to the internet.This game is a waste of money and a waste of potential.

So you made it past the first 2 min gun shots are popping off near you. People do one or two things.. 1) Aggressive player Follows the gun shots and attemps to kill everyone around ( About 15% of the people who try this can do it) 2) House Keeping The guy that waits till gun shots stop and goes in to clean the guy looting .. (Enough said with that one) Now at this point you are either in the Zone or Driving/Running to the Zone.. Those Driving or running 50% end up getting shot and killed. The other 50% make it to the middle of the zone camp in a house or are out looking for kills.After flipping your car.. Running a guy down Gunning someone down.. you are in the Top 10 and either you get picked out by a sniper or fragged... RIP... Chicken Dinner !! You won your first game.. Congrats.. you got 1kill ...

2017-12-20,0,0,433,True,Recommended,This game kicks so much You scavenge for items and the loot tables are always being ed with so good luck there. They with the parachute dynamics so hitting your goal can be challenging and for some reason I ing suck with a shotgun. Real hardcore ucking there. I have almost 400 (391 as of this review) hours into the game. I can't get enough of it. Just watch out for talking French Canadian kids. They can hurt you in ways your wife or mother in law dream of. I'm not dumb you mean kid I'm a strong independant 34 year old man and I don't need you. Still salty af from that fam. Anyway when you read negative reviews it's because they suck. those guys Player Unknown is a mother ing P I M P pimp who flies in jets and s instagram models for the DM screenshots. He made the best game ever since Fallout 3 and maybe New Vegas since I kinda like New Vegas a little more now that I'm older and he thinks you should all shut the up and just play. It's a ing game it lags it cheats you due to latency it robbed your childhood of experiences like losing your v card before you were twenty. Ahem twenty three. it. Buy it. This reviewer said to do it because everyone else did it and is jumping out airplanes and and lobbing random grenades everywhere.

Play with friends its worth a go I will say make sure you have some decent specs on your computer because this is NOT a game to play on a toaster because although walking simulator is exactly pretty at any point not being able to see that tree looking bush looking guy 1000m away is pretty useful.

We bought a product based on what was promised and when the devs blatantly lie to their customers and switch out the product we were promised with another right in front of our faces it makes me hate the company. It sets a bad precedent and makes them believe that they can keep getting away with lying. Don't buy this game if you still havn't until the devs and ESPECIALLY PU get their together.

2017-12-20,0,0,230,True,Recommended,Product received for free. The devs for this game originally did not seem too invested in the work but I have been slapped in the face with how false that assumption was 2 times in the past 2 weeks. First was when I played the Test Servers and the gameplay was much smoother than in the current build along with an insanely beautiful map. And now when the official release dropped and noticing how their servers could not handle the influx of players the devs took it down and delayed it to fix their server issues for everyone to have a pleasant gaming experience. I applaud and thank these devs for their dedication to the game and their consideration to the community. (But please crack down on hackers!),PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

IMO it shouldn't be out of Early Access yet.Now good ol' Blue Hole have added keys to the boxes which have to be bought for real money this is my main reason for the negative rating. Keys are an obvious stream of income which I understand if the game is free to play but for a game that has obviously made a tonne of money already it's just a money grabbing micro transaction.TL DR Love the game even with it's bad performance but the adition of keys you have to buy is the final nail in a poorly made coffin.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

You decide where to jump with your parachute and you try to survive to #1. While you make up your way to victory you will have to control your inventory find better weapons and kill the other opponents you face on the way. While the game's concept and gameplay is good of course there are some tiny problems.+Gameplay 8.5 9/10 while the gameplay is good there are problems To start with bugs. Black screens character doesn't responds see the guy's gun from the other side of the wall (happened a few times) disconnecting for no reason weird inventory / item glitches...+Graphics 8/10 This is personally my opinion. Graphics are kinda good to me could be better but is still good.(Important Note Here While the graphics are okay ish the game uses so much CPU and GPU compared to what you get.)+Concept 9 9.5/10 One of the best concepts I've seen for a few years. It kinda started a new game type. Games like Fortnite (by Epic Games) uses the same concept in their games.+Environment 9/10 Proper thought maps. Loots change everytime and can be very surprising.

Just remember every time you purchase DLC a loot box skin etc YOU ARE RUINING THE GAME INDUSTRY (look at the mobile game industry). I've gone the whole year just playing indie games and honestly after seeing the newest Call of Duty I'm glad for it the triple ""A"" studio's just keep re skinning the same old crap and selling you half a game for $79.99 CAD and expect you to pay extra for the whole thing.This game is very different from the run of the mill FPS game Every kill is meaningful and every death (almost physically) hurts.

2018-03-22,0,0,1613,False,Not Recommended,I have to give this game a negative rating which is truely sad. The game has so much potential.but the developers are too busy with new maps and skins and annecessary balancing updates to even be worried about fixing the real issues at hand. We living in South africa still have no server of our own which means you need to play EU servers which means your ping is avg 200. This means that you get headshot 2 seconds later after you stopped peaking already die ing and being shot around corners.. And dont let me even start about server lag...the have made so much money off the game but they cant fix basic issues like this. CSGO is most prob a better alternative game to this your just going to get frustrated. Plus the hackers are out of control..still !! They release numerous updates throughout the day which cause your game to crash while you are playing and when you try to reconnect and continue where you left off..if either says connection failed or the game crashes with a memory reference. I have alot of hours on the game was at on point top 0.84% on solo EU so im deff not a new player. All in all..great game+ developers shity experience not worth buying... Update the desync is so fu*ken bad i cant explain it. Loot takes time to spawn STILL!! WORST game on steam a.t.m would rather play Ring of Elysium free and much better.

It's nothing but a lazy h1z1 mod put in a unreal 4 asset testing zone.Been playing this game for about 30 hours and I think I made my opinion about this game. Of all the 30 hours I spent (5% alone which was probably the worst experience ever) 90% of the times it was just me running around for 20 minutes just to be killed by some dude 5 miles away.Wouldn't be so bad if stuff actually happened along the way but it's just you in one of the most empty and unoriginal maps ever created picking up items for 30 minutes so then all of your precious time is wasted by a single 10 second moment of despair. An unaccounted variable.The maps are so god damn big and boring. Most of it is filled with the iest textures and models that would make a 12 year old browsing Unity Asset Store jealous.The only thing keeping this game alive is the same one as CS GO (A game that is gainning mold by this point) is in game bitcoin.Fortnite is a much better game in my opinion since the matches are much shorter and sweet.

2017-07-30,0,0,373,True,Not Recommended,PlayerUnkown's Battlegrounds is a fantastic early access game I bought from day 1. On day 1 I bought it for myself along with 5 other copy's for my friends who I reguarly game with but who are a bit iffy about purchasing early access games due to being supporters of Day Z and Ark Survival Evolved.I have played for 175.5 hrs on record at the time of this review and have had loads of fun in the game. It is a very skill based game with luck and zone positioning being key in winning any game. Finding that rare sniper rifle or silencer can really get you excited for the win. The constant fear of not knowing where or how many people are nearby makes the gameplay in PlayerUnnknown's Battlegrounds a worthy experience.However I cannot support an early access game or in my opinion any game that locks content behind the anti consumer paywall that is the microtransaction crate system. I myself have spent over $150 USD on multiple copys of this game as I thought it was a great early access experience to be enjoyed by my friends and I. It is very dissapointing to see this game still in early access breaking its promise to not include DLC content until full release. DO NOT PAY FOR REAL MONEY KEYS!

It's not the cheaters fault (despite them being annoying) that the design and codng for the game ignores 20+ years of experience in FPS style games and cheating...Not to mention very often the cheats that are MOST DAMAGING to the game NEVER GET CAUGHT because they do things like let the player know where you are at all times where all the best gear is and many more. I wish I had known about the 5 hour Steam refund thing this game is a PoS covered in a turd sandwhich washed down with a cup of vomit. Ignore all the fanboi's who scream it's the greatest thing since sliced bread..like I said the idea is good the implementation could have been done better by a highly evolved ameoba.Oh yeah and this gem...if you design a game that ALLOWS friendly fire but then you implement a strict ""no teamkilling"" rule where you BAN people for it (see recent Steam news article)...I mean that should tell you the level of ignorance and stupidity by both ""Playerunknown"" and the entire development team...In recent patches things like vehicle physics and mechanics have somehow what I thought were the worst vehicle of any video game EVER got WORSE. No really...you now get randomly thrown from vehicles or you can be driing anywhere no ANYWHERE (it has happened on the paved roads more than once) hit a completely invisible ""nothing"" and come to a full stop and take damage like you rammed something...with nothing visible.The cheating hasn't gotten better the freezes are more common the lag continues to degrade (despite 'server optimization')...there are seriously too many problems to list I truly regret spending a single penny on this PoS",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-09-10,0,0,44,True,Not Recommended,This game was and still is a fun game for me in the first 9 hours of game time I made it to top 10 and at one point ended up in 4th place. The learning curve isn t that difficult thanks to guides and streams and it was easy to understand the mechanics and strategy needed to get ahead and make it to the end. However I cannot recommend this game to everyone because of the following problems rampant cheaters botting monetization in the style of CSGO crates and lack of optimization for low end computers. Cheating is very rampant in this game speed hacks and wall hacks are common. As an anecdote I had to deal with a wall hacker who was able to kill me with an AKM behind a wall in a two story house he didn t even peek around the corner he simply shot me and that was it. There is also speed backs that let you run like Sonic the Hedgehog enabling you to easily get the loot you want and to waste teams out in the open. Fortunately for me I never spotted one of those users but streamers like Shroud can attest to this experience. But what makes this infuriating is that knowing that even if the cheater is banned by reports it will not stop the cheater from forking over $30 to get a new copy along with a new account. Botting makes it worse for those that need to farm BP the in game currency. Botting is an issue that affects squads and duos at the moment as someone who mainly plays solo those don t happen much on the NA solo matchmaking. But to those who do see it it s pretty straight forward afk during the plane drop and land in an area wait for the circle to close and die to being outside the play zone. During this time you can leave the game and reque for another match all the while receiving the small amount of BP. Many of these bot owners have a number of them on hand to keep farming BP is due to the monetization of these games in the form of loot crates which I will get to later. But all you need to know is that if you re in a squad or duo and that 99 100 player count suddenly drops to 30 or 40 before first circle than your match was probably full of bots. Taking the fun out of duos and squads. Now monetization is a whole other issue other because those who played CSGO will find this very familiar you get cosmetic items through crates that can make your character look badass or just plain silly. However the rarest items in these crates or the crates themselves hold a lot of value due to their rarity take for example miniskirts they are one of the hardest item to obtain from the crates and as a result they hold a lot of money that people are willing to fork over $100+. Now how do sellers get such an item? Either get lucky with a crate opening or use the bots mentioned in the previous paragraph and farm that BP. Other than this extreme example the rest of the market place has prices for certain clothing that can range from $1to $20. But keep in mind you can find most of those same items out in the field you just can t keep it after the match. That leaves us with my last pet peeve. Finally we have the game optimization. Now I understand that this is an early access game it s not fully optimized but I feel this is still worth a mention. If you have a budget PC like I do then your out of luck. This game hates lower end PC s especially those that use HDD 8 gigs of RAM and any graphics card below the NVIDIA GTX 1080. Now I understand that the Dev s are working to make this game more optimized but until then the worst thing you re going to have to do is either spend 6 hours of trouble shooting to get the game to run smoothly or spend a lot of money to either upgrade your PC or just build a new one at that point PUBG price of $30 might as well be $1000+ as that s the estimated price you re going to spend just to play this game. Until then you re going to have to deal with lots of lag poor rendering and even a freeze or blue screen of death when playing this game. In summary Player Unknowns Battlegrounds is a very fun game but it has so many issues that at the moment I can t endorse it to anyone who is interested. Right now this game is for only those that want to farm BP and make money on the steam market place cheaters and high end PC build that most of us can t afford. But should Bluehole Inc. decide to better optimize this game and deal with the exploits their userbase are using than I would give this game a full endorsement. For now it s not getting any from me.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-04-13,0,0,570,True,Recommended,I've only played a few games. All in which I have died. Once from a firefight. Twice from not paying attention to the Forcefield. Nonetheless I am really enjoying this game. I like the engine it runs off of and the open survival world. Stalking prey running for cover. The fact that you could roam for 5 minutes only to find yourself in an intense firefight is really cool. It keeps you on your toes. All in All I can only see this game getting better. One thing I definatly think should be implimented is a TUTORIALEdition #1 One thing I would also add to this is more vehicles. With only 3 to choose from it's not awful but a larger variety would be nice later on. Maybe a Pickup Truck and a more rare car that is always there but not as many. The buggy is nice for duo. The SUV is nice for squads and so is the sedan. But seeing as it is a pick up truck would be nice. Something like 2 seats in the cab and allowing one or two players in the bed. It could add a different twist to the game forsure. Or witha truck allow the bed to be used for storage and if you die then that could be looted.Edition #2 The game has crashed on me 3 times within the past two days. I do find it fun still yet upsetting that this is crashing so frequently. I do understand this will be fixed with time. A bug I would like to add is that every couple of games or so I have to leave because my F key to collect items will not let me collect items. Yes this persists after trying with 2 different keyboards.Edition #3 Now with almost 250 hours into the game (Yes I know that's not too many) I have noticed the bugs being fixed. One issue I have is the Optimization on Erangle. When parachuting in my game takes a while for buildings to fully render thus making it impossible for me to enter a building immediatley. Moving on the additions of weapons has been amazing. They add a different but nice feel. The desert map is simply amazing. It renders in immediatley for me but further more the new wepaons are fantastic! I never stray away from the new .45. I haven't found much use in the sawed off and the winchester but they are nice and fun to use. In Edition 1 I said it would be nice to get a truck and that has definatley been answered. I'm sure i'm not the only one who asked but it is still nice to see that it was implimented. The bronco is also amazing. I often find myself taking one of them over the buggy. All in all the new map was definaltey refreshing. My game does crash and I do experience lag a lot but I do understand that this is a work in progress. My client crashed twice today but it is understandable. 8/10,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The second is China I think they should be region locked. I wouldnt even mind if everyone was region locked every few games or so I die by somebody that can see thru walls or can teleport anywhere and its annoying and they are always asian. not to mention it would be nice to be in a lobby with fellow english speaking people. Other than those 2 points. Great gameThis CAN be a great game but as of now it is not. The lag alone is the reason I stopped playing if you get lucky enough to get a gun at the start of the game good luck trying to run over to it and pick it up as you rubber band and click f 10 times before you get it.

2017-10-13,0,0,301,True,Recommended,I heard there are some negative experiences in china as an european player I love this game and don't have any connectivity issues still it has some flaws as it is allowed heck even supposed to have as an early access game.Let's be honest the Menu/Lobby/character screen from which you start the game is It crashes non stop the equipment bugs around the server choice (EU AS NA etc... ) sucks (it somehow always changes to AS for no reason) and especially when you're playing in a squad it has some weird group glitches and bugs. But it's just the menu so I don't realy care/ it doesn't really matter that much.What bugs me the most about that menu are the statistics. I don't know what is wrong with them but they are not accurate at all. I wasn't sure until after I won a match and it's shown nowhere in the statistics.If we're talking about the whole wardrobe thing I don't know if I really care about it but it's really hard to get cool clothes without spending actual money. Let's be honest though they don't really give an advantage.I'd love if the game had some option to spectate freecam after dead in solo rounds or when your whole squad/duo died even if it's just to find out who killed you from where. Because especially if I'm second it really bugs me if I didn't even see or hear the winner shooting at me (which can happen a lot).To end the review... All I named here was the negative stuff. there's actually a lot way more than negative positive things I could tell about this piece but let's just say It's priceworthy and you can play it alone or up to four players and it's always fun. I never had a game that gave that much adrelanine especially if you're one of the last ten living players.All in all buy it and judge for yourself (unless you're chinese maybe). Oh yeah and don't forget that it's early access I know you're probalby sick of it by now but such a game can have bugs/unfinished content.Oh and if your pc can't handle it sucks to be you P,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-27,0,0,548,False,Not Recommended,This is a fantastically fun game... at times. The rest of the time it is ridiculously laggy (to the point of barely being playable in the early part of the game) and infested by cheaters. Seriously the cheating is beyond ridiculous. There are aim bots speed run hacks/cheats invulnerability hacks/cheats and other fun to deal with for all the non cheating players. Reporting players who are cheating also doesn't seem to do anything and I wonder whether this reporting mechanic was included to make the victim feel better rather than to actually do anything.The fact that it is now a *finished* game with a 1.0 release and these problems have not only not been fixed but are actually worse than it was when I first started playing several months ago evidences that the priorities of the developers is not focused on improving the game for existing customers. The focus for the developers seems to simply be to sell as many copies as possible while they can. It's a shame.If you are going to buy this game then please do so with your eyes open and realise that these problems may never be fixed.

2018-10-12,0,0,452,False,Not Recommended,"I bought this game during the hype of the Battle Royal summer of 2017. It was the game to have and it was in many ways revolutionary. My squad of guys played hours upon hours and won a bunch of games and lost even more but never truly hated the game. It was clunky had terrible netcode and guns were very difficult to control and for all these reasons winning was that much more pleasurable for us we knew we had beaten all the odds. But after so many lackluster updates to try to get the game functional we finally had to say goodbye. The game is not taken care of and Bluehole is not a good enough studio to realize that they are killing their game by not acting time efficiently or implementing actual game fixing features. Each update holds no actual gameplay value and maps are not well created and at this point there should be at least six maps in the 4x4 size category. I could create better maps more frequently on the FarCry 3 map editor on my PS3 and they can only release 2 new maps within the span of nearly 2 years.Vehicles are also too scarce and the bluezone is too annoying a mechanic (in this game not others) to deal with since most of the time you'll be playing running simulator to get to the safe zone as cars are so infrequent.The gunplay is too complicated and too laggy for most to have a successful gunfight. Never in a game have I felt more unequiped even when I'm holding a fully automatic rifle in my hands.Expanded grievences Entering a vehicle does not default you to the drivers seat which will get you killed if you are trying to get away from a gunfight Ability to mute specific toxic teammates was only just implemented There are not enough real landmarks on the map to help guide teammates to enemy positions nor is there a spotting mechanic. This makes squad firefights extremely difficult to win because all you can do is say ""He's behind the tree"". I realize there's a compass but you try triangulating the position of an enemy in 5 seconds when your buddy says 355 which is actually 230 on your compass. Equiping gear and attachments to weapons is too clunky and unfluid. The click and drag approach could make sense if the gun slots were next to the ground slots in the tab menu but having to equip everything manually takes so much time and oftenn in the early game you don't have that time. Netcode is terrible and for a month or so it seemed like they fixed it. But then they reverted back to their old system and that's when I couldn't take the incompetance anymore. Not enough map variety and not enough real content for a $40 game (Canadian) The constant lying and inaction from Bluehole is too much to handle nowHonestly what drove me to even write this review of PUBG is the fact that Ring of Elysium recently launched and it is far and away the version of PUBG that everyone wanted PUBG to be. Everything I mentioned above is not an issue for RoE with exception to the map grievance which I'm sure will change. But even if it doesn't The game is FREE.In conclusion don't buy this now garbage game. It will bever be fixed only marketed to be. What you see on streamers channels is rare in this game and will very seldom actually happen to you. Save your money and come join me on Ring of Elysium where gunshots actually hit there is no lag ever that I noticed and you can actually kill people without the fear of cheaters or that the other person had better ping than you.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-10-14,0,0,132,True,Not Recommended,"This game is very popular and has sold millions of copies and yet this game is completely unplayable. It's laggy. It's buggy. It's full of that scream on their microphones for no ing reason alright? The developers aren't doing to fix the issues that are plaguing the game. It gets boring really quickly. The weapons are not diverse. The doors don't open man. You press 'F' to open the door and you expect it to just open and it doesn't open. And then sometimes you pick up a weapon and it doesn't appear and you die. And I have a very powerful computer alright? I can run Witcher 3 on ULTRA. OK? And I get over 60 FPS. This unoptimized piece of poo poo barely runs even on the lowest settings and I can't get even 30 FPS out of it. Constant slideshows. The GPU gets so hot that I don't have to put the kettle on to make tea. I just put my cup on my computer and brew tea. That's a true fact. You play the same map over and over and over and like by the 10th playthrough you already know the map. The colors are gray and dull and depressing. And why is it in Russia? Why can't we have more colorful locations? Why can't we have a jungle map with like a volcano or something? Why not a desert map? A city? The arctic? Anything but gray dull decaying post Soviet Russia. I don't care man have Russia too but at least make it one of many maps not the only map in the game.These guys took Arma 3's engine did a few minor changes and are now selling tens of millions of copies reaping insane revenues and they can't even fix some basic stuff man. And I'm not even getting into the ripping off of Chinese players by forcing them to buy ""network accelerators"" instead of just getting dedicated Chinese servers and I'm not even getting into the whole ""stream sniping"" debacle.

2017-12-13,0,0,409,True,Not Recommended,I want to like this game. I want to request this game. The overal appeal and feel of the game is great. That is when it works. The biggest issue with PUBG as it stands and what keeps it from being a recomandation from me is the servers. With so many people buying and playing the early acess version you would think that the dev team would begin taking steps to correct the rubber banding the bullets that you shoot and see make contact but never do damage because the other players didnt register it. In a game that when we boil it down comes to reflexes accuracy and how quickly you can process information its the death of it. Its not a game of RNG when it comes to what equipment you get its a game that you have to hope the server is also in your favor.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-13,0,0,227,True,Recommended,could be better,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-10-13,0,0,301,True,Not Recommended,PlayerUnknowns Battlegrounds has come a long way from what it began as. There have been new guns added bettter optimization a new map among many other things. The devs seem to be striving to improve the optimization even further which is something nobody can really complain about however there are some other issues i still have with this game. The first thing is the net code. The netcode in PUBG is atrocious in comparison to bigger titles like Battlefield 1 and call of duty. This is very frustrating as the early game can be a laggy mess and it discourages players from landing in areas like the military base school po i etc. This is something BLUEHOLE needs to be working on. Another issue is the game is very unstable. Time and time again the game will crash during a match or the worst case scenario a gun fight. This gets very irritating as it happens far too often and it ruins the experience. Something that isn't really directly in the game but still affecting it is the PUBG Invitational Dreamhack coming soon and the other tournament based matches. The reality of these tournaments is they make the game look even more aweful than it already is. The spectating system needs an extreme aamount of fine tuning which is something we don't need right now. The devs need to work on enhancing the experience for the players not these stupid tournaments that chew up development time. The Invitational was enough it showed how much they needed to work on improving the game not throwing out more and more events. My final issue is how a match is played out. The early game like said earlier is a laggy mess but there are many other issues as well. An example of this is how slow the first zone moves. It feels like an eternity between the first zone and the second zone. The pacing is far too slow making the game far less immersive. The late game is the only time where you might start breaking a cold sweat which is not good at all. Players should be on the edge most of the time its a battle royal after all. To conclude Playerunknown's Battlegrounds still has a very long way to go before its smooth and well optimized. So if you feel like grabbing the game make sure your PC can handle the game in its current state. Also make sure your well aware of the bugginess and spaghetti net code in the game right now. I reccommend players should buy this game only when the 1.0 release comes out if they want a better experience off the top. So don't buy this game in its current state.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-21,0,0,327,False,Recommended,Do not try and run this on a toaster. Yes it has further optomisations to come but what game doesn't.? Ive had two crashes in 8 months. Game runs fine and more so with recent updates.Playing locally on the new FPP solo mode on OCE is brilliant. I get sub 30ms pings to Sydney servers and the game runs so well its not funny. Cheating is an issue they have been addressing and the recent announcement that they will be trialling the 'ping lock' method is great news. This means less access to those from distant lands and games more populated with players in a similar ping range i.e. LOCAL players this will be a good thing. It will help the netcode thoughput for all in game and also reduce the possibilitiy of the overtly active Chinese based cheaters from joining Aussie servers. Fingers crossed. So if you have a decent modern rig with a bit of grunt (SSD drives area good idea too) and a good internet connection you are getting a great game for $30 clams.

2017-07-02,0,0,275,True,Recommended,Example I think PUBG is the best battle royal game you can play right now. It is not without its problems though hence Early Access Game. So basically stop complaining on a game that isnt finished yet. pros It is very fun. The gunplay feels great and the tension you get at endgame is unlike anything else. I love the variety of weapons as well. Vaulting in PTR is probably the best game play you can get hope it comes out soon.Lootcrates dont give player advanteges which is a plus its all strickly cosmetic.the pay for crates was to fund PUBG tournament.Massive community with lots of great people to play with.Constant updates especially in the PTR. cons 30 dollars is a bit much for an early access imoDevs have an unfortunate policy of banning for stream sniping even with lackluster proof. This is unfair to say least. People have been banned with no knowledge of the streamer they were sniping . Even if they did this isn t really something the devs should be responsible for imo. Optimization is a bit rough. It does run better in the ptr but in the main branch of the game I get around 20 40 fps with my (cpu and gpu and settings). I get around 60 to 100 in the ptr though so this will probably change. and buildings not loading in which is caused by veiw distance breaking.server lag yes this dose happen sometimes specailly when large amount of people landing in same area. (dosnt allways happen to me)A bit more of my thoughts Fortnite yes its free optimized nice dosnt have the same feel as PUBG seems way to silly and cartoony. I would like the mention that optimization isn t as bad as people make it out to be. I get 60 100 fps in the ptr which will be rolled out soon enough. Porting to Xbox one thoughts well the game isn't finished yet so I don't know why they chose that I hope they fix a lot of performance issues on it if so. Hackers/cheaters iv seen them constantly banning cheating/hacking on the servers so they are doing something. I hear they're adding a new anti cheats every major update. So that isnt to bad isnt it? last anti cheat banned 24000 people for using speed hacks and aimbots so it dose work.(just my opinion)The devs are doing a great impression of someway wanting the themselves though. They have silly rules regarding streamers which I am not a fan of and i think the money is getting to there heads plz dont become the new EA.Most rounds I just like fudging around cause I don't play seriously lol. like Hitman challenge I cannot overstate how fun this game is. The gunplay is great the community is huge and growing and the tension is second to none in endgame. the game has high replayability. This game is something special and i have high hope for it to do well in the future. One great game moment is when we wiped an entire squad by shooting there car to much and all died in firey explosion. Final final thoughts I would recommend this game only if you have a bunch of freinds to play with cause why not its allways better to play with others D wouldn't recommend for the price tag till full release. (steam did have a sale in fall so was alot cheaper)Basically this is balanced review has its pros and its cons. Sunk 250hours into the game so im quite happy with the review iv given.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-10-21,0,0,385,False,Not Recommended,I've played this game for over a three hundred hours at this point and within the last few months I've run into cheaters on a concistent level beyond the realms of CSGO and other popular games cheaters frequent. I mean three to four games in a row level of cheating. '99%' of my public matches level of incompetence and it's become absolutely ridiculous at this point.I don't write many reviews as you can see from my public profile and I wish this was an exageration but quite frankly I don't think I could sink anymore time into this game whether it'd be casually or competitively without feeling like it's completely in vain. How a game with (3 million) concurrent players can suffer from such a blatant rampant unsavory predicament is beyond me and I fail to see the benefits of such behavior in your game. I haven't experienced cheaters at this magnitude since Counter Strike Source... Beyond the excessive cheater dilemma there are just large unresolved server wide issues still present in the game and it has become apparent to me and many others that players from the other side of the globe not only ruins the smooth gaming experience (If you could really call it anything near at this point.) the game is trying to offer on it's official release but completely renders this game unplayable at any competitive level in the foreseeable future. The net code is an absolute mess and I cannot see this game returning to my library of games if these issues persist throughout its future updates and versions of the game's release. Like many others I gave PUBG the benefit of the doubt with their pre release early access game releases but seeing as the game has been launched for about a month now and has officially released on other platforms I do not understand how these issues are so prevalent amoungst EVERY possible facet this game tries to offer its player base. The faulty net code and faulty matchmaking system with inconsistent gameplay and hit registration could be managed and can warrant some level of playability at a casual level sure. But this level of egregious blantant cheating is beyond a dilemma at this point and should be top priority to any company small or large to eradicate from their game's official servers immidiately without hesitation but I continue to feel the need to update my review every couple of months to ensure players that this issue &gt &gt HAS NOT GOTTEN BETTER &lt &lt but worse in fact.Currently at this state in early access and now on official 1.0 release this game remains unplayable and I refuse to re install this game until I see documentation and publication that there is action being taken in these parts of the game (outlined above.) and the neglect our complaints have received over the last few months are dealt with properly.This is coming from someone who is in the top 3% in North America currently on both solo and squad playlists. This is unacceptable and I'm embarrassed this game has become such a P.C gaming phenomenon at its current and continuing state. If these problems persist any longer this game will have without a doubt a short lived negligible success and an unlikely future. hollow,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-05,0,0,190,True,Not Recommended,"Early access bla bla game is due to change bla bla... My review is early access too is due to change when released. Considering the developer has been doing this battleroyale mode mods / games for a long time I don't forgive game mechanic failures as ""early access"". This game is all about luck. Everything inside is RNG and that is ed up. Looting You may be searching 10 houses and not find anything else than a pistol and shotgun while the other guy finds m16 ak47 with good scopes best protection gear first 2 3 house he enters. (and this can happen at same house in the same spot of the map not like he goes to a military base or some sort of thing)Gunplay Gun handling and recoil is pure RNG too... you maybe full auto shooting 30 bullets to 10 feet distance and not get more than 2 bullet hit while the other guy sprays same gun same distance same style and get 15 out of 30 bullets hit you. Because in every bullet there is RNG modifier for recoil which gets pretty ed up after the first bullet. (""shoot / wait / shoot so you land every shot noob"" ? yea tell that to the guy who sprays you 10 feet distance and insta kills you before you can even land the 2nd bullet) some say people use no recoil hacks... I don't want to sound like cry baby but yes I saw quite a lot of hackers they exist...Battleroyale experience Map is way too big and there is so little time between zone restriction circle. If you cant find a car &amp RNG decides to make you walk to the otherside of the world.. just quit.. game becomes very annoying running simulator. Forcing you to run for 15 20 minutes doing nothing but sprinting &amp trying to heal. Probably will be killed while trying to run too since you are obvious target while rushing. Tactics &amp fun is non existent when you are forced to run non stop for whole match. Oh and yes the circle comes like 3 4x faster than your running speed so before you even reach to safety it starts moving to even further leaving you in constant death zone goodluck with that.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-10-03,0,0,179,False,Not Recommended,Ok look so i've played a bunch of hours on this and likely will continue because it's nice to get steam credit for selling crates but like HOLY The biggest issue in this game is literally just the ineptitude of the developers now. I get that yes it is hard to make a game where everyone is kept happy and is treated fairly but the big problem that the game is facing is a huge influx of cheaters (mostly chinese) flooding every single server and game. There have been suggestions for a region lock and yes that is the best idea. There is no reason for every day to have 70% of my games on the OCE server in squad to have 2+ teammates who only speak chinese and are killing dudes through walls.TLDR game's alright devs are being ing stupid,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The best experience I had is with friends.But yeah you totally need a good CPU and Graphics Card.I play this game on ""high"" about 90 30 Frames. So there are massive drops sometimes.So if you are in citys or houses everything will be fine. But open fild with a lot is going on and fast movement your FPS will drop. And yeah 30 Frames are still OKAY. But the drops make it hard sometimes to aim etc.Also a few glitches happens every now and then. But yeah it is an alpha.We already saw some cheaters and hackers unfortunately and weird stuff happens sometimes.Like you hit the enemy already 8 times and they are still fine. But they only need one shoot to kill you etc.Sometimes I don't even know where they are shooting from etc. (maybe I'm just to bad in it.)Overall I love to play that game with my friends and had some good time.

Fortnite was also made on unreal engine and they juz proved that their baby game is still more smooth and lag free compared to this I was just wondering How of programmers are u guys? My PC is giving me 100 120 fps in this game while it could provide me a solid 120 games such as Far Cry 4.

2017-10-08,0,0,48,True,Recommended,Well a little under four hours in and it is a blast. Great gameplay and the tension is fantastic. The initial race for gear and weapons while trying to avoid the 99 other players dropping in with you is insane! The only things I would like to see a quick improvement on is the movement. It is a bit clunky but nothing bad enough to ruin the experience. Some of the interactions are a bit delayed or sensitive to where you are aiming (doors etc..) The weapons are great. Joining as a squad is easy. Weather is amazing.

On top of that it tends to be very buggy and glitchy even on high performance computers.

2017-08-28,0,0,97,True,Not Recommended,"PUBG is a game that I've played quite a bit of and I've enjoyed almost all of what I've played. But the problem is almost all of that enjoyment has come from playing with friends. Solo this is one of the worst multiplayer games I've played. Weapons I've realized after playing for a while that there is really not that much variety in weapons. Basically you can use either a shotgun (which are all the same) an assault rifle (which are all the same) or a sniper rifle (which to be fair actually have variances in feel between the 3 available). There are technically also pistols melee weapons smg's and a crossbow but they're all useless. Melee is broken pistols do nothing the crossbow is just like a sniper rifle that can't use a good scope and smg's are just worse assault rifles. ""But"" I hear you asking ""what if you can't find a good gun then you could use one of those."" No. If you land in an area with more than 1 house 9 times out of 10 you'll find at least a rifle and a shotgun. Speaking of which there isn't really ever a reason to use anything other than 1 shotgun and 1 sniper or if you can't find one an AR. Loot The loot system is more than anything frustrating. Most of any given game will turn into looking through houses to find the 1 or 2 pieces of usable loot per house. A gun here some meds there maybe you get lucky and get that elusive level 3 helmet or vest but it's never exciting because you know that by the end of the game your loot's probably going to be the exact same as it always is give or take a few meds that you won't need because you already hgave so many. The game just throws loot at you to the point that you will always have everything as long as you don't die within the first 3 or 4 minutes. The only real difference from game to game is your scopes. To the game's credit scopes can make a huge difference and are relatively rare. If you get near the end and you have a x8 scope and the other team only has a x4 you'll have a big advantage.Combat Like I said earlier melee combat is completely broken. If you land near somebody it will every time turn into both of you jumping around hitting each other hoping that you get lucky and your hits actually register. In actual gunfights this is much better but the problem is that if you're only in solos you'll rarely actually have these. Most games in solos and many games in duos end with you getting shot from someone you can't see and dying before you can tell where they are. Only in squads where you have 3 or preferably 4 pairs of eyes to look will you get into full fledged coordinated fights. On the plus side shooting is the one thing in this game that actually feels smooth and responsive. Also as much as I'm painting a picture of the game being all luck there are still always a decent amount of head on shootouts in most games. And when you're in squads the gunplay and fights are as much fun as you'll ever have in a game.General Complaints The game is incredibly clunky. Every single thing you do other than shooting feels like it should feel better to do. Especially noteworthy are parachuting down jumping driving moving and looting. These things happpen to encompass most of the game. Which brings me to the core problem of the game you don't really do anything most of the time. This is the biggest reason you need friends to play with for the game to be any good because if you don't the game will just be one big slog where you're running on autopillot until you see another person. You drop down look for a gun kill anyone near you once you find one continue looking for scopes and armor and meds go to wherever the zone goes and then repeat steps 3 and 4 until there are less than 10 people left and the zone's small. At that point it's a toss up wether you'll have a super fun intense few minutes while you fight to the death or you'll get shot in the back of the head by a sniper rifle and die before you can do anything. Overall I'd say only buy this game if you have good friends who you are 100% sure you can and will play with for a while.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-02,0,0,328,True,Not Recommended,Me and my friend have quit playing this game for two reasons. Two main reasons that the developers fail to address.1. Big performance issues. With top spec PCs this game gets you 40 50 fps when it should give you 100 fps. It also rubberbands like hell to the point of it being frustrating and feeling just like a weekend project instead of a game with 2 million daily players.2. Hackers. Cheaters are a big issue in this game. Speed hacks wall hacking and more. 1 in every 2 games has a cheater.We wait for 1.0.

2017-10-09,0,0,343,True,Recommended,The basics are deceptively simple but there s a level of mastery that can be attained in PUBG and I can t write that off. The more I play the more I appreciate the depth of the game. It s exhilarating to pick off an enemy running across a field and it s terrifying to be that person running across the field. There are a million different scenarios similar to this that unfold in every match of PUBG.For a game that s still in Alpha it s almost a pleasant surprise that server stability is one of the biggest issues facing the game. Desync is a bigger killer than any gun. Servers and netcode can be upgraded and improved thankfully. It s a pity that players have to butt heads with uncooperate internet tubes but Bluehole Studios have made an immersive and energizing game that improves upon nearly every aspect of the budding survival arena genre. 9/10,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-01-07,0,0,193,False,Recommended,Don't get me wrong I love this game but now with 50% percent of the playerbase being from China and 99% of hackers being from China also it just makes for a very random experience. Chinese players of course have very high ping and so gunfights with them tend to leave you more wounded than you should be or just flat out dead because theyre ing hard to shoot jittering all over the place. And the hakcers.... . Me. Sideways. It's infuriating for a game that takes so long to get into you can die so quickly. Your speediest deaths are almost guaranteed to be from a hacker whether this is someone who can see you approaching through a wall or has absolutely ZERO recoil you're going to get ed and its going to make you gape. Despite all this negativity PUBG is a great game and a ton of fun can be had with China looking to get it's own dedicated server most hackers will be gone and so will any laggy opponents give it a go. 10/10tldr ch1nks lag and hacking they'll be gone soon games still fun as,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-04-20,0,0,158,False,Not Recommended,"Product received for free. Update (Mild Language) This game has become trash once it improves I will remove this &amp revert my review back to its original state. My one message to the devs is try and actually IMPROVE the game instead of SUING other companies! LIKE COME ON ITS BEEN 14 PATCHES SINCE 1.0 AND NOW YOU FINALLY DECIDE TO OPTIMIZE THE GAME AFTER MESSING WITH EVERY WEAPON AND ADDING A MAP THAT NO ONE REALLY ASKED FOR LIKE COME ON BLUEHOLE GET YOUR TOGETHER! Breif Overview ""No matter how much I try &amp hate this game I always come back.""That is a recent statement I made when talking about PUBG for non players this game may seem insane as most people are playing it but dont let this fool you. I may have 80 hours in the game making it like the 3rd most played game on my account but that doesnt mean I enjoy it. Far from it most times. This game is complete t half the time getting shot from across a hill by a player who may be a bush but your not sure because every cluster of pixels looks like one. Then again it has its moments where it shines so brightly you can help but press search because you have a ""good feeling about this one"" or something so funny so random just happened you cant help but recreate it. These are the reasons I made that statement because this game is a mixed bag. Sometimes its great &amp other times its a 50 tonne wrecking ball smashing through your hope in humanity. Graphics They're ok. They are not great but they certainly aren't unity level crap. The higher graphics settings add antialiasing which all games have it just smooths pixels and improve more lighting effects such as SSAO/HBAO (Ambient Occlusion) but even then you still need a pc thats permanently pumped with steroids just to run the game at this slight graphical improvement.Texture wise I really see no difference between each level except above medium takes my fps to a steady cinematic 24. This being said you really dont look at the textures all that much during gameplay due to the insane concerntration to every little sound or pixel around you. The only time I really notice these textures is when looking at my guns even then its mostly when aiming. Performance This really is where PUBG goes into a league of its own I genuinly do not think I have played such an unoptimised game. Honestly patch #1.0 was meant to bring optimisation and really it didnt. What brought optimisation for me was a well timed christmas present of a GPU from myself to myself. Even then my GT 1030 (yes its a budget card and yes for it being entry level its pretty decent) even then my card still cant play it steadily granted its nowhere near my AMD HD 6570 but even so its still shockingly bad especially since Fortnite runs on the same engine and is 100 times more optimised. Gameplay ""Is that a player or a bush?""Jokes aside the gameplay is stellar you're dropped onto either an ex soviet era island with 100 players or a Btec desert with a few houses massive open areas &amp 100 other people. This makes for exciting matches honestly I dont believe how much I enjoy this game. Im not really one for PvP etc but this game has had me hooked for months. The first game is always rough for me but then on my second or thrid match I kinda come into my element usually ranking 10th 15th now by no means is this ""good"" but its a real sense of acheivement to know that 90 85 other players have died for you to get to where you are.The blue zones are good not much to say because they are simple. It really is as easy as moving from one zone to another to stop you from dying. Red zones are simillar if you're caught in one just walk away from it you really shouldnt die in a red zone they're more there for aesthetic reasons such as audio cover and being cool to look at than to wipe you out.My main tip gameplay wise is be attentive &amp always check a distant bush twice. Final Verdict Very enjoyable whilst staying very dislikable. 27 is quite a lot of money (idk about your currency) but honestly its a worthy investment. Not only can crates help to make that money back the game is just fun because it has the right amount of edge and thrill and action to keep you hooked. And because of that I am writting this review to hopefully entice some more new players like me.So yea final verdict Enjoyable whilst staying easy to dislike but never become bored of due to its sporadic gameplay &amp attributes. (ps if you liked this pls drop a like or what ever the rating system is here &amp I hope this was helpful)",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-05-05,0,0,61,False,Not Recommended,If I go to school at least I'll be getting shot by something I can see.Joke review aside this is a pretty good game with active developers. Cheating is not much of a problem at all anymore and the developers are actively working on cutting it down even more. Just this week 15 arrests of hack developers were confirmed by the game developers.The first thing you do in this game is drop from a plane which flies in a randomly placed straight line on the map. You can either drop in the middle of nowhere and have less items to pick up or right in the middle of a city and have more items to pick up. Those items are typically better so there will be several people also dropping there who are willing to fight you over them.You also have vehicles gun attachments and gear to wear. Vehicles include motorcycles vans trucks and cars. They will protect you and help you get to places faster but they are also loud and can flip over if you're a dumb driver. Gun attachments will improve your gun's stats and will also include scopes and sights which don't directly improve the gun's visible stats but will improve your aim. Wearable gear will protect you and increase your carrying capacity.You may play in solo duos or squads. Voice chat is your only form of communication with other players on your team and text chat does not exist. You will only play with people using your preferred perspective which can be TPP or FPP.Finally there are three circles in this game red white and blue. Blue will slowly consume the entire map and slowly kill you and white is where it will stop for the time being. Always be travelling to the white as to avoid being killed by the blue. Vehicles are the only things faster than the blue zone. You will be given notifications and warnings of when the blue will start consuming the map again. The red zone indicates that explosives are dropping in the area and the only way to not be killed by them is to either leave the red zone or get inside of a building.That's what this game is. If I have missed anything please comment on my review and let me know so I can add it.EDIT I'm going to go all YELP on this review and unrecommend it. This is NOT something I would usually do as I usually base my reviews on whether or not I'd actually recommend it. I **do** recommend it but I feel that sending this game's score down is the only way to get Bluehole to actually listen to the community about this one issue bugs. We need improved netcode and optimization rather than more crates. They **are** working on this but it never seemed to be their top priority as it should be. This new update worsened things and now it feels *literally unplayable*.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2018-05-07,0,0,124,False,Recommended,Had a lot of potential and promise early but the games meteoric rise in popularity clouded the devs eyes with dollar signs and they havent in over a year fixed a single one of the glaring bugs and problems that were in present in extreme alpha. If you get out of a vehicle going even 1mph you almost die and the movement is clunky and not fluid at all. Also no region locking leads to swarms of 2 300 ping players lagging all over the place in an already pathetically coded game to begin with. If you can get past that which lets be honest you kind of have to with the current options on the market its a decently fun game with friends.

2018-01-21,0,0,552,False,Not Recommended,I have very mixed feelings about this game. The concept is great gameplay gets better with every update but there are some HUGE issues some of them are deal breakers. First of all shooting you have to randomly think if your ping is ok if yes then at target if not then shoot 2m before/after target... Cheaters? A TON and they don't do anything with them. You spend 20 minutes playing top 10 then get aimbot headshot from behind a stone without LoS great. Idiotic grass you zoom in having clear view grass in your scope can't see anything. Sound is all wrong on stereo can't EVER hear from where the car is coming from. The game would be great if it were a finished product not what it's now.Edit Added over 100 hours of gameplay review along about 2 patches The game is gettiing even worse. There is a huge desync between players IN THE SAME GAME. Where you shoot them and miss (regardless of seeing your aim on their head) and then hide behind a rock to die of a headshot while already being hidden. Sound is still a huge issue but guess what they added weather (again). Doesn't matter than it's screwed up they added it. So when it rains you can't hear when it's sunset you can't see Game is about 60% running 20% loading and waiting for a full minute with 100 other people and 15% looting and about 5% of real tactics and fighting. Loot and vehicle spawn is ridiculous. Can't find a backpack for half of the game caus eyou picked the wrong house apparently. Landed in the south side of the map? Great all vehicles are in the norht side now you have to run there for about 5 minutes.Fun fact you can't mute people in your team when in a random team. So you get idiots yelling full volume and the only thing to do is turn off the chat itself smart.Another game where devs focus more on getting money from idiotic lootboxes than on actually getting the game in shape. Strongly advise against buying this.EDIT A guy just shot me THORUGH a tree (which normally block shots). This game is ing utter,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

In another match I was shooting at someone who got out of a car and it seems that none of my bullets hit him and afterwards he magically dies to a gunshot and there was no notification that he had died on the upper right corner.

2017-12-30,0,0,16,False,Not Recommended,Not a fun game. The game consists of either being able to see people ever or see 20 people all with weapons and scopes you don't have. Not a fun solo game to play. Groups with friends is the only way to enjoy the game. There are plenty of bullets that never hit disconnecting and horrible optimization. RNG decides whether you win or lose every single game..Other than that it is just like sitting in a chatroom with friends. Not really much going on for most of the game. I suggest looking up some conversation starters to keep the chatroom fun and lighthearted. One thing I have tried is to name the cars that appear on the maps the driving is BY FAR the funnest thing in the game. PUBG does a great job at making a car simulator with a little work could be considered average. My names for the hippy van is Bertha the car is Klaus the dune buggy is Darryl the boat is Angus.Don't buy this game this ain't fun.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-12-30,0,0,560,False,Not Recommended,"Overall Rating 6.5/10Overall I think it is fun but I think it is also very frustrating. I don't know if Bluehole intentionally design this game to be a camper fest but that is what it is right now. The game rewards players very significantly for camping and is strongly reinforced in core gameplay. At this point in time I think most people or those who are already interested in the game know how the genre battle royale works and so I will skip over explaining those details. The general consensus of how players play ultimately rip the ""fun"" out of the game. Other players avoid fights in order to survive (makes sense but follow me here) so they usually hide and run away at the first contact of a fight. These players march on from circle to circle avoiding any gun battles. For a shooter game I feel the core gameplay is more like island adventure where you skip from house to house rather than exciting gun fights which provide an enjoyable gaming experience. Players value winning over everything else rather than having fun at least in the region I player in is like that (NA region). Another point I'd like to come across are the air drop crates. These crates seem to have items that I feel are unusuable at times. For a crate that comes with ""supplies"" I feel would come with more quanity of medics. The only time I am comfortable with trekking for these crates are usually when I already am geared and go there picking fights rather than getting the drop. The drop is generally a added bonus to the murder spree that entails it. So this brings me to my next point why this game is a camp fest. These drops that incentivize players into not camping do not reward players enough to go for them. It contains a gun possibly a one or even a gun you cannot use because of ammo restriction i.e. you are carrying an M4 and Mini14 and it drops a Groza with like 60 bullets. Alright? Not a good option to really take it and note that this is after a deadly gun fight with others seeking this same drop. I often feel not rewarded for winning these fights and at times I may not even have an opportunity to loot the others I have killed due to circle restriction or just the danger of even looting them to preying eyes. So I go on my merry way leaving the drop with LESS supplies than I came with. Over time after contesting many drops I've come to the conclusion that the only time I ever go to drops are not for the supplies in the drop but to pick off kills or pick a fight with other players because the match became stagnant and I cannot find a single soul to fight. A third point I'd like to make is the red zone. Why is this here? PUBG developers have little to say about this ""feature"" and only made a mark saying that the red zone is random. Other players seem to suggest that it is NOT random and may hint that a player is in the area. Some may argue that this mechanic in the game forces player out of camping but does it really? Personally I think it reinforces the need to stay in building or basically camping. The only place you are guaranteed safe from the red zone are in buildings or just out of it. However if you are running (no vehicle) and the red zone spawns on top of you what are you chances? You basically just sprint out of it or to the closest building in hopes it doesn't blow you up. This mechanic reinforces the need to stay indoors and camp. Even in PUBG tournaments Bluehole hosted tournaments as well the red zone is turned off. They turned it off because they know it reinforces camping and they want the gameplay to be more action pack to make the stream more enjoyable to watch but if you watch PUBG tournament and most notoriously the Gamescon Invitation Tournament you can see that even in higher level player it's just a camp fest. Yes this is realistic. Yes this makes sense. BUT! This is a video game and overall I don't care if I win. This shouldn't be an esport title. It should be played to have fun and I really don't care if I die often as long as it's fun. But too many of my games the only fights I get into are at the first drop in major areas or the fights that I painstakingly roam the map to find. So Bluehole I hope that you aren't intentionally making this game a camp fest to feed it's realism which I feel you may be and I hope that you see my perspective and try to make the game more fun rather than more realistic. I do have plenty of suggestions on how I believe you can change game design to make it less camperish and I look forward to future updates.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-12-30,0,0,92,False,Recommended,this must be the best game i've ever played but there is one problem... First of all this game is very intense especially when you are in the top 5 and you got a whole squad of people shooting at you (like if this happened to you).

The game runs very well on high end machines dont listen to all the whiners on console priced PC's.. If you have money and a good rig you will love the game if you enjoy this play style..If you have a great PC like I do then the game actually plays surprisingly well ! I have had 1 crash in 100+ hours of game time and hardly any in game glitches nor lag. Now on to the good stuff heart pounding action with nice feeling weapons and a fantastic variety of attachements.

2017-07-26,0,0,264,True,Not Recommended,"The developers recently announced that they are introducing marketable microtransactions and DLC in the game during early access despite prior promises not to do so. Given that they have not finished developing the core game they should not be busy putting bilking more money from their customers over actually finishing the core game. Their claim is that the revenue generated from the microtransactions will be used to help things like development costs and tournament hosting but given that this is a game that players already paid to play and millions of dollars at that this argument doesn't float. This sort of thing is only acceptable in free to play games that do not have an initial point of sale to generate revenue. In addition though these items are ""cosmetic"" in nature I feel the need to remind folks that in highly competitive games like this any potential camouflage is NOT cosmetic it's pay to win. In summary I cannot possibly reccomend this game to anyone as the developers have shown that they have more interest in generating addional revenue over finishing their product. If you have bought this recently I strongly advise that you request a refund.(Update Oh yeah their ban policies are ridiculous as well.

Oh you want to duo with a random teammate? Great idea! Here is your teammate! Good luck!Teammate Degenerate can't aim doesn't know how to speak English makes the whole situation cringey whenever you need to communicate whenever you are getting shot at or anything else that requires you to speak to one another.You A decent player not the best aimer but at least you know where to aim. Knows how to speak English is not cringey whatsoever.And then your opponents All they literally do is camp behind a stupid tree for 2 3 minutes waiting for someone to pass by oh look! The one that is passing by just happens to be you! And you don't suspect a random person to be behind a tree out in the abyss of nowhere to pop up and shoot at you? No you don't.All your time effort sprinting carrying all of your sweet items that you've gathered from so many different places ruined. By what? A random camping person behind a tree.Now this is just in game stuff don't mention the optimization this game has it's horrible. I have a good PC some of the latest parts that are out there on the market. The good stuff basically.I get actual horse radish 45 55 FPS on VERY LOW LOW Settings. I thought perhaps it's my PC being bad? So I looked up some other people on YouTube with almost the same PC as me and they also get the same FPS problem as me. So does streamers not to mention relatively famous streamers.And if you look for yourself incase you don't believe me the first key searches on YouTube or even Google when you search for ''PUBG How'' this is what's going to come up ''pubg how to increase fps''Oh and by the way the servers are pretty horse radish.

2017-12-07,0,0,37,True,Not Recommended,Game is fun and has a great concept behind it. It will be hard to find many people that disagree with that. That said the game is ed almost unplayable and i say this because in a shooter you require bullets to always hit their target and register. Not hit blood splatter and person take no damage (I ve emptied full clips and nothing also hit a people in the head with/without helmets multiple times and nothing). It has many performance issues which render it almost unplayable the game suffers major flaws bullets not registering constant drop outs desync glitches and more.I played it with the hope that the devs would eventually fix the issues that the game has. It has been quite a long time now. I keep seeing more and more content added yet none of the major bug fixes. You can read this and think that there are some people saying it's fine and performance isn't an issue. From my understanding these people are little fan boys that need to pull their head out of their Yes the devs post they have fixed bugs but with the money they have made any decent dev team who actually cared would have completely overhauled the code they used and developed a game worthy of the concept they have come up with. If you want to spend your money on a game that is far from finished and let s be honest will probably never be finished go ahead. But if you're having doubts then by all means go and buy something else that is proven to be good. This game still needs huge amounts of work but that goes with any game in early development. The reason I m giving this a negative review is because the devs continue to put hours of work into adding useless content to try and suck in more innocent people rather than actually fix what is wrong with the game. Devs should not betray their supporters they need to show appreciation by eliminating issues that cause bad gameplay rather than continually add content to a game which already has more than enough content for an early release. If the game runs there are a variety of items and in this case one working game mode that should suffice for testing purposes and devs should focus on making the game more playable/reliable. Obviously this wasn t the case with battlegrounds. What makes this even worse is there is a bunch of previously mentioned fan boys defending the game and its screwed up coding. They are saying things like It s expect of a game in early access or Devs are busy working on it or The game works fine for me . S the game doesn t run fine for anyone. Go watch live streamers and you will see at least one glitch every game. Stop defending a company that is robbing its supporters!TL DR in current state put simply the game is ed . Spend your money on something else. In the future this game might have all of its glitches fixed but I highly doubt it based on how the devs want to spend resources.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

If you're looking for a completely finished game and aren't interested in random annoying bugs that sometimes may end a match for you then I would wait until it is fully released. I have some hope for the game its a great battle royale game and the best out imo. But early access is still a scary thing so beware. If you were into DayZ and are thirsting for a game like it I highly recommend it.

I recommend the DUO Mode because there you have just one mate and it's mostly guaranteed that you find nice waepons and armour if you pick a good place to land with your chute. All in all I can say that every mode in this game makes fun and the switch between FPP and TPP is the best variety a game can have. So even if you don't like FPP or TPP there is basically a mode wich is designed for you.If you buy this game make sure not to rage in the first rounds and keep playing to get your first ""chicken dinner"". 9/10 Points",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Also you do need a pretty fast computer to run the game otherwise you'd have a higher chance of crashing right as the game starts.Overall I definitely reccomend this game to everyone. It's addicting and it just gets better by the updates coming in.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-07-28,0,0,3,True,Recommended,Devs clearly care about this game and are doing early access the right way. This is a super fun battle royale style game. There's no waiting to join a game you press queue and you're in. Then you and 98 other players get dropped a large island littered with loot and weapons that you then collect and shoot each other with. It's very tactical and the gun play is fairly realistic (without being tiresome and annoying with the realism). It's a fantastic game and there's a reason why it's so popular right now.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-07-28,0,0,9,True,Recommended,Ugh this game. I love it I suck at it hardcore but I love it. PUBG is a simple battle royal style game where you just need to kill other people and survive to number one. Easy? Not at all. You winning is as hard as It comes and even the game is against you initially.It's not well optimized it isn't. It's better now than it was before (much better) but at first I had to do a lot of googling and sleuthing to even get it to run without severe sound glitches and screen tearing. Hopefully further patches will save people that time in the future.Gameplay is fun and tense from the very start all the way to the last second and every move matters. You never know who's posting up in a house or behind a tree so observance is key. I suck at this so I suck at this game. You need good eyes.I would reccomend it 100% well worth the money and entertaining despite performance issues. Had some great moments in the small time I've played.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-01-01,0,0,274,False,Not Recommended,New Review I had an incredible amount of fun with this game for quite a while. I loved the tactics the challenge and that delicious chicken dinner. Yeah there were bugs but it was in Early Access. Then it was fully released and it got worse. The devs spent all their time on eSports and cosmetics instead of improving the core of a really fun game. Then even the cosmetics would expire! I bought the Sanhok pass only to find out the jacket I unlocked lasted for 3 weeks. This game is just squandered potential now. It could've been great but it'll just end up being the game we all thank for kicking off the Battle Royale craze rather than the champion of it.Old Positive Review from a year ago One of the more tense and tactical squad games I've ever played. There's nothing like trying to take a building from another squad with your friends or trying to defend a house you're setting up in for a few minutes. Sure it's got some bugs. And yes some people love to cheat. But neither of those are prevalent enough to affect most players. I've only come across two suspected cheaters in almost 200 hours of gameplay and with the new death cam and built in reporting tools it's getting better.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-12,0,0,499,True,Recommended,"It's a good game good that's it. The Devs know less than Jon Snow on the feedback from the ""Community"" and have made the game purely a RNG style game so you don't have to have Skill to play. However that screws EVERYONE else over. ""PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS is a last man standing shooter being developed with community feedback. Players must fight to locate weapons and supplies in a massive 8x8 km island to be the lone survivor. This is BATTLE ROYALE."" No this is NOT battle royal and No you don't have to fight for loot you can if you want but it will probably spawn in right near you Skill or no Skill you too can win unless you have Skill forgot about Skill not being a factor like a real shooter game where it is Skill based. I will still recommend this game for the simple fact that it is good and could potentially be better.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-08-12,0,0,51,True,Recommended,Having a blast so far some people don't like the recent updates but I thorougly enjoy the amount of care the developers give this game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-06-01,0,0,254,True,Not Recommended,Nvidia geforce GTX 860 intel i7 8 gb ram. Can't run the game even though the requirements are lower. The few times it did run before nearly setting my PC on fire though were solid just gotta wait for optimization updates.EditPeople are being banned because the developers won't or haven't yet fixed bugs that are well known. For instance if you kill someone who is experiencing the issue where buildings have not yet rendered you will be banned permanently from the game.Video games are not just a mode of entertainment nowadays it's part of our culture. Friends and family play video games together it's become commonplace and even replaced card or board game nights in many family units. The Developer thinks they can just effectively and permanently remove people from a very trending video game because of bugs they should be fixing? No.This is getting out of hand. There needs to be a union where gamers stand against this BS I and many others are tired of being treated like wallet waiting to be emptied by these fools who think they can throw whomever they please to the sidewalk and continue on without implication. PubG I cannot recommend to anyone until I am certain that justice is done PROPER and not SWIFTLY.It's starting to look like a cash grab game the developer is showing signs that many other Early Access titles have of preparing abandonment and callous disregard to it's community.When something becomes successful others will look to it and see how it succeeded. This attitude is not acceptable and this practice is already becoming a norm if it is not stopped here and now then it will become the norm. Many of us are already treated like garbage because we are not wealthy in the workplace and sometimes at home. Let's not allow this to continue.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-08-12,0,0,99,True,Recommended,PUBG is a great model for early access games but it's not without flaws. The shooter mechanics in the game are fun and incredibly rewarding wandering around can range from a snooze fest to hair raising firefights and the diversity of weaponry puts this game one bar over H1Z1 in my opinion. However the game has a laundry list of bugs and glitches as well as performance related issues. Buildings not rendering Dacias falling through bridges server lag among a few others that I've experienced. One of the minor annoyances I've experienced is the BattleEye client not closing after exiting the game. No real issue there just Task Manager it and move on. My biggest issue is the game not updating properly and the only solution I've found is reinstalling it which can be a real pain when I just want to hop on with friends. Everything considered it's a great game. I feel like the devs could be a bit less Nazi about their code of conduct but oh well. Once the bugs are all buffed out and streamers aren't banned for a combination of vehicle manslaughter and game breaking bugs I'm sure this game will be a model for EA. 8/10 would recommend ),PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-12,0,0,32,True,Not Recommended,I've been trying to like this game a lot of my friends are playing and it continues to rise on the charts but every time I walk away from it I hate myself for wasting my time.It's not an enjoyable world to play in. Movement is jenky and takes a lot of getting used to. The weight of your character makes it hard to do otherwise simple things like run through a doorway or down a narrow hallway. A lot is done in the spirit of simulation that directly opposes fun. Stand next to a window and your gun shoots at the ceiling because you can't get the gun between you and the window. Maybe that's real but it's also annoying. You wouldn't fire a gun at the ceiling but there's a disconnect from what your avatar does and what you think you're trying to do. It ruins the game. And don't get me started on the general delayed (because it's server side) opening of doors and interacting with objects...But even if you play a lot and start to get used to these quirks what's the game really? You drop into a big map and run around picking up stuff until you die. Most of the game is just running around not interacting with people. Not shooting just walking and looking at the ground. If you're lucky or good you get to shoot and kill people. If you're average or bad then you get killed often without even seeing who shot you. And the game doesn't show you what happened you just die and see your body and it's like okay now it's time to play again.The gameplay loop of running around for 30 minutes looking at the ground picking up stuff for a minute of firefight at the end doesn't pay off. And then there's the circle. The circle that keeps people moving I feel is both a clever and poorly implemented feature. Half the time it's a massive penalty to you and half the time it's a non factor. In the end the game is a weird mess of trying not to die to radiation whilst being forced into bad positions and hoping to be the lucky last person to have to move. It's very much a lottery system and I have no respect for it.The only plus is I didn't spend $60 on the game. I don't recommend it.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-04-11,0,0,626,True,Recommended,This game is definitely going somewhere. Let's be real though it requires a fairly decent system if you want respectable frames. Community isn't the best but I just play with friends so it doesn't bother me much. Super addicting and really makes you test your wits. Kills are rewarding and I feel like overall the weapon balancing is about right EXCEPT with shotguns. So many times have I shot an unarmed enemy at point blank range (mind you either head or torso shots) to neither kill or knock them down. Shotguns got nerfed down in a previous update hopefully they can be fixed. With over 200 hours I'm still looking for some more chicken dinners. I've followed the guide I've linked below and my frames haven't gotten much better but they are a lot more consistent.

2017-07-24,0,0,275,True,Recommended,This game is pretty much all I want to play these days (and I just picked up the excellent Torment Tides of Numenera so that's saying a lot.). But there's nothing more terrifying and compelling than dealing with other people. I play PUBG mostly as a stealth game and it allows me to picture myself as the hero of my own narrative. I think that's kind of what everyone else is doing too(picturing themself as hero not necessarily playing like I do) so each 30 minute run is an intense joy and between the tough shooting mechanics rickety vehicles and ratcheting tension from the wall of death the game creates a lof of cool space for emergent storytelling.Best moment so far scavenging on the edge of the zone with a car parked near some buildings. I hear someone arrive and run for my car. They've gotten in too close already and are firing with a submachine gun. I'm barely armed and have no good cover so I jump into the car and floor it in their general direction. I have probably 10 meters or less to accelerate so when the car hits it's not an instant kill and they continue firing as they are pushed along by the vehicle. A harrowing second or so later they expire against a wall and I get out of the car to scavenge bandages and weapons from their pack bandage myself up and prepare for the next encounter. Just a great game with so many meaningful choices and so many different ways to approach. I don't need a good KD ratio or a consistent strategy to enjoy the hell out of it.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

When it crashes your character also keeps on walking while you're outside of the game and up until recently your team tag dissapeared so my teammates just shot me..... I've had a total of 3 hours of fun gameplay around the crashes and glitches... The ping is hilarious as well. Please stay away unless you get it for free or something. It's not worth the headache. You'll rarely sit down put on your headset and teamspek becasue one or more people will always be crashing. No wonder that every game you enter there are AFKs and as soon the game forcefully drops them one person who's not afk gets 5 kills on them that grants him more points for the first 2 minutes of the game than if you survived 20 minutes without getting a single kill and then suddenly getting headshot by a cheater.

2017-07-12,0,0,1136,True,Recommended,I have nothing else to do so here is a pros and cons list Can be annoying with the RNG for example when you don't find any guns in the beginning of the match A few glitches here and there but nothing that will ruin your experience + Early access(this isn't really a con because its so well done that you don't really notice it) + Runs fairly well especially for being early access. + Many different guns+ The guns are actually different and not just the same guns with different models and textures + Extremely intense gameplay+ Satisfying shooting(and killing)+ High skill ceiling+ Cooperative(if you choose)+ BP currency reward which you can use to buy packs with clothes(no bonus stats)Thats everything i can think of so yea i hope this was helpful.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-09,0,0,240,True,Recommended,I do like PUBG it's really good and fun. Takes practice to get better but this ios a great Battle Royale.My only concern is with the damage to players and the aiming placement.I've shot players 4 times with a Shotgun saw the blood and everything but they never went down.I've been at full HP with a Lv.2 Helmet and body armor and got one shot by a close range player with an UMP.Aimed directly at a guy and shot at him only for it to hit the tree by me or the car by me even tho the crosshair was aimed at him and not showing that small red one anywhere.But all in all game is great and worth the $30Gameplay 7Graphics 8Replay 10Addiction 10Servers 5 (Lots of connection and lag issues and not on my part)Controls 8Keep up the good work and I look forward to working with y'all on this Early Access.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2018-01-09,0,0,101,False,Not Recommended,Okay so this game is extremely fantastic and gets your heart pumping. HOWEVER once you get to high ranks the number of hackers is so terrible. There is a hacker in everygame and now you can even see it in the deathcam. I have had multiple times where someone would be scoped in on the ground and then snap to my head then killing me ruining my duos and solos. Not to mention I have qued into duos and squad and have gotten 2 people that spoke english in my whole time playing PUBG. Sometimes you will have lag and hit reg problems but those problems seem to be dwarfed by the hackers/cheaters. I want to love this game and I do love it but I can't recommend this game until they fix the major problem which imo is the cheaters. Only then can they start to fix the hit reg and lag issues that are present.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2018-01-09,0,0,433,False,Recommended,So far I've been playing a lot of PUBG with my friends with the U.S while I'm in Brazil and while I understand that regionlocking would prevent cheaters (apparently most of them are from the Asia server) from infesting every server I appreciate being able to play in a different server with my friends with very little delay. In this regard I feel like Bluehole has done an amazing job.As far as meeting cheaters go I haven't met one yet or maybe I don't have high enough rating to meet cheaters so in my 113 hours so far I believe I have met 0 cheaters.I think the game has a fair pricing in regards of the amount of content you get. The replayability is insane given that each match is completely different from the other. For the price that it is marketed at I think its a steal.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-01-09,0,0,2251,False,Recommended,Well well well you've decided that its time to see what all the fuss is about. Let me be the first one to tell you that this is the best game on steam right now. There's no better and more fulfilling feeling like some Popeyes at the end of a match here. It's the most fun I've had with new gen games in a very long time. Full of content and variety in the gameplay the only thing that drags this game down is the hacks and the occasionally poor netcode. Believe me you will experience aimbots. Then you'll experience hackers. But you won't care. Simply because the game is that good. Do not fret fellow frustrated gamers Bluehole will fix the hacks... eventually. When they do I will fall in love with this game all over again. Don't expect to be #1 no matter how good you are bc/ the hackers will claim that in a heartbeat. That's why China is #1. PPL have been suggesting a gridlock for the chinese or regions in general but honestly this game just needs a better anticheat. Desperately. That is the only way the issue can be reasonably fixed. It's a 10/10 game that is being ruined by the overabundance of hackers in the top 5 percentile primarilly in third person but first is no exception. So just do the community a favor Keep Playing. kill the aimbotters and show them de wei. If they do not know de wei then you must spit on their gameplay. It will help you get better for when the game gets competitive and they fix the issue. Sometimes it will feel like you cannot do anything about it let me list a few examples S12k shotgun aimbot killed me 500+ meters away a week ago.2 kar98 aimbotting wallhackers killed me and everyone else in pecado 2 days ago.2 vecter wielding aimbot wallhackers killed me in Mil base through 7 walls a kilometer away that same day.I just died 2nd F*CKIN place to an aimbotter before i wrote this (4 kill duo)On my own count I have been successfully DDOS'd 3 times by hackers (they shut off my internet mid game) &lt i have like 3 firewalls btwI've seen a hacker parachute down with a care package 5 minutes after the game had started in one of those DDOS events.Every time you watch a killcam its really stupid obvious when someone is using an aimbot bc no one in their right mind can autofire headshots back 2 back past 50 meters its just not plausible no matter how good you are.Look the players who do this hacker crap don't have any respect for their own skills especially when they don't even try to hide the hacks. Most actually don't. They're really cocky bc/ they think that they're out here better than everyone else. Go Captain Price on their asses and show them why you're a better player. If you catch me on the BG's and you get me congrats. I'm pretty damn good. If you're a hacker then maybe you should find something better to do because we will find you and your will get banned/ reported tf out of and no matter how many times you buy the game I will show you de wei bc an aimbot is not enough to kill me ur gonna need wallhacks or a buffed gun. You're gonna need skill and if you have some then just play the game normally. It's a lot more fulfilling that way.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-05-07,0,0,130,True,Recommended,I had an AMD FX 6300 + GTX 970 and I could barely run this game 50 ish FPS and the poorest quality. I couldn't tell the difference between a pixel and a player. Constant FPS drops to around 30 40 FPS. This was after the performance patch. I hear Intel users where doing much much better on a similar platform so I ugpraded.Now on a GTX 1080 + i7 7700k processor I'm doing 60+ FPS no problems.Pros This gameplay is crack. Some people fight and constantly keep moving. Unreal engine 4Cons Some people think this is an ARPG. They gear up to max ammo + armor + weapons and THEN fight. Most people KoS or shoot on sight. You are supposed to hold your fire comunicate the enemys position then take the KILL SHOT. Shooting to make noise and miss is a good way to get your hole squad killed. Looting. Most people are when it comes to this. They risk their lives and their hole squad just for loot. Doesn't even matter that they are geared. They want LOOT. They also keep looting while an enemy is engaging your team and / or killing your team mates. So yeah. I mean.... at the start of the game you get a gun and go kill someone but after that... loot.

It is still early access but at least there is a gameplan to get out of early access unlike many others. Playing this game solo keeps me on edge in a good way. It is some of the most tense gameplay I have experienced. If I see a person running at 200 meters I need to decide whether to take a shot and give up my location. Playing this with friends is an even better experience. I find it frees me up to enjoy a high risk/high reward gameplay style. Either way there are many strategies to use. Just make sure you do not spend too much time making these decisions as the game does not reward an indecisive player. All in all it is definitely worth $30.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

It perfectly balances the feel of its gameplay between stretches of quiet downtime and moments of incredibly high adrenaline and intensity. Every match tells a story and every win feels like a huge accomplishment. The gunplay feels fantastic with heavy recoil shot leading and bullet drop so nailing a sniper headshot is extremely satisfying. The game looks pretty nice but hopefully graphics and optimization may improve over time right now framerates aren't great. The sound engine is fantastically immersive with sounds changing in their sharpness and tonality depending on direction and distance allowing you to pinpoint where shots or cars are coming from. There are even 3D sound effects for bullets whizzing past your character a really nice touch for an early alpha game. The whole package looks really promising right now and I hope the developers continue to make it even better. Right now it scores 86/100.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-04-03,0,0,408,False,Not Recommended,"The idea of the game is good there's definitetly playability and fun things about the game. However this game was RELEASED as a paid game to the public in a very ALPHA state. The shooting mechanics are broken and if you're coming from ANY real shooter you'll be frustrated that bullet registering is non existent. The net code is very bad and you'll frequently die from lagging thru the terrain or unable to pick up anything from the ground. You'll warp and rubber band around. If you do manage to survive odds are you'll be killed by someone with a string of random numbers for a name that aimed at you across 10km and instantly headshot you. They don't do anything to prevent hackers like any real competitive game. Overall its fun at first but then you'll grow to quickly resent the game when you spend 15 minutes just picking up items just to die and do it again because of game engine problems. What's worse is that the developers have made it clear they arent focused on fixing any issues. They will not introduce region locking and the North American server is just all Chinese players which completely defeats the purpose of having a team game (can't communicate with any players). Also lag favors the person lagging since hit registration etc is client side so the same overseas people intentionally choosing a bad server for them will kill you before you can even see them on your screen. Besides this the developers have already been forcing paid loot boxes down our throats before fixing ANY issues. With the latest batch of updates (""optimizations"") the render distance of terrain has become pathetic. Render distance of grass has become a joke. You can no longer lay down in a field because you are seen from anything beyond 150m (easily red dot range...). Cheaters have went down a fair amount but I am still running into them on a regular basis. I can deal with cheaters for the most part.

There's 2 regions dedicated to them why do i have to consistenly play with people who dont speak a common language in the eu region in a team based game?Almost immediately i just do solo because it's annoying listening to someone spam "" your mother"" over and over on voice in some or other asian accent.Basically if you dont have friends to play with don't bother auto matchmaking. I can't reccomend this game to anyone other than non english speaking asians since every region is over populated with them making a team based game rather redundant for english speakers...I'm not a fan of region locking and never have been but this game is something special i can't even...

2017-08-10,0,0,213,True,Recommended,I'm going to give this a positive review now because of the contraversy. Game is fun for the parts of it that represent a game. Microtransactions are not a part of the game they're a separate thing altogether to make your game pretty.There are lots of great games with these things like CS Dota and OW and even KF2. If I don't want them I don't buy them it really doesn't phase me regardless of what promises were made and when. You see business's need money to get bigger and better. So if a business has reached a target and have grown then they'll set another target to grow so they can reach their bigger goals. There's chance that PUBG has reached a point where it could start either getting steady or start declining. Do I know? No. I'm just thinking outside the box. But what if devs have come to understand that maybe not now but in the future to come they need to back themselves as much as possible for when it does inevitably happen? What if they want to start making more games and become a more serious company?But what this could mean is that they need to find a way to make more money so they can support this game in a bigger and better way. Me personally? I support that 'type' of thinking where their intention is legitimatly to improve and not just for their own selves but for their devoted fans. I don't agree with it if they don't put the money to improving the experience.If someone bought a piece of clothing and made the company an extra $5 which allowed them to reach a goal to improve their game in a certain way that helps most everyone who still plays the game then good on them for helping the company grow and good on the company for giving the player that 'choice' to make in supporting them for further growth.We're all human we all have bills to pay and families to feed we all have goals. If you don't support someone elses goal that's fine that's also what makes us human but this is my own personal opinion on the matter and I hope I can change the way 'some' people think about it. Even if it doesn't change their mind entirely it's a good thing to put into perspective before casting the final judgment.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I would reconmend this game to people who love intense gun fights close quaters or far. You arent safe anywhere on this hole of an island )What i would change is the physics and realism mostly the physics as some cars can spaz out harder than a COD player.Secondly this game could improve with future maps free to the community and none of this mainstream DLC Keep your game cooler than ice and give your growing fan base the respect of a true game developer should!Although there is word of a desert map coming i think we all want to see a Jungle map with all veiw distance and an Urban map for the campers to live in p Good game overall and would love to see more maps and content!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-10,0,0,353,True,Recommended,The game as a whole is a great experience. There is a small learning curve and not as user friendly to new players as it could be. If you don't let yourself get discouraged from not finding good loot your first time around and actually get a couple of games in I guarantee you'll find something you really love about this game. The weekly and monthly updates are a good sign that this game won't be abandoned by devs like other early access titles. My only complaint is around the graphics issues you'll face ie buildings spawning slowly and frame drops on landing unless you have a high end build but this is becoming less of an issue with fixes and tweaks in recent updates.On a side note many people are giving bad reviews because of the new payable crates that were added even though the devs said they were going to avoid this sorta thing. I understand people are upset about the paid crates but they are for a good cause as the pay for the new tournament and goes partially to charity.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-10,0,0,3,True,Not Recommended,This is like a dumbed down survival game. Now what do I mean by that is it's pretty much a survival game but your only objective is to kill or hide no temperature no hunger no resource management(except for your weapons and healing of course) only killing and being the last one alive. Pros It is pretty realistic in the killing aspect when you don't have armor on you can be killed with a couple of shots or you can get ran over by someone in a vehicle get bombarded by the incoming missiles inside the danger zone or you could be punched to death.There is a huge player base so you'll never be waiting for an eternity for someone to play with(for now anyway)Cons This game is boring quite more so if you don't have a group or someone to play with. You spend most of your time running around gathering weapons then you can choose to either run guns blazing or stealth through it. For me that is pretty dull gameplay wise I don't want to be camping waiting for people and if I go running guns blazing there's a huge chance I'm dead and that's it game over. This game is not for everyone especially with casuals is what I'm getting at if you want to enjoy this be competitive and that's not the game I'm looking for but if you are competitive by all means get this game. With that being said I refunded this game I no longer want to play it even if I do get people to play with it's just too bland for my taste. I'm not sure if they'll be adding anything new to this game as it is Early Access but I've never been so bored with a game that I bought.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-08-10,0,0,39,True,Recommended,"I have played it for a bit now and I can tell you why I didn't play more. I broke my headset while dying 2nd at the last standoff. This happens when you are a toxic player and sooooo I have to wait to buy a new one.Other than that.The game is this currently very popular King of the Hill type of game as ""H1Z1 King of the Kill"" ""Arma 3 Battle Royal"" and ""The Culling"". It is still released in Early Access which I didn't like about the other games aswell because there might be a lot of bugs occuring but this game does it WAY BETTER than all the others I mentioned. The service team is top and they have no real downtimes only maybe some connection probs (but not as much as in the others above). PUBG runs smoothly and is a very tactical shooter. The game is very well designed and balanced. There are very rarely times when you feel that a weapon is not as well designed as others. The newly introduced FIRST PERSON MODE really got me into playing even without headphones. I like it very much and I think this is one of the first one where the First person mode looks as good and feels as good as in PUBG. Overall if you like Battle Royal Shooter in Third Person or in First Person this is the game to go. A lot of players. Evergrowing community and overall very positive feedback.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Now most of the good things has been said by everyone so I'm not gonna bother saying the pros anymore. Instead I would like to share some of the things I would like to see the dev add/do to this game Add a first person only gamemode (Not saying third person is bad I just think adding this mode would add some variety to the game) Freeroam mode that lets you get familar with the map (Or just enjoy the scenery) The ability to create private server for everyone Optimize the performance More stable server (To put it kindly Asia servers aren't just the most stable thing in the world) I know this is getting old but a zombie mode would be fun (Edit With auto matchmaking system)And most importantly get rid of those microtransaction bs. Seriously look at the recent review ratio dev the community aren't pleased with your scheme and for good reason. Just remove these pointless bs for the sake of your own reputation (Though we all know at this point this would never happen).Btw don't give me excuses that this is just a small dev team that need more funding to improve the game or all the profit made from microtransaction will go to charity or something something. This game sells like freaking hotcake and the team is basically showering with freaking money at this point.But overall even with these annoying microtransactions the gameplay still doesn't suffer from it and from my point of view if a game got good gameplay that's all it needs to be recommanded and played.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Not just in PUBG.Other people may think that it is not worth it to spend $20 $30 have to deal with cheats and bugs.But in my opinion I recommend buying it because it's really fun!Do not get too attached to the words of other people if you haven't tried it yourselfIt is worth it for me to pay this amount of money and have fun and laugh with my friends and formed a friendship with some random stranger that I met in the game XDThe game is still under development and on early access sure there is bugs etc.Overall the game is easy to understand easy to play and very simple rules.You Loot You Run and You Fight.Check your PC spec before buying. Or do a research and find out about SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS that are requiredto run PUBG smoothly and enjoy your time in PUBG!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-15,0,0,189,False,Recommended,After roughly 95 hours worth of playing PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS my thoughts and views on this game are solid.First off if you are a child adult or parent wanting buy this game make sure that you are not buying this game on any laptop unless it is built for gaming. PC is advised as this game is large and will require a good graphics card to run all settings well. My current GPU which is being used to run this game is a GeForce GTX 750 Ti although I can only run the game at 45FPS on very low settings. This game requires a lot when it comes to being able to run it. GAMEPLAY Currently there are solo duo and squads. You choose one of these modes whether you want to play with a friend or by yourself or not and then you select what camera perspective you will be in. The two options are FPP (first person) or TPP (third person). For a beginner buying this game start of TPP. After selecting out of those options you will load into a starting island on one of the two maps. The only available maps to play currently are the original green forest type map and desert rugged map. Your lobby will fill up to 100 players or near that and then you will spawn into an aircraft which will fly over the map from random angles each new game you play. There will be hotspots where there is good loot and most people will parachute out of the plane. After doing so you will parachute to your selected destination on the map this is where you need to start scavenging fast for loot. Guns medicine attatchments and gear will be spread out across the map for you to scavenge for and find. During this stage there will be a circle that appears and you need to get into it before the time limit otherwise you will take damage from the blue. The circle will appear again and smaller this time. Around this stage you will encounter other enemies and be forced to attack or run. After surviving these stages the number of people alive will drop and you will be ina very small circle eventually.... This is grind time and you need to survive to win. Sound is key in this game so make sure you have headphones or speakers to listen to gun shots and footsteps. After roughly 20 40 minutes the game will be done if you have survived this far. And you will recieve BP a currency used in game.This game is not like Fortnite please to do not think that it is this game you can drive vehicles and marine craft also you can damage other teammates compared to Fortnite. This game is very realistic and I recommend if you are going to play with friends from time to time or all the time as it makes the game more enjoyable. Survival is key. Its every man for himself sometimes so always remember that. OVERALL This game is enjoyable and far more realistic which adds challenges to how you play and where you go. Make sure you have a strong powerful computer if you would like to run this game smoothly otherwise its a total waste of money. Enjoy!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2018-01-12,0,0,199,False,Recommended,Amazing game. Great graphics fun mechanics satisfying kills adrenaline pumping ends of matches great gunplay and fun vehicles.

2017-09-19,0,0,353,True,Not Recommended,So if you think this is a skill based game... Well it just isn't because of this reasons 1st You drop from a plane wich randomly spawns on any part of the map making so each match is a totally different thing with random facts like airdrops and loot.2nd Loot is totally random what i mean is that even if you drop on a high loot zone theres a high chance of enering a house and getting nothing (pistols or even a melee weapon)3rd My third point is positioning what i mean with this is that you could've killed 20 guys but at the end if you dont have a good positioning (hill building trees etc) you will end up losing. Ex On my last match i got 12 kills most of them with the AWM but at the end we were 4 and i ended on an open field with no trees or anything to cover with and a guy who i didn't see came behind me and insta killed me with a mini14 so wheres's the skill on that kill huh.(real case),PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Obviously the game is good so rather than posting what's good about it I'm going to post a few things that may make you regret buying it 1) Gold is determined strictly on how many kills you get NOT how long you survive. You can be the 2nd person alive out of the 100 but if you only have 1 kill because you played stealthily all game you get next to no gold.2) The main menu is all kinds of buggy graphically. Do NOT leave the game open the kind of issue the game is having will caused burned images on your screen.3) There is not a wide variety of weapons but it's a good medium.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-05,0,0,220,True,Not Recommended,"Game crashes every 2 seconds cars flip on nothing half the time you're getting shot at you have no idea where the shots are coming from. When you drop at a very populated area you have to pray to god almighty you get a gun before your opponents. In a scenario where two players are both holding the same shotgun aiming at each other in the chest from about 10 meters it's literally just rng who dies because since the shotguns are buckshot the pellet spread is random. In the very late game everything comes down to the randomness of where the circle closes in because if it circles in on your opponent they can chill behind a rock pressing e and q to see past it while yo uhave to run it through what is usually little to no cover. The game is so rng that on the leaderboards even the BEST players have a winrate of at most 25%. People so good at aiming and strategical play that they can have the highest win rating and end games with 20+ kills e.g grimmmz will still lose 3/4 games because the computer said so. This game is so actually unfun with the way you die half the time its from your car flipping on terrain that i assume was made in unity with blocks and semicircles and and the other half its from the circle being a tumor and you getting 1 shot from the dude with the awm who got the easiest shot on you while you had to run from tree to tree to get cover. I can only imagine people ""like"" this game because of the hype train and I only play it cause its the only game that me and a couple of my friends all have.

They expect you to spend all your BP on a box that was spent probably 3 hours on and all I get are a pair of sunglasses. The lag issues are terrible currently. I just got out of a game and while I was driving a Dacia around the buildies decided to disappear with only the stairs and window frames visible so I actually saw 2 people camping in the building. Sometimes point blank shots with a shotgun do not hit but in a replay I have they clearly did so the bullets don't register. This game is very much in the Alpha stages apparently and I would not recommend putting money into this game until it is finally stable. If I hadn't already put the time in that would make the customer service reject my ticket I would put in for a refund.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-08-10,0,0,207,True,Recommended,I highly recommend this game for players who are in the market for boatloads of heartache followed by moments of brief joy.Overall a fairly solid game and of course there are bugs. Some of you will whine and cry about it. Some might even quit playing but the bugs are not bad enough to ruin all your matches. Then after you win a match you will keep playing cause this game sucks you in like that but it is worth buying and playing. Just dont quit before you win atleast one match. thats when you wont be able to stop trying to win again.Also try not to be sucked into the bad reviews because of people who are upset about paid DLC. honeslty i would rather play a game that gives me the option to buy stuff (which as of right now is clothing) then play a game like battlefield that forces me to drop an additional $60 bucks just to be able to stay in the game long enough to enjoy it. I know they lied and said they wouldnt but you all know it could be worse and they could make you pay out the for in game advantages. When that happens i will gladly switch this to a thumbs down and jump on that wagon with you.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I for one don't mind giving a few bucks here and there to a company that listens to the gamers. I absolutely love the game and where it's going and quite possibly where it will be in the future.

2018-04-02,0,0,472,False,Not Recommended,After playing this game for a number of hours I can say it's a pretty fun game overall. Though it I can't recommend it until they fix the amount of cheaters each server is filled with. Between a few aim bots head shoting across the map with a UMP / Character highlighting on their mini maps / speed hacks / or getting head punched still leaving the plane. It's been shy under a month and about 80 90% of the games I get in are just hackers one after another. I keep believing that the devs will fix it but it just seems to get worse and worse each day.Pretty much the game is broken as hell and I can play about three match until I become completely and quit.Region lock the cheaters out fix your program to detect them or pay another company to help you fix it.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

This 1.0 update has shown the devs are hard at work on improving tthe game and making it more diverse and fun with a new map weapons etc. Overall the game feels much more smoother barely any lag barely rubber banding stable servers etc overall the major problems that made this game unplayable have since then been improved and fixed for the most part. I would now recommend this game to anyone looking battlegrounds type game. As the update I will rate the game a 8/10 the game is smoother to play but still has some problems hopefully to be improved and fixed in a timely matter.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I can't kill a guy with his back facing me when i'm crouch tapping... 99% of the game is looting and running in straight lines I just don't get the hype honestly.I do not recommend this game to anybody tbh.ESPORTS READY LOL,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-19,0,0,120,True,Recommended,PUBG. I ignored this title for all these months because I thought the name sucked. Now I am sorry I waited so long. I have owned the game for three days and only played solo trying to git gud. System 4970 4.5ghz 2xgtx970s sli 16gigs ram. I let the game adjust the settings and began the play and noticed that it was great until I had an encounter with another player. IT would lag and stutter while I am trying to shoot it out with someone. I being a gamer for the last 20 years readjusted the settings down a bit and got the right combo to eliminate any lag or stutter problems. Now the game is smooth as silk but Im still dying hehe. No chicken dinners yet but I have finished top ten several times now and consistent in top 20.Yes you can tell by the graphics that this isnt an AAA title but hey you are not paying AAA title prices either. The game play is a sheit load of fun. With just a couple different maps you could play this game forever. So get rid of the HAX let the complainers move on to other games and the core base can git gud together.You can go in for a mission and get out at any time. You can take as long as you want between missions. There is only a minute or less wait once you que up. This plays into the casual gamer for sure. Anyway this is now the 414 161 review.When a AAA game maker can make a game like this with top shelf graphics it will have my money.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-01-02,0,0,79,False,Recommended,Where to start. PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS is a tremendous game with some game breaking bugs. If this game removes the loading screen freezes and getting kicked out of games without being able to reconnect it would score a 10/10. There is quite the learning curve when beginning if you've never played a battle royale game before. Once you get the hang of gun control and game physics it's loads of fun. It's also much more fun if you play with friends (if you have friends). 9/10.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-01-04,0,0,248,False,Not Recommended,I really enjoyed this game but After 3.0 the amount of hackers that have ruined games is crazy. Some of the situations that i found myself in the game made this game as addictive as it is. Once those situations are taken away because of clear hacking like killing our team and accidently turning 120 degrees to head shot another player because they held the button down too long kind of cheating the game is no longer fun or rewarding. Until steps are taken to reduced/remove hackers i can't recommend this game. no one wants to spend an 30 min in game looting and fighting to be killed to an aimbot across the map.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2018-01-04,0,0,219,False,Recommended,"Playerunknown's Battlegrounds or ""PUBG"" Steam's most played game ever a sensation.But is it worth the money?First of all you do not find any tutorial in game or a testing ground like in Arma or Battlefield where youcould test weapons etc. So the first hours of play will be trial and error with a more less steep learning curve.The most important thing will be time management When do you loot? Where do you loot (avoidance of dangerousand popular loot spots)? When do you move to the circle? The Gunplay is a bit harder than in most shooter games since you have to lead your shots for moving targets and zeroing your weapon for longer shots. Nice mixture of good gunplay and tactics.The game principle is easy. A plane with round about 80 100 players flies on a straight line over the map. At each time you are able to eject from the plane. After you land you will make your way to a gradually shrinking area which is marked with a circle on your map. If you fail to enter the area within the countdown you will get constantly damage over time. To reach the destination you can use different vehicles spawned on the map. After the introduction of the new vaulting system you are now able to climb on cars walls and especiall through windows. This brings new CQC tactics into the game love it. The car physics is imo not that good. It is very easy to flip and die especially with the motorcycle because you hit a little tiny rock. With 1.0 release the car physics and vehicle sound got a bit better (i really like the new van found on the new desert map). Although there are only 2 maps available right now the game is not very repititive due to the fact that the plane flies different routes and that the circle ends up at a different location every game too every match you play feels different. However you can not choose between the 2 maps at the current state. The randomly chosen map leads to emptier rooms than usual caused by people who want to play one specific map and therefore leaving the lobby. The developer already rows back and said that you will be able to choose which map you want to play in the near future.The available mode variety is very big. You can play first or third person alone duo or as a squad on both maps.Most problem of the third person mode is the fact of house camping. That is why I recommend to play in first person mode where both sides have neither advantages nor disadvantages. There is also a good item variety. You can find 5 different assault rifles 5 different sniper rifles 3 different MP's and shotguns. All weapons are well balanced feel great and can be customized with a bunch of different attachments (can also be found on the map) as well. Nevertheless you can also find some op loot which is randomly getting dropped by a plane and is heavily contested. Beside weapons healing stuff and attachments there is also clothing loot available. Sometimes it lies directly under a weapon and you accidentally grab some shoes instead of the weapon in a dangerous situation. Imo clothing loot should be deleted.On graphics point of view the new desert map offers more variation of buildings better ground textures and more level details but is not comparable to e.g. GTA V. Biggest criticism is the distance visability of the environment. For example you are laying on the ground in thick grass and the enemy who is sitting 200m away from you just sees plain leafless ground instead and can easily spot and kill you.The servers are less laggy since the full release but optimization is still the biggest issue of the game. With a GTX 1070 and an i7 7700 I still only have a stable 40 fps or less on 1080p with low settings. Especially at the beginning of the match desync rubber banding lags and bugs are the daily agenda. You are getting stuck with the parachute and getting damage by landing. Or it is lagging so hard that you can not loot equipment and therefore you lose the first battle if someone drops near your landing zone. Furthermore I experienced a considerable increase of crashes after 1.0 release.Although PUBG is a well balanced game with great potential and a lot of fun especially with friends optimization is big problem in the current build. If you cope with that you will get a challenging and fun game. All others should definitely wait until the game is more optimizied.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

One thing i really enjoy about the game is all the different types of guns and different loot they have you can also add mods to your guns. FYI you don't have to solo you can team up with 3 other people me being a noob at this game this helped alot. I actually like team play better because they can watch your back and call out locations of the enemy. Overall this game is worth the $29.99 and more i just hope they don't bring this to console.

2017-08-11,0,0,114,True,Recommended,"I will start off by saying that I do recommend this game. However this game is far from perfect and I dont know how well it will fair over time because of certain gameplay elements but feel I should highlight some of the cons as well as pros after roughly 38 hours played.Pros The game creates very heart pounding moments especially near the end of the match. It has a pretty good asortment of weapons (a new weapon is added every month). The weapon attachment system is cool with lots of options on what loadout to run with assuming you can find the loot to do it. It is best when you play with a friend or in squads with multiple people. The game can be very tactical and that makes it satisfying to outplay enemies that way.Cons Since this game is early access it has a ton of bugs and glitches. (These are to be expected and if you can't deal with that then don't buy early access games). The game isn't very well optimized right now. I run at all very low settings except textures at high and get 40 60 fps on a 1060 graphics card. The game also stutters a lot especially at the beginning of a match. The ping feels like it really high at times. The sounds can sometimes be a bit off. The bullet sounds are a big complaint of mine at the moment. Specifically the sounds the bullets make when they fly past you. Everytime you are shot you will hear 2 sounds. The bullet flying past you making a ""crack"" sounds and the shot of the gun. However the sound of the bullet flying past is so loud and sudden that you often can't hear the actual gun shot so it leaves you not knowing where you are being shot from. Many times I have been either running or sitting at cover and start getting shot and have no idea where its from because I cant hear the shots and end of dying to somebody I never saw. And that brings up my next point. You can play a whole match spend about 20 to 30 minutes in a game and see not a single player and then end up dying to somebody you never saw because they happened to be hiding in the right bush. The games RNG elements can make it very unsatisfying sometimes. I have had games where this thing has happened and it just leaves me feeling like I just wasted a half an hour. A lot of these issues however are only in solo play as squads is a bit more forgiving in terms of getting into fire fights as you get put into a knock out stage before actaully dying. As I said before try to play in duos or squads.This game overall is good. I would rate it a 7/10. Once all of the performance issues are worked out I would give it an 8. This is mainly due to the gameplay issues I have mentioned as well as the whole premise of the game does not lend itself to a very skill based system. Sure its good to be skillful with guns and aim and knowing certain tactics but a big part of the game is completly random. Loot drops vehical spawns and most of all the circle and where it ends up. All of these limit how far skill can take you. Theres game where you can sit in a house for 20 minutes because the circle keeps spawning around you and other games where you have to traverse the whole map. However with all of that said I still do recommend this game just be aware that it has problems and you should be aware of them going into this game.EDIT I would not worry about the mirco transactions that have been added. They are completly cosmetic and have no actual gameplay effects. There is no pay to win.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-08-11,0,0,1069,True,Recommended,All I see are a bunch of haters. I don't think they hate the game but just need to be hating on something. Overall this game is fun for me. I get my kicked and sometimes I do the kicking. The game isn't perfect but it's still a great game that puts new content into it on a monthly basis. Playerunknown and PUBG are very active on Twiter informing everyone of good and bad news. This is what gamers want to see from a developer. Listening and communicating. This is an early access game and I only see it getting better. Custom Servers with game moding. The potential is huge for PUBG.Ignore the haters because who really cares if people buy gear. Yes it's out in Early Access but people want it. The number of people buying the gear are doing this because they really enjoy the game. I know for me it's worth it. If you like survival 3rd and 1st person shooters guns shooting guys in the head with a KAR98 strategy running idiots over blah blah blah get this game. Watch streamers play to see for yourself. It's a good game that is worth the $30 and more.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

PubG says they have only 30 35 people in the department for bans and cheats but they are a billion dollar company now so there is no excxuse why they cant hire more.

V1.0 made major improvements to make the game just amazing. However in the last week or so hackers/cheaters have made the game impossible. It removes absolutely all fun. 7/10 games have been finished for me from a kill 300+ yards away no aiming/no scope 3 shots while driving kills.

2017-08-27,0,0,105,False,Recommended,I think that this is actually a really good game however has a massive amount of issues. There are a lot of really bad things about this game. One of the more peresonal issues is the extremly quick time to kill (1 to the head without a helmet for most guns). I do not like many quick times to kill and I think that in PUBG it feels really bad as your 30 minute quest for loot can be ended by a single guy you didnt even see. Also the randomness. Now this is not as big of an issue for me but it very annoying when so much of the game is based off of randomness. Where the plane flys determines where you can drop. Random. What guns you can get is detrimened by RNG. Random. How many players you find throught the match. Random. Basiclly everything about your game is random. The movement system in this game might also be the worst movement system I have seen in any game. Ever. It feels clunky and slow and you often jump at things and just miss and then need to run 10 feet back so you can clear it. The whole things feels awful. That being said however the game itself is a lot of fun. It feels rewarding to get a kill and obtaining guns can be fun. I really like this game and for only $30 i feel like I have to reccomend it. The game is a lot of fun however the one thing that you need to be aware of is that it takes a long time to get good at this game. It probably took me around the 30 hour mark to be able to consistantly get even a single kill per game. That being said when you do get good at the game you can stomp on the lower players and win a large amount of the time. This game is best played with a group of your friends however it is still fun solo.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

But I also believe that most people are a little butt hurt. The game is fun I really do enjoy the game. This game has something that I haven't felt in a long time with most games. I don't know if it is the thrill of survival and killing other people or that every match is a different story that you as a player partake in.I do know that the developers are doing all they can to make this game fun and fix all the bugs that are in the game. Some things take a longer time to fix than others and I personally know that with fixing bugs you are likely to break something else. But I do believe that the game is going to be better in the future.If you want to buy the game stay in touch with the reddit page. There you can find everything you want to know and if the game is playable in the current state. As for me I enjoy the game and I think you will too.

2017-12-06,0,0,258,True,Recommended,The idea to this game is incredinly simple. Kill everyone till you are the last alive. It really is a fun game if you are up for a challenge. I see many people buy the game cause there favorite youtuber plays it and they go into it shooting everything they see like they are playing Call of Duty. While you can find success just running and shooting the best game play comes from when you carefully plan an attack and it goes to plan. With that said when your plan goes south chaos quickly envolops everything and that is just as fun. The controls feel good and seem to get better with each update. It is still an early access game so do expect bugs. There are very frustrating times when you land and have to wait for the buildings to render in this is ecspecialy frusturating when you land near other people. With each update this problem seems to occur less and less for me personally. If you a looking for a good shooter that can go from everything being silent to everything around you erupting in a symphony of gun fire or having to make split second decisions that end in life or death than this game is for you.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The devs seem to be at the moment somewhat focused on polishing the game and making it run better for a full release but as an Early Release game it is doing very well.

I used to play hours on end with my friends and now we get a few games in and quickly remember why we stopped playing last time we tried.

2018-01-07,0,0,176,False,Recommended,For it's full release the game has improved quite a bit though it still has problems. The game is still horribly optimized and the minimum requirements listed on steam do not feel very accurate. With a gtx 1080 nvidia reccommends everything to be set on the lowest possible settings so I would ignore those suggestions if you are using the geforce experience so there is a disjoint in the settings with the driver as nvidia claims the game can be ran at ultimate settings on 1920x1080 on their website. So if you can handle the still constant crashing and a very vague 'optimal settings' from both the game and nvidia then you will be fine otherwise steer clear of this for a long while.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-12,0,0,190,True,Recommended,"PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds is loosely based on the mechanics of CounterStrike combined with the world size of an RPG. Each match pits one hundred players against... each other. Last man standing wins! Of course the chance of you winning is so ridiculously low that it's a major challenge which is part of the fun. This is a hard game. You will die repeatedly starting out and rarely in a ""fair fight"". Except for this one time when a guy tried to box me when I had a shotgun in the first minute. That was a fair fight for me. Players can camp hide lay traps and hide sneak up on you etc. Unlike Counterstrike players can heal with first aid kits. But like Counterstrike when you die there are no continues the match is over and you can't even spectate.Players can camp in one area through most of the game but there is a circle of death that shrinks around the play area forcing firefights until only one player is left. Body armor reduces damage guns can be upgraded with sights and stabilizers backpacks let you carry more supplies energy drinks heal slowly over time and cars can be used to rapidly traverse terrain. Or run players over.9/10. Despite being an early access game it's very polished although it crashes whenever I try to overclock my graphics card.There is some controversy over in app purchases and I agree that they should be removed if they tilt the game in favor of people that buy them.

There are many other things that need fixed in the game for it to be considered ready for full release and what is being done instead? Paid crates and keys I tell you. Not only is it bad that you have to pay for them but I rarely see anyone get anything good out of them. I watch streams that open crates and they repeatedly get the same garbage items out of the crates. Velcro shoes anyone?

For the amount of money this game made the developing company they could've had hudreds of people working on it but Bluehole instead like so many other games decided micro transactions where more important than a playable game.Basically this game in it's current state is not worth $30USD you'd be better off playing Fortnite. Which just for the record I haven't played and probably won't. What I'm saying is you buy this game right now and you will be let down by poor optimisation bugs memory leaks and endless waves of hackers and cheaters. In the unlikely event that in the future these things are all fixed then I 100% recommend this game.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-11,0,0,1289,True,Not Recommended,Ram packed with cheaters at the moment! There's no possible way anyone can recommend spending so much money on this game in its current state even in early access. I play on a GTX 1080 on a decent system and only sometimes sit at a stable 60 fps with all my settings on LOW. But with other players and cars close i drop between 30 40. Whenever we seem to get into a gunfight i drop to sometimes 11fps or lower.So many bugs in this game need fixing and alot of improvements are being released slowly over time I will update this review as updates roll out but until server performance is improved and game stability is improved I do NOT reccomend this game.When you load into a game and finally find a decent team who communicate well and play well you spend half an hour struggling in in game voice chat trying to explain their steam profile links there isn't a way to report anyone theres no on site messaging system or anyway for you to simply click a button and be on their steam profile!All bugs and crashes aside and this game has a very big following with very many active players per week. I feel that once this game is fully optimized it'll truly be an awesome game but until then its a real waste of money.EDIT The game is finally some sorts of stable. You still get the occasional crash but nothing major.Only dissapointing thing is the fact the developer stated he wasn't going to add micro transactions till full release but has now brought in a crate and key type system.

2018-01-09,0,0,169,False,Not Recommended,You'll probably enjoy it for the first week or so especially if you're playing with friends. After that the glaring problems really start to wear down the fun. The game has potential but I can't recommend this game until a few core issues are fixed. Cheating Horrrible. Unacceptable. Rampant. I'll admit region locking (see below) would help out but that's just a bandaid. I know they are trying but they need to do more. Region lock For the love of God please region lock the servers. No it isn't xenophobic to not want people on the other side of the planet playing on your data center. The netcode in this game is already terrible and people with a horrible ping make the problem so much worse. Sometimes you can't tell if your death cam is a result of cheating or because the enemy is physically 7000 miles away using a 28.8 modem. Engine It's pretty bad. I've never played such a clunky iteration of the Unreal engine before. Performance is sketchy even on decent rigs. Movement feels really wonky sometimes especially when you're landing your parachute or driving a vehicle. Riding your motorcycle over rock at the wrong angle can quickly turn your bike into space vehicle. Trying to shoot through things like windows with bars or railings is frustrating. I love unloading my magazine into a player only to realize every bullet was stopped by an invisible force field surrounding the railing on a stairwell. Loot boxes This is really minor but still kinda boggles my mind. Why bother putting reward crates in your game if 99% of them contain duplicates of the same ragged beige pants or grey shirt? I'd prefer the crate system just be removed entirely. Removing the incentive to farm that super rare miniskirt that sells on Steam for like $400 might just clean out a few of the farming cheaters.Overall thoughts is that the game is a solid idea with poor execution. I look forward to when someone else comes along and executes the genre with a level of Blizzard polish. Fortnite is already pretty close even though I'm not a huge fan of the game's art style.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I have less than 10 hours into it and have already made it to the top 10 in a couple of matches.

Someone on reddit pointed out ""The only fight that matters is the last one."" While it is fun to dive into the middle of a city and gun it out with a couple other people the real key to winning seems to be taking a more laid back approach stalking your targets and only fighting when you absolutely have to.The voice comms during pre game are pretty annoying but those seem to end once the game starts. I'm not sure if that is by design but I think it is. Voice comm does not seem to be server wide.

2017-10-08,0,0,271,False,Not Recommended,This game clearly demonstrates the value of public opinion. If you think the Marvel Universe is the greatest thing to hit movie making since Charly Chaplin &amp Robert Downey Jr. is the finest actor who ever lived then PUBG is definitely the game for you. I mean twenty million people can't be wrong correct ? You go get 'em tiger and say Hi to WCgr333771icg for me you will know him when he caps you from three quarter's of a mile. Have fun &amp we'll see you in RUST after you have played a few hundred hours and realise running across a map for loot and then dying just isn't fun.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-21,0,0,310,False,Recommended,"Finally my first steam review ever! After 200+ hours on the main build and 30 or so more on the test server I can say that I'm incredibly proud of Bluehole for using early access the way that it was meant to be used. The only time I think the negative early access reviews were accurate were when paid keys were introduced after they promised none of that until 1.0 and when Tencent stepped in and put in advertisements over the chinese players screens. All the other negative feedback prior to the 1.0 launch is completely bogus if you ask me. This game got better and better every early access patch that came out because it was being co developed by the community and now here at 1.0 we have reached a very well polished and well optimized build of the game Bluehole didn't do what so many developers do nowadays by launching early access making a lot of money and cashing out. They had their minds set and they made it reality and wow did they do a good job.As for the game itself There's a very fine line that realistic shooters need to dance on in terms realism and determining what realistic elements need to go in order to make the game enjoyable and this game does this perfectly. For example the bullets coming out of the barrel forcing you to take a step back from a window if you're too close LOVE IT! but also sacrifices realistic elements like backpack space and unlimited sprint I wouldn't want to play a game where I could literally only hold what would realistically fit in my backpack and thank god all players are triathalon athletes because when I can't find a vehicle I set my auto run and head for the hills the maps are huge after all. The gunfights feel so good and so fair you will feel yourself getting better the more you play this game your combat techniques will improve your looting techniques will improve and you'll learn intriquite little things that all add up to make you a better player rewarding you for the hundreds of hours you have put into the game while still giving you that high adrenaline octane feeling when you've made it to the endgame and you're battleing players the blue zone and strategy all in a short amount of time. There are little things that I get annoyed with at this game like waiting for a game to start all to land and get my head blown off by a shotgun meanwhile I'm fully kitted with some fingerless gloves but for the first time in a long time I've been excited to come home to this game and have designated full days to play this with my friends and have lost countless hours because that ""one more game"" went all the way to the wire or just because it turns into multiple games.Overall get this game. $30 is well worth this masterpiece and you'll have fun playing it no doubt and the best part is that this is only the beginning! Your $30 investment will grow as more content gets added to the game and gets even furthur optimized. Again thank you Bluehole/PUBGcorp/Greene for not letting the community down with a quickly thrown together early access title. Expect hundreds and hundreds moure hours out of me both on PC and Xbox. See you on the Battleground.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-21,0,0,43,False,Recommended,I love this game but its the first game I've played in years that doesn't have proper 3 screen support. I thought they'd fix it before the release but its still wonky. In the menu you only see the character's crotch and the messed up view in game is a hindrance. This is a great game but if you have 3 screens you have to play it in fullscreen windowed mode on one screen until they fix those issues.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
